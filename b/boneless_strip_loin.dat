40|$|Numerous {{outbreaks}} of foodborne illness {{have been attributed}} to non-intact beef (e. g., tenderized, marinated, and enhanced) products contaminated with Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7. Organic acids are commonly utilized in the beef industry as antimicrobial interventions, which must be validated to eliminate or reduce E. coli O 157 :H 7 to an undetectable level. Rifampicin-resistant Biotype I E. coli O 157 :H 7 surrogate microorganisms (ATCC BAA- 1427, BAA- 1428, and BAA- 1430) were applied as a cocktail (7. 8 log 10 CFU/ml) to three beef products (<b>boneless</b> <b>strip</b> <b>loins,</b> top sirloin butts, and bottom sirloin flaps) prior to treatment with an antimicrobial intervention (2. 5 % Beefxide or 2. 9 % lactic acid). Products were then subjected to a single or multiple pass tenderization and/or marination process. Beefxide and lactic acid treatments resulted in statistically significant log reductions of the microorganisms (P < 0. 05) on the surfaces for all three products. Surrogate microorganisms were recovered from interior samples of all three products after mechanical tenderization. Additionally, surrogate concentrations recovered from flap surface and internal samples taken post-tumbling and marination were statistically similar (P < 0. 05). These data indicate that tenderization and marination processes can transfer microorganisms into the interior of whole-muscle cuts, and suggest Beefxide and lactic acid may be similar in their efficacy as an antimicrobial applied as an intervention in the production of non-intact beef products...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{aging is}} an old-time process {{used to produce}} a high quality beef product marketed to {{high-end}} customers. Its most unique quality is the distinctive dry-aged flavor. Dry aging has been accomplished through many protocols over the years, but an optimum protocol has not been adopted. Practitioners of this art {{are very interested in}} providing a consistent, quality, safe product. Traditionally, dry aging is done without packaging, which places more emphasis on plant quality control practices to achieve a consistent product. This limits the number of processors that have the ability to produce dry-aged product. Packaging bags with a very high water vapor transmission rate that may simulate traditional dry aging are now available. If the quality from dry aging in these bags is equal to that obtained with the traditional unpackaged method, other processors might consider dry aging because this bag allows for less stringent facility needs and potentially greater yields. Overall, an in-thebag dry-aging system would require fewer controls and still result in decreased weight losses, which would provide a significant yield advantage. Objectives of this research were to determine the combined effects of two different dryaging methods (unpackaged and in the bag), two loin-cut styles (bone-in shell <b>loins</b> and <b>boneless</b> <b>strip</b> <b>loins),</b> and two aging times (21 and 28 days) on flavor, juiciness, tenderness, palatability, development of the unique dry-aged flavor, moisture vapor loss, and microbial growth. An additional objective was to determine effects of vacuum packaging after dry aging on dry-aged flavor stability of steaks...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{methods for}} controlling Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella non-pathogenic bacterial surrogates during {{the production of}} marinated non-intact beef products. Hot (~ 30 degrees C) <b>boneless,</b> beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> (n = 54, Institutional Meat Purchase Specification 180) were inoculated with one of two levels (approximately 5. 8 and 1. 9 log 10 CFU/cm 2, hereafter referred to as high- and low-inoculated, respectively) of non-pathogenic, rifampicin-resistant E. coli organisms used to simulate harvest floor contamination. The inoculated beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were chilled at 2 degrees C for 24 h, and then vacuum packaged and aged for 7 to 24 days at 2 degrees C. The beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were subjected to one of five treatments or control (no treatment). Spray treatments were: 2. 5 % L-lactic acid, 5. 0 % L-lactic acid, 1, 050 ppm acidified sodium chlorite, 205 ppm peroxyacetic acid, and tap water. Lactic acid treatments were applied at ~ 53 degrees C, whereas the other sprays were applied at room temperature (~ 25 degrees C). Treated and control pieces were tumble marinated using a commercial marinade. Sample counts were collected throughout the experiment to track reductions in inoculated microorganisms as impacted by antimicrobial treatment and processing. For the high-inoculated <b>strip</b> <b>loins,</b> the 5. 0 % L-lactic acid treatment was most effective (P < 0. 05) across treatments and control at reducing surrogate organisms on meat surfaces before marination, producing a 2. 6 log 10 CFU/cm 2 reduction. The water treatment accounted for the least (P < 0. 05) reductions across treatments and control of surrogate organisms on the meat surface before marination. Peroxyacetic acid produced the greatest reduction of surface surrogate organisms in the finished, marinated product. The water treatment resulted in greater internalization of surrogate microorganisms {{when compared to the}} control. Furthermore, certain less effective antimicrobial sprays such as water may facilitate internalization of surface bacteria, more so than non-treated subprimals. It is important that producers of non-intact beef products focus on using effective antimicrobial sprays that maximize reductions and minimize internalization of surface bacteria into the finished product...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify critical parameters of application for selected harvest and fabrication intervention strategies used to control Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella. Paired, <b>boneless,</b> beef <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> (n= 120, IMPS 180) were selected at a commercial cow harvest facility, transported to the Food Microbiology Laboratory, Texas A&M University, and inoculated with nonpathogenic, rifampicin-resistant E. coli organisms (ATCC # 1427, 1428, 1430) to simulate harvest floor contamination. The beef <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were inoculated hot (~ 30 ?C) and then subjected to one of three chemical treatments (L-lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, and acidified sodium chlorite) including subset variations for concentration and pH. Lactic acid was applied warm (~ 53 ?C) and at room temperature (~ 25 ?C), whereas the peroxyacetic acid, and acidified sodium chlorite were applied at room temperature (~ 25 ?C). Lactic acid was applied at concentrations of 2. 5 % and 5 % using different water sources (tap and distilled), and at a common pH of ~ 2. 2 using different water sources (tap and distilled). Peroxyacetic acid was applied at concentrations of 210 ppm and 150 ppm, and acidified sodium chlorite was applied at concentrations of 500 ppm and 1200 ppm. Half of the <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> received the chemical interventions prior to chilling or ?hot? (~ 25 ?C), whereas the other half received the interventions after a chilling for ~ 24 h at ~ 2 ?C. When applied to hot <b>strip</b> <b>loins,</b> only the 2. 5 % and 5 % lactic acid treatments resulted in a greater than 1 log reduction, but for chilled <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> all treatments achieved greater than a 1 log reduction. When tap water was used to prepare the intervention, there was a difference between reductions for hot (0. 68 CFU/cm 2) and chilled (2. 02 CFU/cm 2) product, but there were no differences between hot and chilled for distilled water. Also, there were no differences in reductions between using tap and distilled water for hot products or for chilled products. The pH of the meat surface was lowest for the 5. 0 % lactic acid (3. 07) and highest for the 150 ppm peroxyacetic acid (6. 07).

Microbiological samples were collected from each section after inoculation (to determine the initial attachment of the surrogates), after being removed from the vacuum packaging at 3 d, and after treatment with lactic acid either before or following the dry- or wet-aging period. Dry-aged sections had a greater (P 0. 05) on microbiological counts whether the lactic acid was applied before or after dry- or wet-aging. In addition, there was no significant interaction (P > 0. 05) between aging and the application time.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effects of endpoint temperature, cooking method, and marbling on Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF; an objective method for determining tenderness) of three beef muscles. Eighteen subprimals of a muscle containing low content of connective tissue, longissimus lumborum (<b>strip</b> <b>loin),</b> and two muscles containing a high content of connective tissue, biceps femoris (bottom round) and deep pectoralis (brisket), were selected from USDA Select and Choice (Certified Angus Beef) carcasses. After 14 days of aging, subprimals were frozen, fabricated into steaks, and stored frozen until cooking. Steaks were assigned to one of two cooking methods, the Magikitch’n® electric belt grill (a rapid conduction method) or a water bath (a slower, convection method); and one of nine endpoint cooking temperatures, 104, 113, 122, 131, 140, 149, 158, 167, or 176 °F. According to WBSF results, optimum tenderness for the <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> occurred around 131 °F. Higher marbling protected tenderness at higher endpoint temperatures. Tenderness increased in bottom round and brisket muscles as endpoint temperature increased from 104 to 140 °F, then tenderness decreased as endpoint temperature rose from 149 to 176 °F. Endpoint temperature was the only significant factor affecting bottom round tenderness. Steaks cooked in the water bath had higher WBSF and, therefore, were less tender than those cooked on the belt grill. This was true for both the <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> and brisket.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} test the hypothesis that short-term oral administration of dietary vitamin D 3 to beef cattle before slaughter would increase beef tenderness through greater calcium-activated calpain activity in postmortem aged skeletal muscle. Thirty continental crossbred steers were allotted randomly to three treatment groups housed in one pen. One group served as a control; two other groups were administered boluses with either 5 x 10 (6) or 7. 5 x 10 (6) IU of vitamin D 3 daily for 9 d. Cattle were slaughtered 1 d later. The longissimus lumborum was excised from each carcass 72 h postmortem and steaks removed at 3, 7, 14, and 21 d postmortem. The semimembranosus muscle (top round) was excised from each carcass 72 h postmortem and steaks removed at 7, 14, and 21 d postmortem. Blood plasma calcium concentration of cattle treated with 5 or 7. 5 x 10 (6) IU of vitamin D 3 was higher (P 3 ̆c. 05) than that of controls. <b>Strip</b> <b>loin</b> and top loin steaks from cattle fed supplemental doses of vitamin D 3 had lower (P 3 ̆c. 05) Warner-Bratzler (W-B) shear values at 14 d postmortem but were not significantly different from controls at 3, 7, or 21 d (<b>strip</b> <b>loins)</b> or 7 or 21 d (top rounds). No significant difference in <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> steak tenderness was observed by sensory panel at 14 d postmortem (P 3 ̆c. 17) between steaks from control and vitamin D 3 -treated steers. At 14 d postmortem, <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> and top round steaks from cattle fed 5 x 10 (6) IU of vitamin D 3, but not from those given 7. 5 x 10 (6) IU, showed more proteolysis (P 3 ̆c. 05) than did steaks from control cattle, based on Western blotting analysis. Therefore, the use of supplemental dietary vitamin D 3 given daily for 9 d before slaughter did improve tenderness (lower W-B shear values) of 14 -d postmortem aged beef. Increased proteolysis seems to be the mechanism of tenderization...|$|R

40|$|Carcass and Warner-Bratzler {{shear force}} data on <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> steaks have been {{obtained}} on over 4, 200 cattle from contemporary progeny groups from {{the most widely used}} sires in 15 beef cattle breed associations (16 breeds). Trained sensory panel evaluations have been conducted on over 1, 500 <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> steaks from a sample of contemporary progeny groups from sires included in the QTL (quantitative trait loci) validation component of the project. One breed association has published Warner-Bratzler shear force Expected Progeny Differences (EPDs) for 57 sires of two breeds. DNA analyses and screening have been completed for 11 QTL on eight sires from several breeds. EPDs for carcass traits, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and sensory panel traits may be completed for several breeds within the year 2001. Information from this project should allow seedstock producers to improve carcass traits, tenderness, and other palatability traits through classical genetic selection or through DNA marker-assisted selection...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the influence of various degrees of doneness on the nutrient content of beef. Ten steaks were obtained from each of five USDA Prime, five USDA Choice, and five USDA Select <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> and assigned to one of five degree of doneness treatments (two sets of treatments per <b>strip</b> <b>loin)</b> : uncooked, medium rare (63 ?C), medium (71 ?C), well done (77 ?C), and very well done (82 ?C). Steaks then were dissected into separable tissue components consisting of lean, fat, and refuse. Lean tissue was used to obtain proximate analyses of protein, moisture, fat, and ash. This study showed that degree of doneness did influence (P < 0. 05) the nutrient composition of beef steaks. As the degree of doneness increased, percent fat and protein increased, while percent moisture decreased. Thus, cooking steaks to a higher degree of doneness will result in a higher calorie steak...|$|R
40|$|We used 162 <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> to {{determine}} the influence of different quality grades, aging periods, blade tenderization passes, and degree of doneness on thawing and cooking loss and Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS, tenderness). Select (SEL), Choice (CHO), and Certified Angus Beef™ (CAB) <b>strip</b> <b>loins</b> were aged for 7, 14, or 21 days and not tenderized (0 X) or blade tenderized one (1 X) or two (2 X) times. Steaks from each <b>strip</b> <b>loin</b> were assigned randomly to final endpoint cooking temperatures of 150, 160, and 170 °F. For steaks aged 7 days, all quality grade and blade tenderization treatments had similar (P>. 05) WBS. For steaks aged 14 days, CHO steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than SEL steaks, CAB tended (P=. 07) to have lower WBS than SEL, 2 X steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than 1 X steaks, and 1 X steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than 0 X steaks. For steaks aged 21 days, CAB steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than CHO steaks, CHO steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than SEL steaks, and 2 X steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than 1 X steaks. Among the 0 X and 2 X groups, CAB and CHO steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than SEL steaks. For the 1 X group, only CAB steaks had lower (P<. 05) WBS than SEL steaks. Blade tenderization improved tenderness of strip steaks but should be combined with high quality grades, increased aging, and lower endpoint cooking temperatures to achieve maximum tenderness...|$|R
5000|$|Strip steak, {{also known}} as New York strip: A {{high-quality}} steak cut from the short <b>loin</b> or <b>strip</b> <b>loin,</b> a muscle that is relatively low in connective tissue and does little work, {{and so it is}} particularly tender. It is referred to using different names in various countries. When still attached to the bone, and with a piece of the tenderloin also included, the strip steak is a T-bone steak.|$|R
