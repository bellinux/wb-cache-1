5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has finally <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion {{that it is a}} bad idea. He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not know whom to choose.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have <b>been</b> <b>divorced.</b> The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E
5|$|Though Olga {{repeatedly}} asked Tsar Nicholas II {{to allow}} her to divorce, her brother refused on religious and dynastic grounds; he believed marriage was for life and that royalty should marry within royalty. When their brother, Grand Duke Michael, eloped with his mistress, Natasha Wulfert, the Tsar and Olga were scandalized {{along with the rest of}} society. Natasha was a commoner who had <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> twice, and one of her former husbands was an officer in the same regiment as Kulikovsky. Michael was banished from Russia, and the likelihood of the Tsar ever granting Olga's divorce, or permitting her to marry a commoner, looked remote.|$|E

50|$|It was, indeed, {{a way of}} life, which recognizes liberty, {{equality}} and fraternity as the principles of life and which cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from each other: Liberty cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from equality; equality cannot <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from liberty. Nor can liberty and equality <b>be</b> <b>divorced</b> from fraternity. Without equality, liberty would produce the supremacy of the few over the many. Equality without liberty would kill individual initiative. Without fraternity, liberty and equality could not become a natural course of things.|$|R
5|$|The {{implementation}} of a uniform civil code for all citizens has not been achieved owing to widespread opposition from various religious groups and political parties. The Shah Bano case (1985–86) provoked a political firestorm in India when the Supreme Court ruled that Shah Bano, a Muslim woman who had <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> by her husband in 1978 was entitled to receive alimony from her former husband under Indian law applicable for all Indian women. This decision evoked outrage in the Muslim community, which sought {{the application of the}} Muslim personal law and in response the Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 overturning the Supreme Court's verdict. This act provoked further outrage, as jurists, critics and politicians alleged that the fundamental right of equality for all citizens irrespective of religion or gender was being jettisoned to preserve the interests of distinct religious communities. The verdict and the legislation remain a source of heated debate, with many citing the issue as a prime example of the poor {{implementation of}} Fundamental Rights.|$|E

25|$|Along {{with these}} general acceptances, many {{movements}} view contraception use {{outside of marriage}} as encouragement to promiscuity. For example, Focus on the Family states,Sex is a powerful drive, {{and for most of}} human history it was firmly linked to marriage and childbearing. Only relatively recently has the act of sex commonly <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> from marriage and procreation. Modern contraceptive inventions have given many an exaggerated sense of safety and prompted more people than ever before to move sexual expression outside the marriage boundary.|$|E
25|$|In a {{scene in}} a bar, the {{character}} of Paul Marrane tells Gloria {{the tale of a}} soldier who goes off to war, first giving his wife a bill of divorce that becomes official if he doesn’t return within 12 months, but then retroactively takes effect from the moment he left; should he not return, this would mean that she would have <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> during the last 12 months, despite the fact she had spent those months married to that very same man. This is a paradox and a contradiction to the law of noncontradiction.|$|E
25|$|In 1943 Fatmawati {{became the}} third wife of Sukarno and the {{following}} year gave birth to his first child, a son. Sukarno named his child Guntur meaning thunder.

25|$|Isabella's {{marriage}} was annulled by Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, who was Papal legate, and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais. The Bishop of Beauvais then married her to Conrad (controversially, since {{his brother had}} been married to her half-sister and it was uncertain whether he had <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> by his Byzantine wife). The succession dispute was prolonged {{by the arrival of}} Richard I of England and Philip II of France on the Third Crusade: Richard supported Guy, as a Poitevin vassal, while Philip supported Conrad, his late father's cousin.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of her murder, Christine and Fred Schultz had <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> six months. Fred Schultz {{initially}} stated he was on duty investigating a burglary with his partner, Michael Durfee, at {{the time of}} the murder, but years later he admitted they were actually drinking at a local bar. When ballistics testing revealed it was his off-duty revolver that had been the murder weapon, suspicion shifted to Laurie Bembenek, as she had been alone in the apartment she shared with Schultz and had access to both the gun and a key to Christine's house that Fred Schultz had secretly copied from his oldest son's house key. Bembenek was arrested for Christine Schultz's murder on June 24, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Valentino {{first met}} Winifred Shaughnessy, known by her stage name, Natacha Rambova—an American silent film costume and set designer, art director, and protégée of Nazimova—on {{the set of}} Uncharted Seas in 1921. The two worked {{together}} on the Nazimova production of Camille, by which time they were romantically involved. They married on May 13, 1922, in Mexicali, Mexico, which resulted in Valentino's arrest for bigamy, since he had not <b>been</b> <b>divorced</b> for a full year, as required by California law at the time. Days passed and his studio at the time, Famous Players-Lasky, refused to post bail. Eventually, a few friends were able to post the cash bail. He was also investigated for a possible violation of the Mann Act.|$|E

25|$|The {{members of}} the core group all shared an {{academic}} background, being students at Munich university. The Scholl siblings, Christoph Probst, Willi Graf and Alexander Schmorell were all raised by liberal, independently thinking and wealthy parents. Alexander Schmorell was born in Russia, and his first language was Russian. After he and Hans Scholl had become friends at the university, Alexander invited Hans to his parents' home, where Hans also met Christoph Probst {{at the beginning of}} 1941. Alexander Schmorell and Christoph Probst had already been friends since their school days. As Christoph's father had <b>been</b> <b>divorced,</b> and had married again to a Jewish wife, the effects of the Nazi Nuremberg Laws, and Nazi racial ideology had impacts on both Christoph's and Alexander's lives from early on.|$|E
25|$|Caleb begins The Love Dare halfheartedly {{viewing the}} tasks {{as more of}} a checklist, while nurses at Catherine's {{hospital}} warn her not to trust him as they interpret his actions as a way to butter her up for a better divorce settlement. With encouragement from his father and Michael, Caleb continues, though Catherine eschews his affections and grows closer to Dr. Keller. Finding Catherine unmoved, Caleb is consoled by his father while Michael reveals that he has <b>been</b> <b>divorced.</b> Caleb sustains burns on the job, and while being treated at the hospital where his wife works, Dr. Keller inadvertently discovers that Catherine is married and he is treating her husband, but continues his affections. Caleb continues The Love Dare with renewed faith and Catherine gives him an envelope petitioning for divorce.|$|E
