25|$|Flying {{training}} {{comprised the}} second half of the primary course. Starting with straight-and-level flying accompanied by an instructor in a dual trainer, the student advanced step by step until he could solo, execute a variety of maneuvers, and deal with many of the situations arising in flight. If the cadet review board (<b>Benzine</b> Board) did not get him, he graduated with the rating of junior airplane pilot (JAP). In 1927 basic flight training moved out of the advanced phase and combined with primary. At that point, primary-basic changed to eight months in length and advanced to four months.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the word}} {{gasoline}} instead of petrol outside North America can often be confusing. Shortening gasoline to gas, which happens often, causes confusion with various forms of gas used as car fuel (compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)). In many countries, gasoline has a colloquial name derived from that of the chemical benzene (e.g., German Benzin, Czech benzín, Dutch <b>benzine,</b> Italian benzina, Russian бензин benzin, Polish benzyna, Chilean Spanish bencina, Thai เบนซิน bensin, Greek βενζίνη venzini, Romanian benzină, Swedish bensin, Arabic بنزين binzīn). Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay use the colloquial name nafta derived from that of the chemical naphtha.|$|E

50|$|The {{ground on}} which the {{colliery}} and 'plant' stood {{is yet to be}} re-developed. The ground has reportedly high concentrations of <b>Benzines</b> in the soil at present and therefore it would be dangerous to re-use in its present condition. This is one major blight on the landscape. Caerphilly County Borough Council inherited most of land and face an awkward situation. To clean up the land would more than likely cost more than what the land is worth, so restoration work in the near future is unlikely.It is worthy of note that, during the 2nd World War, German aircraft actually dropped bombs, both incendiary and active, on Caerphilly Mountain top (anyone visiting the area will find it still full of craters) mistaking it for the Bedwas/Trethomas mountain where the intention was to eliminate the National Benzol 'Plant' which produced aviation fuels from the coal as by-products.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} of the Bagnères-de-Bigorre conference, Rossi had already turned his {{attention}} toward the astrophysical implications of cosmic ray phenomena, particularly extensive air showers. [...] After Rossi's recognition, in Eritrea, that these events exist, they were extensively studied by Pierre Auger, and by Williams. [...] At this time, the extremely fast response of the newly developed scintillation counters offered a new way to study the structure of air showers. [...] To do this, Rossi enlisted his student, George W. Clark, who completed a PhD in 1952, and Piero Bassi, who was a visitor from the University of Padua. [...] Because solid scintillating material was unavailable, they decided to use terphenyl dissolved in <b>benzine,</b> which is an efficient liquid scintillator. [...] With the aid of three counters deployed {{on the roof of the}} MIT Physics building during the winter of 1952/53, they found that shower particles arrived within only one or two meters of a disk, which travels at nearly the speed of light in the direction of the shower axis.|$|E
500|$|In 1912 WSPU members adopted arson {{as another}} tactic {{to win the}} vote. After Prime Minister Asquith had visited the Theatre Royal in Dublin, suffragette activists Gladys Evans, Mary Leigh, Lizzie Baker and Mabel Capper of Oxford Street, Manchester {{attempted}} to cause an explosion using gunpowder and <b>benzine,</b> which resulted in minimal damage. During the same evening Mary Leigh threw an axe at the carriage containing John Redmond, the Lord Mayor, and Prime Minister Asquith. Over {{the next two years}} women set fire to a refreshments building in Regent's Park, an orchid house at Kew Gardens, pillar boxes, and a railway carriage. Although Pankhurst confirmed that these women had not been commanded by her or Christabel, they both assured the public that they supported the arsonist suffragettes. There were similar incidents around the country. One WSPU member, for example, put a small hatchet into the Prime Minister's carriage inscribed with the words: [...] "Votes for Women," [...] and other suffragettes used acid to burn the same slogan into golf courses used by MPs. In 1914 Mary Richardson slashed the Velasquez painting Rokeby Venus to protest against Pankhurst's imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|Fire {{was always}} a concern around oil {{and one of the}} worst fires was on June 11, 1880. What {{came to be known as}} [...] "Black Friday" [...] {{happened}} when almost [...] of oil burned after an oil tank was hit by lightning. The fire raged for three days until it finally was brought under control. Although the oil was valued at $2 million, there was no loss of life. Another fire occurred on June 5, 1892, when Oil Creek flooded and a tank of <b>benzine</b> overturned. The <b>benzine</b> ignited and in the ensuing explosions 60 men, women, and children died. Another lightning strike in 1894 resulted in [...] lost in a fire. Oil production peaked the late 1880s and has declined greatly since, although a few operating wells are still located in the park.|$|E
40|$|More than 200 wallcoverings of {{different}} kind were analyzed on emissions of formaldehyde, vinylchloride monomer (VCM) {{and the heavy}} metals As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb and Se. The formaldehyde emission was measured according to a modified WKI-flask method. In order to determine indoor air concentrations, the obtained material parameters were correlated with steady state concentration values from 1 cbm chamber tests. VCM was analysed by headspace gas chromatography. The metals were extracted with hydrochloric acid at 37 degree C and quantified by AAS or ICP/AES. All investigated wallcoverings showed only low emission potentials for formaldehyde and the eight metals. In no case could VCM be detected. To {{find out more about}} emissions of other volatile organic compounds (VOC), wallcoverings were exposed to inert gas at 60 degree C (dynamic headspace) and the emitted substances were specified by (GC/MS). Alternately, the release of VOC was investigated under specified climatic conditions in a 1 cbm test chamber. The VOC-emissions of the tested wallcoverings were low in all cases. Aliphatic hydrocarbons, probably coming from solvents like test <b>benzines,</b> were mainly found. Some aliphatic aldehydes and aromatic solvents could also be detected in small quantities. By testing the water vapour permeability of more than 40 probes, {{it was found that the}} permeability coefficients are widely spread, depending on the type and amount of the cover material...|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{when you}} come in sight of Moffitt--my, oh, my! Well, you come in smell of it about as soon. That gas out there ain't odorless, like the Pittsburg gas, and so it's {{perfectly}} safe; but the smell isn't bad--about as bad as the finest kind of <b>benzine.</b> Well, the first thing that strikes you {{when you come}} to Moffitt is the notion {{that there has been a}} good warm, growing rain, and the town's come up overnight. That's in the suburbs, the annexes, and additions. But it ain't shabby--no shanty-farm business; nice brick and frame houses, some of 'em Queen Anne style, and all of 'em looking as if they had come to stay. And when you drive up from the depot you think everybody's moving. Everything seems to be piled into the street; old houses made over, and new ones going up everywhere. You know the kind of street Main Street always used to be in our section--half plank-road and turnpike, and the rest mud-hole, and a lot of stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher than the back, and here and there a decent building with the gable end to the public; and a court-house and jail and two taverns and three or four churches. Well, they're all there in Moffitt yet, but architecture has struck it hard, and they've got a lot of new buildings that needn't be ashamed of themselves anywhere; the new court-house is as big as St. Peter's, and the Grand Opera-house is in the highest style of the art. You can't buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot in New York--or you couldn't when the boom was on; I saw the place just when the boom was in its prime. I went out there to work the newspapers in the syndicate business, and I got one of their men to write me a real bright, snappy account of the gas; and they just took me in their arms and showed me everything. Well, it was wonderful, and it was beautiful, too! To see a whole community stirred up like that was--just like a big boy, all hope and high spirits, and no discount on the remotest future; nothing but perpetual boom to the end of time--I tell you it warmed your blood. Why, there were some things about it that made you think what a nice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together, instead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook, and devil take the hindmost. They made up their minds at Moffitt that if they wanted their town to grow they'd got to keep their gas public property. So they extended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region round there; and then the city took possession of every well that was put down, and held it for the common good. Anybody that's a mind to come to Moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wants free; and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas you want to heat and light your private house. The people hold on to it for themselves, and, as I say, it's a grand sight to see a whole community hanging together and working for the good of all, instead of splitting up into as many different cut-throats as there are able-bodied citizens. See that fellow?" [...] Fulkerson broke off, and indicated with a twirl of his head a short, dark, foreign-looking man going out of the door. [...] "They say that fellow's a Socialist. I think it's a shame they're allowed to come here. If they don't like the way we manage our affairs let 'em stay at home," [...] Fulkerson continued.

50|$|Beginning in the 1960s and 70's, {{the high}} {{incidence}} rate of polyneuropathy amongst industrial workers chronically exposed to petroleum <b>benzine</b> and other hydrocarbon solvents prompted {{investigations into the}} safety of chronic exposure to petroleum distillates. Many of the cases of polyneuropathy amongst workers chronically exposed to vapors of petroleum <b>benzine</b> and similar solvents {{have been attributed to}} the n-hexane component of these mixtures. Using an animal model (Wistar-strain male rats), Ono and coworkers reported that chronic exposure (12 h a day for 24 weeks) to hydrocarbon solvent vapors conspicuously impaired peripheral nerve function in the 500 ppm n-hexane group, slightly impaired in the 200 ppm n-hexane group and petroleum <b>benzine</b> II group (containing 500 ppm n-hexane), and barely impaired in the petroleum <b>benzine</b> I group (containing 200 ppm n-hexane). These results suggest that some components in petroleum <b>benzine</b> are likely to antagonize the neurotoxic effects of n-hexane to the peripheral nerves, possibly by inhibiting the oxidation of n-hexane to its more toxic metabolites 2-hexanone and 2,5-hexanedione. Ono and coworkers also observed depressed body weight gains amongst the exposed groups compared to the control group in the order: petroleum <b>benzine</b> II > petroleum <b>benzine</b> I (ccontaining 200 ppm n-hexane) >> 500 ppm n-hexane > 200 ppm n-hexane. These results suggest that other components found in petroleum <b>benzine</b> may have an additive, syngeristic or potentiative effects on the biological effects of n-hexane. Namely, 1000 ppm n-hexane, 3000 ppm n-heptane and 1000 ppm toluene were reported to have the effect of depressing the body weight gain of rats.|$|E
