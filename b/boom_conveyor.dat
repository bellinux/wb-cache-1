5000|$|Travelling: The stacker {{moves on}} a rail track, {{which may be}} broad or narrow gauge, {{enabling}} it to move around the stockyard as required. For this purpose, traction motors powered by direct current (DC) are connected by bevel gears to between 12 and 22 wheels. For manual control, all the controls are in a controller's cabin above the <b>boom</b> <b>conveyor</b> or boom. Modern stackers can be controlled remotely.|$|E
50|$|She is a self-unloading vessel, with a 250 feet m <b>boom,</b> {{mounting}} a <b>conveyor</b> belt, {{that could be}} swung to port or starboard.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{originally}} {{powered by a}} triple expansion steam engine. [...] During her eighty years in service she was upgraded with a self-unloading <b>boom</b> and <b>conveyor</b> belts, a bow thruster, and her steam engine was replaced with a more powerful diesel. According to George wharton, of the boatnerd site, she was the largest vessel in the US Steel's fleets, when built, but by 1981, she {{had become one of}} the smallest.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971 she {{was sold}} to Algoma Central. [...] In 1987 she was renamed Algogulf. In 1990 Algoma Central renamed her Algosteel, after a refit where she was {{equipped}} with a large <b>boom</b> and internal <b>conveyor</b> belts and elevators, so she could unload her cargo without relying on shore facilities.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{stockpile}} {{is formed}} by machinery dumping coal into a pile, either from dump trucks, pushed into heaps with bulldozers or from <b>conveyor</b> <b>booms.</b> More controlled stockpiles are formed using stackers to form piles {{along the length}} of a conveyor, and reclaimers to retrieve the coal when required for product loading, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{transfer}} station {{itself is a}} converted 200,000 DWT VLCC (ex 'Berge Brioni') with a storage capacity of approximately 180,000t. Export vessels moor {{on the port side}} and are loaded by a travelling, gravity fed <b>conveyor</b> <b>boom</b> with a 36m outreach which eliminates the need for shifting during loading. Approximately 60 vessels are handled annually.|$|R
5000|$|On 14 February 2016, unit 222 005 was in {{collision}} with a <b>conveyor</b> <b>boom</b> left foul {{of the line}} at Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire. The lead vehicle suffered substantial damage and the driver was shaken but uninjured. No injuries were reported amongst the 85 passengers, although the boom operator was severely injured. The RAIB have opened {{an investigation into the}} accident.|$|R
50|$|It mainly {{consist of}} an {{extendable}} arm or <b>boom,</b> a belt <b>conveyor,</b> a tripper to elevate and transfer product {{from a source}} conveyor or feeder, and a mobile structure to support the boom. It is usually mounted on rails and sometimes on tyres and can move {{in order to be}} able to reach the whole length of the ship. The boom also can move front and back, up and down by separate drives so that it can fill the whole breadth of the hold and adapt to the ships increasing draught while it is loaded. At the discharge, a special telescoping chute, with rotating, pivoting spoon, facilitates even and complete filling of the holds.|$|R
50|$|Stockpiles provide surge {{capacity}} to {{various parts of}} the CPP. ROM coal is delivered with large variations in production rate of tonnes per hour (tph). A ROM stockpile is used to allow the washplant to be fed coal at lower, constant rate. A simple stockpile is formed by machinery dumping coal into a pile, either from dump trucks, pushed into heaps with bulldozers or from <b>conveyor</b> <b>booms.</b> More controlled stockpiles are formed using stackers to form piles along the length of a conveyor, and reclaimers to retrieve the coal when required for product loading, etc. Taller and wider stockpiles reduce the land area required to store a set tonnage of coal. Larger coal stockpiles have a reduced rate of heat loss, leading to a higher risk of spontaneous combustion.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{pesticide}} spraying depends on <b>boom</b> movement. A <b>conveyor</b> with a shaking platform {{was built to}} analyse the influence of boom movements on spray distribution. It is able to generate uniform translations and rotational movements of a small boom under laboratory conditions. The overall ground spray distributions were studied using image analysis. Suitable representations and mathematical tools were considered to analyse the unevenness of ground spray distributions and to compare accurately spray patterns. The effects of boom height, boom speed and nozzle type on dynamic spray distributions were analysed and compared with stationary distributions. The effects of yaw and roll movements were also considered. Measurements of droplet size and velocity made with a phase Doppler analyser were added to complete the dynamic effect study. Tests were repeatable but some fluctuations were obtained when boom height increased.

40|$|Loading of bulk {{materials}} like iron ore, coal, fertilizers, grains into ships for transportation by sea {{is done by}} ship loaders. Ship loaders are a very common sight in ports and jetties from where {{bulk materials}} are exported. It mainly consists of an extendable <b>boom,</b> a belt <b>conveyor</b> and a mobile structure to support the boom. It is usually mounted on rails and sometimes on tires and can move {{in order to be}} able to reach the whole length of the ship. The boom also can move front and back (boom telescoping), up and down (luffing) by separate drives so that it can fill all the corners of the ship hatches. Ship loaders are built in capacities from 1000 to 15000 TPH (tones per hour). The height of a ship loader can be in excess of 20 meters and the boom can extend to a length of more than 60 meters. Arc type of ship loaders are usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and slewing movement of the boom to reach maximum portions the ship hatch area. This type of ship loaders are less common in present day ports as it cannot load material to all portions of the ship hatches, requires huge berth construction work and more number of conveyors A Linear ship loader is usually mounted on a pair of rails that are parallel to the berth and the ship. This type of ship loader can perform operations like long travel, luffing and telescopic movement of the boom to reach all portions of the ship hatch. We propose a machine called radial ship loader which is capable of loading 1000 â€™s of tons of bulk material in to ships and can considerably reduce civil work for berth, power consumption and number of conveyors required for operatio...|$|R
