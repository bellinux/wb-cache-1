2500|$|On June 8, 2015, Tony Campolo {{released}} a statement changing {{his position on the}} issue of gay relationships, and stating that he now supported full acceptance of Christian gay couples into the Church. He cited several reasons including the institution of marriage primarily being about spiritual growth instead of procreation, what he had learned through his friendships with gay Christian couples, and past examples of exclusionary church traditions practiced [...] "by sincere believers, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> now agree that they were wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Thicke {{explained}} to the Breakfast Club, [...] "The album is called Blurred Lines. I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are living right in between those straight lines. And everything you thought you knew, the older you get, you realize, 'Damn, I don't know nothing about this. I better pay attention, I better listen and keep learning.' So I think that, that's what I've been realizing these past few years." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "But," [...] David Clowney writes, [...] "freedom is frightening, and it {{is easier}} to run from it into the safety of roles and realities that are defined by society, or even by your own past. To be free is to be thrown into {{existence}} with no [...] "human nature" [...] as an essence to define you, and no definition of the reality into which you are thrown, either. To accept this freedom is to live [...] "authentically"; <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> run from authenticity. In the most ordinary affairs of daily life, we face the challenge of authentic choice, and the temptation of comfortable inauthenticity. All of Roquentin's experiences are related to these themes from Sartre's philosophy." ...|$|E

60|$|This lady, {{like many}} <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{had turned to}} charity and philanthropy in the earlier days of her bereavement; <b>but,</b> unlike <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> her benevolence had not died out with the sharpest pangs of her sorrow.

6000|$|... "Ah, yes; you. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> took it very easily. Dear, dear! When I {{think of}} it, {{and see how}} hard they work now, and {{remember}} what pleasant times we used to have,--I don't feel sometimes quite sure." ...|$|E

6000|$|He {{took the}} big green bundle {{from his head}} and set it down, pulled off his old hat to flap the dust out of it, then sucked at his short clay. [...] "Well," [...] he said at length, [...] "some fancies one thing and some another, <b>but</b> we <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> like a regatta." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Headingly, {{with his}} slow, {{deliberate}} manner, [...] "I won't {{say that we}} have not our tiffs, and there are some of our people--mostly of Irish stock--who are always mad with England; <b>but</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have a kindly thought for the mother country.

6000|$|... "Well, {{some of us}} {{know one}} another, in the office, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> don't. There's quite a {{regiment}} of people on a big paper. If you'd like to come out," [...] Burnamy ventured, [...] "perhaps you could get the Woman's Page to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she said, {{thinking}} {{as she looked}} at him. [...] "Yes. Yes. That is the impression. That is the quality. But in reality-- There are other things in the world beside effects and impressions. After all, that is--an analogy.

60|$|The little crowd {{becomes the}} reading public, and Hocker grows into an editor; he twists my arm in other ways. Some are brave, so the crowd kicks them and scurries off {{to catch the}} four-fifteen. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> I fear, are slaves to Hocker. Then, after awhile, the wind grows sulky and will not tell us stories any more, {{and we have to}} make them up out of our own heads. Perhaps it is just as well. What were doors and windows made for but to keep out the wind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, that's so, <b>but</b> I guess <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> get rusty. We {{land in a}} rut of {{obstetrics}} and typhoid and busted legs. What we need is women like you to jump on us. It'd be you that would transform the town." ...|$|R

40|$|In what is {{believed}} to be a world first, 16 Australian faith communities representing the world 2 ̆ 7 s great religious traditions have united to speak out on climate change. The climate change debate has tended to be dominated by the language of science. The 2006 Stern Report from the UK began to extend the discussion to the economic effects of global warming. <b>But</b> for <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> the fate <b>of</b> the planet as a result of global warming is really a moral issue. Climate change is ultimately about what it means for people - especially children - and the whole creation.  ...|$|R

I'd {{write of}} people and places like I knew, and I'd make my {{characters}} talk everyday English; and I'd let the sun rise and set in the usual quiet way without much fuss over the fact. If I had to have villains at all, I'd give them a chance, Anne--I'd give them a chance. There are some terrible bad men in the world, I suppose, but you'd have to go a long piece to find them--though Mrs. Lynde believes we're all bad. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have got a little decency somewhere in us.

6000|$|Mr. Stockton {{considered}} {{his career as}} an editor of great advantage to him as an author. In an autobiographical paper he writes: [...] "Long-continued reading of manuscripts submitted for publication which are almost good enough to use, and yet not quite up to the standard of the magazine, can not but be of great service to any one who proposes a literary career. Bad work shows us {{what we ought to}} avoid, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> know, or think we know, what that is. Fine literary work we get outside the editorial room. But the great mass of literary material which is almost good enough to print is seen only by the editorial reader, and its lesson is lost upon him in a great degree unless he is, or intends to be, a literary worker." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because of {{the safety}} in the Sea Valley, which {{was because of the}} wall and the watchers and the guards, and because there was food in plenty for all without having to fight for it, many {{families}} came in from the coast valleys on both sides and from the high back mountains where they had lived more like wild animals than men. And it was not long before the Sea Valley filled up, and in it were countless families. But, before this happened, the land, which had been free to all and belonged to all, was divided up. Three-Legs began it when he planted corn. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> did not care about the land. We thought the marking of the boundaries with fences of stone was a foolishness. We had plenty to eat, and what more did we want? I remember that my father and I built stone fences for Three-Legs and were given corn in return.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wilhelmina," [...] he said softly, [...] "life, our life, {{does its}} best to {{strangle}} the emotions. One feels that one does best with a pulse which has forgotten how to quicken, and a heart which beats {{to the will of}} its owner. <b>But</b> the <b>most</b> hardened <b>of</b> <b>us</b> come to grief sometimes.

60|$|Here they {{attacked}} us again. The great drum on the teocalli beat {{for the last}} time, {{and for the last}} time the wild scream of the Aztec warriors went up to heaven. We fought our best; I killed four men that day with my arrows which Otomie, who was at my side, handed me as I shot. <b>But</b> the <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had not the strength of a child, and what could we do? They came among us like seamen among a flock of seals, and slaughtered us by hundreds. They drove us into the canals and trod us to death there, till bridges were made of our bodies. How we escaped I do not know.|$|R
5000|$|Wu {{is known}} for not celebrating his birthday, arguing {{he does not know}} the purpose of celebrating one's birthday. The fact that all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> can be {{standing}} here today, we must be thankful towards our mother. <b>But</b> instead <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> send our wishes and purchase gifts for one another during birthdays. Wu says that it's more than what he can accept. To him, birthdays is not an opportunity for people to gain advantage from and to receive gifts from the others. Wu was recently linked to a Taiwan-based American man named Mark, who was said to have grown close to the singer over the months, and was called [...] "Sister Fong" [...] by Taiwanese TV personality Dee Shu, alluding to his sexual preference.|$|R

His staff are all {{comparatively}} young men, {{with none of the}} stiffness of the British staff officer about them. We are all young--there is scarcely a man with the rank of captain in the British Army out here. We are all majors or colonels in the Egyptian Army, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are subalterns in our own regiments. It is good training for us. At home a subaltern is merely a machine to carry out orders; he is told to do this, and he does it; for him to think for himself would be a heinous offence. He is altogether without responsibility, and without initiative and, by the time he becomes a field officer, he is hidebound. He has never thought for himself, and he can't be expected to begin to do so, after working for twenty years like a machine.|$|E
60|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1917 it was very hot in New York, and hotter still aboard the transatlantic liner thrust between the piers. One glance at our cabins, at the crowded decks and dining-room, at the little writing-room above, where the ink had congealed in the ink-wells, sufficed to bring home to us that the days of luxurious sea travel, of a la carte restaurants, and Louis Seize {{bedrooms}} were gone--at least for a period. The prospect of a voyage of nearly two weeks was not enticing. The ship, to be sure, was far from being the best of those still running on a line which had gained a magic reputation of immunity from submarines; three years ago she carried only second and third class passengers! <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were in a hurry to get to the countries where war had already become a grim and terrible reality. In one way or another we had all enlisted.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{portion of}} the Swiss had {{remained}} on guard in the Tuileries when the main body marched away. The instant the palace was undefended the mob burst in. Every Swiss was murdered, {{as well as many}} of the servants of the queen. The mob sacked the palace and set it on fire. When the Swiss left we had one by one made our way out by a back entrance, <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were recognized by the mob and were literally cut to pieces. I rushed into a house when assaulted, and, slamming the door behind me, made my way out by the back and so escaped them, getting off with only these two wounds; then I hurried to a house of a friend, whom I had seen murdered before my eyes, but his servants did not know of it, and they allowed me to remain there till dark, and you see here I am." ...|$|E
60|$|Their {{confidence}} {{in human nature}} is really honourable and magnificent; it {{takes the form of}} refusing to believe the overwhelming majority of mankind, even when they set out to explain their own motives. <b>But</b> although <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would in all probability tend at first sight to consider this new sect of Christians as little less outrageous than some brawling and absurd sect in the Reformation, yet we should fall into a singular error in doing so. The Christianity of Tolstoy is, when we come to consider it, one <b>of</b> the <b>most</b> thrilling and dramatic incidents in our modern civilisation. It represents a tribute to the Christian religion more sensational than the breaking of seals or the falling of stars.|$|R
60|$|No doubt he, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{would be}} uplifted at {{times by the}} awakened lyrism of his heart into regions charming, empty, and dangerous. <b>But</b> also, like <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{he was unaware of}} his barren {{journeys}} above the interesting cares of this earth. Yet from these, no doubt absurd and wasted moments, there remained on the man's daily life a tinge as that of a glowing and serene half-light. It softened the outlines of his rugged nature; and these moments kept close the bond between him and his brig.|$|R

6000|$|Having silenced Objection {{by force}} of unreason, Will walked to Lowick {{as if he had}} been on the way to Paradise, {{crossing}} Halsell Common and skirting the wood, where the sunlight fell broadly under the budding boughs, bringing out the beauties of moss and lichen, and fresh green growths piercing the brown. Everything seemed to know that it was Sunday, and to approve of his going to Lowick Church. Will easily felt happy when nothing crossed his humor, and by this time the thought of vexing Mr. Casaubon had become rather amusing to him, making his face break into its merry smile, pleasant to see as the breaking of sunshine on the water--though the occasion was not exemplary. <b>But</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> are apt to settle within ourselves that the man who blocks our way is odious, and not to mind causing him a little of the disgust which his personality excites in ourselves. Will went along with a small book under his arm and a hand in each side-pocket, never reading, but chanting a little, as he made scenes of what would happen in church and coming out. He was experimenting in tunes to suit some words of his own, sometimes trying a ready-made melody, sometimes improvising. The words were not exactly a hymn, but they certainly fitted his Sunday experience:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Methinks, if {{such good}} fortune ever befell a bookish man, I should choose this lodge {{for my own}} residence, with the topmost room of the tower for a study, and all the {{seclusion}} of cultivated wildness beneath to ramble in. There being no such possibility, we drove on, catching glimpses of the palace in new points of view, and by and by came to Rosamond's Well. The particular tradition that connects Fair Rosamond with it is not now in my memory; but if Rosamond ever lived and loved, and ever had her abode in the maze of Woodstock, {{it may well be}} believed that she and Henry sometimes sat beside this spring. It gushes out from a bank, through some old stone-work, and dashes its little cascade (about as abundant as one might turn out of a large pitcher) into a pool, whence it steals away towards the lake, which is not far removed. The water is exceedingly cold, and as pure as the legendary Rosamond was not, and is fancied to possess medicinal virtues, like springs at which saints have quenched their thirst. There were two or three old women and some children in attendance with tumblers, which they present to visitors, full of the consecrated water; <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> filled the tumblers for ourselves, and drank.|$|E
6000|$|Medora took heart, a cheap hall {{bedroom and}} two art lessons {{a week from}} Professor Angelini, a retired barber who had studied his {{profession}} in a Harlem dancing academy. There {{was no one to}} set her right, for here in the big city they do it unto all of us. How many of us are badly shaved daily and taught the two-step imperfectly by ex-pupils of Bastien Le Page and Gérôme? The most pathetic sight in New York--except the manners of the rush-hour crowds--is the dreary march of the hopeless army of Mediocrity. Here Art is no benignant goddess, but a Circe who turns her wooers into mewing Toms and Tabbies who linger about the doorsteps of her abode, unmindful of the flying brickbats and boot-jacks of the critics. Some of us creep back to our native villages to the skim-milk of [...] "I told you so"; <b>but</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> prefer to remain in the cold courtyard of our mistress's temple, snatching the scraps that fall from her divine table d'hôte. But some of us grow weary at last of the fruitless service. And then there are two fates open to us. We can get a job driving a grocer's wagon, or we can get swallowed up in the Vortex of Bohemia. The latter sounds good; but the former really pans out better. For, when the grocer pays us off we can rent a dress suit and--the capitalized system of humor describes it best--Get Bohemia On the Run.|$|E
40|$|Dow Jones {{was rising}} despite {{worldwide}} unrest, high unemployment, {{and the increasing}} likelihood that a presidential candidate thought to be unfriendly to Wall Street, Barack Obama, would win a second term in November. Montagne asked Wessel why, {{in the face of}} all this bad news, stocks were rising. “Well, ” Wessel replied, “it’s always hard to know why the stock mar-ket does what it does. And it’s important to remember that the mood on Wall Street could change abruptly at any moment. ” Wessel’s language is so familiar it doesn’t strike us as the bizarre cultural phenomenon it is.

And though Enoch and Elias went into the temple through a gate which certainly may be called Beautiful, the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have to find our way to it through Ezekiel's low-bowed door and the vault full of creeping things and all manner of abominable beasts. Nevertheless, there is a certain frame of mind to which a cemetery is, if not an antidote, at least an alleviation. If you are in a fit of the blues, go nowhere else.
