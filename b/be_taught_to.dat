5|$|Trained {{cockatoos}} {{are sometimes}} seen in bird shows in zoos. They are generally less motivated by food than other birds; some may more respond to petting or praise than food. Cockatoos can often <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> wear a parrot harness, enabling their owners {{to take them}} outdoors. Cockatoos {{have been used in}} animal-assisted therapy, generally in nursing homes.|$|E
5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting {{as a kind of}} invisibility cloak, and they had to <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins {{was also}} {{committed}} {{to education and}} conservation. He made appearances on the TV series Science in Action, traveled to Asia to promote science education, and chaired a U.C. elementary school science project which recommended that science <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> children as early as six. In conjunction with the Sierra Club he produced two educational films: Nature Next Door (1962) and No Room for Wilderness? (1967). Stebbins co-authored revisions of the widely used textbooks General Zoology (5th ed.,1972; 6th ed., 1979) and Elements of Zoology (4th ed., 1974), books originally written by Tracy Storer and Robert Usinger.|$|E
5000|$|According to disciples' grades, the Dharma is as {{inferior}} and superior. For example, {{the inferior}} <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the merchants Trapuṣa and Ballika {{because they were}} ordinary men; the middle <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the group of five because {{they were at the}} stage of saints; the eightfold Prajñāpāramitās <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> bodhisattvas, and Prajñāpāramitās are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms.|$|R

50|$|For skiers in {{this class}} with above the knee amputations, how to fall {{properly}} is an important skill. They <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> try to prevent the stump of their leg from hitting the snow as it can cause more damage to that leg {{than the one that}} is not partially missing. When working on side stepping, the skier is supported to keep the stump of their leg on the uphill side. Elite skiers <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> avoid using outriggers as crutches. They <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> turn using their leg instead of their ski poles. In getting on ski lifts, skiers {{in this class}}ification with amputations <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> lift their outriggers off the ground and point them forward.|$|R
5|$|Stratton {{served in}} the Army during World War I, {{developing}} psychological tests to select airmen for Army aviation. Exposure {{to the war effort}} prompted his interest in international relations and causes of wars. He was an anti-war believer who held psychology should aim to assist humanity's quest to avert future wars. He was optimistic that people and ethnicities, making up nations, could <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> live in peace, though the races were not equal in inborn mental capacity, a belief he held as scientific. In the later part of his career he wrote books looking at international relations, war, and the differences between races on emotions. He was also a scholar of the classics and translated Greek philosophers.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{progressive}} neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease. Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech. AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech. A portable amplifier, for example, {{may be used to}} increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary. In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred. High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease. Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Rabbis {{believed}} that the mysteries of Kabbalah were so complex and so easily misunderstood that it could only <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> devout students (mostly males) only after age 40. Therefore, some traditionalists had seen the Kabbalah Centre as a perversion of Judaism's ancient and secretive mystic tradition.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that elementary algebra should <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> students as young as eleven years old, though in recent years it is more common for public lessons to begin at the eighth grade level (≈13y.o.±) in the United States. However, in some US schools, algebra is started in ninth grade.|$|E

25|$|Where the {{sequencing}} {{of subject matter}} is concerned, it is the constructivist viewpoint that the foundations of any subject may <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> anybody at any stage in some form (Duffy and Jonassen 1992). This means that instructors should first introduce the basic ideas that give life and form to any topic or subject area, and then revisit and build upon these repeatedly. This notion has been extensively used in curricula.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, {{he took a}} job as {{a teacher}} in Oconto, Wisconsin. There, he {{continued}} to read voraciously, and had a particular attraction for science. It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if people could <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> think with the reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in the world could be alleviated.|$|E
50|$|The school offers {{physical}} education and cultural education apart from the curriculum education. Students <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> play instruments such as mirudangam, flute, tabla, violin and harmonium. Bharathanatyam and silambam <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> boys and girls.

25|$|When the Air Corps {{began to}} lay its plans for {{expansion}} {{in the fall of}} 1938, one of its major tasks was the provision of facilities for the additional thousands of men to be trained in (1) basic military courtesies, customs and traditions, to include classification of personnel for advanced training. (2) Flying and flight crew operations of military aircraft, and (3) the technical training necessary for the even larger numbers of men to <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> service and maintain aircraft and aircraft equipment.|$|E
25|$|The Train grew to 115 men by 12 March and was encamped on Kings Domain, Melbourne. Bracegirdle and Bond {{had also}} {{discovered}} that no one left in Australian in either the Army or the Navy had any useful knowledge {{on the subject of}} bridging trains, they would have to wait for their pontoons and vehicles to be built – meaning a wait of at least six weeks before {{they would be able to}} begin training, and that almost all of their unit would need to <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> ride, on very few horses.|$|E
25|$|In Korea and Japan, phonetic {{systems were}} {{developed}} so that Chinese characters could <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the general public. Vietnam's educated class {{looked down on}} Nom as inferior to Han, so they {{were not interested in}} doing the work required to turn Nom into a form of writing suitable for mass communication. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language and has nearly 5,000 distinct syllables. Neither the Korean nor the Japanese writing systems indicate tones, so they cannot be accurately applied to the Vietnamese language without significant modifications to their systems.|$|E
50|$|The oral {{tradition}} is not dead. In schools {{or at home}} or in the street, where children <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> learn by heart, to memorize, nursery rhymes or poems or songs, then they can be said to participate in the {{oral tradition}}. The same is often true of the children belonging to religious groups who <b>are</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> learn to say their prayers. In other words, childhood is one of the ages of man (in Shakespeare's sense) and is essentially an oral tribal culture. The transition from this oral culture takes place when the child <b>is</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> read and write. Then the child enters the world of the manuscript culture.|$|R

5000|$|An Indian {{commentary}} on the Mahāyānasaṃgraha, entitled Vivṛtaguhyārthapiṇḍavyākhyā, gives a classification of teachings according to {{the capabilities of the}} audience: According to disciples' grades, the Dharma is as inferior and superior. For example, the inferior <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the merchants Trapuṣa and Ballika because they were ordinary men; the middle <b>was</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> the group of five because they were at the stage of saints; the eightfold Prajñāpāramitās <b>were</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> bodhisattvas, and Prajñāpāramitās are superior in eliminating conceptually imagined forms. The eightfold Prajñāpāramitās are the teachings of the Prajñāpāramitā as follows: the Triśatikā, Pañcaśatikā, Saptaśatikā, Sārdhadvisāhasrikā, Aṣṭasāhasrikā, Aṣṭadaśasāhasrikā, Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā, and Śatasāhasrikā.|$|R
25|$|Specially bred rats {{have been}} kept as pets {{at least since the}} late 19th century. Pet rats are {{typically}} variants of the species brown rat, but black rats and giant pouched rats are also known to be kept. Pet rats behave differently from their wild counterparts depending on how many generations they {{have been kept}} as pets. Pet rats do not pose any more of a health risk than pets such as cats or dogs. Tamed rats are generally friendly and can <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> perform selected behaviors.|$|E
25|$|In Britain, but {{especially}} London, during the 1970s and the 1980s {{the teaching and}} playing of cricket was dying in schools funded by the state, for many complex reasons and by 1990 only 20 {{out of more than}} 800 such schools in London were playing the game. The teaching of cricket has declined throughout England in recent years, but the issue is compounded in London as there are few local teams with their own grounds on which children can <b>be</b> <b>taught.</b> <b>To</b> counter this lack of interest, CKC was set up by two Yorkshiremen William Greaves and Hayden Turner, who have a passion for cricket, and were concerned at its decline.|$|E
25|$|Baxter {{is a new}} robot {{introduced}} in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding {{in order to be}} used. This means Baxter needs no programming in order to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> <b>to</b> perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.|$|E
