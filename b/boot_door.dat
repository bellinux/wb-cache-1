50|$|The {{lines of}} the car had been improved, the floor-level lowered and the body's extra length and width gave more head, leg and elbow room for driver and passengers. It was now easier {{to get into the}} back seat and all four seats had been {{redesigned}} to give better support. The spare wheel was moved outside the car and enclosed in a metal cover. Two handles were now provided to the <b>boot</b> <b>door,</b> one with a lock.|$|E
5000|$|At around 7.30 am, the {{two police}} {{officers}} and Aimé Perrin arrived at the crime scene, which had already been contaminated multiple times. According to Perrin, Gustave {{arrived on the scene}} on foot and not on his bicycle: he came up behind the police officers, who had just found Lady Anne Drummond’s body. The officers found a 4 cm² shred of skin from a human hand hooked on the car’s rear bumper. This evidence was passed to police chief Edmond Sébeille as soon as he arrived on the scene. The car's front doors had been closed, while the double <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> had been pushed in, with the key left in the lock on the outside, dismissing the theory that Elizabeth Drummond had locked herself in the car from the inside. 6.4 metres behind the rear of the car was a drainage sump. Behind the sump, the police officers noticed a large pool of blood covering about 1 square metre. The blood was never tested, and it was never established whose blood this was. The police found two cartridge cases and two full cartridges, lying in pairs (one cartridge case and one intact cartridge). One pair was found 3 metres behind the car, while the other was found 5 metres perpendicular to the front-left of the car and 1.5 metres away from Lady Anne's body. The two pairs of cartridges/cases were approximately 9 metres away from each other. The cartridge cases were marked [...] "LC4", and were different from the full cartridges, which bore the mark [...] "WCC 43" [...] and [...] "WCC 44". Gustave drew the police officers' attention to the body of Sir Jack Drummond {{on the other side of}} the road, and pointed them to where Elizabeth Drummond's body lay on the riverbank. The two officers discovered shoe prints from crepe shoes. It appeared that the wearer of these shoes had walked away from Elizabeth's body and back again several times. These shoe prints were protected by placing twigs around them and were photographed.|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{focuses on}} an analysis, a model {{creation}} and simulations {{of a car}} <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> mechanism. The problem was analyzed {{on the basis of}} real measurements made on three different vehicles. Based on the measurements, computational models describing the real system at different levels of complexity were created. Matlab/Simulink was used to create and calculate the models. The output of the thesis is the simulator of a car <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> which also includes simplified model of a control unit. The simulator should provide an approximation of current and kinematic quantities of these mechanisms. The model is implemented on dSPACE platform that allows real-time simulations. The simulator can be modified in terms of changing the parameters of the mechanism and modifying some of its results...|$|E
5000|$|The Exeo is a D-segment model, {{which is}} built on the Volkswagen Group B7 (PL46) platform.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. There is a growing population of older {{people around the world}} and the population of older drivers is increasing in parallel. UK government figures in 2012 reported that there were more than 15 million people with a driving license aged over 60; more than 1 million of these were over 80. The aim of this thesis is to determine the requirements of older users for an improved driving experience leading to recommendations for the automotive industry. Initially it was necessary to understand some of the key issues concerning the driving experiences of older drivers; therefore a questionnaire survey of drivers of all ages (n= 903) was conducted supplemented by interviews with drivers aged ≥ 65 years (n= 15). Areas covered included: musculoskeletal symptoms, the vehicle seat, driving performance and driving behaviour. Respondents reported that they were dissatisfied with adjusting specific seat features, for example the head rest height and distance from the head; females reported more difficulty than males. Reaching and pulling the <b>boot</b> <b>door</b> down to close was difficult for 12...|$|E

60|$|A {{particularly}} aggressive squeak detached {{itself from}} the others and sounded on the stairs. The resemblance to the noise made by new boots was stronger than ever. It was new <b>boots.</b> The <b>door</b> opened, and Mr. Vickers, {{with a slice of}} bread arrested half-way to his mouth, sat gazing in astonishment at Charles Vickers, clad {{for the first time in}} his life in new raiment from top to toe. Ere he could voice inquiries, an avalanche of squeaks descended the stairs, and the rest of the children, all smartly clad, with Selina bringing up the rear, burst into the room.|$|R

In the black stove the ash lay dead; on the range were chips of wood, and newspapers, and rubbish of papers, and crusts of bread, and crusts of bread-and-jam. As Siegmund walked across the floor, he crushed two sweets underfoot. He had to grope under sofa and dresser to find his slippers; {{and he was in}} evening dress.|$|R
50|$|Subsequent to {{the launch}} of the Mazda MX-5 in 1989, MG (then owned by Rover Group) {{produced}} new body panels for the standard MGB body shell in 1992 to create an updated MGB model. The suspension was only slightly updated, sharing the leaf spring rear of the MGB. The <b>boot</b> lid and <b>doors</b> were shared with the original car, as were the rear drum brakes. The engine was the 3.9-litre version of the aluminium Rover V8, similar to the one previously used in the MGB GT V8. A limited-slip differential was also fitted.|$|R

The Gordini-developed engine had two twin-choke Webers, a hot cam, an 11.5 compression ratio, big valves and tuned extractor exhaust system. The body was very light, featured fibreglass <b>doors,</b> <b>boot</b> and bonnet panels, plus plastic windows and a stripped interior. The factory said the car's weight was lowered by more than 25 percent.|$|R
60|$|A great {{tramping}} of <b>boots,</b> slamming of <b>doors,</b> {{and shouting}} of voices followed {{the departure of}} the boys, as well as a crash, a howl, and then a roar of laughter, as Bob fell down the cellar stairs, having opened the door in search of food and poked his nose in too far. Presently they came back, very dusty, cobwebby, and cold, but triumphantly bearing a droll collection of trophies. Mark had a piece of board and the lantern, Tony a big wooden box and a tin pail, Bob fondly embraced a pickle jar and a tumbler of jelly which had been forgotten on a high shelf in the storeroom.|$|R
60|$|She made a {{movement}} {{as though to}} close the door. It is possible that Deane would have taken the hint and departed, but for that last searching look which he threw at her. He thrust his <b>boot</b> against the <b>door,</b> and resumed his place {{on the inner side}} of the threshold. From there he looked at her once more. He was right. There were traces of powder on her cheeks, and her eyebrows were certainly not natural. Underneath her trim black skirt he had caught a glimpse of brown open-worked stockings, and tan shoes with a large bow and high heels. Instinctively he felt that no ordinary servant would have been allowed to go about like this.|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} applies a sheet (1) to a surface (13), e. g. the painted {{surface of a}} car. The sheet is {{supplied}} from a roll (2), from which it is pulled off. It is laid on to the surface, being cut out before, during or after placing, such that {{the edge of the}} surface slightly projects beyond the edge of the cut sheet. The residue (11) is taken away, before, during or after placing, in an automatic process. Also claimed is the corresponding equipment, to carry out the proposed procedure. USE - Used to apply a sheet to a surface, especially a painted vehicular surface, for protection, replacing earlier methods of e. g. wax protection. ADVANTAGE - This process may be fully automated and the protected surface is formed easily and at small cost, and subsequently there is no difficulty in handling since there are no projecting sheet edges to cause problems. Applied to bonnet, <b>boot</b> and <b>doors,</b> all these can be opened afterwards without hindrance, allowing checking, and if necessary, rectification. The sheet is applied in such a manner that the paintwork, which may yet require full hardening, is not marked or damaged...|$|R

Engine finished like a show piece. There are electric lights in the quarters with two switches, louvres over the four-door windows, twin wind-tone horns, a lockable cupboard, two wipers, winding screen, and sliding roof. The Times' Motoring Correspondent continued [...] "the boot is not very large and the door does not fold down to the same level. Entrance and leg room behind are but fair, and the back seat is rather upright. On the other hand, the wheelbase of the Fifteen is not long and this body is of the sports type. There is enough head clearance and the floors are flat and unobstructed. The spare easy-clean wheel is in its own compartment. The seating is luxurious." ...|$|R
