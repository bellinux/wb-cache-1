40|$|This is a retrospective, {{descriptive}} study done on 65 patients at specialized cardiac center at Ahmed Gasim hospital Kh, North. All patients who underwent {{surgery in the}} period between 1998 - 2001. Joined the study. The study is to evaluate the surgical outcome & early complications. There were 23 (46. 6 %) males and 32 (58. 4 %) females. Patients below the age of 10 years represent 23. 07 % while those between the age group 11 - 30 represent 70. 7 %. Female patients were found to predominate on male patients in certain cardiac defects such as patent ductus arteriosus, atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect, while males predominate in Fallot’s tetralogy and congenital aortic stenosis. The majority of patients found to belong to tribes {{in the north and}} middle Sudan. Complete absence of patients from southern tribes was noted in this study. In this study the commonest cardiac defects who were operated upon are patent ductus arteriosus (18 patients), 6 atrial septal defect (16 patients), Fallot’s tetralogy (9 patients). Most of the patients (67. 6 %) were diagnosed by consultants, (21. 3 %) by medical registrar and (10. 2 %) <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistant.</b> The clinical presentation was characterized by dyspnoea (84. 6 %), palpitation (53. 8 %), fatigue (38. 4 %), cough (23. 07 %) and cyanosis (15. 3 %). The postoperative complications were reported in seven patients. They included wound infection (n = 2), aortic aneurysm (n = 1) and heart failure (n = 2). Three patients died (mortality of 4. 6 %). This study showed that the outcome of surgery in treating congenital cardiac defects is good, despite the late presentation of the patients and the short experience of the staff in a recently established center. Further studies are recommended to delineate the relationship between sex and occurrence of certain cardiac defects.

40|$|Background : Eclamptic {{convulsion}} is a live threatening condition {{associated with}} high maternal and perinatal mortality. It remains {{a major cause of}} maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Methods: This is a prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional hospital based study, concerned with the management of eclampsia in Khartoum teaching hospital, Khartoum north teaching hospital and Omdurman maternity hospital during the period from November 2002 to March 2003. The study was carried out to analyze the protocol for management of eclampsia in these hospitals. It includes fifty cases who presented with eclampsia, details of management were studied using questionnaire. Results: The incidence of eclampsia was 8. 8 / 1000 total births, and the maternal mortality was 18 %. The cause was cerebral heamorrhage in 10 % of cases. General life saving measures (O 2 therapy, airway, oral suction and input output chart) were taken by some but not all doctors. The anticonvulsant drug used was diazepam in (72 %), Mgso 4 in (14 %) of cases. The doses were not standardized. The frequency of recurrence of convulsions was 84 % and the mean time taken for control of convulsions was 18 hrs. The anti-hypertensive drug used was nifedipine in (42 %) and dihydralazine in (20 %) of cases. The doses were also different from patient to patient and the control of blood pressure was poor (40 % at 2 hrs – 54 % at 6 hrs – 76 % at 24 hrs of delivery). Rate of caesarean section was 72 % and mean time interval for delivery was 3. 5 hrs. General anesthesia was used in (81 %) of cases of abdominal delivery. It was given in all cases <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistant.</b> Prolonged impairment of consciousness was noted. Glasgow coma < 8 was noticed in 74 % of cases at 24 hours - and in 48 % of case at 48 hours after delivery. It was significantly related to the use of diazepam. Conclusion: It is shown from the study that a definite protocol is lacking in these hospitals. The study recommended that a strict protocol for management of eclampsia to be established and the drugs and equipments needed to be made available, with continuous revision of the protocol and its out come...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess {{the status of the}} present dental and oral health {{services}} at Gezira Province. The facilities included those in urban and rural areas including Wad Medani Dental Hospital, Wad Medani Military Hospital, El Gadaiea Health Centre and Marinjan Health Centre. The study tools were direct pre-coded questionnaires, and a checklist. The procedure involved dental clinical examinations to estimate the dental health services assessed by measuring, the decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) index and status of personnel, equipment and materials. The study sample was randomly selected at 10 % of patients attended Wad Medani Dental and Military Dental Hospitals for a week time period (6 days). All patients attended El Gadaiea and Marinjan Health Centres (n = 201) and sampled patients at rural health institutions during the same period were recruited (n = 448). A checklist was used {{to assess the}} personnel, equipment and instruments. The Gezira province in central Sudan is 6000 km in area with an estimated population of 1, 757, 265. It comprises 658 towns, villages and camps. The total number of dentists in the Gezira State was 26, of those 14 were working in the province. With a dentists population ratio of 1 : 130, 000. Thirty study sites in the rural area were chosen from five study councils included Alhosh, Wad Alnaeem, Alhag Abdalla, Almadina Arab and Hantoub. They comprise 418 towns, villages and camps, of these 5 only 118 with health services. In these there are only 4 dental units, three of them were incomplete, all of them were operated by dental assistants, while the only complete unit was operated <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistant.</b> This result revealed absolute lack of dental services in rural areas. The present units are old and most of them were not functioning. This was the reason that most of rural population seek oral health services for periodontal diseases and dental caries in Wad Medani health institutions. Most of patients irrespective of their residence, preferred treatment at private dental clinics because they expect better care due to good facilities. The results also revealed a poor level of oral health services reflected by the presence of a high level of decayed and missing component of DMFT. The missing teeth were mainly due to increased extraction of dental caries and periodontal diseases. The mean DMFT index was estimated 6. 2 in urban population and 6. 7 in rural population, statistically significant. This DMFT score exceeds the WHO stated DMFT score to achieve the goals for standard oral health. This study showed a high DMFT score in Gezira Province both in rural and urban areas and this was similar to a previous study in a former central state included Gezira Province which indicated high prevalence of dental caries, periodontal diseases and poor oral health services...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{neonatal}} {{health is}} {{a major contributor to}} mortality in under-five children in developing countries, accounting for more than two thirds of all deaths {{in the first year of}} life, and for about half of all deaths in children under-five. A major constraint to effective neonatal survival programmes in developing countries, such as Bangladesh, has been the lack of accurate epidemiological data on neonatal deaths. The current study aimed to (1) describe the causes of neonatal death in a rural subdistrict of Bangladesh; (2) describe associated birth and obstetric characteristics of neonatal deaths; (3) describe the patterns of care-seeking practices during the fatal neonatal illness episode; (4) compare deaths and care-seeking patterns between the Maternal and Child Health and Family Planning (MCH-FP) service area of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) and the adjoining government service area; (5) identify the predictors of neonatal deaths; and (6) assess the accuracy in assigning causes of death from verbal autopsy data by comparing physician review with medical assistant review and computer-based algorithm. This study was carried out during 2003 and 2004 in a demographic surveillance area in the Matlab rural sub-district of eastern Bangladesh. The surveillance system covers a population of ~ 220, 000 and is maintained by ICDDR,B. Community health workers (CHRW) visit each household monthly to record vital demographic, morbidity and health care seeking data. Half of the surveillance population receives MCH-FP services from ICDRR,B (ICDDR,B service area) and the remaining half receives standard government services (government service area). Verbal autopsies, consisting of retrospective interviews with caregivers of recently deceased neonates about the circumstances leading to their death, were carried out by the staff trained in verbal autopsy. The interviews were held with the mothers of all deceased neonates (n= 365) who had died during 2003 and 2004. The verbal autopsy data were then independently reviewed by three physicians and a medical assistant to assign a direct cause of death and an originating cause of death. A computer algorithm using evidence-based clinical signs and/or symptoms was also used for assigning cause of death. Agreement of at least two of the three physicians was used to determine direct causes of death. Diagnostic accuracy and reliability of medical assistant and algorithm in assigning direct cause of death were evaluated by comparing with the diagnoses provided by the physicians. Linked epidemiological data on all live births in the Matlab area during 2003 and 2004 were also analysed. There were 365 deaths among the 11, 291 live births recorded during 2003 and 2004, yielding a neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 32. 3 per 1000 live births. The NMR was lower in the ICDDR,B area compared to the government area. Of all neonatal deaths, 37 % occurred within 24 hours, 76 % within three days, 84 % within seven days, and the remaining 16 % between eight and 28 days of birth. Five causes accounted for 85 % of the deaths: birth asphyxia (45 %), prematurity/low birth weight (LBW) (15 %), sepsis/meningitis (12 %), respiratory distress syndrome (7 %), and pneumonia (6 %). The majority of neonatal death cases were low birth weight (56 %) and singleton births (82 %). There were some differences in the distribution of causes of death between the ICDDR,B and government areas, the most notable being prematurity/LBW which was twice as common in the ICDDR,B area than in government area. Strikingly, more than a third (37 %) of the deceased neonates had not been taken to any source of health care for the fatal illness episode, and another quarter (25 %) sought care from traditional healers or from unqualified practitioners. Only 37 % sought modern biomedical care from a doctor or paramedic. Among the 365 neonatal deaths, a much higher proportion (48. 5 %) of the deliveries occurred at a health facility in the ICDDR,B area, compared to 15. 3 % in the government area. Vaginal delivery was the commonest mode of delivery in both areas, with a higher proportion of caesarean sections in the ICDDR,B area (9. 3 %) compared with the comparison government area (1. 6 %). The verbal autopsy method appears to be highly effective in that agreement on a direct cause of death was reached by at least two physicians in 339 (93 %) cases. Using the physician review as the gold standard, the medical assistant review of causes of death demonstrated a sensitivity ranging from 47. 7 % to 83. 5 % depending on the cause of death, a specificity ranging from 93. 0 % to 97. 5 %, and kappa values ranging from 0. 51 to 0. 77. Similarly, depending on the cause of death, algorithm demonstrated a sensitivity ranging from 35. 6 % to 77. 4 %, specificity ranging from 86. 8 % to 95. 9 %, and kappa values ranging from 0. 24 to 0. 69. Independent predictors of neonatal mortality included lack of maternal education, single parity, and lack of antenatal care (ANC) during the last trimester. Male sex of the neonate, multiple births, and facility-based delivery were also significantly associated with excess neonatal mortality. In conclusion, the study highlighted the central role of birth asphyxia, prematurity/LBW, and sepsis/meningitis in neonatal deaths, indicating that the core of interventional packages to prevent neonatal deaths in rural Bangladesh should incorporate these causes. Community awareness about early care seeking, skilled attendance at delivery, and training and integration into mainstream services of traditional/unqualified care practitioners are some of the approaches needed to reduce neonatal mortality further. Improving access to female education and antenatal care would also have beneficial effects on neonatal survival. This study revealed the value of both review <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistant</b> and computerbasedalgorithm to reliably assign major causes of neonatal deaths from verbalautopsy data. Further research could be undertaken to develop optimal combinationsof the medical assistant and hierarchical algorithm for assigning major causes ofdeath in low-resource settings such as Matlab...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{multiple}} chronic conditions {{are at high}} risk for potentially avoidable hospitalizations, which may be reduced by care coordination and self-management support. <b>Medical</b> <b>assistants</b> are an increasingly available resource for patient care in primary care practices. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether protocol-based care management delivered <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistants</b> improves care in patients at high risk for future hospitalization in primary care. DESIGN: Two-year cluster randomized clinical trial. (Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN 56104508). SETTING: 115 primary care practices in Germany. PATIENTS: 2076 patients with type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic heart failure and a likelihood of hospitalization in the upper quartile of the population, as predicted by an analysis of insurance data. INTERVENTION: Protocol-based care management, including structured assessment, action planning, and monitoring delivered <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistants,</b> compared with usual care. MEASUREMENTS: All-cause hospitalizations at 12 months (primary outcome) and quality-of-life scores (12 -Item Short Form Health Survey [SF- 12] and EuroQol instrument [EQ- 5 D]). RESULTS: Included patients had an average of 4 co-occurring chronic conditions. All-cause hospitalizations did not differ between groups at 12 months (risk ratio [RR], 1. 01 [95 % CI, 0. 87 to 1. 18]) and 24 months (RR, 0. 98 [CI, 0. 85 to 1. 12]). Quality of life (differences, 1. 16 [CI, 0. 24 to 2. 08] on SF- 12 physical component and 1. 68 [CI, 0. 60 to 2. 77] on SF- 12 mental component) and general health (difference on EQ- 5 D, 0. 03 [CI, 0. 00 to 0. 05]) improved significantly at 24 months. Intervention costs totaled $ 10 per patient per month. LIMITATION: Small number of primary care practices and low intensity of intervention.

40|$|Many elderly {{adults in}} the United States suffer from {{cognitive}} issues that can range from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia. There often is a diagnostic delay before providers recognize these conditions, {{which can lead to}} affected patients and their families suffering adverse medical and social consequences. National advisory groups have offered conflicting viewpoints as to the benefits of employing a structured assessment to improve timely detection of cognitive impairment. The Mini-Cog™ screening test for cognitive impairment has been shown in studies to be easy to incorporate in the work flow of support staff in physician offices, and to be accurate for detection of problems with cognition in the elderly. Numerous studies have reported the ability of structured screening assessments to detect impairment at academic centers; the literature is not as robust on the topic of employing such assessments in large community-based practices. The results of a study of patients age 75 and above who presented for Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) at Premier Medical Associates (PMA) are reported.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{shift to}} test-based {{management}} of malaria represents an important departure from established practice under the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI). The possibility of false results of tests for malaria and co-morbidity, however, make it important that guidelines in IMCI case assessment are still followed. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study to evaluate current practices in IMCI-based assessment of febrile children in 10 health centres and 5 district hospitals, with follow up of {{a subset of}} children to determine day 7 - 10 post-treatment clinical outcome. Clinical consultation, examination and prescribing practices were recorded using a checklist by trained non-medical observers. The facility case management of 1, 983 under-five years old febrile children was observed and 593 followed up at home on days 5 - 10. The mean number of tasks performed from the 11 tasks expected {{to be done by}} the IMCI guidelines was 6 (SD 1. 6). More than 6 tasks were performed in only 35 % of children and this varied substantially between health facilities (range 3 - 85 %). All 11 tasks were performed in only 1 % of children. The most commonly performed tasks were temperature measurement (91 %) and weighing (88 %). Respiratory rate was checked in only 4 % of children presenting with cough or difficulty in breathing. The likelihood of performing "better than average number of tasks" (> 6) was higher when the consultation was done <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistants</b> than doctors (O. R.  =  3. 16, 1. 02 - 9. 20). The number of tasks performed during assessment did not, however, influence clinical outcome (O. R.  =  1. 02, 0. 83 - 1. 24). CONCLUSION: Facility-tailored interventions are needed to improve adherence to IMCI guidelines incorporating test-based management of malaria. Studies are needed to re-evaluate the continued validity of tasks defined in IMCI case assessment guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background: Randomized {{efficacy}} {{clinical trials}} conducted in research settings may not accurately reflect {{the benefits of}} tobacco dependence treatments when used in real-world clinical settings. Effectiveness trials (eg, in primary care settings) are needed to estimate the benefits of cessation treatments in real-world use. Methods: A total of 1346 primary care patients attending routine appointments were recruited <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> <b>assistants</b> in 12 primary care clinics. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} 5 active pharmacotherapies: 3 monotherapies (nicotine patch, nicotine lozenge, and bupropion hydrochloride sustained release [SR]) and 2 combination therapies (patch + lozenge and bupropion SR + lozenge). Patients were referred to a telephone quit line for cessation counseling. Primary outcomes included 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 1 week, 8 weeks, and 6 months after quitting and number of days to relapse. Results: Among 7128 eligible smokers (10 cigarettes per day) attending routine primary care appointments, 1346 (18. 9 %) were enrolled in the study. Six-month abstinence rates for the 5 active pharmacotherapies were the following: bupropion SR, 16. 8 %; lozenge, 19. 9 %; patch, 17. 7 %; patch + lozenge, 26. 9 %; and bupropion SR + lozenge, 29. 9 %. Bupropion SR + lozenge was superior to all of the monotherapies (odds ratio, 0. 46 - 0. 56); patch + lozenge was superior to patch and bupropion monotherapies (odds ratio, 0. 56 and 0. 54, respectively). Conclusions: One in 5 smokers attending a routine primary care appointment was willing to make a serious quit attempt that included evidence-based counseling and medication. In this comparative effectiveness study of 5 tobacco dependence treatments, combination pharmacotherapy significantly increased abstinence compared with monotherapies.

40|$|Introduction and aims: It is {{necessary}} to ascertain current prescribing of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) to address potential overuse. A retrospective analysis was conducted of all prescriptions for URTIs among ten public primary healthcare centres in Kedah, Malaysia from 1 st January to 31 st March 2014. Results: A total of 123, 524 prescriptions were screened and analysed. Of these, 7129 prescriptions were for URTI, with 31. 8 % (n= 2269) containing antibiotics. Macrolides were the most commonly prescribed antibiotic constituting 61 % (n= 1403) of total antibiotics prescribed. There was a statistically significant association between different prescribers and diagnoses (p= 0 • 001) and a weak positive trend suggesting family medicine specialists are more competent in antibiotic prescribing, followed <b>by</b> <b>medical</b> officers and <b>assistant</b> <b>medical</b> officers (τ= 0 • 122) [...] Conclusions: Prescribing practices of some prescribers were inconsistent with current guidelines encouraging resistance development. National antimicrobial stewardship programmes and further educational initiatives are ongoing in Malaysia to improve antibiotic us...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to improve the rate of {{colposcopy}} in an urban population of patients with known abnormal Pap smears within 3 months of implementation {{in order to identify}} and treat lesions that could progress to cervical cancer. Using a modified PDSA approach and leveraging the functionality of the electronic health record, our working group of patients and representatives from our outpatient office first created a protocol that was implemented <b>by</b> the <b>medical</b> <b>assistants</b> to assure that all Pap smears were verified by the providers. We then created a process by which the providers worked with a nurse-triage team to contact patients with abnormal Pap smears to educate them about their disease and facilitate their colposcopy appointment. The results of the implemented plan demonstrated that 100 % of Pap smears were verified by the provider compared to 95 % prior to plan implementation. The percent of patients having colposcopy performed after plan implementation was 85 % compared to 50 % prior to plan implementation, a 70 % improvement. If patients who did not have colposcopy performed due to medical indications (i. e. pregnancy) were excluded from the analysis, the percent having colposcopy rose to 91 %, an 82 % improvement from pre-project levels. The mean time from Pap to colposcopy was 38. 5 days, which was below the target benchmark of 75 days. This project improved patient satisfaction and did not increase the workload of the <b>medical</b> <b>assistants</b> or the providers. By using a modified PDSA approach and leveraging the functionality of the EMR, we improved the rate of colposcopy by 70 % within three months of plan implementation and also improved patient and provider satisfaction.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{students}} {{who want to}} become a medical specialist have to enrol in a training program which is in limited supply. During the search for a position as trainee (or "junior medical specialist"), they may accept a temporary job as a <b>medical</b> <b>assistant.</b> We use a micro data set to investigate whether such work experience increases the probability of becoming junior medical specialist. To deal with selectivity, we simultaneously model the transitions from unemployment to trainee, from unemployment to <b>medical</b> <b>assistant,</b> from <b>medical</b> <b>assistant</b> to trainee and from <b>medical</b> <b>assistant</b> to unemployment. We find that a job as <b>medical</b> <b>assistant</b> helps to become a medical specialist. © Springer-Verlag 2002...|$|R
