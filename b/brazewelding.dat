40|$|The {{stability}} and corrosion resistance of thorium exposed to eutectic NaK were investigated. Satisfactory results on thorium tube or rod fabrication {{by means of}} extrusion were obtained. Rolling and swaging thorium presented no difficulty but drawing proved unsuccessful. Strainhardening values of iodide thorium were {{about half of those}} of Ames thorium. The fubrication of unanium tubing by extrusion was successful in the alpha but not in the gamma nange. By increasing the extrusion ratio, an increaae in the strength of the STA 410 ! fiber texiure with respect to that of the STA 010 ! component and an increase in sharpness of both resulted. Static corrosion tests using a two-component system was initiated. The characteristics of a plate which is to be fabricated into a fuel element tube were determined and methods for fabrication of such a plate are discussed. (See also ORNL- 910 (Del).) (C. J. G.) Preliminary investigations on SAP (sintered aluminum powder) alloys are reported. The mechanical properties of SAP at elevated temperatures are oniy slightly altered by prolonged heating. Its structaral stability is not effected by temperatures at 450 deg C and lower temperatures, blistering starts at 520 deg C and fissures appear in thin walled SAP 930 tubes at temperatures higher than 500 deg C. Thermal cyclings have no influence on the mechanical and structural stability of SAP 930 tabes. Vacuum tightness of SAP tabes can be maintained with temperatures up to 620 deg C. Pressure tightness for an internal pressure of 4 atm of helium is kept at 450 deg C. Thin-walled tubes with twisted fins are made of 8 AP 930. Joining of SAP parts by flash and by <b>brazewelding</b> is satisfactory. End closures of the tabes are vacuum tight and show a mechanical strength equal to that of the parent material. SAP shows good corrosion resistance to polyphenyls at 400 deg C. There is no reaction between SAP and UO/sub 2 / after heating at 550 deg C for 56 days. Read and SAP are highly compatible. Neutron irradiation of SAP raises the mechainical strength and lowers the elongation in the material, but the differences between unirradiated and irradiated properties {{do not appear to be}} important.

30|$|Orthodontic bands (LEONE MOD. E 8305 no. 14) {{were then}} fitted {{to the first}} molars of each model, and the test screw <b>brazewelded</b> on the bands. The RPE {{constructed}} for the four-arm screw featured palatal supports, and no bands on the premolars. The two-arm RPEs were welded to the first molars and featured no palatal supports. The constructed RPEs were bonded to the metal teeth using composite cement (ULTRA BAND-LOCK, Reliance, USA) and light-cured using an LED curing light (Elipar Freelight 2, 3 M Espe, wavelength 430 [*]÷[*] 480  nm, intensity 1200  mW/mm 2) for 30  s from the occlusal surface, the most effective method of bonding bands {{with this type of}} bonding agent [29].|$|R
