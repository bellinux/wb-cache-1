He {{made no attempt}} to notate what he heard, but absorbed it and let it find its way later into his own music. On Gravity Frith mixed up all these different musical styles to make new songs out of them.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|Yamaguchi {{felt that}} the album's music focus was a {{way for them to}} explain their instincts, and what kind of a band they were. The band members {{primarily}} listened to minimalist techno and instrument-focused music during the recording sessions of Sakanaction, which strongly affected the sound of the album. In particular, Sakanaction had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> German DJ Stimming, UK house artist Miguel Campbell and American recording artist Toro y Moi. Yamaguchi noted that the other band members all listened to Akufen, and that bassist Ami Kusakari preferred goa trance.|$|E
25|$|The band {{have cited}} bands such as Fugazi, Polvo and Archers of Loaf as {{influences}} for the albums sessions, while Brian Lane proclaimed {{that the main}} influence for their progression towards the more aggressive and raw sound was coming off of tour and being bored of the songs {{that they had been}} playing. Accardi had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> albums such as Ten by Pearl Jam, Jar of Flies by Alice in Chains, and Purple and Core by Stone Temple Pilots. Garrett Tierney looked to emulate some of the bass guitar sounds found on the records of The Jesus Lizard and Hüsker Dü.|$|E

He and Sheppard went into the study after dinner to read it but Sir Roger {{had a change of}} mind and asked Sheppard to leave him alone to peruse its contents. Sheppard did so and found Parker just outside the door, as if he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> what was happening within...|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} day, on 15 August, the Japanese declared their {{acceptance of}} the Potsdam Declaration terms, and unconditionally surrendered to the Allies. On the afternoon of that day, Sukarno received this information from leaders of youth groups and members of PETA Chairul Saleh, Soekarni, and Wikana, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Western radio broadcasts. They urged Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence immediately, while the Japanese were in confusion and {{before the arrival of}} Allied forces. Faced with this quick turn of events, Sukarno procrastinated. He feared bloodbath due to hostile response from the Japanese to such a move, and was concerned with prospects of future Allied retribution.|$|E
25|$|The {{band had}} <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Martha Wainwright's Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole during the {{sessions}} and were fans of it. Towards {{the end of}} the recording sessions, Lightbody wrote a duet with her in mind, hoping to get her to sing it. She liked the song and agreed to record it. Eugene Kelly and a few members from The Reindeer Section also appear as choir in various songs throughout the album. Simpson credited Lee for being supportive of the band, {{and at the same time}} critical, when necessary. Each band member used to come to him for opinion on work they were doing. Morale during the sessions was high, with the band feeling a sense of togetherness seeing the hard work everyone was doing.|$|E

Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> music [...] But I had never heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team had}} <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> American hits and [...] "trying to measure up". They remixed American hip-hop and R songs, adding layers of melody {{to suit the}} European radio audience. In the wake of their early successes, the team had to choose whether to remain in Norway or move to pursue their goals: [...] "We knew that to make the records {{we really wanted to}} make, we had to go to America." [...] Hermansen and Eriksen chose to produce records in the United States, while Rustan {{preferred}} to remain a producer in Norway because {{he did not want to}} leave his family behind.|$|E

Written by Katy alongside Goldon Warren, who also produced it under the name Geeneus, the track was released as a standalone single via digital retailers on 8 July 2013 by Rinse and Columbia Records. It was composed after Katy had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> dance genres. The theme conveyed in the lyrics is love while musically, the song {{has been described as}} a [...] "trance-y" [...] and [...] "rave-y" [...] dance song with its production containing synthesizers and piano. Katy later decided to not include it in Little Red (2014).|$|E

500|$|Flo Rida {{explained}} that he listened to [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)" [...] and similar records growing up {{as a result of}} the varying music genres his seven sisters listened to. Ultimately, his A Aaron Bay-Schuck came up with the idea to sample [...] "You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)" [...] in a song. Bay-Schuck told HitQuarters that he had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a shuffle beat produced by DJ Frank E on a CD of potential beats and had kept hearing in his head the melody of the Dead or Alive song over the top of it. Co-A Mike Caren then brought the sample to the attention of Flo Rida.|$|E
500|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the phrase}} to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by Barry Gifford. In the May 11, 1968, issue of Rolling Stone, he wrote about the album A Long Time Comin' by U.S. band Electric Flag: [...] "Nobody who's <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> Mike Bloomfield—either talking or playing—in {{the last few years}} could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock." [...] In January 1970 Lucian K. Truscott IV reviewing Led Zeppelin II for the Village Voice described the sound as [...] "heavy" [...] and made comparisons with Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge.|$|E

In 1998, Smith contributed a cover of the Beatles song [...] "Because" [...] to the closing credits and soundtrack of the film American Beauty. Although {{this was the only}} Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least two others ("Revolution" [...] and [...] "I'll Be Back") and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts.|$|E

500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song's conclusion, but mistakenly forgot {{to do the same}} for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.|$|E
500|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{recording}} process, Dean had <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> country, drawing inspiration from 1960s guitarists like Jimmy Bryant, Speedy West, Hank Garland, Pete Drake, Hank Snow and Aerosmith's Brad Whitford. Songs like [...] "Hickory Dichotomy" [...] gave Weiland and Kretz a [...] "Down South" [...] and [...] "swampy kind of feeling". Although it was recorded in standard tuning, [...] "Hickory Dichotomy" [...] features a slide guitar solo performed in open G. Both [...] "Cinnamon" [...] and [...] "Maver" [...] were recorded with a Telecaster set up for Nashville tuning, and Dean described [...] "First Kiss on Mars" [...] as having a [...] "down-home country kind of feel", but noted Weiland's influence on the song: [...] "That title takes it to this whole other plateau." ...|$|E

Willkie kept the public pressure on: like most corporate executives, he had not spoken out against Roosevelt's New Deal policies, but in January stated in a radio debate that anti-utility policies were depressing share prices, making it hard to attract investment that would help America to recover. [...] "For several years now, we have <b>been</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> a bedtime story, telling us that the men who hold office in Washington are, by their very positions, endowed with a special virtue." [...] The Saturday Evening Post dubbed Willkie [...] "the man who talked back".|$|E
