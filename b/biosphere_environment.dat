Because of its proximity to Earth, the abundant evidence for water, and the implications that water has for the development and persistence of life, Mars is also the next likely target for human exploration and colonization. As such, it will also serve as an important test bed for the development of techniques for deep biosphere exploration and resource evaluation for other bodies in the solar system. If the early evolution of the Earth and Mars followed similar paths, then it’s possible that methanogenic bacteria may have developed in the planet’s early aqueous surface and near-surface environment (Max & Clifford, 2000).

However, destructive penetration to long-isolated bedrock environments during construction of underground waste repositories can lead to increased nutrient availability and potentially affect the long-term stability of the repository systems, Here, we studied how microorganisms present in fracture fluid from a depth of 500 m in Outokumpu, Finland, respond to simple carbon compounds (C- 1 compounds) in {{the presence or absence}} of sulphate as an electron acceptor.

Our results show that deep subsurface microbes exist in dormant states but rapidly reactivate their transcription and respiration systems in the presence of C- 1 substrates, particularly methane. Microbial activity was further enhanced by the addition of sulphate as an electron acceptor. Sulphate- and nitrate-reducing microbes were particularly responsive to the addition of C- 1 compounds and sulphate.

40|$|Landscapes {{are created}} by exogenic and endogenic {{processes}} acting along the interface between the lithosphere and the atmosphere and hydrosphere. Various landforms result from the attack of weathering and erosion upon the highly heterogeneous lithospheric surface. Landscapes are dynamic, acutely sensitive to natural and artificial perturbation. Undisturbed, they can evolve through a succession of stages to a plain of low relief. Often, the progression of an erosion cycle is interrupted by tectonic or environmental changes; thus, many landscapes preserve vestiges of earlier cycles useful in reconstructing {{the recent history of}} Earth's surface. Landforms are bounded by slopes, so their evolution is best understood through study of slopes and the complex of factors controlling slope character and development. The substrate, <b>biosphere,</b> climatic <b>environment,</b> and erosive processes are principal factors. Creep of the disintegrated substrate and surface wash by water are preeminent. Some slopes attain a quasisteady form and recede parallel to themselves (backwearing); others become ever gentler with time (downwearing). The lovely convex/rectilinear/concave profile of many debris-mantled slopes reflects an interplay between creep and surface wash. Landscapes of greatest scenic attraction are usually those in which one or two genetic factors have strongly dominated or those perturbed by special events.

In particular, fungi and bacteria (frequently associated with green algae, cyanobacteria, lichens, etc), wide-spread in <b>biosphere</b> <b>environments,</b> are the main biological systems related to deterioration of cultural asset. Moreover in the aerosol of indoor environments, whre the manufacts are exposed or stored, complex microbiai communities may release some molecules with human (visitors, professionals) health damaging properties, that may persist during the time. In order to identify the biological systems on artworks surface andJor dispersed in the aerosol, an integrated morphological-molecular protocol based on microscopy (OM, SEM, CLSM), in vitro culture (colonies isolation) and amplification of DNA target sequences (PCR, sequencing, sequence-comparison) have been applied. Non invasive samplings were performed by sterile swab, adhesive tape or Nylon H+ membrane (Amersham) on work of art surfaces, while aerosol sampling by portable AirPort MD 8 sampler (Sartorius), equipped with disposable gelatine filters. Recently, in our laboratory, new bioactive molecules (BMs) extracted from marine invertebrates organisms have been characterized and tested in order to remove protein layers (bio-c 1 eaning by Proteolytic-peptides = BMP) or to control the bacteria and/or fungi colonization onto artifacts (Antimicrobial-peptide = BMA). The action of c 1 eaning represents {{one of the most important}} step in restoration projects, such as take out organi c layers (animai glue or other protein mixtures, frequent 1 y deteriored) stratified onto the manufact surface. Cleaning must be selectively performed, making distinction between different areas, removing the deposits without acting direct 1 y to originaI materials ofthe manufact. Particularly interesting is that the Proteolytic-peptides (BMP) start to act from 4 °C up to 37 °C. We tested the BMP molecules on different substrates and temperatures, between 19 - 26 °C. The related commerciaI enzymes, actually used in bio-c 1 eaning procedures, work at specific range of temperature 37 °C; temperature value represents a limit in the use of these enzymes, since the heating of manufact surface is usually not available. The opportunity to apply BMP molecule on several substrates, both organic and inorganic (canvas, wooden, ceroplastics, mosaic, frescos), without heating (surface or enzyme solution), improve the efficiency of bio-c 1 eaning protocols, according to the conservative-restoration procedure.

The samples examined in this study are from sites APSK 08, 09 and 10 on the Suiyo seamount of the Izu-Bonin Arc in the Pacific Ocean. Based on the vertical distribution and stereochemistry of amino acids in this vigorous sub-vent environment, a model of deep sea subterranean chemistry and biology is proposed, describing optimal microbial activity rather than abiotically synthesized amino acids components. Total hydrolyzed amino acids in the hydrothermal sub-vent core samples are of the order of 101 – 102 nmol/g-rock.

Lateritic soils form through weathering and deliver abundant iron (oxy) hydroxides but very little sulfate {{to the lake}} and its sediment. To characterize the sediment biogeochemistry, we collected cores at three sites with increasing water depth and decreasing bottom water oxygen concentrations. Microbial cell densities were highest at the shallow site - a feature we attribute to the availability of labile organic matter and the higher abundance of electron acceptors due to oxic bottom water conditions. At the two other sites, OM degradation and reduction processes below the oxycline led to partial electron acceptor depletion. Genetic information preserved in the sediment as extracellular DNA provides information on aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs related to Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae, Chloroflexi and Thermoplasmatales. These taxa apparently {{played a significant role}} in the degradation of sinking organic matter. However, extracellular DNA concentrations rapidly decrease with core depth. Despite very low sulfate concentrations, sulfate-reducing bacteria were present and viable in sediments at all three sites, as confirmed by measurement of potential sulfate reduction rates. Microbial community fingerprinting supported the presence of taxa related to Deltaproteobacteria and Firmicutes with demonstrated capacity for iron and sulfate reduction. Concomitantly, sequences of Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Methanomicrobiales indicated potential for fermentative hydrogen and methane production. Such first insights into ferruginous sediments show that microbial populations perform successive metabolisms related to sulfur, iron and methane. In theory, iron reduction could reoxidize reduced sulfur compounds and desorb OM from iron minerals to allow remineralization to methane. Overall, we found that biogeochemical processes in the sediments can be linked to redox differences in the bottom waters of the three sites, like oxidant concentrations and the supply of labile OM.

One of the first ecologists whose writings survive may have been Aristotle or perhaps his student, Theophrastus, both of whom had interest in many species of animals and plants. Theophrastus described interrelationships between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC. Ecology developed substantially in the 18th and 19th century. It began with Carl Linnaeus and his work with the economy of nature. Soon after came Alexander von Humboldt and his work with botanical geography. Alfred Russel Wallace and Karl Möbius then contributed with the notion of biocoenosis. Eugenius Warming’s work with ecological plant geography led to the founding of ecology as a discipline. Charles Darwin’s work also contributed to the science of ecology, and Darwin is often attributed with progressing the discipline more than anyone else in its young history. Ecological thought expanded even more in the early 20th century. Major contributions included: Eduard Suess’ and Vladimir Vernadsky’s work with the biosphere, Arthur Tansley’s ecosystem, Charles Elton's Animal Ecology, and Henry Cowles ecological succession. Ecology influenced the social sciences and humanities. Human ecology began in the early 20th century and it recognized humans as an ecological factor. Later James Lovelock advanced views on earth as a macro-organism with the Gaia hypothesis. Conservation stemmed from the science of ecology. Important figures and movements include Shelford and the ESA, National Environmental Policy act, George Perkins Marsh, Theodore Roosevelt, Stephen A. Forbes, and post-Dust Bowl conservation. Later in the 20th century world governments collaborated on man’s effects on the <b>biosphere</b> and Earth’s <b>environment.</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{philosophical}} and methodological management aspects of the technosphere’s evolution. The foundations of the management concept of the technosphere’s evolution, consisting of two blocks were developed: 1) a conceptual model of the technosphere structure {{and the process of}} the technosphere’s evolution; 2) a conceptual model of the management system of the technosphere’s evolution. In the article the characteristics of the boundaries of the technosphere beyond the Earth are considered. The technosphere as a global system was formed during the 20 th century, its development continues in the unstable mode of the accelerating non-linear development and spatial expansion. In the technosphere there is no internal and external communication, including feedback, that is necessary for the balanced development. These are the main causes of the “uncontrollability” of the technosphere. The management system structure of the technosphere’s evolution and the strategy that is aimed to achieve three main goals were proposed: 1) saving the Earth’s biosphere; 2) security, survival and sustainable development of humankind in the balance (co-evolution) with the <b>biosphere</b> and the <b>environment</b> on the Earth and in the Solar system; 3) the creation of the conditions for disclosure {{and the use of the}} potential of technologies, equipment, technical development to manage the future, the implementation of the transition to the noosphere, the attainment of human immortality in the Universe. The three management scenarios, main features, and limitations were considered. A common approach to the management of the technosphere’s evolution: the system approach in the framework of the socio-techno-natural system, the paradigm of the balanced and sustainable development and managing the future. In order to manage the infrastructure, technologies and technological mode by the effects of the technosphere on the environment, new approaches, methods and technologies, including monitoring, automation, Big data for “external” control of the technosphere and the organization of its self-regulation, including through the Internet of things, technologies, impacts, environmental pollution, etc. are needed. It is proposed to establish an International Institute of the Technosphere...|$|R
40|$|Sediments {{from three}} {{sites in the}} Alboran Sea, Western Mediterranean were {{investigated}} {{for the presence of}} bacteria in deep sediments. A series of 54 x 1 -cm 3 sediment samples were removed from core sections of Hole 976 B between 26. 9 and 646. 6 mbsf (16 samples), Hole 977 A between 0 and 525. 8 mbsf (29 samples), and Hole 978 A between 346 and 644. 6 mbsf (9 samples) for direct microscopic determination of bacteria. Sites 977 and 978 were only 24 km apart,contained similar sedimentary sequences and interstitial water profiles and covered complimentary depth ranges to provide samples from the surface to 644 mbsf, hence these were treated as one site. Significant bacterial populations were present in the deepest samples of both sites 644 and 647 mbsf in site 977 / 978 and 976 respectively (3. 5 x 106 cells/cm 3 and 1. 62 x 106 respectively). These bacterial depth distributions correspond very well with previous data from Atlantic and Pacific Ocean sites, but they also extend considerably the previous deepest marine sediment samples that have been analysed for bacteria (514 mbsf) and extend the depth of the bacterial <b>biosphere</b> in this <b>environment.</b> As the rate of decrease in bacterial populations does not change even in these deep samples it is likely that bacteria are present even deeper than 650 mbsf in marine sediments. At site 977 / 978 a deep brine incursion supplies sulfate below 400 mbsf and absence of methane in this zone suggests active bacterial anaerobic methane oxidation. A similar brine incursion in the Peru Margin was shown to stimulate bacterial activity and increased bacterial viability at depths of 80 mbsf and approximately 1 mya. A similar effect may be occuring at site 977 / 978. This would explain why the bacterial profile does not decrease with depth in the deeper layers and demonstrates the viability of bacteia in ancient deposits (6 mya) ...|$|R
40|$|Consensus {{exists that}} further {{environmental}} pollution {{and climate change}} could be prevented if energy systems' emissions are significantly reduced. But energy will remain {{one of the most}} active driving forces of social and economic progress over the whole 21 st century. This predetermines the necessity and expediency for long-term energy studies. Global energy systems recently have started the transition path from systems based on fossil fuels, with limited and exhaustible resources, to systems using inexhaustible or renewable energy resources (fission and fusion, solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, etc.). It is difficult to foresee exactly how long this transition period will last, because the rates of transition will depend on many factors - of which the most important will be energy costs at the end-user and the systems' impacts on humans, <b>biosphere,</b> and natural <b>environment.</b> Two global energy scenarios (Dynamic-as-Usual and Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Conservation, with several options for each of the scenarios) until the middle of the next century are discussed in the paper. According to energy projections, energy demand in developed countries is likely to stay at the current level over the whole time period or may even slightly decline (it is quite possible that in some countries with very high per capita energy demand, the reduction of primary energy consumption will start even in the near future). The major part of the energy demand growth worldwide will be justified by the needs of developing countries to improve their economic and social position. It is expected that primary energy demand in developing countries will increase by a factor of 35 compared to today's level. The world primary energy mix will very much depend on development strategies applied over the next 5060 years. If a strategy for massive prevention of global warming is to be required, the share of fossil fuels in primary energy consumption must be remarkably reduced (even down to 25 % in case of a 60 % CO 2 emission reduction until the middle of the next century as stated by IPCC). Electricity keeps its position as a most universal energy carrier in all sectors of end-use, including transportation. Environmental protection goals can be achieved with the most effective and less expensive ways through applying electric technologies. Therefore, a strong growth rate for electricity generation is projected in both regions - developed and developing countries. Even if radical steps are taken to prevent the impact of energy systems on global climate, the CO 2 accumulation in the atmosphere will not be stopped. At the best, we can speak only of postponing the doubling of carbon concentration in the atmosphere for a couple of decades in the longer future. Parallel efforts within other spheres of the human activity are required: first of all, to stop deforestation of tropical forests, enhance reforestation, and reduce emissions of other greenhouse gases which in total contribute about 50 % to global warming. The transition to an accelerated CO 2 reduction policy will require about 45 % of the world GNP spent on investments within energy systems, which is not significantly higher than today. However, the structure of investments must be drastically changed from energy production to energy conservation and savings. Large concerns exist in finding capital to provide these investments in developing countries because it will be hardly possible for them to accomplish energy/climate programs without strong assistance from the developed world. It would be naive to think that a global energy and climate change policy could be introduced without massive obligatory measures at the national and global levels. These measures should include policy actions, marketing guidelines, educational programs, financial mechanisms, and technology transfer. The realization of such a policy will require the creation of new institutional frameworks, with concerted efforts of all players on the international and national energy markets. However, there are still many unsettled questions that remain in global warming and in looking for effective response strategies...|$|R
