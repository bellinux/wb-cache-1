5|$|At room temperature, {{fluorine}} is a gas of diatomic molecules, {{pale yellow}} when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20ppb. Fluorine condenses into a <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> liquid at −188°C (−306°F), a transition temperature {{similar to those}} of oxygen and nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|In 1770, Peter Simon Pallas {{visited the}} same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that had useful {{properties}} as a pigment in paints. The use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment then developed rapidly. A <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> pigment made from crocoite also became popular.|$|E
50|$|It has dark-streaked brown upperparts, and <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> underparts {{than the}} citril finch.|$|R

5|$|The {{white-eyes}} {{are small}} birds of rather drab appearance, the plumage above being typically greenish-olive, but some species have a white or <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> throat, breast or lower parts, and several have buff flanks. As the name suggests, many species have a white ring around each eyes.|$|E
5|$|The Oxford English Dictionary derives {{the word}} straightforwardly from Old English butorflēoge, butter-fly; similar names in Old Dutch and Old High German {{show that the}} name is ancient. A {{possible}} source of the name is the <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> male of the brimstone (Gonepteryx rhamni); another is that butterflies were on the wing in meadows during {{the spring and summer}} butter season while the grass was growing.|$|E
5|$|The flowers provide dyes of <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> or green, {{and have}} been used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle wicks, or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wingspan}} is 28-35 mm. Very like Eilema morosinum (Herrich-Schäffer, 1847) but the forewing not so elongate, and {{the angles}} not so accentuated, the costal streak broader and <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow,</b> the hindwing duller, not so transparent; {{the apex of}} the abdomen <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow.</b> On the underside the disc is very blackish iron grey, and contrasts vividly with the orange-yellow costa and the broad pale yellow marginal area. Hindwing beneath pale yellow, the costa deeper yellow; below costa a grey streak from the base.|$|R
50|$|It {{is smaller}} in size, with clearer plumage pattern: no {{scalloping}} on breast, underparts <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow,</b> underwing lighter. The {{base of the}} maxilla is dark.|$|R
50|$|The Salome <b>yellow</b> is <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow,</b> {{has more}} limited black on the upperside, and the {{underside}} of the hindwing has a round reddish spot near the trailing edge.|$|R
5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners were not aware they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and a more limited range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes are readily {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> stipe base, and reddish scabers on the stipe. Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow stipe base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E

5000|$|Boisduval's yellow {{is smaller}} and <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow,</b> the male has a weaker [...] "dog face" [...] pattern, the female has reduced black {{on the upper}} side, and the hindwing is less sharply pointed.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 42-43 mm. The forewings are overlaid {{with black}} markings on a yellowish background. There is one {{spot at the}} middle of the wing. The hindwings are <b>yellow,</b> but <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> at the base.|$|R
5|$|In {{a corner}} of our 60m3 room {{farthest}} away from the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E
5|$|The brightly {{coloured}} pile of the bumblebee is an aposematic (warning) signal, {{given that}} females can inflict a painful sting. Depending on the species and morph, the warning colours range from entirely black, to <b>bright</b> <b>yellow,</b> red, orange, white, and pink. Dipteran {{flies in the}} families Syrphidae (hoverflies), Asilidae (robber flies), Tabanidae (horseflies), Oestridae (bot or warble flies) and Bombyliidae (bee flies) all include Batesian mimics of bumblebees, resembling them closely enough to deceive at least some predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} at Braich y Pwll is {{the only}} known location on the British mainland of the spotted rock rose, which produces <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> petals that last only one day. The coast here has open grass heath land and mountain, giving way to rugged sea cliffs and coves. There is a profusion of wildlife, {{and it is an}} ideal vantage point to watch the spring and autumn bird migrations. Choughs, peregrine falcons, kestrels, puffins, stonechats, guillemots and Manx shearwaters can be seen, and dolphins, porpoises and seals can be spotted in the water.|$|E
50|$|Adult Ocypode brevicornis are a {{mottled yellow}} to brown in coloration. Males have been {{observed}} to display <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> colors, especially on their legs. Juveniles have almost perfect cryptic camouflage, making {{it very difficult to}} pick them out from their surroundings.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} pinnate, 40 - 70 cm long, with 11-17 leaflets, each leaflet 5 - 10 cm long and 3 - 5 cm broad. The whole leaf is downy-pubescent, and a {{somewhat}} <b>brighter,</b> <b>yellower</b> green {{than many other}} tree leaves.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-spotted honeyeater is olive-brown {{on the top}} and olive-gray on the bottom. However, {{there are}} <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> areas on the bird's head. The bird has brown legs, feet, eyes, and a brown beak. It is 16 to 20 cm in size.|$|R
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and swollen, moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), {{but it can be}} readily distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late winter to early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
50|$|Both sexes of this 51-56 cm length bird {{resemble}} a female mallard, {{but with a}} slightly darker body. The Mexican duck is mainly brown, with a blue speculum edged with white, obvious in flight or at rest. The male has a <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> bill than the female.|$|R
50|$|Wingspan {{of female}} is 38-46mm. Female much <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> with three lines to fore wing and two to hind wing {{replacing}} the bands and usually prominent. Head and body of larva are finely granulate. Body cylindrical, and pale greyish with black rims. The larvae feed on Gouania species.|$|R
5000|$|Yellow-bellied waxbill, yellow-bellied swee or East African swee (Coccopygia m. quartinia) of {{the east}} African {{mountains}} with subspecies Coccopygia melanotis quartinia, Coccopygia melanotis kilimensis and Coccopygia melanotis stuartirwini. Males of all three lack black on the face. C. m. quartinia has a much <b>brighter</b> <b>yellow</b> belly than nominate C. m. melanotis.|$|R
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground, in a mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|In {{hydrides}} and nitrides, protactinium {{has a low}} {{oxidation state}} of about +3. The hydride is obtained by direct action of hydrogen on the metal at 250°C, and the nitride {{is a product of}} ammonia and protactinium tetrachloride or pentachloride. This <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> solid is stable to heating to 800°C in vacuum. Protactinium carbide PaC is formed by reduction of protactinium tetrafluoride with barium in a carbon crucible at a temperature of about 1400°C. Protactinium forms borohydrides which include Pa(BH4)4. It has an unusual polymeric structure with helical chains where the protactinium atom has coordination number of 12 and is surrounded by six BH4− ions.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan's {{infestation}} by the Zerg {{signaled a}} major overhaul for her appearance. Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are <b>bright</b> <b>yellow</b> as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen using these wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E
50|$|The art {{director}} for the show was Sam Spratt, who created multiple paintings depicting Minhaj's life {{in the style of}} Norman Rockwell for posters and the website. The stage set contained <b>bright</b> <b>yellows</b> and oranges to reflect Indian culture. Minhaj also teamed up with Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson for the musical elements of the show.|$|R
