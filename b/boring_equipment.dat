5000|$|In 1896, {{an unknown}} group {{arrived on the}} island with steam pumps and <b>boring</b> <b>equipment.</b> Although the pumps were unable to keep {{water out of the}} flooded side shaft, borings were taken. It was claimed that one of these borings brought a tiny piece of alleged {{sheepskin}} parchment to the surface. The parchment had two letters in India Ink written on it which appeared to be [...] "vi" [...] or [...] "wi". The group attempted to block any allegedly booby trapped flood tunnels by detonating large underground dynamite blasts. On March 26, 1897, another fatality occurred when a worker named Maynard Kaiser fell to his death. In 1898 excavators poured red paint into the flooded pit which allegedly revealed three separate exit holes around the island. It is not known what became of this group afterwards, or if any additional finds were made.|$|E
5000|$|Herlong was {{developed}} in 1942 after the attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, to house civilian workers to support the Sierra Army Depot, one of several ammunition storage facilities located inland {{in order to be}} safe from Japanese attack. The site also met the requirement of being a dry and isolated area. The community was named after Captain Henry W. Herlong, the first United States Army ordnance officer to die in World War II.

40|$|An {{emergency}} situation in an underground coal mine site is an unexpected and often dangerous event that can quickly escalate if immediate {{action is not}} undertaken. Emergency situations often occur at the worst possible time and {{have the potential for}} multiple loss of life, loss of equipment, loss of coal assets and major damage to a companyâ€™s reputation. In an underground coal mine, an {{emergency situation}} involving a coal heating or small fire can quickly deteriorate into a large fire or worse a gas explosion. As the emergency situation unfolds, various activities will need to be undertaken that {{are not part of the}} normal work practices, for example gas sampling from a <b>bore</b> hole. The <b>equipment</b> required for <b>bore</b> hole sampling, may not be available onsite and the onsite personnel may not be familiar with its use. The aim of this paper is to provide a number of examples, from previous mine incidents to highlight some opportunities as to the emergency planning and preparation that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of the mines emergency response...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a U-shaped structure with the longest leg 105.5 metres feet long and 23.5 metres feet high. Because of delays in importing the specialized <b>boring</b> <b>equipment</b> needed to install the cast-in-place piles {{called for in the}} original design, {{the decision was made to}} use 1615 15 x 15 inch and 16 x 16 inch reinforced concrete piles. These were driven by a steam-powered hammer. On top of the piles a five- and six-storey steel-framed structure was built. The steel was encased in reinforced concrete and 1.75 million bricks. 21,000 cubic yards of aggregate from the Hutt River with cement from Whangarei were mixed on site to create the concrete. The bricks used for the outer cladding were of a special design, with slots to accommodate vertical corrosion-resistant steel rods that reinforced the brickwork and bound it to the structural members. 1500 tons of decorative Hanmer and Whangarei granite and marble were used to clad the interior and the entranceway. 2500 gallons of paint were used. The roof was clad in Marseille tiles.|$|E
40|$|For {{geotechnical}} {{exploration of}} the anhydrite and salt clay cavity locations in Poethen and Bernburg (Saxony-Anhalt) by drilling experiments a new <b>boring</b> <b>equipment</b> has been developed. Long-term in situ tension and deformation measurements were carried out at 1013 m (Poethen) and 410 - 510 m (Bernburg) depths using the hydrofrac method and the hole vent method for tension determination and extensometers for precision deformation measurements. Both tension methods yielded consistent results. Significant deformations and any overstepping of stability could be excluded. Tensions in the anhydrite of Bernburg {{can be explained by}} enlarged model assumptions. Load redistortions of the salt clay could be observed in both locations.

40|$|This {{history of}} the Northern Territory {{pastoral}} industry outlines how, for almost a century, cattlemen were subject to the tyrannies of distance and drought. Distance vitally affected time and cost of travel, income and quality of life. Similarly, geographic and environmental factors - especially drought - determined stocking rates, created mustering problems and affected the quality of livestock turned off, and overall profitability. This book then describes how, {{with the end of}} the packhorse era in the 1960 s and 1970 s, and the introduction of aerial mustering, two-way radios and satellite communications, Beef Roads and road trains, and efficient and economical water <b>boring</b> <b>equipment,</b> cattlemen gained much greater control over their operations. The authors consider, however, that Land Rights, which are the consequence of Aboriginal dispossession, will continue to affect pastoral operations for the foreseeable future...|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of a fluid undergoing a phase change from liquid to vapor while flowing through a duct is of interest to engineers in many practical situations. For the case of interest to us, geothermal hot water flowing through various channels (well <b>bores,</b> surface pipes, <b>equipment,</b> etc.) may reach its flash point and choke point under appropriate conditions. The proper design of energy conversion systems depends {{on the ability of}} the engineer to predict this behavior with an acceptable degree of accuracy. The present study was in part motivated by the task of designing the blow-down, two-phase fluid flow test facility at Brown University. In that facility, a refrigerant (dichlorotetrafluoroethane or R- 114) is boosted to a selected stagnation state and allowed to flow through a nozzle orifice into a long straight tube. The operation relies on the fluid being choked at the inlet section, and under certain circumstances, at the downstream section as well. A simple schematic of the test section is shown. This paper treats the problem generically and analytically, making use of the basic laws of fluid mechanics and thermodynamics. Specific calculations have been performed using R- 114 as the flowing medium. They attempt to identify and describe all possible flow conditions in and downstream of the nozzle for all possible stagnation conditions...|$|R
40|$|Actuated {{traffic signal}} {{controllers}} typically depend on inductive loop detectors to determine {{demand for a}} particular signal phase. The basic philosophy of these controllers is to only provide a green indication to a particular lane group {{when there is a}} vehicle waiting. If an inductive loop detector fails, it must be put in recall mode so that the lane group with the corresponding failed detector is serviced every cycle. When actuated controllers operate in this mode, the performance of the signalized intersection degenerates. Since the vast majority of actuated intersections operate with inductive loop detectors it is useful to have maintenance procedures {{that can be used to}} replace loop detectors that have failed due to pavement distress. This paper describes a procedure that has been developed using directional <b>boring</b> <b>equipment</b> to install a micro loop below the surface of the pavement where it is not subject to pavement distress. The authors believe this procedure will provide a cost effective method of restoring actuated control on approaches or lanes groups where the pavement condition makes it unfeasible to install or re-install a traditional saw cut loop detector. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{registering}} multiple range datasets {{collected in a}} GPS-denied, tunnel-like environment is presented. The method is designed to function with minimal user inputs and be effective {{over a wide range}} of changes in observation angle. The method is initially developed to operate on data in a general 2. 5 D coordinate system. Then, the general registration method is specifically tailored to a 2. 5 D spherical coordinate system. To apply the method, the range data is first filtered with a series of discrete Gaussian-based filters to construct a second-order Taylor series approximation to the surface about each sampled point. Finally, principal curvatures are calculated and compared across neighboring datasets to determine homologies and the best fit transfer matrix. The new method relaxes the minimum change in perspective requirement between neighboring datasets typical of other algorithms. Results from the application of the method on both synthetic and real-world data are shown. The real-world data comes from a series of high explosive tests performed in a tunnel environment. The tunnels were oriented horizontally in rock and constructed with <b>boring</b> <b>equipment.</b> The tunnel surfaces were surveyed with a Faro Focus 3 D terrestrial panorama scanning light detection and ranging (lidar) system both before and after a high explosive device was detonated inside the tunnel with the intent of documenting damage to the tunnel surface...|$|E
