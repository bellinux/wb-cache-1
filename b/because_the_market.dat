25|$|The product gap—also {{called the}} segment or {{positioning}} gap—is {{that part of}} the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings are much better placed for these consumers.|$|E
25|$|Environmental groups make large {{efforts to}} help shape {{legislation}} in New York because they see the strategy as {{an efficient way to}} influence national programs.

25|$|Virtually all {{canned tuna}} in the UK is {{labelled}} as dolphin-safe <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> is almost exclusively skipjack tuna.

25|$|In April 1998, when NBC {{affiliate}} KTEN (which {{added an}} additional primary affiliation with Fox in September 1994, partly {{in order to}} carry its NFL telecasts) terminated its affiliations with Fox and ABC, KDFW began serving as a default Fox station for portions of the adjacent Sherman-Ada market located south of the Oklahoma-Texas state line (including Gainesville, Durant and Hugo) through its availability on area cable providers (cable subscribers residing on the Oklahoma side of the market primarily received Fox network programs via KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City). <b>Because</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> lacked enough commercial television stations to allow the network to maintain an exclusive affiliation, Fox would not regain an affiliate within the market until CBS affiliate KXII launched a Fox-affiliated digital subchannel in September 2006.|$|E
500|$|After its release, it {{had high}} sales rates in Japan, selling {{over one million}} copies a short time after release. Its release in the US did not create as much hype as in Japan mainly <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for the Dynasty Warriors series is smaller there, but it still sold fairly well and {{together}} with the Japanese sales, Dynasty Warriors 4 entered into the Greatest Hits charts. In its time Dynasty Warriors 4 has managed to become IGN's 5th best co-operative game on the PS2 as well. The game is criticized for being very similar to older games in the series and retaining some of the features such as the fogging and repetitive gameplay. Even with these drawbacks, Koei went on to release two expansions for Dynasty Warriors 4 Xtreme Legends and Dynasty Warriors 4 Empires. It had also been ported to the Xbox and to the PC as a Hyper edition. Armchair Empire commented that {{when there is a}} lot happening on screen at once, the game tended to slow down ...|$|E

[...] By 1957, there were 25 mining claims in the Glass Buttes area. [...] At that time, the largest mine was producing 65 to 70 flasks of mercury per month. [...] While the mercury was present in commercially valuable quantities, to cover production costs a relatively high market price was required.

6000|$|Sir Dinadan the Humorist was {{the first}} to awake, and he soon roused the rest with a {{practical}} joke of a sufficiently poor quality. He tied some metal mugs to a dog's tail and turned him loose, and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright, with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and crashing against everything that came in their way and making altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and wallowed on the floor in ecstasy. It was just like so many children. Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had got through. He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech --of course a humorous speech. I think I never heard so many old played-out jokes strung together in my life. He was worse than the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus. It seemed peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before I was born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years afterwards. It about convinced me that there isn't any such thing as a new joke possible. Everybody laughed at these antiquities --but then they always do; I had noticed that, centuries later. However, of course the scoffer didn't laugh--I mean the boy. No, he scoffed; there wasn't anything he wouldn't scoff at. He said the most of Sir Dinadan's jokes were rotten and the rest were petrified. I said [...] "petrified" [...] was good; as I believed, myself, that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of those jokes was by geologic periods. But that neat idea hit the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn't been invented yet. However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through. It is no use to throw a good thing away merely <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> isn't ripe yet.|$|E
