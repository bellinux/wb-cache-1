25|$|Some 19th-century barns {{found in}} other parts of the U.S. may have some {{similarities}} with the New England barn but are distinctly different. The Pennsylvania barn has doors on the sidewall like the English barn but is a larger, bank barn with the cows housed in the basement, and has one or more distinctive forebays (cantilevered walls). The New World Dutch barn (Dutch barn) has similarities to the New England barn with the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on the gable ends, but the Dutch barns are a much older type and are framed with the classic anchor beam framing. Dutch barns are ground barns.|$|E
25|$|The New England barn {{is from a}} {{different}} tradition than the Pennsylvania Barn. In New England the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> are always on the gable end. The cows were on the main level, hay in a mow on the main level and/or above in haylofts, possibly grain storage on the main level, sometimes a tack room or workshop and the basement was used for manure management and other tasks. The New England barn developed in the early 19th century, became the most popular barn type after 1850 replacing the smaller, side-entry English barn and are almost always square rule framing.|$|E
25|$|Similarities {{between the}} English and New England barn are that {{buildings}} {{were used for}} multiple purposes: the cows were in tie-ups {{on one side of}} the main floor, typically a narrower space on the warmer side of the building, and hay storage and a stable were in the other side, typically the colder side. Both types of barns were sometimes built with big doors on both ends of the drive floor so a wagon team could drive through and generally called a drive through barn. Occasionally the back door was small and only used for ventilation or winnowing. There were likely loose poles called a scaffold on the beams above the drive floor and loft floors above the tie-ups. There may be a transom window above the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> and windows were used as needed in some of the walls, but more windows are likely to be found in the New England barn. The roofs of the three-bay barns frequently have no overhang on the eaves or sidewalls, but some New England barns have original, built in roof overhangs.|$|E

2500|$|The {{floor plan}} of aisled barns {{resembles that of}} an aisled church. However, the nave in farm {{buildings}} is called an aisle thus a [...] "three aisled barn". Aisled barns have the big <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on the gable end of the building giving access to the center aisle, often called the drive floor or threshing floor. The side aisles may be the same widths making the barn symmetrical or the aisle where animals were housed may be narrower which is apparent outside the barn because the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> are then off-center. The area between the posts, perpendicular to the aisles are called bays. In stables there is a stable aisle down the centre with individual stalls facing the aisle.|$|E

2500|$|In the Pennsylvania barn, {{the upper}} floor was a hayloft {{and the lower}} a stable area. The <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> were {{typically}} on the sidewall. [...] With William Penn's promise of freedom and inexpensive land, many settlers came to Pennsylvania. Among these settlers were the Germans, who began to build bank barns on their land. Many other settlers followed this practice and it was soon {{the most common type}} of barn Pennsylvania during the colonial era. The Pennsylvania Barn is a specific type of bank barn with a forebay, a projecting floor on one or more sides of the barn. All forebay barns are bank barns but not all bank barns are forebay barns. Robert F. Ensminger in his classic book The Pennsylvania barn: its origin, evolution, and distribution in North America identifies three basic types of Pennsylvania barn: the Sweitzer, Standard, and Extended.|$|E
2500|$|The New England Barn was {{the most}} common style of barn built in most of the 19th century in rural New England and {{variants}} are found throughout the United States. This style barn superseded the ”three-bay barn” in several important ways. The most obvious difference is the location of the <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> on the gable-end(s) rather than the sidewall(s). The New England and three bay barns were used similarly as multipurpose farm buildings (housing animals, crop storage and other uses all in one building) but the New England barns are typically larger and have a basement. Culturally the New England Barn represents a shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming thus are larger and show significant changes in American building methods and technologies. Most were used as dairy barns but some housed teams of oxen which are generally called teamster barns. Sometimes these barns are simply called “gable fronted” and “gable fronted bank barns” [...] but these terms are also used for barns other than the New England style barn such as in Maryland [...] and Virginia which is not exactly the same style as found in New England. A similar style found in parts of the American mid-west and south is called a transverse frame barn or transverse crib barn.|$|E

60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Oliver opened the great <b>barn</b> <b>doors,</b> and, taking a shovel, {{he began to}} clear away the snow from before them. The sky in the east was by this time {{beginning}} to be quite bright; and a considerable degree {{of light from the}} sky, and from the new-fallen snow, came into the barn. Josey got a shovel, and went out to help Oliver. After they had shoveled away the snow from the great <b>barn</b> <b>doors,</b> they went to the house, and began to clear the steps before the doors, and to make paths in the yards. They worked in this way for half an hour, and then, just as the sun began first to show its bright, glittering rays above the horizon, they went into the house. They found that the great fire which Jonas had built, was burnt half down; the breakfast-table was set, and the breakfast itself was nearly ready.|$|E

In the decline of the year, when the woods were variegated with all the colors of the rainbow, Ben seemed to desire nothing better than to gaze at them from morn till night. The purple and golden clouds of sunset were a joy to him.

In the first place, though it supported the men on it, it did not bear them high and dry above the water, which came over the ankles of most of them. Then there was no possible means of steering the unwieldy bark; and there could be no doubt that if the Argonauts did succeed in getting their vessels out into the river, it would immediately descend the stream, and that it, and those upon it, would either be upset altogether, or taken to whichever bank and whatever part of it, the river in its caprice might please.|$|E

And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't got to the end of it yet. He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand. Well, I was getting to feel that way myself, though I've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do.

6000|$|There {{was quite}} a lot of rose garden, it made the air delicious, and it was full of great {{tumbling}} bushes of roses and of neglected standards, and it had a long pergola of creepers and trailers and a great arbour, and underneath over the beds everywhere, contrary to all the rules, the blossom of a multitude of pansies and stock and little trailing plants swarmed and crowded and scrimmaged and drilled and fought great massed attacks. And then Mr. Britling talked their way round a red-walled vegetable garden with an abundance of fruit trees, and through a door into a terraced square that had once been a farmyard, outside the converted barn. The <b>barn</b> <b>doors</b> had been replaced by a door-pierced window of glass, {{and in the middle of}} the square space a deep tank had been made, full of rainwater, in which Mr. Britling remarked casually that [...] "everybody" [...] bathed when the weather was hot. Thyme and rosemary and suchlike sweet-scented things grew on the terrace about the tank, and ten trimmed little trees of Arbor vitae stood sentinel. Mr. Direck was tantalisingly aware that beyond some lilac bushes were his new-found cousin and the kindred young woman in blue playing tennis with the Indian and another young man, while whenever it was necessary the large-nosed lady crossed the stage and brooded soothingly over the perambulator. And Mr. Britling, choosing a seat from which Mr. Direck just couldn't look comfortably through the green branches at the flying glimpses of pink and blue and white and brown, continued to talk about England and America in relation to each other and everything else under the sun.|$|E
