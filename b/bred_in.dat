5|$|Lions {{have been}} known to breed with tigers (most often the Amur and Bengal subspecies) to create hybrids called ligers and tigons. Such hybrids were once {{commonly}} <b>bred</b> <b>in</b> zoos, but this is now discouraged due to the emphasis on conservation.

5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then <b>bred</b> <b>in</b> captivity.|$|E

40|$|Variation in pork {{quality has}} been {{proposed}} to be mostly due to different rates of post-mortem muscle pH decline (Ryu and Kim, 2006) and its influence on tenderness (Pomponio et al. 2010), which is an important eating quality discriminator. The variable nature and inconsistency of meat quality attributes, such as meat colour and pH, <b>in</b> outdoor <b>bred</b> pigs <b>in</b> Western Australia, and the related quantity of stored muscle glycogen at slaughter, led to this investigation. High levels of muscle glycogen pre-slaughter increases potential lactic acid production, the extent of pH decline, and the lightness of pork. The effect of high glycogen levels on the rate of pH decline is controversial (Scheffler and Gerrard, 2007) {{and has never been}} examined <b>in</b> outdoor <b>bred</b> pigs <b>in</b> Australia. The aim of this experiment was to investigate the influence of loin glycogen stores pre-slaughter on post-slaughter pH decline <b>in</b> outdoor <b>bred</b> pigs <b>in</b> Western Australia...|$|R

The Kathiawari Horse Breeders' Association {{maintains}} a register. The Gujarat government maintains stud farms in eleven different locations; one in Junagadh holds both mares and stallions and is tasked with preserving the breed, while the other ten hold Kathiawari stallions that are used for improving the local stock of other or mixed breeds. In 2007, only about 50 Kathiawaris were held by private breeders.Today, the Panchaal region is renowned for its Kathiawari horses, often producing the most beautiful horses of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Americus (foaled 1892, died 1910), was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was {{exported}} to England. He {{had some success}} as a racehorse, but was more notable for his influence at stud. He was <b>bred</b> <b>in</b> California and won the 1895 Culver Stakes prior to his export. He continued to race in England, until he was nine years old, while also standing as a breeding stallion. He stood at stud in Italy, Ireland, Germany, and Belgium before dying in Germany in 1910. Americus' most famous descendant was his great-granddaughter Mumtaz Mahal.|$|E
5|$|An avid {{conservationist}} and hunter, Burnham {{supported the}} early conservation programs {{of his friends}} Theodore Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot. He and his associate John Hayes Hammond led novel game expeditions to Africa {{with the goal of}} finding large animals such as Giant Eland, hippopotamus, zebra, and various bird species that might be <b>bred</b> <b>in</b> the United States and become game for future American sportsmen. Burnham, Hammond, and Duquesne appeared several times before the House Committee on Agriculture to ask for help in importing large African animals. In 1914, he helped establish the Wild Life Protective League of America, Department of Southern California, and served as its first Secretary.|$|E
