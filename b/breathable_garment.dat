50|$|An oilskin is a {{waterproof}} garment, typically worn by sailors and by others in wet areas, such as fish-plant workers. The modern oilskin garment {{was developed by}} an Australian, Edward Le Roy, in 1898. Le Roy used worn-out sailcloth painted {{with a mixture of}} linseed oil and wax to produce {{a waterproof}}, yet still <b>breathable</b> <b>garment</b> suitable to be worn on deck in foul-weather conditions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} thermal {{insulation}} and evaporative resistance of a waterproof and <b>breathable</b> <b>garment</b> system and determines the factors influencing its thermal performance. The experimental garments were composed of underwear (shirts with 100 % wool and 100 % polyester) and outerwear (jackets and pants with a vapor-permeable membrane and a vapor-impermeable membrane). Data on clothing insulation {{in a dry}} condition (10 ℃) and a wet condition (10 ℃...|$|E
40|$|A {{species of}} lichen, Lecanora conizaeoides, {{is shown to}} be super-hydrophobic. It uses a {{combination}} of hydrophobic compounds and multi-layered roughness to shed water effectively. This is combined with gas channels to produce a biological analogue of a waterproof, <b>breathable</b> <b>garment.</b> The particular lichen grows mostly during wet seasons and is unusually resistant to acid rain [Hauck, M., 2003. The Bryologist 106 (2), 257 – 269; Honegger, R., 1998. Lichenologist 30 (3), 193 – 212]. The waterproof, breathable surface allows this lichen to photosynthesise when other species are covered {{with a layer of}} water. In addition, rainwater runs off the surface of the organism, reducing its intake of water from above and probably contributing to its resistance to acid rain...|$|E
50|$|The {{first report}} of using Gore-Tex to make waterproof, <b>breathable</b> <b>garments</b> {{appeared}} in a market report, April 13, 1972. The manufacturing process was patented in 1972. The first commercial sales of Gore-Tex were made in 1976 when Early Winters, Ltd., began making and selling Gore-Tex tents. The next year Early sold Gore-Tex rainwear.|$|R
