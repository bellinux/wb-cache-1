40|$|Abstract- There {{are many}} {{situations}} where human activities have significant {{effects on the}} environment. Ozone layer damage is one of them. The objective {{of this paper is}} to review the origin, causes, mechanisms and bio effects of ozone layer depletion as well as the protective measures of this vanishing layer. The chlorofluorocarbon and the halons are potent ozone depletors. One of the main reasons for the widespread concern about depletion of the ozone layer is the anticipated increase in the amounts of ultraviolet radiation received at the surface of the earth and the effect of this on human health and on the environment. The prospects of ozone recovery remain uncertain. In the absence of other changes, stratospheric ozone abundances should rise in the future as the halogen loading falls in response to regulation. However, the future <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> will also be affected by the changing atmospheric abundances of methane, nitrous oxide, water vapour, sulphate aerosol, and changing climate...|$|E
40|$|The {{stratospheric ozone}} layer {{provides}} protection for Earth's land-based organisms against harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, but the past century has seen the ozone layer compromised {{as a result of}} human activity, resulting in commensurate shifts in surface UV-B flux. Despite the importance of UV radiation to the well-being of life, records of surface UV-B flux only exist {{for a short period of}} time. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and UV-B flux in the past an alternative method of determining UV-B is required. Changes in spore chemistry have been proposed as a palaeo-monitor of UV-B flux, which can then be related to stratospheric ozone abundance. By employing the rapid and inexpensive technique of FTIR microspectroscopy to investigate changes in spore chemistry, a large dataset spanning seven different spatial and temporal UV regimes has been generated in order to evaluate the feasibility of routine usage of a spore-based UV-B proxy.

40|$|Ground-level ozone is a {{secondary}} air pollutant and is photochemically produced by solar radiation from the reaction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Ground-level ozone is considered a harmful pollutant due to its adverse impact on human health, agricultural crops and materials. The concern-ing factor is {{that in spite of}} decreasing trends in some other air pollutants (e. g. NOx), ozone concentrations are still increasing. This paper describes the temporal variations <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> at four air quality monitoring sites (Harwell, Leeds, Marylebone and Strath Vaich) in the United Kingdom for the year of 2008. The association <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> with some traffi c-related air pollutants has been explored applying a quantile regression model (QRM). The traffi c-related air pollutants considered as predictors for this study are hydrocarbons (HC), nitric oxides (NO), nitrogen dioxides (NO 2), carbon monoxides (CO) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5). QRM can handle the non-linearities in the relationship <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> and its predictors and is applicable to non-normal air quality data distribution. The <b>behaviour</b> and interaction <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> with its predictors vary at different regimes <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> distributions, which remains hidden when applying an ordinary least square regression model. QRM explains signifi cantly more variations in ozone concentrations (global goodness of fi t R 1 = 0. 88) as compared to ordinary least square regression (coeffi cient of determination R 2 = 0. 32) and is therefore better suited for ozone data analysis and prediction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} the {{implementation}} of an advanced convex optim-isation method {{in the framework of}} integrated assessment modelling. The integrated assessment of optimal policies requires a flexible and modular optimisation framework to exchange information between models while providing a consistent response in a reas-onable time. In the Luxembourg Energy Air Quality model, the NOx and VOC emis-sions are computed by an energy model and the dispersion of air pollutants, including produced ozone, are simulated by an air quality model. Here we implement an oracle-based optimisation technique to couple the energy model and the air quality model in cost-effectiveness mode. Each model is queried by a program, the so-called “oracle”, which supplies the model output and sensitivity information to a main program. The con-vergence of procedure is ensured given sufficient assumptions on the convexity by the cutting plane method Proximal-ACCPM. Encouraging results show the capability of the method to handle the non-convex <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> production, but also to find an optimal solution within a reasonable timeframe of a few hours...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> (O 3) in the {{seasonal}} snowpack, measurements were taken of O 3 and CO 2 in the interstitial air on Rishiri Island, {{which is located}} in northern Japan, during the 2010 / 11 winter season. Exhibiting variation on timescales ranging from several minutes to several days, the atmospheric O 3 in the surface air generally increased from December (38 ppb) to April (52 ppb). The ozone mixing ratio sharply decreased below the snow surface. Whereas the CO 2 data in the interstitial air indicated that a rapid exchange between the snow and the atmosphere occurred intermittently, the O 3 mixing ratio remained low and constant (< 5 ppb) in the snowpack interior. The vertical profile of the O 3 mixing ratio indicates that the e-folding lifetime of the O 3 loss reaction was 5. 0 ± 2. 3 minutes {{during the day and}} 10. 0 ± 6. 3 minutes at night, suggesting photochemical O 3 depletion occurred during the daytime. Kinetic experiments using ambient (maritime) air and snow indicate that the photochemical O 3 loss is proportional to the solar radiation and that the O 3 loss rate decreases as dawn approaches during the night. The result of the kinetic experiments using artificial O 3 in the pure air and snow suggests the important role of gaseous species in the ambient air towards O 3 depletion...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{recent years}} {{a number of}} chemistry-climate models have been {{developed}} {{with an emphasis on}} the stratosphere. Such models cover a wide range of time scales of integration and vary considerably in complexity. The results of specific diagnostics are here analysed to examine the differences amongst individual models and observations, to assess the consistency of model predictions, with a particular focus on polar ozone. For example, many models indicate a significant cold bias in high latitudes, the "cold pole problem", particularly in the southern hemisphere during winter and spring. This is related to wave propagation from the troposphere which can be improved by improving model horizontal resolution and with the use of non-orographic gravity wave drag. As a result of the widely differing modelled polar temperatures, different amounts of polar stratospheric clouds are simulated which in turn result in varying ozone values in the models. The results are also compared to determine the possible future <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone,</b> with an emphasis on the polar regions and mid-latitudes. All models predict eventual ozone recovery, but give a range of results concerning its timing and extent. Differences in the simulation of gravity waves and planetary waves as well as model resolution are likely major sources of uncertainty for this issue. In the Antarctic, the ozone hole has probably reached almost its deepest although the vertical and horizontal extent of depletion may increase slightly further over the next few years. According to the model results, Antarctic ozone recovery could begin any year within the range 2001 to 2008. The limited number of models which have been integrated sufficiently far indicate that full recovery of ozone to 1980 levels may not occur in the Antarctic until about the year 2050. For the Arctic, most models indicate that small ozone losses may continue for a few more years and that recovery could begin any year within the range 2004 to 2019. The start of ozone recovery in the Arctic is therefore expected to appear later than in the Antarctic. Further, interannual variability will tend to mask the signal for longer than in the Antarctic, delaying still further the date at which ozone recovery may be said to have started. Because of this inherent variability of the system, the decadal evolution of Arctic ozone will not necessarily be a direct response to external forcing...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to model and {{interpret}} the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> when utilised to decolourise reactive dye solutions in textile dyeing applications. The purpose of ozonating the dye solutions is to remove dyes from the waste streams produced in order to conserve the water and eliminate the impact associated with these industrial processes. In order to explain the decolourisation process, ozonation experiments were conducted in a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a semi-batch reactor (SBR). Experimental results at both steady state and unsteady state were obtained from both reactors. Stoichiometry revealed that many dye molecules were decoloured per ozone molecule consumed (58 mole of dye solution per one mole ozone). This suggests that decolouration was taking place via a radical chain reaction. Different coloured dyes had different rates of decolouration. This implied the rates were not totally mass transfer controlled. It {{was found that the}} higher the initial dye concentration, the lower the rate of decolouration. This was an unexpected result when needed to be explained using the model. The effect of different gas-phase ozone concentrations appeared to be negligible. For the SBR, there was a difference (what do you mean??) between the results of experiments. These occurred when the dye was added before the solution was pre-ozonated and when it was not. The former gave more consistent results and showed slightly higher initial rates. Because, for the CSTR, there are wide ranges of steady states as a function of residence time, the major benefit of using the CSTR rather than an SBR is that one can explore different regions of the reaction space. Thus, in doing modelling, one {{is in a position to}} assess the kinetic model against a wider variety of conditions. A mathematical model was developed to describe the kinetic behaviour of the reactive dye degradation by ozone. The basis for the model took into account the phenomena observed as a consequence of exploring the implications of the experimental results described above. The model had three unknown constants and these were estimated by regressing on all the SBR data simultaneously. The fit between experimental and model data was found to be good. As a final verification of the model, it was used to predict the CSTR unsteady/steady-state data. Again, the fit was found to be good (R 2 = 0. 9897 Model versus experimental) thus suggesting the kinetic model captured all the important aspects of the reaction kinetics. This model thus becomes potentially important for the design of future facilities for the degradation of a reactive dye by ozone...|$|E
40|$|The {{ground-based}} radiometer GROMOS, {{stationed in}} Bern (47. 95 ° N, 7. 44 ° E), Switzerland, {{has a unique}} data set: it obtains ozone profiles from November 1994 to present with a time resolution of 30 min and equivalent quality during night- and daytime. Here, we derive a monthly climatology <b>of</b> the daily <b>ozone</b> cycle from 17 years of GROMOS observation. We present the diurnal <b>ozone</b> variation <b>of</b> the stratosphere and mesosphere. Characterizing the diurnal cycle <b>of</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> is important for correct trend estimates <b>of</b> the <b>ozone</b> layer derived from satellite observations. The diurnal ozone cycle from GROMOS is compared to two models: the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the Hamburg Model of Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere (HAMMONIA). Generally, observation and models show a good agreement: in the lower mesosphere, daytime ozone is for both GROMOS and models around 25 % less than midnight ozone. In the stratosphere, ozone reaches its maximum in the afternoon showing values several percent larger than the midnight value. Further, GROMOS and models indicate a seasonal <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the diurnal <b>ozone</b> variations in the stratosphere with a larger afternoon maximum during daytime in summer than in winter. Using the 17 years <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> profiles from GROMOS, we find strong interannual variations in the diurnal ozone cycle for both the stratosphere and the mesosphere.

40|$|A 10 -year study <b>of</b> surface <b>ozone</b> mixing ratios in the Central Mediterranean was {{conducted}} based on continuous ozone measurements from 1997 to 2006 by a background regional Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) {{station on the}} island of Gozo. The mean annual maximum mixing ratio is of the order of 66 ppbv in April–May with a broad secondary maximum of 64 ppbv in July–September. No long-term increase or decrease in the background level <b>of</b> surface <b>ozone</b> could be observed over the last 10 years. This is contrary to observations made in the Eastern Mediterranean, where a slow decrease in the background ozone mixing ratio was observed over the past 7 years. Despite the very high average annual ozone mixing ratio exceeding 50 ppbv—in fact, the highest average background ozone mixing ratio ever measured in Europe—, the diurnal O 3 max/O 3 min index of < 1. 40 indicates that the island of Gozo is a good site for measuring background surface ozone. However, frequent photosmog events from June to September during the past 10 years with ozone mixing ratios exceeding 90 ppbv indicate that the Central Mediterranean is prone to long-range transport of air pollutants from Europe by northerly winds. This was particularly evident during the so-called “August heatwave” of the year 2003 when the overall ozone mixing ratio was 4. 6 ppbv higher than the average of all other 9 months of August since 1997. Air mass back-trajectory analysis of the August 2003 photosmog episodes on Gozo confirmed that ozone pollution originated from the European continent.

40|$|High levels <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> (typically 850 ppm) {{are readily}} {{decomposed}} by semiconductor photocatalysis, using {{a thin film}} of the semiconductor titanium dioxide (Degussa P 25 TiO 2) cast on a glass tube, and UVA light, i. e. light of energy {{greater than that of}} the bandgap of the semiconductor (ultra-bandgap light); in the absence of this light the thermal decomposition <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> is relatively slow. The semiconductor films show no evidence of chemical or photochemical wear with repeated use. At high levels <b>of</b> <b>ozone,</b> i. e. 100 ppm {{less than or equal to}} [O- 3] less than or equal to 1400 ppm, the initial rate <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> decomposition by semiconductor photocatalysis is independent of [O- 3], whereas, at lower ozone concentrations, i. e. 5 ppm less than or equal to [O- 3] less than or equal to 100 ppm, the initial rate <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> photodestruction decreases in a smooth, but non-linear, manner with decreasing [O- 3]. The kinetics <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> photodecomposition fit a Langmuir-Hinshelwood type kinetic equation and the possible mechanistic implications of these results are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{mechanism}} of oxidizing action <b>of</b> <b>ozone,</b> prospecting the process of potable water treatment, sewage treatment, as well as the removal of fouling from filtering media. In addition, there has been studied the effect <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> on ion exchanger matrix and its dynamic exchange capacity. A series of tests for kinetics <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> solubility in distilled, tap and partially desalted water has been performed. The results of the experiments had been processed by program- shell Mathcad Professional 7. 0, which allowed to deduce the functional relations between ozone concentration and barbotage time. Knowing barbotage time it is possible to calculate ozone concentration and select optimal modes <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> treatment. The experiments on the removal of fouling from filtering media have resulted in the development of ozonization process flowsheet, ozone treatment conditions. The analysis <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> effect on ion exchanger matrix and definition of dynamic exchange capacity of ozonized filtering medium have been carried out. The application <b>of</b> <b>ozone</b> treatment technology has proved to be effective in fouling removal without damaging the matrix of io...|$|R
