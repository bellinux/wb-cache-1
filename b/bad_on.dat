Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed. The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower slough and built a new Portland Airport on land along the middle slough. Activists and civic leaders, concerned about pollution on the Willamette River, led cleanup campaigns, but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment. Pollution eventually grew so <b>bad</b> <b>on</b> the slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water.|$|E

He also argues that the interpretation of the moon's conjunction with a planet as good when the moon is full, but bad when the moon is waning, is clearly wrong, as from the moon's point of view, half of her surface is always in sunlight; and from the planet's point of view, waning should be better, as then the planet sees some light from the moon, but when the moon is full to us, it is dark, and therefore <b>bad,</b> <b>on</b> the side facing the planet.|$|E

Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the <b>bad.</b> <b>On</b> returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother.

Lynch helped Banks fend off Naomi and Tamina leading to a temporary and uneasy alliance between the two. Also that same night Charlotte lost a non-title match to Brie Bella by roll-up. This led to a title match between the two for the Divas Championship scheduled for Fastlane, which Charlotte won.|$|E

Digital Spy's Dek Hogan criticised Kay's performance, calling the Abzorbaloff [...] "a marvellous idea and it's a pity his creativity was absorbed by a turn from a visiting comedian". In a review of the series, Stephen Brook of The Guardian stated that he [...] "hated" [...] the episode, describing it as a [...] "parody of Doctor Who fans". The scene where Elton says he and Ursula have [...] "a bit of a love life" [...] was criticised by some commentators, who felt that the resultant implication of having oral sex with a paving slab was unsuitable for Doctor Whos large family audience; others, however, dismissed this dialogue as a harmless joke that children would not understand.

After the fire was extinguished, the ship resumed her voyage to Liverpool, but the cargo caught fire a second time, and was only finally extinguished by a combination of battening the hatches to starve the flames of oxygen and the use of steam pumps.
