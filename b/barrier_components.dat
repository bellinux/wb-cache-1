40|$|Earthen {{barriers}} such as CCLs and GCLs {{have been}} employed in geotechnical practices {{to provide a}} low permeability hydraulic barrier since long time ago. These types of barriers exhibited satisfactory performance for many applications such as landfills. The performance of low permeability barriers {{is based on the}} swelling potential of their component, which is mostly Na-bentonite, in contact with polar fluids such as water. However, the acceptable range of conductivity cannot be achieved by traditional earthen barriers when they are permeated by non-polar fluids such as gasoline. This phenomenon occurs due to the incompatibility of earthen barrier constituent with non-polar compounds. Also, the traditional earthen barriers are not able to retard the contaminant transport due to their negligible reactivity with organic compounds. As a result, the application of low permeability barriers was limited to polar and non-contaminated flows. In this study, the performance of traditional earthen barriers as a hydraulic and chemical barrier was enhanced by introducing an organically modified amendment (HDTMA-bentonite) to traditional earthen <b>barrier’s</b> <b>components...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{involves a}} combined experimental and modeling study that builds on our previous DOE-sponsored work in investigating how KMnO{sub 4 } {{can be better}} used with in situ remediation of groundwater contaminated by chlorinated ethylenes (e. g., PCE, TCE, DCE). This study aims to provide scientific basis for developing a new long-term, semi-passive ISCO scheme that uses controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } as a reactive <b>barrier</b> <b>component.</b> Specific objectives of the study are (1) to construct controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } as a new reactive <b>barrier</b> <b>component</b> that could deliver permanganate at a controlled rate over long time periods of years, (2) to quantitatively describe release mechanisms associated with the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 }, (3) to demonstrate efficacy of the new remediation scheme using proof-of-concept experiments, and (4) to design advanced forms of controlled release systems through numerical optimization. The new scheme operates in a long-term, semi-passive manner to control spreading of a dissolved contaminant plume with periodic replacement of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } installed in the subsurface. As {{a first step in}} developing this remedial concept, we manufactured various prototype controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } forms. Then we demonstrated using column experiments that the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } could deliver small amount of permanganate into flowing water at controlled rates over long time periods of years. An analytical model was also used to estimate the diffusivities and durations of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 }. Finally, proof-of-concept flow-tank experiments were performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the controlled release KMnO{sub 4 } scheme in controlling dissolved TCE plume in a long-term, semi-passive manner. Another important thrust of our research effort involved numerical optimization of controlled release systems. This study used a numerical model that is capable of describing release patterns of active agent from controlled release systems of varied forms and applications. We manufactured prototype single- and double-layered matrix-type controlled release systems and tested their release patterns using numerical simulations and column experiments. In a series of simulations, we demonstrated that an encapsulated, dispersed-agent polymeric matrix-type controlled release system could deliver active agent at a predetermined constant rate for long time periods of years and decades. Such long-term, constant release system is useful in the construction of fertilizers, herbicides, or implantable drug delivery devices as well as in subsurface treatment.

In particular, zirconia-based materials exhibit both low {{thermal conductivity}} and structural stability at high temperature, making them suitable for such applications. Because creep is one of the potential failure modes, and because diffusion is a mechanism by which creep takes place, we have performed computer simulations of cation diffusion in a variety of zirconia-based low-K materials. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulation method is an alternative to the more widely known molecular dynamics (MD) method. It is designed to study "infrequent-event" processes, such as diffusion, for which MD simulation can be highly inefficient. We describe the results of kinetic Monte Carlo computer simulations of cation diffusion in several zirconia-based materials, specifically, zirconia doped with Y, Gd, Nb and Yb. Diffusion paths are identified, and migration energy barriers are obtained from density functional calculations and from the literature.

40|$|Dry eye is {{a common}} {{disorder}} caused by inadequate hydration of the ocular surface that results in disruption of barrier function. The homeostatic protein clusterin (CLU) is prominent at fluid-tissue interfaces throughout the body. CLU levels are reduced at the ocular surface in human inflammatory disorders that manifest as severe dry eye, {{as well as in}} a preclinical mouse model for desiccating stress that mimics dry eye. Using this mouse model, we show here that CLU prevents and ameliorates ocular surface barrier disruption by a remarkable sealing mechanism dependent on attainment of a critical all-or-none concentration. When the CLU level drops below the critical all-or-none threshold, the barrier becomes vulnerable to desiccating stress. CLU binds selectively to the ocular surface subjected to desiccating stress in vivo, and in vitro to the galectin LGALS 3, a key <b>barrier</b> <b>component.</b> Positioned in this way, CLU not only physically seals the ocular surface barrier, but it also protects the barrier cells and prevents further damage to barrier structure. These findings define a fundamentally new mechanism for ocular surface protection and suggest CLU as a biotherapeutic for dry eye...|$|R

Following a satisfactory validation of the model, further dynamic non-linear analyses were conducted to investigate the dependence of the full system performance to the size of impacting blocks.

40|$|The present work {{attempts}} to obtain {{deeper understanding of}} the development of laminar morphology in polymer blends and to optimize the production and properties of laminar polymer blends in ribbon extrusion. Studies of the microstructure of extruded ribbons of high density polyethylene (HDPE) /polyamide- 6 (PA- 6) and polypropylene (PP) /ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) blends have shown {{that it is possible to}} control the flow-induced morphology to generate thin, large and discontinuous overlapping platelets of PA- 6 or EVOH dispersed phase in a HDPE or PP matrix phase, respectively. Such polymer blends are known as laminar polymer blends. The laminar blends of HDPE/PA- 6 with only small amounts (20 wt%) of the <b>barrier</b> <b>component,</b> i. e. PA- 6 resin, produced significant reduction (up to 45 times) in hydrocarbon permeability of extruded ribbons. The PP/EVOH laminar blends with 25 wt% of the <b>barrier</b> <b>component,</b> i. e. EVOH, yielded 10 times improvement in hydrocarbon permeability of the extruded ribbons. The above was achieved by optimizing material characteristics, processing conditions and flow field in the screw zone and in the die unit. In particular, an approach for controlling the mixing and melting steps in the screw zone was introduced, in order to maximize the size of melted particles of the dispersed phase upon entering the die unit. In the die region, extensional flow generated by incorporating converging and diverging sections in the die design, caused the large particles entering the die to be stretched in both directions (machine and transverse directions), thus, producing platelets in the plane of extrusion. The effects of the following factors on morphology development and blend properties were considered and, when possible, manipulated to obtain large particles and deformations of dispersed phase particles: screw zone temperature profile, die temperature, screw design and configuration, composition, pre-compounding, die exit gap size, and cooling system. The influence of the rheology of the system, i. e. the viscosity and elasticity ratios of components, was studied and manipulated to obtain large deformations of dispersed phase particles. The effect of interfacial tension on the morphology and barrier and mechanical properties was investigated and for the HDPE/PA- 6 system, the interfacial tension was optimized by controlling the level of compatibilizer, in order to obtain maximum barrier and mechanical performance of the laminar blends. Pressure-Volume-Temperature (P-V-T) characteristics of the individual resins and blends of HDPE/PA- 6 were studied, in order to calculate the interfacial tension values and other thermodynamic relationships for compatibilized and non-compatibilized blends of HDPE and PA- 6. Various relationships were obtained for predicting the barrier and mechanical properties of the laminar blends from morphological data...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Intestinal mucin 2 (MUC 2), a major gel-forming mucin, {{represents}} a primary <b>barrier</b> <b>component</b> of mucus layers and a target site for secretory IgA. Poly-meric Ig receptor (pIgR) expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelium {{is used to}} transport polymeric IgA from the lamina propria into luminal mucins to estab-lish the first lines of intestinal defense. To determine the spatio-temporal expression of MUC 2, IgA, and pIgR in broiler chickens and Pekin ducks, intestinal tissues (n = 6 /age) were dissected from late embryonic days up to 21 d posthatch. In the intestinal tissues, MUC 2 was expressed with a rapid increase at hatching, followed by steady expression through 21 d posthatch both in chickens and ducks. IgA expression was low {{during the first week}} following hatching for both species. From the second week posthatch, IgA was rapidly expressed in the chickens, arriving at steady expression in the third week after hatching. However, in ducks, IgA expression during the 2 to 3 wk posthatch period was relatively slow. The expression of pIgR was greatly increased af-ter hatching for both species, but its expression in ducks was relatively delayed. In addition, intestinal pIgR ex-pression was highly correlated with MUC 2 and IgA ex-pressions in chickens but just moderately correlated in ducks. The relatively slow and late expression of IgA and pIgR as well as their moderate correlation may or may not account for the susceptibility of ducklings to mucosal pathogens at a young age...|$|R

However, most compassion research focuses on compassion fatigue—an outcome variable— rather than examining the specific factors that may interfere with compassion in a physician’s practice. This report describes the development and early psychometric data for a self-report questionnaire assessing barriers to compassion among physicians. Methods In 2011, a pilot sample of 75 physicians helped to generate an initial list of barriers to compassion. A final 34 item Barriers to Physician Compassion (BPC) questionnaire was administered to 372 convenience-sampled physicians together with measures of demographics, practice-related variables, stress, locus of control and trait compassion. Results The barriers to physician compassion were not one-dimensional. Principal component analysis revealed the presence of four distinct, face-valid and discriminable factors—physician burnout/overload, external distractions, difficult patient/family and complex clinical situation. All <b>barrier</b> <b>components</b> had adequate internal reliabilities (> 0. 70) and meaningful patterns of convergent and divergent validity.
