5|$|In {{market and}} brand focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate <b>brand</b> <b>management</b> and product <b>brand</b> <b>management.</b> Focusing on the brand {{as the core}} for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The design {{is driven by the}} brand vision and strategy.|$|E
5|$|The {{main focus}} of product <b>brand</b> <b>{{management}}</b> lies on the single product or product family. Product design management is linked to research and development, marketing, and <b>brand</b> <b>management,</b> and {{is present in the}} fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. It is responsible for the visual expressions of the individual product brand, with its diverse customer–brand touch points and the execution of the brand through design.|$|E
5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of <b>brand</b> <b>management</b> is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate <b>brand</b> <b>management.</b>|$|E

5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of <b>brand</b> <b>management,</b> commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character and brand as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.

According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing and <b>brand</b> <b>management</b> for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to better {{understand}} the <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> process from the employees’ perspective. Specifically, it explores how the different dimensions of <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> influence employees’ attitudinal and behavioural responses. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study was carried out to test the proposed model. The sample consisted of 297 employees in the UK financial services sector. Hypothesis testing was conducted using partial least square regression. Findings: Results indicate that effective <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> can increase employees’ identification with their organisations. Specifically, the most influential dimension is the employee-client focus. Results also show that organisational identification is a key variable to explain job satisfaction, word-of-mouth and brand citizenship behaviour. Research limitations/implications: This study focusses on the UK financial sector. To explore the generalisability of results, replication studies among other sectors and countries would be useful. The cross-sectional nature of the study also limits its causal inference. Practical implications: This study shows the importance of <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> to foster positive employee attitudes and actions that go beyond their job responsibilities. The model developed may help organisations analyse the impact of managerial actions, monitoring the potential effects of changes in <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> amongst employees. Originality/value: Although numerous conceptual frameworks highlight the importance of <b>brand</b> identity <b>management,</b> empirical studies in this area are scarce. The current work extends previous research by empirically analysing the effects of the dimensions of <b>brand</b> identity <b>management</b> from the employees’ perspective...|$|R

500|$|The {{authority}} and {{position of the}} design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does {{in his or her}} daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function: design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a [...] "line function" [...] is directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the [...] "primary" [...] organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited {{authority and}} the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a [...] "secondary" [...] organisational process, design management is seen as [...] "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, <b>brand</b> <b>management,</b> marketing, R, and communication.
