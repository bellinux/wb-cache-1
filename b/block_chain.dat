50|$|In bicycle chains, skip-link chain has {{the same}} one-inch spacing as the earlier <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Due to the asymmetry, the rollers fit over long teeth used with earlier <b>block</b> <b>chain,</b> but due {{to the use of}} rollers, {{efficiency}} is better than <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Skip-link chain is typically arranged with the long plates also the wide-spaced outer plates, which mimics the visual effect of <b>block</b> <b>chain.</b> Since sprocket teeth run on rollers, they cannot be usefully wider than the width of the narrow-spaced links, so the tooth can be no wider than with a symmetrical chain. Thus, skip-link chain spreads wear over half the number of teeth and has worse sprocket durability than a symmetrical roller chain. Chain wear is dominated by wear between pins and bushings, and this is the same as a modern roller chain.|$|E
50|$|The Solidus Bond {{utilizes}} SHA-256 elliptical encryption on a decentralized <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> {{to create}} and redeem debt instruments issued in a digital currency. The bonds are brought into existence upon command by any investor via algorithm rather than fiat. Coupon payments and bond redemption are also executed by algorithm, {{eliminating the need for}} brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the <b>block</b> <b>chain</b> ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond <b>block</b> <b>chain,</b> then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In current day scenario, {{the need}} to protect {{information}} has become very important and hence the need for cryptographic algorithms is high. Here, we extend the parallel key encryption algorithm and bring out its full potential by implementing the various cryptographic modes such as cipher <b>block</b> <b>chaining</b> and interleaved cipher <b>block</b> <b>chaining</b> where commendable increase in efficiency and reduction in encryption and decryption time can be seen. We have also considerably increased the key size by using 1024 bit and 2048 bit keys for the algorithmic implementation and in CBC and interleaved CBC execution. Our practical analysis has brought to front the salient features of the parallel key encryption algorithm and its ability to provide enhanced data protection when using a larger key size along with its randomness property. In theoretical analysis, it can be shown that remarkable reduction in encryption and decryption time of cryptographic systems is achieved and an enhanced strength to the system against brute force attacks is achieved. Furthermore, PCA can be extended for different cryptographic modes, using varying key size and number of keys used in the process.
