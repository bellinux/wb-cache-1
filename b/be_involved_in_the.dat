These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes.

In bacteria, this overlap may <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
