40|$|This paper {{presents}} a re-assessment {{of the date}} and constructional sequence of the Sanctuary, a later Neolithic timber <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> <b>setting</b> on Overton Hill, near Avebury. Previous interpretations involving elaborate phasing and a protracted chronology for the site are rejected. Instead, {{it is argued that}} the site re{{presents a}} single or double phase monument, constructed around 2500 cal BC and associated with pottery of the Grooved Ware tradition. The character of the pre-monument activity, construction and use of the site is examined. Patterns of formal deposition, involving pottery, lithics and human bone, are recognized, and considered {{in the context of the}} site's architecture and the structured organization of space, access and movement...|$|R
40|$|The Primary {{objectives}} of this creative project were {{the exploration of}} well-known fairy tales (such as Snow White), {{and the process of}} creating interactive jewelry based on my own personal interpretation of these stories. I designed and constructed seven jewelry pieces using traditional metal working techniques along with innovative contemporary surface treatments such as etching, sandblasting and colored pencil decoration. Each piece contained a "surprise" interactive element - some pieces contain moving parts, while others contain small pieces of fabric tape on which sentences are written. These tapes are mechanized to wind up into the ring or pendant. This body of work required a variety of metalsmithing techniques including complex constructions, copper forming, casting, lathe turning, <b>and</b> <b>stone</b> <b>setting.</b> Department of ArtThesis (M.
