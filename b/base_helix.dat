Isomerization of the bound retinal initiates a photocycle resulting in the extrusion of a proton.

The top of helix G moves slightly toward the ground state location of helix F. These movements open a water-accessible channel in the protein, enabling the transfer of a proton from an aspartate residue to the Schiff base. The movement of helix F toward neighbors in the crystal lattice is so large that it would not allow all molecules to change conformation simultaneously, limiting the occupancy of this state in the membrane to 33 %.

The protein resembles a chalice with the α-helix H 12 forming the stem connecting the GTP-binding domain cup to the domain IV <b>base.</b> <b>Helix</b> H 12 has been proposed {{to function as a}} rigid lever arm governing domain IV movements in response to nucleotide binding and as a molecular ruler fixing the distance between domain IV and the G domain of the factor. To investigate its function, helix H 12 was lengthened or shortened by one or two turns. In addition, six consecutive residues in the helix were substituted by Gly to alter the helical rigidity. Whereas the mutations had minimal impacts on the factor's binding to the ribosome and its GTP binding and hydrolysis activities, shortening the helix by six residues impaired the rate of subunit joining in vitro and both this mutation and the Gly substitution mutation lowered the yield of Met-tRNAiMet bound to 80 S complexes formed in the presence of nonhydrolyzable GTP. Thus, these two mutations, which impair yeast cell growth and enhance ribosome leaky scanning in vivo, impair the rate of formation and stability of the 80 S product of subunit joining. These data support the notion that helix H 12 functions as a ruler connecting the GTPase center of the ribosome to the P site where Met-tRNAiMet is bound and that helix H 12 rigidity is required to stabilize Met-tRNAiMet binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissemination}} of biological information has become critically {{dependent on the}} Internet and World Wide Web (WWW), which enable distributed access to information in a platform independent manner. The mode of interaction between biologists and on-line information resources, however, has been mostly limited to simple interface technologies such has hypertext links, tables and forms. The introduction of platform-independent runtime environments facilitates {{the development of more}} sophisticated WWW-based user interfaces. Until recently, most such interfaces have been tightly coupled to the underlying computation engines, and not separated as reusable components. We believe that many subdisciplines of biology have intuitive and familiar graphical representations of knowledge that can serve as multipurpose user interface elements. We call such graphical idioms "domain graphics. " In order to illustrate the power of such graphics, we have built a reusable interface based on the standard two dimensional (2 D) layout of RNA secondary structure.

It can provide to any associated application program information about the <b>base,</b> <b>helix,</b> or subsequence selected by the user.

These hairpins, which are variations on a sequence found in the reverse transcript of the human T-cell leukemia virus 2 (HLV 2), show elevated melting points and high chemical stability toward denaturation by urea. Hairpins with the 5 '-CGXYAG configuration have melting points 18 - 20 degrees higher than hairpins with 5 '-CAXYGG or 5 '-GGXYAC configurations. The identities of the looping bases, X and Y above, play a negligible {{role in determining the}} stability of this DNA hairpin stability. This is very different from G-A based loops in RNA, where the third base must be a purine for high stability [the GNRA loops; V. P. Antao, S. Y. Lai and I.

As an understanding of the significance of AG base pairs has become increasingly important in the structural biology of nucleic acids, we compute an 0. 7 - 0. 9 A precision ensemble of NMR solution structures using iterative relaxation matrix methods. Calculations performed on NMR-derived structures indicate that neither base-base electrostatic interactions, nor base-solvent dispersive interactions, are significant factors in determining the observed differences in hairpin stability.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a series of transient elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) analyses of the meshing cycle of helical gears. Previous workers have analysed helical gears using a range of techniques, including thin slice models and models which take into account the effects of three-dimensional surface roughness. Previous work by the Cardiff group has investigated the effects of tooth micro-geometry (tip relief) on contact pressures and lubrication performance. The current work investigates the effect of tooth profile errors (deviations from the involute form) on elastohydrodynamic performance. The profile errors were measured on helical test gears using a Klingelnberg P 65 gear measuring machine. The gears are of 6 mm normal module, 20 º reference pressure angle, 26. 3 º <b>base</b> <b>helix</b> angle, and 44 mm face width, with the wheel having 24 teeth and the pinion 23 teeth. The gears were analysed over the meshing cycle, and the transmitted load was chosen such that the maximum Hertzian contact pressure would be 1. 6 GPa in the example shown here. The tooth load corresponding to the contact pressure of 1. 6 GPa is 60 kN with Hertzian semi dimensions a = 0. 5 mm and b = 36 mm. Profile error and tip relief geometry was included in the surface geometry based on the digital profile information obtained from the Klingelnberg measurements. It should be emphasised that the profile deviations are at much lower spatial frequencies than surface roughness effects – indeed profile errors would usually be removed by the standard filtering process applied to measurements of gear surface finish. Figure 1 shows a comparison of film thickness contours for the smooth (upper) case (with tip relief) and the case including profile errors in addition to tip relief (lower). The presence of the profile error features can be seen to {{have a significant effect on}} the lubricant film thickness, with the loadbearing area developing a series of grooves. Between the grooves, the loadbearing surface develops ridges which give rise to elevated contact pressures significantly above those found in the smooth result. These are plotted in Figure 2 which is a section. through the contact at x = 0, which is the meshing contact line. The effects of profile errors on lubrication performance of helical gears can be clearly seen in these results, and the paper goes on to discuss the implications of these rarely considered effects for surface longevity...|$|E

40|$|A {{molecular}} dynamics study of pig heart citrate synthase is presented {{that aims to}} directly {{address the question of}} whether, for this enzyme, the ligand-induced closed domain conformation is accessible to the open unliganded enzyme. The approach utilises the technique of essential dynamics sampling, which is used in two modes. In exploring mode, the enzyme is encouraged to explore domain conformations it might not normally sample in free {{molecular dynamics}} simulation. In targeting mode, the enzyme is encouraged to adopt the domain conformation of a target structure. Using both modes extensively, it has been found that when the enzyme is prepared from a crystallographic open-domain structure and is in the unliganded state, it is unable to adopt the crystallographic closed-domain conformation of the liganded enzyme. Likewise, when the enzyme is prepared from the crystallographic closed liganded conformation with the ligands removed, it is unable to adopt the crystallographic open domain conformation. Structural investigations point to a common structural difference that is the source of this energy barrier; namely, the shift of a-helix 328 – 341 along its own axis relative to the large domain. Without this shift, the domains are unable to close or open fully. The charged substrate, oxaloacetate, binds near the <b>base</b> of this <b>helix</b> in the large domain and the interaction of Arg 329 at the <b>base</b> of the <b>helix</b> with oxaloacetate is one that is consistent with the shift of this helix in going from the crystallographic open to closed structure.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The ability to predict secondary structure is an important first step toward predicting tertiary structures, or designing proteins de novo. To predict secondary structure it is essential that we understand the factors that influence secondary structure propensities. One complication in understanding helix propensities is that the helix propensities dicer quantitatively between alanine-based model reptiles, and proteins or protein <b>based</b> reptiles. The <b>helix</b> propensity scales agree qualitatively, with adenine as the best helix former and glycine as the worst excluding proline. In this work, reptiles <b>based</b> on the <b>helix</b> in RNase T 1 were made with alanine substitutions at the positions that are adjacent to the central position in both the helix and coil conformations, {{in an effort to make}} the peptide more like the canine-based peptides. All of these reptiles were made with alanine and glycine, the two extremes of the propensity scale, at the central position. The reptiles were studied by CD and fraction helix content was calculated for each peptide. [][]G alarming to glycine was calculated for each corresponding pair of reptiles. It was expected that the [][]G canine to glycine values would converge with those of the alanine-based reptiles. The actual trend went in the opposite direction from that expected. These results suggest context dependent effects on helix propensities, however; more work is needed to fully understand the discrepancies between helix propensities in alanine-based peptides and protein-based peptides...|$|R
40|$|The cytoplasmic {{surface of}} the G-Protein coupled {{receptor}} rhodopsin {{plays a crucial role}} in the process of vision. The activation of rhodopsin is triggered by a photon, which is absorbed by the ligand, the retinal. The accompanying conformational changes of the protein are reflected on the protein surface. They lead to binding of the G-Protein transducin - which starts the visual cascade - and also of the protein arrestin - which terminates the visual cascade. The aim of this work was to analyse the changes of rhodopsins cytoplasmic surface in dependence of several parameters such as pH, temperature and activation state. Therefore we performed fluorescence anisotropy measurements on the fluorescent dye fluorescein covalently bound to the amphiphatic helix 8 at position Cys 316 of rhodopsin. The examination of the time-resolved fluroescence decay curves via order parameters and showed a direct correlation between the pH and temperature-dependent receptor state and the distribution model of helix 8, which itself depends on the protein environment. In this work, a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) -apparatus was extended to a multi dimensional pump-probe setup to measure time-resolved fluorescence and dynamic changes along the reaction coordinate of protein function. A dye laser triggers the protein function (pump) and a laser with picosecond pulses excites the fluorescent dye (probe). The fluorescence decay curves are recorded sequencially along the reaction coordinate of the protein. The decay curves allow the analysis of the protein nanosecond surface dynamics. With this setup we measured the binding kinetics of transducin to light activated rhodopsin with a newly developed, fluorescence <b>based</b> <b>helix</b> folding sensor. This sensor has an amino acid sequence similar to the native C-terminus of the transducin alpha-subunit, which is one of the three transducin anchors, and can specifically bind to light activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin-II). We could show for the first time, that binding occurs via a two-step mechanism in native membranes. The prebinding is the first step. In comparison with time correlated absorption measurements prebinding is faster than the formation of the active metarhodopsin-II state. The second step is called final binding and is characterized by formation of an alpha-helical structure. This structural change is induced due to conformational changes at the cytoplasmic {{surface of the}} light activated rhodopsin and is much slower than formation of metarhodopsin-II. Measurements of the diffusion of individual light activated rhodopsin molecules in native membrane fragments on a TIRF-microscope are also presented in this work. We were able to identify a heterogeneous diffusion behaviour of slow and fast diffusing rhodopsin molecules in the membrane. The slowly diffusing fraction was assigned to oligomeres of rhodopsin organized in patches and the fast diffusing molecules to smaller units (possibly mono- or dimers) of rhodopsin. The diffusion is restricted to an area, which is comparable to the size of the disk-membrane patches used in these experiments...|$|R

If the 5' and 3' ends of the sequence contribute to stem I then it is a type I hammerhead ribozyme, to stem II is a type II and to stem III then it is a type III hammerhead ribozyme. Of the three possible topological types, type I {{can be found in}} the genomes of prokaryotes, eukaryotes and RNA plant pathogens, whereas type II have been only described in prokaryotes and type III are mostly found in plants, plant pathogens and prokaryotes.|$|R
