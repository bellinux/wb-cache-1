5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003.

It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{the body}} of a 38-year-old woman, seven months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in an open field four days after she had disappeared from her residence in Panama. A plastic bag had been left over her head, and she had been gagged; the case was ruled a homicide. The <b>body</b> <b>had</b> suffered from the tropical heat and high humidity, and was bloated and highly discolored. At autopsy, the remains of the fetus were discovered in the woman's undergarments.

5|$|In September 1972, 5,667 {{students}} {{entered the}} new state university, the largest opening day enrollment at the time.

A typical student entering FIU was 25 years old and attending school full-time while holding down a full-time job. Forty-three percent were married. Negotiations with the University of Miami and Dade County Junior College led FIU to open as an upper-division only school. It would be 9 years before lower-division classes were added.|$|E
