During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque should not have <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to the course for promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most {{had to wait until}} 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E

25|$|Though Knoop {{of course}} {{had been only}} four {{at the time of}} the battle, so he had no {{personal}} knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> as a general-staff member he had access to the after-battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in actual possession of one, but he never bothered to consult them). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book based on all these sources. This book (published with the explicit consent of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneoulsy offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary. But Siborne stayed safely in England.|$|E
500|$|According to University of Illinois {{historian}} James Anderson in the film, [...] "His {{story is}} a story of great accomplishment, of heroic efforts and overcoming tremendous odds...a story about who we are and what we stand for and the challenges that have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> the challenges that are still with us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{setting of}} Gone to Coney Island is Coney Island, a popular {{amusement}} park and picture subject.

Those who have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> those who have heard of it know what it means. Perhaps nothing further is required." [...] Bowers notes that the popularity of Coney Island was itself able to make a successful film regardless of the scenario involved. Booming Business is notable because it appears to have contained slapstick comedy if The New York Dramatic Mirror review was accurate. Edwin Thanhouser specifically stated that the company would not produce slapstick comedy in an article in The Moving Picture World.|$|E

2500|$|... 8 November: the Remembrance Day bombing at Enniskillen killed 11 {{civilians and}} one RUC officer, and injured 63 people. Another bomb had been planted at Tullyhommon Post Office, near Pettigoe, County Fermanagh. A Remembrance Sunday parade (which {{included}} {{many members of}} the Boys' and Girls' Brigades) had unwittingly gathered near the Tullyhommon bomb. British soldiers and RUC officers had also <b>been</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> the IRA said it triggered the bomb when soldiers were standing beside it. It was defused by security forces and was found to have a command wire leading to a [...] "firing point" [...] across the border.

[...] Bankhead, who loathed both Nazism and Communism, was outraged and thought Hellman a moral hypocrite. Hellman had never been to Finland, and Bankhead, as did the rest of the cast, suspected she refused the benefit due to a fanatical devotion to Soviet Russia. As a result of the feud, Hellman, who did not like being questioned and was used to getting her way, and Bankhead, who was always outspoken and hated being crossed when she knew she was morally right, became enemies.|$|E
2500|$|A rematch {{between the}} two fighters was {{described}} (in 2009) as being [...] "much anticipated", but has failed to eventuate.

2500|$|Some of the {{features}} in the early releases of the game were criticized by reviewers. GameSpys Mike Sharkey {{did not believe that}} the new content added was good, pointing out that the game provides very {{little in the way of}} new content; and that the Elo rating system seems ineffective, having many players of various skill levels all playing at once throughout the early days of release. Evan Lahti from PC Gamer noted that the majority of new official maps in Global Offensive were only for Arms Race or Demolition game modes; while Classic maps were only given [...] "smart adjustments" [...] to minor details. Pinsof thought that in its release state, it would not be the final version of the game to be released. Paul Goodman said that long-time fans of the series, Global Offensive will start to show the game's age, saying that he [...] "couldn't help but feel that I had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> done that a dozen times before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first eleven episodes {{were set}} {{primarily}} in Neverland; co-creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis {{spoke about the}} setting of the third season stating, [...] "Neverland is a land of belief, a land of imagination, and a land where all our main characters are being stripped down to their core. It’s really allowing us, as writers, to dig deep into who they are and to push them forward to new places. I think being in Neverland {{is going to have a}} profound effect on each of the characters. It’s really fun to see these characters and dig deep this year and explore what it’s like for Emma to [...] her parents. Neverland is really a place where we can sit down and think about that." [...] The two also noted that Peter Pan will feature in the season but will be a more [...] "complicated" [...] version of the character, with Kitsis saying, [...] "We have not yet met Peter Pan and we have not yet seen Neverland, and that is where we're going!" [...] In a further interview, Horowitz stated, [...] "Well for us, Neverland is kind of a place that makes you confront your past. It's sort of the heart of darkness and to be a 200-year-old person, you know because you don't grow up there, you have to keep yourself amused. However long Peter Pan has <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> for whatever reason he has been there, we intend to reveal our take on that and on the legend of Peter Pan. We have a way that it intertwines with our Once Upon a Time mythology that we're really excited to unveil." [...] At Disney's D23 Expo event, the creators hinted at romantic sparks between Emma Swan and Captain Hook, and revelations about how Hook became a pirate. On March 10, 2014, the producers revealed that they may look ahead at incorporating characters from the films The Princess and the Frog, Brave, and Frozen in future episodes, possibly towards the end of the third season if they get the green light from Disney. Later that month, it was announced that the season finale will air on May 11, 2014 and have a duration of two hours.|$|E
2500|$|Mulford began {{traveling}} to Mexico in 1935 taking {{his first trip}} with Tibor Pataky, an artist friend. This trip was written about in his book Adventures in Mexico. He returned with Racine, his second wife in 1936 and began making frequent trips to South America over the next twenty years. Mulford had {{a great interest in}} finding both new and old species of plants that could be used as both indoor decorations and landscape material. In 1938 Mulford made a Cuban expedition and from this trip he introduced Agave caribbea to Florida. Around this same time Mulford met Lyman Smith who was working at Harvard's Gray Herbarium, being referred to him by sources in the Smithsonian. Lyman ultimately would be of help with the identification and classification of the bromeliads that Mulford would be collecting. It is Lyman Smith who directed him to Brazil as he had himself <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> collected specimens. Mulford had initially expressed an interest in exploring Dutch Guiana Mulford's and Racine's book Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, a long out of print book but available through used sources was a well told story of their 1940 trip to Brazil. The book was a success and its completion brought the artful teamwork that was to mark the relationship between Racine and Mulford. His keen vision, liveliness and resourcefulness balanced with her devotion and help in caring for all of the plants and helping organize his materials, keep fastidious notes of her own were replicated many times over the years with many projects. In 1939 Mulford set off to Brazil again for six months covering much better known areas than their previous trip. Mulford was again able to find new species in places that were supposedly already previously explored and declared exhausted by prior collectors over the previous one hundred and fifty years. Mulford recollected a number of [...] "lost" [...] species during his trips to Brazil. He introduced the brilliant yellow flowering tree, Tabebuia umbellate to North America. This tree is now famous in Orlando, Florida. In 1940 he made his second six month expedition to Brazil and Trinidad this time specializing on bromeliads, orchids and philodendrons. From this trip he introduced many new bromeliads and the now famous self-heading philodendrons. World War II put a stop to further expeditions for some years. Mulford turned his attention to cultivating and popularizing the bromeliads. He continued to work with Lyman Smith who continued to describe and identify the bromeliads that had been brought back from Brazil in the preceding years. In 1946 Mulford resumed his expeditions. From Brazil he brought back the begonia acetosa and introduced it to US gardeners. He and Racine also traveled to Columbia. This trip followed the earlier trail of the famous Edouard Andre to confirm and add to his discoveries 75 years before. These were {{considered one of the most}} important bromeliad areas of Latin America. In 1948 he made a plant expedition around South America collecting in Dutch Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia Costa Rica, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Trinidad. Several years later in 1951 he would leave on a Venezuelan plant expedition. This was followed in 1954 to Jamaica with his final plant collecting trip made to Mexico in 1957. During these trips Mulford not only collected thousands of herbarium specimens for the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, DC where all of the scientific data is now on file but he also collected thousands of seeds and live plants to enrich the variety for Florida gardens.|$|E
