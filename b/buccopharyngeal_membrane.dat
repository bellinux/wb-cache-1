40|$|Article Outline: A 6 -month-old term infant was {{referred}} {{with a history}} of snuffly breathing and obstructive sleep-disturbed breathing unless she was postured upright. From birth she had had daily right-sided rhinorrhea, which was mostly grayish and of egg-white consistency. It had not responded to antibiotics or intranasal steroids. Feeding was slow but weight gain was normal. Perinatal history was unremarkable, with cigarette smoking 4 per week the only potential teratogen identified. Clinical examination showed a left unilateral middle ear effusion, a left preauricular sinus, a bifid tip of uvula, and ankyloglossia. Flexible transnasal endoscopy demonstrated a pale skin-covered finger-like projection, arising from the left lateral nasopharyngeal wall in close proximity to the Eustachian tube, crossing to the contralateral side. CT showed patent bony choanae bilaterally with a 9 × 7 -mm soft tissue density superior to the soft palate. MRI (T 2 weighting and T 1 fat saturation, pre- and postcontrast) showed a 7 -mm-diameter lesion projecting 12. 5 mm into the pharynx. It was separate to the left internal carotid artery, with slight contrast enhancement. The absence {{of a wide range of}} signal intensities and the ordered structure suggested teratoma unlikely. There appeared to be a cord-like extension with concentric ring structure immediately adjacent to the Eustachian tube, to the skull base postero-inferior to the Eustachian tube. Under general anesthesia a combined transnasal and retropalatal endoscopic approach was commenced. The attachment of the lesion to the mucosa of the anterior aspect of the Eustachian tube was needle-point diathermy-divided under vision and then with steady traction using non-thru-cut forceps the lesion was avulsed from its origin in the postero-inferior aspect of the lower third of the Eustachian tube, and delivered transorally. After removal the size of the left Eustachian tube orifice was seen to be 4 to 5 times that of the right (Fig 1 - Dilated Eustachian tube orifice after removal of hairy polyp). The operative procedure was uncomplicated. The left unilateral mucoid effusion was aspirated. Histopathology demonstrated a 15 × 7 × 7 -mm polypoid lesion covered by epidermis with associated adnexae (hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and eccrine glands) overlying a core of fibroadipose tissue with minor salivary glands and skeletal muscle. This was characterized as a “hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube. ” At general anesthetic for division of the ankyloglossia 5 months postexcision there was no recurrence of either the lesion or the middle ear effusion, and the orifice of the Eustachian tube had shrunk so as to be only a little larger than the contralateral side. Discussion: “Hairy polyp of the nasopharynx” is a clinico-pathological descriptive term. The clinical description derives from macroscopically visible fine hairs arising from the pale external covering of skin (Fig 2 - Hairy polyp of the Eustachian tube). At flexible or rigid transnasal or retropalatal endoscopy they typically appear as a sausage-like lesion projecting medially across the nasopharynx. Up to 2004, 114 cases of hairy polyp of the nasopharynx had been described, most arising from the lateral pharyngeal wall. Origin specifically from the Eustachian tube was thought to be excessively rare but it is quite possible that increasing use of nasal endoscopes before and after removal will show that origin from within the lower end of the Eustachian tube is more common than previously thought. It is presumably this origin that resulted in dilation of the developing cartilaginous Eustachian tube; and removal of the hairy polyp allowed remodeling towards a normal size. They most commonly present early in the first year, with a female preponderance up to 6 : 1. Presentation with nasal signs and symptoms occurs when nasopharyngeal and nasal obstruction predominate, and occurs with otologic signs and symptoms when Eustachian tube obstruction coexists. When larger, the lesions may be visible below the soft palate or acting as a ball-valve may obstruct the larynx causing positional cyanosis; indeed, fatal obstruction has been reported. Several theories of embryologic origin exist. Hairy polyps arising from the Eustachian tube may originate in the fourth postconceptual week from entrapped cells between the first pouch endoderm and first cleft ectoderm. Because they resemble the pinna, they have been postulated to be accessory auricles arising “internally” from the first branchial anlarge. Less likely would seem to be persistence of the bucconasal or <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membranes,</b> or uncontrolled development from entrapped pluripotential cells...|$|R

50|$|In embryogenesis, Rathke's pouch is an evagination at {{the roof}} of the {{developing}} mouth in front of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane.</b> It gives rise to the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis), a part of the endocrine system.|$|E
50|$|In humans, the {{development}} proceeds differently. The <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> is {{created in the}} foregut and it is perforated during the 4th week of human development, creating the primitive mouth, whereas the cloacal membrane is created in the hindgut and it is perforated during the 8th week of human development, creating the primitive anus after the mouth opening has already been created.|$|E
50|$|The {{region where}} the crescentic {{masses of the}} {{ectoderm}} and endoderm come into direct {{contact with each other}} constitutes a thin membrane, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> (or oropharyngeal membrane), which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx. In front of the buccopharyngeal area, where the lateral crescents of mesoderm fuse in the middle line, the pericardium is afterward developed, and this region is therefore designated the pericardial area.|$|E
50|$|The {{extension}} of the mesoderm takes place throughout {{the whole of the}} embryonic and extra-embryonic areas of the ovum, except in certain regions. One of these is seen immediately in front of the neural tube. Here the mesoderm extends forward in the form of two crescentic masses, which meet in the middle line so as to enclose behind them an area that is devoid of mesoderm. Over this area, the ectoderm and endoderm come into direct contact with each other and constitute a thin membrane, the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane,</b> which forms a septum between the primitive mouth and pharynx.|$|E
50|$|The dental lamina is {{a band of}} {{epithelial}} tissue seen in histologic sections of a developing tooth. The dental lamina is first evidence of tooth development and begins (in humans) at the sixth week in utero or {{three weeks after the}} rupture of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane.</b> It is formed when cells of the oral ectoderm proliferate faster than cells of other areas. Best described as an in-growth of oral ectoderm, the dental lamina is frequently distinguished from the vestibular lamina, which develops concurrently. This dividing tissue is surrounded by and, some would argue, stimulated by ectomesenchymal growth. When it is present, the dental lamina connects the developing tooth bud to the epithelium of the oral cavity. Eventually, the dental lamina disintegrates into small clusters of epithelium and is resorbed. In situations when the clusters are not resorbed, (this remnant of the dental lamina is sometimes known as the glands of Serres) eruption cysts are formed over the developing tooth and delay its eruption into the oral cavity. This invagination of ectodermal tissues is the progenitor to the later ameloblasts and enamel while the ectomesenchyme is responsible for the dental papilla and later odontoblasts.|$|E

30|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forth to explain the association between cleft palate and intraoral synechiae. The most convincing is the sequence of cleft palate predisposing to increased mucosal contact between tongue and developing alveolus [1]. Other possible mechanisms like persistence of <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> and local ischemia of amniotic bands causing pressure on the first branchial arch also explain the rare occurrence of isolated alveolar synechiae. Airway management presents unique challenges to the anesthesia team. Blind nasal intubation was attempted in the past [5]. Tracheostomy is, generally, reserved {{as a last resort}} in these patients with only one article quoting the need for tracheostomy in a 38 -week-old male infant presenting with marked desaturations [3]. Nasotracheal intubation with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope as performed in our case is considered the gold standard [1, 5].|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to determine if}} respiratory changes might occur in conjunction with migrations of the rough-skinned newt, Taricha granulosa (Skilton) {{in and out of}} ponds in the Willamette Valley. A field study was carried on from December 1964 through October 1965 to investigate certain physical and chemical parameters imposed on T. granulosa in relation to respiration. A laboratory study of Taricha in the summer and winter was conducted to uncover any changes in oxygen uptake by the various respiratory surfaces. The investigations found that the animals had a higher respiratory rate in winter than in summer. When they left the ponds in late summer the percent of pulmonary respiration increased and the percent of cutaneous respiration decreased. When the animals again took up their aquatic habitat in the winter cutaneous respiration assumed a dominant role. Oxygen uptake through the pulmonary system appeared to increase substantially with temperature in the range 10 ° to 25 °C, while cutaneous oxygen uptake appeared to increase slightly in the same range. Carbon dioxide was released primarily by the skin in both summer and winter. Temperature coefficients were generally lower than values predicted by van't Hoff's rule which may be an adaptation to Taricha's exposure to wide fluctuations in temperature. The exponential value of b in the equation M = aW[superscript b] indicated metabolism (M) increased by the 2 / 3 power of weight (W). This relationship did not appear to change significantly from summer to winter, that is, from terrestial phase to aquatic phase, even though the predominant route of oxygen uptake changed from lungs to skin. The <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> appeared to have a respiratory function in T. granulosa. Animals maintained underwater with their lungs and skin eliminated from respiration were shown to consume measurable amounts of oxygen. The atmospheric respiratory potentials of the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> and lungs were found to be of the same order of magnitude, except at 25 ° C. The flexibility of shifting to alternate respiratory surfaces for oxygen uptake is believed to be a factor in the ability of Taricha granulosa to survive and to successfully exploit new habitats...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo feed or breathe, {{the oral}} opening must {{connect with the}} gut. The foregut and oral tissues {{converge}} at the primary mouth, forming the <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> (BPM), a bilayer epithelium. Failure to form the opening between gut and mouth has significant ramifications, and many craniofacial disorders {{have been associated with}} defects in this process. Oral perforation is characterized by dissolution of the BPM, but little is known about this process. In humans, failure to form a continuous mouth opening is associated with mutations in Hedgehog (Hh) pathway members; however, the role of Hh in primary mouth development is untested. Here, we show, using Xenopus, that Hh signaling is necessary and sufficient to initiate mouth formation, and that Hh activation is required in a dose-dependent fashion to determine the size of the mouth. This activity lies upstream of the previously demonstrated role for Wnt signal inhibition in oral perforation. We then turn to mouse mutants to establish that SHH and Gli 3 are indeed necessary for mammalian mouth development. Our data suggest that Hh-mediated BPM persistence may underlie oral defects in human craniofacial syndromes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe initial opening {{between the}} gut {{and the outside}} of the deuterostome embryo breaks through at the extreme anterior. This region is unique in that {{ectoderm}} and endoderm are directly juxtaposed, without intervening mesoderm. This opening has been called the stomodeum, <b>buccopharyngeal</b> <b>membrane</b> or oral cavity at various stages of its formation, however, in order to clarify its function, we have termed this the “primary mouth”. In vertebrates, the neural crest grows around the primary mouth to form the face and a “secondary mouth” forms. The primary mouth then becomes the pharyngeal opening. In order to establish a molecular understanding of primary mouth formation, we have begun to examine this process during Xenopus laevis development. An early step during this process occurs at tailbud and involves dissolution of the basement membrane between the ectoderm and endoderm. This is followed by ectodermal invagination to create the stomodeum. A subsequent step involves localized cell death in the ectoderm, which may lead to ectodermal thinning. Subsequently, ectoderm and endoderm apparently intercalate to generate one to two cell layers. The final step is perforation, where (after hatching) the primary mouth opens. Fate mapping has defined the ectodermal and endodermal regions that will form the primary mouth. Extirpations and transplants of these and adjacent regions indicate that, at tailbud, the oral ectoderm is not specifically required for primary mouth formation. In contrast, underlying endoderm and surrounding regions are crucial, presumably sources of necessary signals. This study indicates the complexity of primary mouth formation, and lays the groundwork for future molecular analyses of this important structure...|$|E
