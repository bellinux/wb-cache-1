5|$|The {{curriculum}} emphasizes writing; {{students are}} required to complete a semester project each term on a topic chosen in conjunction with an advisor, and are required to complete a research paper during their third year. All students must pass a basic-studies comprehensive examination to register for upper-level courses, and at least one area-studies comprehensive examination (usually in their area of concentration) to graduate. A senior thesis is required of all students. Usually an analytic or expository essay, it may also <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> original fiction, poetry, a performance or work of visual art. Students are encouraged to present their theses orally, and the public is invited to the presentations.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of Orion existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions Orion, the Hunter, and Orion, the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once Orion was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while Orion, the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} ideasthesia has been often {{discussed}} {{in relation to}} art, and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art. According to the theory, we consider something to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> art when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, {{a piece of art}} makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) [...] in other words, idea is well balanced with aesthesia.|$|E

500|$|On November 19, 1872, {{while the}} coinage bill was still before Congress, Linderman made {{a report to}} the Secretary of the Treasury. In the report, Linderman argued that the coin need not hold legal tender status, and that it could simply <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> silver {{imprinted}} with its weight and fineness. Linderman also notes that such a product could supersede the Mexican dollar and eventually command a six to eight percent premium; at that time, American silver exported to the Orient was being sold at a two percent discount. Linderman proposed that the coin be named the [...] "silver union" [...] in order to distinguish it from the standard coins then in production.|$|E

NASA later confirmed the object to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that launched Apollo 16 into space. In July 2011, after returning the piece of debris at NASA's request, 16-year-old Schanze was given an all-access tour of the Kennedy Space Center and VIP seating for the launch of STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle program.|$|E
500|$|... "Today Is Your Day" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of 3 minutes and 12 seconds. The song is a slow mid-tempo ballad of the country pop genre. Nonetheless, several critics, such as Nicholas Köhler and Ken MacQueen Maclean's, have {{described}} the track to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> pop music, rather than country music. It commences with a sole piano accompanying Twain's voice, and later progresses to an assortment of banjo, string instruments and other instrumentation. However, the production is maintained as sparse, leaving Twain's vocals at center. The lyrics are written in second person and discuss optimism and personal upliftment. In the bridge she sings, [...] "Brush yourself off no regrets / This {{is as good as}} it gets / Don’t expect more or less / Just go out and give it your best", meaning one must be able to disregard dreaming for a better day because [...] "today is all you’ve got". Melinda Newman of HitFix presumed, considering Twain's back story, that Twain wrote [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] as a message for herself.|$|E

500|$|Meredith Blake, {{reviewer}} for the Los Angeles Times, {{said that}} the episode {{was a sort of}} masculine companion piece to the fourth season episode [...] "The Beautiful Girls", as [...] "Signal 30" [...] focuses on [...] "collective identity crisis of the agency's male population". Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell [...] "one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today" [...] and called the dripping sink [...] "more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn’t do something to plug it up soon, he’s going to drown." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode [...] "a classic" [...] and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt the kitchen sink symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always a chip on his shoulder and he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but he can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> work." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to J.O. Awolalu, {{proselytizing}} Christians and Muslims have mislabelled idol to mean false god, when in {{the reality}} of most traditions of Africa, the object may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> wood or iron or stone, yet it is [...] "symbolic, an emblem and implies the spiritual idea which is worshipped". The material objects may decay or get destroyed, the emblem may crumble or substituted, but the spiritual idea that it represents to the heart and mind of an African traditionalist remains unchanged. Sylvester Johnson – a professor of African American and Religious Studies, concurs with Awolalu, and states that the colonial era missionaries who arrived in Africa, neither understood the regional languages nor the African theology, and interpreted the images and ritualism as [...] "epitome of idolatry", projecting the iconoclastic controversies in Europe they grew up with, onto Africa.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{promoted}} [...] "Coming of Age" [...] {{by releasing}} a time-lapse music {{video of a}} seven-story mural of the Supermodel album cover being painted in downtown Los Angeles. Young and Sick, who also designed artwork for Torches, designed the mural. The painting took over ten days to complete. Although Young and Sick designed the mural, the actual painting was done by artists LeBA and Vyal {{under the guidance of}} Danial Lahoda, the owner and director of LALAarts. Foster explained that the mural wasn't intended to be a promotion for the album cover: [...] "it's meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> art for the city that happens to be an album cover." [...] On January 23, 2014, the band played a free show in front of the mural. Following some legal controversy, the Supermodel mural was later painted over.|$|E
