5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the skylark, corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. <b>Breeding</b> <b>performance</b> has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E

50|$|Breeding time in red-billed gulls is {{expressed}} only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> substantially.

By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because sex-limited traits are almost always heritable within the sex {{in which they are}} expressed.|$|E

50|$|Populations {{of lesser}} spotted {{woodpeckers}} are mostly resident, {{but can be}} nomadic to some degree. Annual fluctuations in population numbers are common. The winter temperatures may have a direct effect on winter survival of lesser spotted woodpeckers by heat loss, whereas weather conditions during spring have an indirect effect on <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> by affecting food sources. In 2017, the UK population of lesser spotted woodpeckers {{was reported to have}} almost halved since 2009, to around 2,000. The British Ornithology Trust blamed modern habits of removing dead trees quickly from parks and woodland, depriving the birds of the decaying wood which is their favoured nesting habitat.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that only adults were reaching the wintering site in Ethiopia and that it was the low survival rate of immature birds - and thus an insufficient recruitment at the breeding colony in Palmyra - that was causing the slow and steady decline of the colony from 3 breeding pairs in 2002 to just 1 in 2010. Satellite tracking and surveys conducted in western Saudi Arabia during 2009-2010, with key cooperation of the Saudi Wildlife Authority, suggested that a combination of hunting and electrocution were causing a high mortality of dispersing immature ibises. This mortality is currently regarded as the main cause of the low recruitment occurred at the Palmyra colony during the years following the high <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> of period 2002-2004 (only 3 recruitment events out of 14 chicks fledged).|$|E
5000|$|Adequate {{nutrition}} at pre-mating time periods showed {{to have the}} most effect on various reproductive processes in mammals. Increased nutrition, in general, during this time was most beneficial for oocyte and embryo development. As a result, offspring number and viability was also improved. Thus, proper nutrition timing during the pre-mating time is key for development and long-term benefit of the offspring.Two different diets were fed to Florida scrub-jays and <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> was noted to have different effects. One diet consisted of high protein and high fat, and the other consisting of just high fat. The significant result was that the birds with the high protein and high fat diet laid heavier eggs than the birds with the rich-in-fat diet. There was a difference in the amount of water inside the eggs, which accounted for the different weights. It’s hypothesized that the added water resulting from the adequate protein-rich and fat-rich diet may contribute to development and survival of the chick, therefore aiding reproductive success.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In many bird species, males display colour-ful, usually {{carotenoid}} or structurally based plumage ornaments. On {{the other}} hand, {{there are many}} bird species and entire avian genera that are achromatic, i. e. with predominantly white, grey and black plumage colours. Achromatic plumage is a typical feature in many shrikes for example. In this study, we examine the importance of an achromatic plumage pattern, namely, the black tail spots on the two outermost tail feathers (T 6 and T 5) of Lesser Grey Shrikes (LGS) for sex discrimination and {{as an indicator of}} individual quality. Our results suggest that the black tail patterns, especially spots on T 5, are important for sex discrimi-nation, but only in combination with other melanin-based or morphological features. The presence of black tail spots on T 5 is also an indicator of male age. However, {{there is no indication that}} presence, size and asymmetry of these black spots are indicators of indi-vidual quality of both sexes in the terms of <b>breeding</b> <b>performances...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceAs {{predicted}} by life history theory, once recruited into the breeding population and with increasing age, long-lived animals {{should be able}} to manage more efficiently the conflict between self-maintenance and reproduction. Consequently, <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> should improve with age before stabilizing at a certain level. Using temperature-depth recorders and isotopic analysis, we tested how age affects the foraging behaviour of king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus during one trip in the chick-rearing phase. Depending on sex and age, king penguins expressed two different foraging strategies. Older birds gained more daily mass per unit body mass than younger ones. Older females conducted shorter trips, dived deeper and performed more prey pursuits. They also had higher blood levels of d 15 N than younger individuals and males indicating sex- and age-specific dietary regimes. However, we found no differences in carbon isotopic signature, suggesting that individuals exploited the same foraging areas independently of sex and age. Our results suggest that king penguins are able to increase the quantity of energy extracted with increasing age and that such a strategy is sex-related. Our study is the first to reveal of an interaction between age and sex in determining foraging efficiency in king penguins...|$|R

5000|$|Red-necked grebes usually nest as {{isolated}} pairs {{with more}} than 50 m between neighbouring nests, although semi-colonial nesting may occur in suitable sites, where up to 20 pairs each defend a linear territory. Semi-colonial breeding {{is more likely to}} occur in prime locations, such as large floating mats of vegetation with no connection to the shoreline. Such sites, safe from most predators and large enough to provide some wind and wave protection, have grebes nesting much closer than shoreline breeders, down to 10 m. Pairs nesting in these colonies produce larger clutches of eggs, which hatch earlier in the season and result in larger broods. The territory is defended with various threat displays, including wing-spreading, hunching, and bill-thrusting; pairs breeding in colonies are more aggressive, less likely to leave the nest unguarded and show a greater tendency to move {{out of sight of the}} colony when not incubating. Breeding is often in loose association with gulls or other colonial water birds. The monogamous pair forms in April or May on migration or at the breeding water, and a highly vocal courtship ritual commences. The elaborate <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> includes head-shaking, a head-lowered [...] "cat" [...] display, parallel rushes in an upright position and mutual presentations of green weeds, and culminates in a [...] "penguin" [...] dance in which pair members raise the whole body upright, breast to breast.|$|E

Within the framework of R&D activities supported by the HORIZON 2020 EUROfusion Consortium action on the DEMO WCLL breeding blanket design, a campaign of parametric analyses has been launched at the Department of Energy, Information Engineering and Mathematical Models of the University of Palermo (DEIM), in close cooperation with ENEA-Brasimone, in order to assess the potential influence of BZ cooling tubes number on the thermal performances of the DEMO WCLL outboard breeding blanket equatorial module under the nominal steady state operative conditions envisaged for it, optimizing their geometric configuration and taking also into account that a large number of cooling pipes can deteriorate the tritium <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> of the module.

40|$|Interannual {{variability}} {{within the}} pelagic marine environment around South Georgia is a well-recognised phenomenon. A key {{aspect of this}} variability is interannual fluctuation in the abundance of Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Here we describe a new acoustic survey programme to monitor krill abundance in the South Georgia region. We present biomass estimates for 2 survey boxes, located over the shelf-break to the northeast and northwest of the island, derived from {{the first of these}} surveys conducted in January 1996. We contrast these with the most recent previous estimates for the region obtained in January 1994. Weighted mean krill density (and weighted variances) estimates for the 1996 surveys were 40. 57 g m- 2 (13. 37) and 26. 48 g m- 2 (54. 30) for the eastern and western boxes respectively. These are high compared with those obtained in January 1994, when estimates for similar areas were 1. 87 g m- 2 (0. 14) and 7. 43 g m- 2 (1. 33) respectively. The greater than 20 -fold difference between surveys reveals a very large interannual variability in krill abundance at South Georgia. In 1994 the low abundance resulted in greatly reduced breeding success in most habitual krill predator species there. In the 1996 season, however, breeding success of these species was normal. Instantaneous estimates of krill abundance using acoustic techniques are therefore consistent with measurements from predators, whose <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> provide a longer-term indication of prey abundance in the surrounding pelagic ecosystem in a particular season...|$|R

The effects of four dietary vitamin E levels viz. 0 (served as control), 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg feed, on the somatic growth, ovarian development of brood fish and on their <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> were studied.

40|$|International audienceAlthough toxic {{chemicals}} constitute {{a major threat}} for wildlife, their effects have been mainly assessed {{at the individual level}} and under laboratory conditions. Predicting population-level responses to pollutants in natural conditions is a major and ultimate task in ecological and ecotoxicological research. The present study aims to estimate the effect of mercury (Hg) levels on future apparent survival rates and <b>breeding</b> <b>performances.</b> We used long-term data set (ca. 10 years) and recently-developed methodological tools on two closely-related Antarctic top predators, the south polar skua Catharacta maccormicki from Adélie Land and the brown skua C. lonnbergi from the Kerguelen archipelago. Adult survival rates and breeding probabilities were not affected by Hg levels, while breeding success the following year decreased with increasing Hg levels. Although south polar skuas exhibited much lower Hg levels than brown skuas, they suffered from higher Hg-induced breeding failure. This species-difference could be attributed to an interaction between Hg and other environmental perturbations, including climate change and complex cocktail of pollutants. By including Hg-dependent demographic parameters in population models, we showed a weak population decline in response to increasing Hg levels. This demographic decline was more pronounced in south polar skuas than in brown skuas. Hence Hg exposure differently affects closely-related species. The wide range of environmental perturbations in Antarctic regions could exacerbate the demographic responses to Hg levels. In that respect, we urge future population modeling {{to take into account the}} coupled effects of climate change and anthropogenic pollutions to estimate population projections...|$|R

During the recent past most of the wildlife corridors in the Rajaji National Park area through which elephant performs their long-term migration between Rajaji to Corbett National Park has been shrinked, which has affected the <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> along with genetic exchange between the elephants of different protected areas.

Mixing of the adult bulls, selection of prospective partner to mate, smelling of genital organ and discharge of urine were few of the major features of mating behaviour in elephants. Generally 15 – 20 days were required for completion of mating process but if the environmental conditions were unfavourable it was completed by a month. The duration of coitus was observed to be 3 - 4 minutes, which largely depends upon presence of group members and cooperation of the prospective cow. Breeding season in Rajaji National Park was noted to be extending maximum from May to November, which through embraces the hot, rainy and beginning of cold seasons but largely the warm period.

30|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the small flock sizes, the low practice of castration, especially among sheep farmers, and the complete lack of keeping breeding records, the selection of replacement animals from within the flock as observed among the surveyed farmers represents {{a high risk of}} inbreeding of which they were probably not aware. The implication of this for the development of more viable urban sheep and goat enterprises is to create awareness among farmers (1) on the negative effects of inbreeding and (2) on the importance of individual identification of animals and breeding record keeping in their farm management strategies, and (3) to provide them with an appropriate easy-to-use paper-based or/and mobile phone/smartphone-based record keeping system, as these electronic devices are in widespread use among urban dwellers in Sub Saharan Africa (Porter 2015). As revealed by the results of the current study, irrespective of city and species, replacement animals were selected mainly {{on the basis of their}} general appearance and condition. Record keeping will enable farmers to shift from the current practice to a selection of better performing animals for replacement, based on pedigree information and <b>breeding</b> <b>performances.</b> The higher proportions of mature male sheep compared to goats could probably be explained by the low practice of castration among sheep farmers irrespective of city, and this is due to the fact that a ram for “Eid al-Kabir” (the Islamic festival of sacrifice) needs to be intact, i.e. not castrated. The complete lack of breeding males in several sheep and goat flocks in Bobo Dioulasso compared to the other two cities might result in delayed services and negatively affect the flocks’ reproductive performance and overall productivity.|$|R

Although, many species are unable to cope with such an environment, afew species {{can be found in}} cities and can help us assessing the impact of urbanizationon wildlife. Urban-related environmental modifications are multiple and some of themseem beneficial while others seem rather detrimental to wild vertebrates. Moreover, theimpact of these modifications on wild vertebrates is likely to vary depending on the phaseof the annual life-cycle. Therefore, it is challenging to get a comprehensive picture of theimpact of urbanization on wild vertebrates. Overall, urbanization is usually associatedwith reduced <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> in wild birds, but the impact of urbanizationon the phenotype and quality of developing offspring has been less studied. In thisstudy, we specifically investigated the impact of urbanization on several proxies ofindividual quality in great tits (Parusmajor). We concomitantlymeasured body size (tarsuslength and body mass), plumage coloration, and telomere length in 14 -days old chicksissued from 4 populations (two pairs of urban/rural populations located in two differentgeographical areas of France). First, rural chicks were significantly taller and heavierthan urban birds although this impact of urbanization on body size/body mass appearsonly true for the most urbanized site. Interestingly, body size was also affected by thegeographical area of capture, suggesting that regional environmental conditions mayattenuate or exacerbate the influence of urbanization on nestling growth. Second, thecarotenoid-based yellow plumage of rural nestlings was more colorful than that of urbanbirds, independently of the area of capture. This suggests that urban birds probably havea low-carotenoid diet relative to rural birds. Finally, telomere length did not differ betweenrural and urban chicks. These results suggest that urbanization probably imposes largedevelopmental constraints in wild vertebrates and that this impact may primarily berelated to constraining nutritional conditions...|$|R

For yearling females, bigger birds were better performers and survived to breed again. Among yearling males, smaller birds had larger broods, but, larger males survived. In adults, body size had little influence on <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> in either sex; however, the trends between body size and brood size in the sexes were different. Mate choice of male body size by females was repeatable. However, choice of male size {{was not related to}} female size. There was no repeatability of choice for body condition in Merlins. Body size showed high heritability between parents and male offspring, whereas, body condition exhibited low heritability. Territory quality did not affect <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> in females. Females in poorer body condition had earlier chick hatch dates and higher LRS than ones in better condition. Hatch date was repeatable for the same females occupying different nest places, but, not so for the same nest places occupied by different females. Among males, surviving birds occupied higher quality territories. LRS was positively correlated with territory quality in males, but, this was due to the influence of the poorest quality territories. When males switched territories they also moved to ones of higher quality. Male body condition was not related to <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> nor survival. Hatch date was not repeatable for the same males occupying different nest places. In conclusion, considerable differences exist between the sexes in terms of how the factors studied impact <b>breeding</b> <b>performance.</b> This study illustrates that despite heavy contributions by both sexes to the breeding attempt, their different responsibilities during breeding strongly influences the effect of the factors studied...|$|E

40|$|Kazakh fine-wool sheep bred in {{semiarid}} {{and desert}} zones of the Kazakhstan South-East are most widely {{spread in the}} Republic. However, most sheep do not satisfy the respective requirements of the breed in terms of productivity and especially reproductive capacity. Consequently, increasing the <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> and yield of commercial lambs {{is one of the}} most urgent issues in fine-wool sheep breeding. One of the tasks for scientists and agricultural specialists is to develop efficient methods to increase the reproductive capacity of fine-wool sheep and preserve lambs to the age of one year, one of the ways to increase the <b>breeding</b> <b>performance</b> being the selection of polycarpous pairs intended to accelerate the breeding rate for the mentioned product...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Establishing {{patterns}} of movements of free-ranging animals in marine ecosystems {{is crucial for}} {{a better understanding of}} their feeding ecology, life history traits and conservation. As central place foragers, the habitat use of nesting seabirds is heavily influenced by the resources available within their foraging range. We tested the prediction that during years with lower resource availability, short-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus tenuirostris) provisioning chicks should increase their foraging effort, by extending their foraging range and/or duration, both when foraging in neritic (short trips) and distant oceanic waters (long trips). Using both GPS and geolocation data-loggers, at-sea movements and habitat use were investigated over three breeding seasons (2012 - 14) at two colonies in southeastern Australia. RESULTS: Most individuals performed daily short foraging trips over the study period and inter-annual variations observed in foraging parameters where mainly due to few individuals from Griffith Island, performing 2 -day trips in 2014. When performing long foraging trips, this study showed that individuals from both colonies exploited similar zones in the Southern Ocean. The {{results of this study suggest}} that individuals could increase their foraging range while exploiting distant feeding zones, which could indicate that short-tailed shearwaters forage in Antarctic waters not only to maintain their body condition but may also do so to buffer against local environmental stochasticity. Lower <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> were associated with longer foraging trips to distant oceanic waters in 2013 and 2014 indicating they could mediate reductions in food availability around the breeding colonies by extending their foraging range in the Southern Ocean. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the importance of foraging flexibility as a fundamental aspect of life history in coastal/pelagic marine central place foragers living in highly variable environments and how these foraging strategies are use to buffer this variability...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Colonization of {{mountain}} areas by the White Stork {{is a new}} and poorly docu-mented phenomenon, started {{in the first half}} of the last century. In this paper I present the course of expansion and the current distribution of this species in the range of the Sudeten Mountains, SW Poland (max. altitude 1602 m, habitats available for stork up to 600 m asl). Results are based on the White Stork censuses started here as early as 1907. Before 1950 the White Stork occurred almost exclusively in the foothill zone of Sudeten, and fluctuated in numbers. The number of occupied nests grew fourfold between 1934 (38) and 2004 (169), and the altitude of nests increased by 200 m (max. 560 m asl). In this period, mountain val-leys became inhabited and changes in the frequency of nest types were noted. However, dur-ing the last decade the colonization stopped in terms of numbers and altitudinal expansion but the reasons remain unclear. The stork density in the inner mountain area (0. 85 pairs/ 100 km 2) was only a third that in the foothills, but the <b>breeding</b> <b>performances</b> were better. Long-term yearly data from two sample plots showed a significant increase in chick productivity per pair (JZa) in the plot lying inside the mountains (1643 m 2), but a decrease in chick productivity per successful pair (JZm) in the plot lying in the foothills (793 km 2). Comparison with two other populations colonizing the Carpathians revealed a dissimilarity with the Sudeten population, e. g. higher rate and different periods of expansion. Treating the White Stork as a model species entering new, previously unoccupied areas it was shown that the course of this process can change in time, and differences can be seen both within the given population and between populations colonizing different (upland) areas...|$|R
5000|$|For example, {{since the}} 1970s the Matschie's tree-kangaroo, an {{endangered}} species, has been bred in captivity. The Tree Kangaroo Species Survival Plan (TKSSP) {{was established in}} 1992 {{to help with the}} management of Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). TKSSP's annual breeding recommendations to preserve genetic diversity are based on mean kinship strategy (in order to retain adaptive potential and avoid inbreeding's disadvantages). In order to evaluate a captive <b>breeding</b> program's <b>performance</b> (in maintaining genetic diversity), researchers compare the genetic diversity of the captive breeding population to the wild population. According to McGreezy et al. (2010), [...] "AZA Matschie tree kangaroo’s haplotype diversity was almost two times lower than wild Matschie tree kangaroos". This difference with allele frequencies shows the changes that can happen over time, like genetic drift and mutation, when a species is taken out of its natural habitat.|$|R
