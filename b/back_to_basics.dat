5000|$|<b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Basic</b> Car Plan: In {{the past}} 50 years, LA’s {{population}} {{has grown by}} 25% while the LAPD has grown by 30%; however, the number of officers on the street has actually decreased in that time. Cognizant {{of the need for}} more officers patrolling the streets, Councilman Buscaino paired up with Councilman Bonin <b>to</b> produce the <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Basic</b> Car Plan, a 10 point plan that encourages the LAPD to return to their “Basic Car Plan,” a model implemented in 1969 that saw a 1% reduction in crime while nationwide crime rates soared by 55%. Under the <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Basic</b> Car Plan, the City will revisit the LAPD’s deployment formulas in order to establish reasonable minimum patrol staffing levels. The implementation of minimum patrol staff levels, along with other changes that encourage operational flexibility and integration with local communities, ensures that the <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Basic</b> Car Plan reflects a robust vision to combat crime and establish relationships between the LAPD and the constituents they serve.|$|R

25|$|In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards {{expansive}} {{and experimental}} psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival {{when he went}} to Nashville to record the album Blonde on Blonde, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, John Wesley Harding (1967) and Nashville Skyline (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>basics</b> trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group The Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George. The <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>basics</b> tendency would also be evident in the Rolling Stones' Beggars Banquet (1968) and Exile on Main Street (1972), the Beatles' The White Album (1968) and Let It Be (1970)., The Doors' Morrison Hotel (1970) and L.A.
