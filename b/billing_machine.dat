5000|$|The first {{commercial}} microprocessor, the 4-bit Intel 4004, {{began with the}} [...] "Busicom Project" [...] in 1968 as Masatoshi Shima's three-chip CPU design for the Busicom 141-PF calculator. In April 1968, Shima was tasked with designing a special-purpose LSI chipset, along with his supervisor Tadashi Tanba, {{for use in the}} Busicom 141-PF desktop calculator. This later became known as the [...] "Busicom Project". His initial design consisted of seven LSI chips, including a three-chip CPU. His design included arithmetic units (adders), multiplier units, registers, read-only memory, and a macro-instruction set to control a decimal computer system. Busicom then wanted a general-purpose LSI chipset, for not only desktop calculators, but also other equipment such as a teller machine, cash register and <b>billing</b> <b>machine.</b> Shima thus began work on a general-purpose LSI chipset in late 1968.|$|E
40|$|Transcript, 84 pp. Audio file {{available}} at [URL] briefly describing his background and education, Ryan, former chairman and CEO of CADO Systems Corporation, discusses {{his work in}} the development and distribution of data processing equipment from the early 1950 s through the early 1990 s. He recalls work with Benson-Lehner in the early 1950 s and he describes the firm's development of the computyper, a <b>billing</b> <b>machine.</b> Ryan discusses his role in the sale of the computyper to Friden and his employment by Friden. He recalls his frustration with Friden's attempts at further development of the product, his involvement in the acquisition of the Flexowriter for Friden, and his management of a branch for Friden in Los Angeles. Ryan recalls his return to Benson-Lehner from Friden in the late 1950 s and the events leading to his formation of Intercontinental Systems Incorporated with Pete Taylor in the late 1960 s. Ryan describes ISI's distribution and development of data processing equipment and his philosophy for the management of engineering and sales at ISI. Ryan recalls his idea to develop a computer for small businesses and describes his role in the partnership that became CADO Systems Corporation in 1976. He discusses the development of the computer by Jim Ferguson and Bob Thorne, his strategy of marketing the computer to small businesses and government offices, CADO's rapid growth, and the creation of additional product lines. Ryan concludes the interview by summarizing his activities since leaving CADO in 1983...|$|E

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing <b>Machines</b> <b>Bill.</b> If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing <b>Machines</b> <b>Bill,</b> I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|R

500|$|On April 14, 1894, {{a public}} Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, {{on the corner}} of 27th Street—the first {{commercial}} motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire <b>bill.</b> The <b>machines</b> were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: Barber Shop, Bertoldi (mouth support) (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), Bertoldi (table contortion), Blacksmiths, Roosters (some manner of cock fight), Highland Dance, Horse Shoeing, Sandow (Eugen Sandow, a German strongman managed by Florenz Ziegfeld), Trapeze, and Wrestling. As historian Charles Musser describes, a [...] "profound transformation of American life and performance culture" [...] had begun.|$|R
40|$|There {{are not yet}} {{practical}} and accurate ways to directly measure core power in a microprocessor. This limits the granularity of measurement and control for computer power management. We overcome this limitation by presenting an accurate runtime per-core power proxy which closely estimates true core power. This enables new fine-grained microprocessor power management techniques at the core level. For example, cloud environments could manage and <b>bill</b> virtual <b>machines</b> for energy consumption associated with the core. The power model underlying our power proxy also enables energy-efficiency controllers to perform what-if analysis, instead of merely reacting to current conditions. We develop and validate a methodology for accurate power proxy training at both chip and core levels. Our implementation of power proxies uses on-chip logic in a high-performance multi-core processor and associated platform firmware. The power proxies account for full voltage and frequency ranges, as well as chip-to-chip process variations. For fixed clock frequency operation, a mean unsigned error of 1. 8 % for fine-grained 32 ms samples across all workloads was achieved. For an interval of an entire workload, we achieve an average error of- 0. 2 %. Similar results were achieved for voltagescaling scenarios, too. We also present two sample applications of the power proxy: (1) per-core power billing for cloud computing services; and (2) simultaneous runtime energy saving comparisons among different power management policies without running each policy separately. 1...|$|R

It was because Biggar had nerves of steel - a courage that did not know the meaning of fear, and that remained calm in the midst of a cyclone of repugnance, hatred, and menace......Joe Biggar, his Parnell's associate, was also able to speak in any circumstances with exactly the same ease of spirit.

Sullivan refers to Biggar's preparation and delaying technique :Of course he could not get the materials for his lengthy discourses [...] "all out of his own head" [...] but he knew whence there was a perfect mine of such matter, and thence he provided himself with supplies. He brought into the House from the Library bundles of parliamentary papers and Blue Books, and from these he proceeded to read copious extracts. Once when he had been at his work for more than two hours, without a pause - except to take an occasional sip of water - the chairman (the House being in Committee), thought to get him to resume his seat by telling him that his observations had become almost inaudible and unintelligible to the chair. Mr. Biggar tendered respectful apologies, said he felt conscious that his voice was growing somewhat indistinct, remarked that he was at rather too great a distance from the chair, but said he would be happy to improve matters by drawing nearer. Thereupon he gathered up his books and papers and moved up, with all the ease and confidence in the world, to the front bench on the opposition side, facing the table of the house - a place reserved by immemorial custom for ex-ministers and their leading supporters. Then, before resuming the thread, or rather the chain-cable- of his discourse, he informed the astonished functionary that if there was any part of his argument which had not reached his ears, he was quite willing to go over it again.|$|R

Eventually, Bundy and Studd began teaming up with Heenan in a series of six-man tag team matches against the Machines (usually, Big and Super; as Andre's health was starting to deteriorate at this time, the Giant Machine made occasional appearances, but more often than not, it was either Captain Lou Albano or a number of popular faces—often, Hogan, Roddy Piper and others—who teamed with the other Machines).
