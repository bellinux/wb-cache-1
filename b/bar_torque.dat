40|$|We use a {{gravitational}} <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> {{method to}} compare bar strengths (the maximum tangential force normalized by radial force) in B and H-band images of 152 galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. Our main motivation is to check {{how much the}} difference in the rest-frame wavelength could affect comparisons of bar strengths in low and high redshift observations. Between these two bands we find an average bar strength ratio Q B/H = 1. 25 which factor is nearly independent of the morphological type. We show that Q B/H> 1 is mostly due to reduced bulge dilution of radial forces in the B-band. The <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method needs an estimate for the vertical scale height of the galaxy, based on the radial scale length of the disk and the galaxy’s morphological type. Since these two might not always be possible to determine at high redshifts in a reliable manner, we also checked that similar results are obtained with vertical scale heights estimated from the radii corresponding to the K-band surface brightness of 20 mag/arcsec 2. Also, we made a simple test of the usability of the <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method at high redshifts by checking the effects of image degradation (nearest neighbour sampling without any adjustment of noise levels) : we found that the estimated bar strengths varied by± 10 % at most as long as the total extent of the bar was at least 10 pixels.

40|$|The {{relative}} bar torques for 45 galaxies {{observed at}} $K$- band with the 4. 2 m William Herschel Telescope {{are determined by}} transforming the light distributions into potentials and deriving the maximum ratios of the tangential forces relative to the radial forces. The results are combined with the bar torques for 30 other galaxies determined from our previous $K$-band survey (Buta & Block 2001). Relative bar torques determine the degree of spiral arm forcing, gas accretion, and bar evolution. They differ from other measures of bar strength, such as the relative amplitude of the bar determined photometrically, because they include the bulge and other disk light {{that contributes to the}} radial component of the total force. If the bulge is strong and the radial forcing large, then even a prominent bar can have a relatively weak influence on the azimuthal motions in the disk. Here we find that the relative <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> correlates only weakly with the optical bar type listed in the Revised Shapley-Ames and de Vaucouleurs systems. In fact, some classically barred galaxies have weaker relative bar torques than classically unbarred galaxies. The optical class is a poor measure of azimuthal disk forcing for two reasons: some infrared bars are not seen optically, and some bars with strong bulges have their azimuthal forces so strongly diluted by the average radial force that they exert only small torques on their disks. The Hubble classification scheme poorly recognizes the gravitational influence of bars. Applications of our <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> method to the high-redshift universe are briefly discussed.

40|$|From {{this vast}} subject, I will pick out and review three {{specific}} topics, namely {{the formation and}} evolution of bars, the formation of bulges, and the evolution during multiple major mergers. Bars form naturally in galactic discs. Their evolution {{is driven by the}} exchange of angular momentum within the galaxy. This is emitted mainly by near-resonant material in the inner disc (bar), and is absorbed by near-resonant material in the outer disc and in the halo. As a result of this, the bar becomes stronger and rotates slower. Bulges are not a homogeneous class of objects. Based on their formation history, one can distinguish three types. Classical bulges are mainly formed before the actual disc component, from collapses or mergers and the corresponding dissipative processes. Boxy/peanut bulges are parts of bars seen edge-on. Finally, disc-like bulges are formed by the inflow of material to the center due to <b>bar</b> <b>torques.</b> Major mergers bring strong and fast evolution and can turn discs into ellipticals. I present results from simulations of multiple mergers in groups of disc or of elliptical galaxies and discuss the orbital anisotropy in the merger remnant. Comment: 8 pages, 8 figures.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of bar strengths in disk galaxies {{is a fundamental}} property of the galaxy population that has only begun to be explored. We have applied the bar/spiral separation method of Buta, Block, and Knapen to derive the {{distribution of}} maximum relative gravitational <b>bar</b> <b>torques,</b> Q_b, for 147 spiral galaxies in the statistically well-defined Ohio State University Bright Galaxy Survey (OSUBGS) sample. Our goal {{is to examine the}} properties of bars as independently as possible of their associated spirals. We find that the distribution of bar strength declines smoothly with increasing Q_b, with more than 40 % of the sample having Q_b <= 0. 1. In the context of recurrent bar formation, this suggests that strongly-barred states are relatively short-lived compared to weakly-barred or non-barred states. We do not find compelling evidence for a bimodal distribution of bar strengths. Instead, the distribution is fairly smooth in the range 0. 0 <= Q_b < 0. 8. Our analysis also provides a first look at spiral strengths Q_s in the OSU sample, based on the same torque indicator. We are able to verify a possible weak correlation between Q_s and Q_b, in the sense that galaxies with the strongest bars tend also to have strong spirals.

The radius of an x 2 -type ring is generally smaller than the inner Lindblad resonance, decreases systematically with increasing Qb, and slightly larger when self-gravity is included.

We explore the relationship between the inner slope and several galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass, maximum rotational velocity, central surface brightness (μ 0), bar strength and bulge-to-total ratio. Even with our limited dynamical range, we find a trend for low-mass galaxies to exhibit shallower rotation curve inner slopes than high-mass galaxies, whereas steep inner slopes are found exclusively in high-mass galaxies. This trend may arise from the relationship between the total stellar mass and the mass of the bulge, which are correlated among them. We find a correlation between the inner slope of the rotation curve and the morphological T-type, complementary to the scaling relation between dRvc(0) and μ 0 previously reported in the literature.

Bar strengths based on the gravitational torque method are derived from 2. 2 micron Ks-band images for a statistical sample of 138 (98 S 0, 40 S 0 /a,Sa) galaxies having a mean total blue magnitude <= 12. 5 and generally inclined less than 65 degrees. We find that S 0 galaxies have weaker bars on average than spiral galaxies in general, even compared to their closest spiral counterparts, S 0 /a and Sa galaxies. The differences are significant and cannot be due entirely to uncertainties in the assumed vertical scale-heights or in the assumption of constant mass-to-light ratios. Part of the difference is likely due simply to the dilution of the <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> by the higher mass bulges seen in S 0 s. If spiral galaxies accrete external gas, as advocated by Bournaud & Combes, then the fewer strong bars found among S 0 s imply a lack of gas accretion according to this theory. If S 0 s are stripped former spirals, or else are evolved from former spirals due to internal secular dynamical processes which deplete the gas as well as grow the bulges, then the weaker bars and the prevalence of lenses in S 0 galaxies could further indicate that bar evolution continues to proceed during and even after gas depletionComment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal, September 2010 issue (LaTex, 29 pages + 3 figures, uses aastex. cls...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{near-infrared}} survey of early-type galaxies designed to provide information on bar strengths, bulges, disks, and bar parameters in a statistically well-defined sample of S 0 -Sa galaxies. Early-type galaxies have the advantage that their bars are relatively free {{of the effects of}} dust, star formation, and spiral structure that complicate bar studies in later type galaxies. We describe the survey and present results on detailed analysis of the relative Fourier intensity amplitudes of bars in 26 early-type galaxies. We also evaluate the symmetry assumption of these amplitudes with radius, used recently for bar-spiral separation in later-type galaxies. The results show a wide variety of radial Fourier profiles of bars, ranging from simple symmetric profiles that can be represented in terms of a single gaussian component, to both symmetric and asymmetric profiles that can be represented by two overlapping gaussian components. More complicated profiles than these are also found, often due to multiple bar-like features including extended ovals or lenses. Based on the gravitational <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> indicator Q_b, double-gaussian bars are stronger on average than single-gaussian bars, at least for our small sample.

40|$|In recent years, {{due to a}} need {{to reduce}} emissions, the {{automotive}} industry has focused on increasing vehicle efficiency. One of the areas being examined for potential improvement is the automatic transmission; specifically, the torque converter clutch damper. The better {{the performance of the}} damper, the more time the torque converter can be kept in the optimum locked position, thus increasing vehicle efficiency. Currently a large number of vehicle manufacturers use transmission technology sourced from external OEMs; {{due to a lack of}} available performance data or validated simulations, sometimes vehicle manufacturers are not able to fully understand the behaviour of the damper. If damper performance (or interactions with other components) cannot be fully assessed during the design development phase, key issues may become known too late in the development process. Thus a deeper understanding of the processes of experimentally characterising and simulating torque converter dampers is required. This thesis describes the development of an arc spring torque converter damper simulation, including the gathering of the experimental data required to validate the simulation. The simulation is used to draw conclusions on the impact of excitation signal form on damper behaviour, leading to new knowledge on the signals required to experimentally characterise a damper. In this thesis a methodology for (and implementation of) the characterisation of torque converter dampers is detailed. It was found that existing available technologies (e. g. fired engines, electric dynamometers) were either too inflexible or prohibitively expensive; thus a novel high frequency mechanical pulsation generator was developed. This solution was developed from a 4 cylinder motored diesel engine; the cylinders are filled with compressed air and the crankshaft driven using an electric dynamometer. Simulation and experimental data has confirmed that mean torque can be controlled using the input dynamometer, with the compressed air producing fluctuations of up to 900 Nm amplitude. However, it was found that the frequency of the output pulsations varied from a fired engine; this is due to reactions between the pulsation generator and the stiffness and inertias of other components on the rig. A review of the performance of the novel pulsation generation concept against other damper excitation methods was also conducted. It was determined that fired engines and electric motors are more suitable for durability testing; the flexibility of the electric motors and the low running costs of the pulsation generator suit damper performance tests. The second phase of this project was to develop a simulation of a two-stage arc spring turbine damper. This damper consists of three inertias, separated by two spring sets; the outer spring set has 3 individual arc springs, while the inner spring set has 5 nested pairs. The principle of conservation of angular momentum is applied to each of the three inertias in order to calculate their individual accelerations. This method is also applied when calculating the acceleration and movement of the springs; the arc springs are discretised into mass and (massless) spring segments. Two features not previously seen in literature are included in the simulation; hardstops and nested springs. The physical hardstops limit the movement of the spring sets (relative movements of the inertias). In this study, the nested springs were simulated as a pair of parallel springs, rather than as a single stiffer arc spring; this is due to the friction that occurs between the springs (the inner race of the larger spring forms the housing for the inner spring). These two features highlight the need for hardware examination before simulation development; disassembling the hardware also allows the location of hardstops (and other features) to be measured rather than relying on the test data. Once a damper simulation was designed, a methodology for simulation parameterisation was required; parameterisation is the process of improving simulation performance through iterations of estimated parameters. The simulated damper was excited using sampled experimental data; to maximise parameterisation process efficiency, each time a parameter change was made, a set of key test points were selected in order to assess simulation performance change. It is not recommended that single test points be examined individually; parameter changes may improve simulation performance at one test point but have an adverse reaction at another. A clear causal relationship between simulation timestep and accuracy (as well as simulation run time) was found; a link between the number of discretised segments and simulation accuracy (and run time) was also confirmed. It was determined that 8 segments was optimal for the inner springs and 18 outer segments offered the best balance between computing power and simulation time. A variety of methods for analysing damper (and simulation) performance are presented in this thesis; it was found that for the 2. 5 <b>bar</b> <b>torque</b> curve experimental data set the simulation performs excellently, with on average less than 5 % error. Overall torque error is less than 10 % across the tested speed range (900 to 2800 rpm), with mean torque differences between simulated and tested order magnitudes of less than 5 Nm. It has been determined that hysteresis loops are not an accurate predictor of real-world damper performance; while they can approximate general trends, they do not cover the normal operating condition. In the final phase of this thesis, the validated simulation has been used to investigate excitation signal, areas of poor damper performance and the link between speed and damper stiffness. By subjecting the simulation to a variety of sinusoidal input signals, it was established that if a sinusoidal signal approximates the 3 most dominant frequencies in a real signal, the damper will behave in a representative manner. Additional orders that have lower frequencies than the dominant order will have a greater impact on the attenuation behaviour of the damper; the effect of additional orders on attenuation behaviour is also linked to their magnitude (relative to the dominant order). A methodology for efficient damper mapping is proposed; the key aim is to produce a dataset that will minimise the length of the parameterisation process while capturing key damper behaviours. It was found that the magnitude of the torque oscillations used to excite the damper is linked to parameter adjustment impact, though this relationship is not linear for all parameters; an approximate level of 300 Nm should be used for excitation. Parameters such as spring stiffness and plate inertias are more likely to have a substantial impact on damper performance at frequencies below 70 Hz; friction tuning factors are impacted more by magnitude changes at frequencies above 150 Hz. It has been demonstrated that while speed can have an effect on magnification ratio, this effect is far less significant at mean torques above the knee point and when sinusoidal input magnitude is kept at or above 300 Nm. It was concluded that neither engine speed nor precise excitation magnitude must be replicated in order to predict approximate performance. During the investigation into areas of poor damper performance, it was confirmed that the trend of increasing magnification ratio with lower frequencies (< 30 Hz) seen in experimental data continued. Simulation testing above 140 Hz revealed that there is not a linear relationship between increased frequency and increased magnification ratio; these areas of magnification ratio spikes are likely due to system resonances. It has been confirmed that while fluctuation magnitude does impact magnification ratio, fluctuation frequency has the most significant (dominant) impact. Finally, the effect of speed on apparent damper stiffness was investigated for both hysteresis loop testing and across a range of outer spring vibration angles; it was confirmed that increasing speed does result in non-homogeneous compression of the springs. It was established that while speed can have an effect on spring stiffness, this effect will vary significantly depending on the movement range (vibration angle) of the spring. The largest increase in spring stiffness with speed is seen when segments of the spring become inactive (cease to move), hence why the effect of speed is more substantial at vibration angle of < 10 °. The simulation was used to confirm the theories linking speed and stiffness found in the literature; higher speeds increase frictional forces, slowing damper segments, resulting in reduced movement. The findings of this thesis are relevant to damper simulation and testing engineers; by expanding knowledge of damper behavioural responses to high frequency excitation signals, as well as demonstrating an effective method for producing validated damper simulations, it is hoped that the vehicle design process will be more efficient and damper modifications more effective...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{analysis}} has been performed for {{a sample of}} 15 Southern early-type disk galaxies, mainly S 0 s, using high resolution K_s-band images. The galaxies are mostly barred {{and many of them}} show multiple structures including bars and ovals, typical for S 0 s. The new images are of sufficient quality to reveal new detail on the morphology of the galaxies. For example, we report a hitherto undetected nuclear ring in NGC 1387, a nuclear bar in NGC 1326, and in the residual image also a weak primary bar in NGC 1317. For the galaxies we (1) measure the radial profiles of the orientation parameters derived from the elliptical isophotes, (2) apply Fourier methods for calculating tangential forces, and particularly, (3) apply structural decomposition methods. For galaxies with multiple structures a 2 -dimensional method is found to be superior to a 1 -dimensional method, but only if in addition to the bulge and the disk, at least one other component is taken into account. We find strong evidence of pseudo-bulges in S 0 s: ten of the galaxies have the shape parameter of the bulge near to n = 2, indicating that the bulges are more disk-like than following the R^ 1 / 4 -law. Also, six of the galaxies have either nuclear rings, nuclear bars or nuclear disks. In all non-elliptical galaxies in our sample the B/T < 0. 4, as typically found in galaxies having pseudo-bulges. In two of the galaxies the B/T flux ratio is as small as in typical Sc-type spirals. This might be the hitherto undiscovered link in the scenario in which spirals are transformedinto S 0 s. Also, bars in S 0 s are found to be shorter and less massive, and have smaller <b>bar</b> <b>torques</b> than <b>bars</b> in S 0 /a-type galaxies. Comment: 51 pages, 9 eps figures, 8 ps figures.

50|$|The {{same basic}} design {{is used for}} both {{single-phase}} and three-phase motors {{over a wide range}} of sizes. Rotors for three-phase will have variations in the depth and shape of bars to suit the design classification. Generally, thick <b>bars</b> have good <b>torque</b> and are efficient at low slip, since they present lower resistance to the emf. As the slip increases, skin effect starts to reduce the effective depth and increases the resistance, resulting in reduced efficiency but still maintaining torque.|$|R

The Super Sprint was the competition model with alloy shock bodies, {{front and rear}} anti-roll <b>bars,</b> an adjustable <b>Torque</b> Splitter, and other features. The Super Sprint also featured a mod motor called the UP240SE. These were built to show that Nikko could produce high quality racing vehicles also. A special Brat upgrade kit from the UP (Unlimited Performance) Works division turned the Dash/Sprint into a lean and mean racing machine. The Brat was even raced in the 1989 1/10 electric off-road World Championship held in Australia, finishing respectably {{in the middle of}} a field of more than 100 cars.|$|R
40|$|A galaxy remains near {{equilibrium}} {{for most}} of its history. Only through resonances can nonaxisymmetric features such as spiral arms and <b>bars</b> exert <b>torques</b> over large scales and change the overall structure of the galaxy. In this paper, we describe the resonant interaction mechanism in detail and derive explicit criteria for the particle number required to simulate these dynamical processes accurately using N-body simulations, and illustrate them with numerical experiments. To do this, we perform a direct numerical solution of perturbation theory, in short, by solving for each orbit in an ensemble and make detailed comparisons with N-body simulations. The criteria include: sufficient particle coverage in phase space near the resonance and enough particles to minimise gravitational potential fluctuations that will change the dynamics of the resonant encounter. These criteria are general in concept and can be applied to any dynamical interaction. We use the bar–halo interaction as our primary example owing to its technical simplicity and astronomical ubiquity. Some of our more surprising findings are as follows. First, the Inner-Lindblad-like resonance (ILR), responsible for coupling the bar to the central halo cusp, requires more tha...|$|R
40|$|An {{asymptotically}} exact continuum dislocation {{theory of}} single crystal bars under torsion is proposed. The dislocation distribution minimizing {{energy of the}} <b>bar</b> with zero <b>torque</b> is shown to be uniform. If the applied torque is non-zero, the minimizer exhibits a dislocation-free zone at the outer ring of the bar's cross-section. The non-uniform distribution of dislocations in equilibrium {{as well as the}} twist angle per unit length are found in terms of the given torque. With the energy dissipation being taken into account, there exists an elastic core region, while dislocation are concentrated in a ring between two dislocation-free zones. This leads to the change of the stress distribution increasing the critical threshold of the torque. Comment: 25 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} vehicle fuel economy {{improvement}} using D-Range neutral control of automatic transmission. The system objected to reducing of fuel consumption during idle. Usually, turbine of conventional auto transmission is mechanically linked to wheel during idling condition. Therefore speed ratio of torque converter is zero for that period. This causes needless power loss by the torque converter slip. To improve this inefficiency automobile makers develops electronically-controlled D-range neutral control system. The D-range neutral control system minimizes slip on the torque converter by shifting gear to a neutral position during vehicle stoped with D-range gear position. However there's insufficient study {{about the effect}} of D-range neutral control system on vehicle fuel economy. In this paper, researches are performed on effect of D-range neutral control system on vehicle fuel economy by experiment with two different vehicle. And it is also estimated the effect on vehicle fuel economy using computer simulation. As a result, 1. 8 % of LA- 4 mode fuel economy improvement can be achieved in a vehicle by D-range neutral control system.

40|$|The {{effects of}} gas {{accretion}} on spiral disk dynamics and stability are studied through N-body simulations, including star formation and gas/stars mass exchange. The detailed processes of bar formation, bar destruction and bar re-formation are followed, {{while in the}} same time the disk to bulge ratio is varying. The accreted gas might be first prevented to flow inwards to the center by the <b>bar</b> gravity <b>torques,</b> which maintains it to the outer Lindblad resonance. While the first bar is weakening, the accreted gas replenishes the disk, increasing the disk-to-bulge ratio, and the disk self-gravity. A second bar is then unstable, with a higher pattern speed, due both to the increased mass, and shorter bar length. Three or four bar episodes have been followed over a Hubble time. Their strength is decreasing with time, while their pattern speed is increasing. Detailed balance of the angular momentum transfer and evolution can account for these processes. The gas recycled through star formation, and rejected through stellar mass loss plays also a role in the disk dynamics. Implications on the spiral galaxy dynamics and evolution along the Hubble sequence, and as a function of redshift are discussed. Comment: 21 pages, 21 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A.

40|$|Abstract—We {{have carried}} out an {{engineering}} {{study with the}} aim of enhancing the reliability of the starting system of the salient-pole synchronous machines in a pumping-generating plant. We focused on accurate prediction of the damper <b>bar</b> currents, electromagnetic <b>torque,</b> acceleration time, and bar temperatures during the starting process. We used the time-stepping finite-ele-ment analysis (FEA) for a multiple-pole model including coupled field-circuit formulation and rotor motion. We also developed an analytical model, incorporating the equivalent circuit parameters, to simulate the starting performance of the generator/motor units. The predicted results from both the FEA model and the analytical model agree well with experimental investigations. As a result, we were able to propose a way to improve the motor’s reliability and allow many additional starts.

40|$|The way {{in which}} COBE (launched by the SS in late 1982) {{performs}} its attitude control is described, along with the design of its on-orbit system. COBE, to be situated in a 900 km high, sun-synchronous orbit, contains two unique control features: (1) {{the orientation of the}} spinning satellite is controlled to a sun-normal attitude in the sun/local vertical plane; and (2) pitch and roll control is maintained by a unique triaxial arrangement of reaction wheels, magnetic <b>torque</b> <b>bars</b> and sensors, located in the body's tranverse plane. Inherent in this triaxial configuration concept is a built-in redundancy that will maintain attitude control in the event of any single-point sensor/actuator component failure. Each of the three control drive electronics operates independently and directly of a system of dedicated sensors. This system functions independently of a computer or an ephemeris communication link, leading to greater reliability...|$|R
40|$|Exponential radial {{profiles}} are {{ubiquitous in}} spiral and dwarf Irregular galaxies, but {{the origin of}} this structural form is not understood. This talk will review the observations of exponential and double exponential disks, considering both the light and the mass profiles, and the contributions from stars and gas. Several theories for this structure will also be reviewed, including primordial collapse, <b>bar</b> and spiral <b>torques,</b> clump torques, galaxy interactions, disk viscosity and other internal processes of angular momentum exchange, and stellar scattering off of clumpy structure. The only process currently known that can account for this structure in the most theoretically difficult case is stellar scattering off disks clumps. Stellar orbit models suggest that such scattering can produce exponentials even in isolated dwarf irregulars that have no bars or spirals, little shear or viscosity, and profiles that go out too far for the classical Mestel case of primordial collapse with specific angular momentum conservation...|$|R
