No.1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No.13 Squadron, flying Venturas, {{taking up the}} slack on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around half of the thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>March,</b> as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No.82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.|$|E
