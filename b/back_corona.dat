International Conference on Electrostatic Precipitation 2016 ”, Wroclaw, Polen, 19. - 23. 09. 2016 <b>Back</b> <b>corona</b> {{and dust}} {{resistivity}} {{are well known}} topics in electrostatic precipitation. <b>Back</b> <b>corona</b> results from high dust resistivity and occurs when the field strength in the dust layer surpasses a critical value E crit, which is typically found {{to be in the}} order of 15 to 30 kV/cm. Besides the resistivity ρ, the current density is the main parameter: E = i ρ < E crit. Hence, possible actions against <b>back</b> <b>corona</b> include a reduction of ρ by dust conditioning, or a reduction of i, for example by pulsed corona operation. Much work has been devoted to study the dependence of ρ on dust composition, temperature, humidity, adsorption layers and dust layer porosity, and a variety of different set-ups for dust resistivity measurements has been proposed. Even though some authors report a dependence of ρ on current density or field strength resp., dust resistivity is mostly seen as a material property. However, in measurements on product dusts in the upper resistivity range, we found that dusts show extremely non-ohmic properties: Most strikingly, resistivity may vary by several orders of magnitude with time. Also, the experimental arrangement can change the resistivity results by orders of magnitude: When resistivity is measured with the dust layer exposed to a corona discharge (imitating the situation in a real ESP), ρ depends strongly on the layer thickness. Meanwhile the same dust does not show the strong layer thickness dependence when electrodes are placed {{on both sides of the}} dust layer, and also time effects are much less prominent. Additional findings include that dusts that have been exposed to resistivity measurements show a high level of electrostatic charging afterwards. An interpretation of these results may be found from the theory of semiconductors and electret materials. Accordingly, highly resistive dust layers do not contain mobile electrons. Current transport occurs only after charge carriers (free electrons or holes) have been injected from the electrodes or from a gas discharge adjacent to the surface. When the injection process is non-symmetric (e. g. with corona discharge), the current transport through the dust layer can be dominated by charge carriers of one polarity, depending on the polarity of the corona. Some of the effects observed in experiment, namely the layer thickness effect and the current density influence, can indeed be ascribed to unipolar injection and space charge limited conduction. The time effects can mainly be ascribed to the “deep trapping” of the charge carriers, leading to a high level of immobile space charge. As overall space charge is limited, this reduces the level of mobile space charge available for current transport. The space charge also leads to a deformation of the electric field inside the dust layer, and hence influences injection via the Schottky (thermionic field emission) mechanism. By integrating the mechanisms of charge transport in dielectrics (injection, drift, immobilization, recombination) into the OpenFOAM® simulation package, rather realistic simulations of time-dependent resistivity are possible. The simulations also are helpful to identify the mechanisms responsible for certain types of resistivity behavior...|$|E

The comparison of the radio emissions with hard X–rays reveals surprisingly that the two emissions often do not correlate in time and thus must originate from different electron acceleration processes.

In open field regions, we model the dependence of fractionation on the plasma upflow velocity through the chromosphere for both shear (or planar) and torsional Alfven waves of photospheric origin. These differ mainly through their parametric coupling to slow mode waves. Shear Alfven waves appear to reproduce observed fractionations for a wider range of model parameters, and present less of a "fine-tuning" problem than do torsional waves. In closed field regions, we study the fractionations produced by Alfven waves with photospheric and coronal origins. Waves with a coronal origin, at or close to resonance with the coronal loop, offer a significantly better match to observed abundances than do photospheric waves, with shear and torsional waves in such a case giving essentially indistinguishable fractionations. Such coronal waves are likely the result of a nanoflare coronal heating mechanism, that as well as heating coronal plasmas releases Alfven waves that can travel down to loop footpoints and cause FIP fractionation through the ponderomotive force as they reflect from the chromosphere <b>back</b> into the <b>corona.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures, ApJ accepte...|$|R
40|$|A dust layer, {{especially}} {{based on}} high-resistivity dust, at the collecting electrodes may cause a <b>back</b> <b>corona</b> discharge in electrostatic precipitators (ESP). It can {{significantly reduce the}} ESP efficiency {{and as a result}} cause ecological damages. To study the dust layer influence inside ESPs, it is necessary to derive an adequate model of the ESP precipitation process with a dust layer at the collecting electrode. The research of the present thesis is focused on stationary studies of the precipitation process with a dust layer at the collecting electrode in ESPs. Three mathematical models are proposed as a description of the precipitation process with a dust layer at the collecting electrode. The models are based on Maxwell’s equations and the finite element method (FEM). COMSOL Multiphysics software is used for their implementation. In all models the dust layer has constant conductivity and the air region has constant ion mobility. In the first model there are no coupling conditions, which is required in mathematics, are given between the two regions. The solution found by COMSOL Multiphysics does not provide physically acceptable coupling conditions. In the second model, a continuous transition zone is introduced between the two regions so that no coupling conditions are required. With the large derivatives in the transition zone, the nonlinear solver in COMSOL Multiphysics does not converge. Finally, in the third model, the dust layer and the grounded collecting electrode are replaced with a boundary condition for the air region. The properties of the third model are investigated, and these models can be used to study the influence of the dust layer. The results of these investigations are reported and discussed. ...|$|E

In addition to theoretical considerations on charging and collection of fine particulates, fractional efficiency analyses have been realized with an optical particle analyzer and two laboratory-scale precipitator modules.

40|$|Nearly {{ninety percent}} of U. S. {{coal-fired}} utility boilers are equipped with electrostatic precipitators (ESP). Cost effective retrofittable ESP technologies are the only means to accomplish Department of Energy's (DOE) goal of a major reduction in fine particulate and air toxic emissions from coal-fired power plants. Particles in the size range of 0. 1 to 5 {micro}m typically escape ESPs. Metals, such as arsenic, cadmium, lead, molybdenum and antimony, concentrate on these particles. This is the main driver for improved fine particulate control. Vapor phase emissions of mercury, selenium and arsenic are also of major concern. Current dry ESPs, which operate at temperatures greater than 280 F, provide little control for vapor phase toxics. The need for inherent improvement to ESPs has to be considered keeping in perspective the current trend towards the use of low sulfur coals. Switching to low sulfur coals is the dominant approach for SO{sub 2 } emission reduction in the utility industry. Low sulfur coals generate high resistivity ash, which can cause an undesirable phenomenon called ''back corona. '' Higher particulate emissions occur if there is <b>back</b> <b>corona</b> in the ESP. Results of the pilot-scale testing identified the ''low temperature ESP'' concept to have the biggest impact for the two low sulfur coals investigated. Lowering the flue gas temperature to 220 F provided the maximum impact in terms of decreased emissions. Intermediate operating temperatures (reduction from 340 to 270 F) also gave significant ESP performance improvement. A significant reduction in particulate emissions was also noted when the flue gas humidity was increased (temperature held constant) from the baseline condition for these moderately high resistivity ash coals. Independent control of flue gas humidity and temperature was an important and a notable element in this project. Mercury emissions were also measured {{as a function of}} flue gas temperature. Mercury emissions decreased as the flue gas temperature was lowered, indicating the native ability of ash to capture the mercury. Pulsed operation of the ESP with the SIR module provided a 2 to 3 -fold reduction in emissions at the higher operating temperatures. In light of the positive results from Phase I, we propose proof of concept testing in the field in Phase II. The main objective of the Phase II testing would be to determine the ESP performance improvement as a function of flue gas temperature and humidity for a range of low-sulfur coals being fired by utilities. Equally important will be the long-term evaluation of the risk of corrosion and plugging (due to acid condensation) associated with low temperature operation. The impact of higher flue gas velocities (lower SCA-specific collection area), compared to the laboratory pilot program, would also need to be evaluated.

40|$|A triode corona {{charging}} system was developed with controlled charging parameters. Typically, the surface voltage of electrified film {{is close to}} the grid voltage. To achieve a large uniformly charged area, relatively large needle-electrode distance, small grid-electrode distance, large needle-grid distance, relatively high needle voltage, and relatively long charging time more than 20 seconds are desirable. The front and <b>back</b> sides of <b>corona</b> charged polymer films usually share similar magnitude but opposite polarities of surface voltage. The surface voltage on each side decays over time, while the ratio of the voltmeter-measured surface voltage to the fieldmeter-measured voltage difference is nearly constant, independent of film material, charging condition, voltage decay rate, and time. This phenomenon {{can be explained by the}} dipolar charge injection model. A small variation in surface density of free charges, as small as ~ 0. 1 % of the surface density of dipolar charges, may drastically change the absolute value of surface voltage and sometimes, even the polarity. The amount of free charges and the associated surface voltage can be tailored through contact electrification (CE), for which the key parameters include the film material, the liquid composition, and the external electric field. Contact electrification can be applied on either neutral or electrified films. By combining corona charging (CC) and CE, we can precisely control the surface voltages of polymer films. As the surface density of CE-induced free charges is much smaller than that of CC-induced dipolar charges and the latter is inherently more stable, the decay rate of free charges is much faster and the dipolar component of charge distribution is much more stable. The change in voltage difference across the film thickness is often negligible...|$|R

We investigate numerically in this work the evolutionary features of the magnetic configuration that includes a current-carrying flux rope, {{which is used to}} model the filament, after the loss of equilibrium in the system takes place in a catastrophic fashion. Rapid motions of the flux rope following the catastrophe invokes the velocity vortices behind the rope, and may invoke as well slow and fast mode shocks in front of the rope. The velocity vortices at each side of the flux rope propagate roughly horizontally away from the area where it is produced, and both shocks expand toward the flank of the flux rope. The fast one may eventually reach the bottom boundary and produces two echoes moving <b>back</b> into the <b>corona,</b> but the slow one and the vortices totally decay somewhere in the lower corona before arriving the bottom boundary. The interaction of the fast shock with the boundary leads to disturbance that accounts for the Moreton wave observed in Halpha, and the disturbance in the corona caused by the slow shock and the velocity vortices should account for the EIT wave whose speed is about 40 % that of the Moreton wave.

40|$|Abstract The radio {{emission}} of solar flares at decimeter wavelengths includes {{a variety of}} emission processes of a plasma thought {{to have a high}} beta. Very intense coherent emissions are observed at frequencies smaller than about 9 GHz. They are caused by plasma instabilities driving various wave modes that in turn may emit observable radio waves. Particularly important are type III bursts, caused by electron beams exciting Langmuir waves. Their sources may be used to trace the path of the electrons <b>back</b> in the <b>corona</b> to the acceleration region. Less known are {{radio emission}}s from trapped electrons driving loss-cone unstable waves, suspected for type IV bursts. These types of coherent radio emission give clues on the geometry and plasma parameters near the acceleration region. More speculative are emissions that are directly produced by the acceleration process. A possible group of such phenomena are narrowband, short peaks of emission. Narrowband spikes are seen sometimes at frequencies above the start of metric type III events. There is mounting evidence for the hypothesis that these spikes coincide with the energy release region. Much less clear is the situation for decimetric spikes, which are associated with hard X-ray flares. More frequently than spikes, however, there is fluctuating broadband decimetric emission during the hard X-ray phase of flares. The use of these coherent radio emissions as a diagnostic tool for the primary energy release requires a solid understanding of the emission process. At the moment we are still far away from an accepted theory. Complementary observations of energetic electrons and the thermal coronal background in EUV lines and soft X-rays can put coherent emissions into context and test the different emission scenarios. In combination with other wavelengths, spectroscopic imaging by FASR would provide exciting possibilities for the diagnostics of the acceleration process...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrostatic}} precipitator {{has been widely}} used {{for many years in}} the electricity supply industry to remove particles from a gas stream. The collection of particles in an {{electrostatic precipitator}} is adversely affected if the resistivity of the particles is high. Attempts to overcome this problem have been made by: flue gas conditioning, operating at high and low temperatures, modifying the shape of the applied voltage. This project is limited to the investigation of the last method. Effects of negative pulsed voltage on the characteristics of corona discharge in clean atmosphere are investigated when the laboratory scale electrode system is clean with collector electrode in clean and contaminated conditions respectively. Fundamental characteristics of clean electrode system are investigated to check whether there is any difference in the discharge mechanism under negative pulsed and negative D. C. voltages. From the measurement of the light intensity emitted from the discharge electrode, the ionisation activities in the high field strength region are interpreted both in the forms of average corona current and the temporal development and movement of ions and electrons. Linear relat ionship is found to exist between the average photon current and the average corona current under both negative D. C, and pulsed voltages. When the average photon current is the same, the discharge patterns are similar for both kinds of voltage. The collisions of highly energised ions with neutral gas molecules give rise to the phenomenon which is known as Electrical Wind is studied. Experimental evidence of these characteristics coupled with a theoretical study of corona discharge indicate that within the frequency range of 13 Hz - 150 Hz the discharge mechanism is the same for both voltages, and the instantaneous properties of the corona current pulse are affected by the accumulation of negative and positive space charges in the neighbourhood of the discharge electrode. Sparking mode is studied with a multiple-point electrode and the results are compared with that obtained with a single point electrode to check the role of negative streamers in forming the complete breakdown. Sparkover voltage is measured when the electrode system is energised by negative D. C. voltage and is compared with that which is obtained with pulsed voltage. The characteristics of the electrode system are changed when the anode plane is covered with a layer of highresistivity, porous material which is used to simulate the contamination condition. The sparkover voltage of the system is drastically reduced by the local gas discharge which takes place in the contaminant. In order to explain the change of sparkover voltage with pulsed energisation, some important properties of the discharge are studied, such as: the distribution of surface charge which accumulates on the layer, the conduction of current and the electrical breakdown in the contaminant, the effect of surface potential gradient on the formation of a stable back discharge. These features are summarised in a proposed mechanism of the formation of <b>back</b> <b>corona</b> discharge.

Understanding how mass and energy is released from the Sun and transported into interplanetary space is of increasing importance to our modern society which depends on space-based technology for global navigation and communications. In this work we explore the source regions, release and acceleration mechanisms, and elemental fractionation of the slow solar wind. In particular we seek to answer the following questions: (1) “How much plasma, if any, do the largest coronal loops contribute to the solar wind?”, (2) “Where and how does closed filed plasma escape into the solar wind and become accelerated?”, and (3) “What are the physical conditions and time scales required for gravitational settling?”. Towards these ends, we delve into over 20 years of solar wind data from two nearly identical Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) instruments which flew onboard the Ulysses (1990 – 2009) and Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE; 1998 - present) spacecraft. We utilize novel analysis methods and discover the existence of a new class of solar wind events which we call “heavy ion dropouts”. These dropouts have distinctive, mass-fractionated elemental composition indicative of specific coronal conditions and probable source regions.
