50|$|Small farmers {{depending}} on rain water {{are the worst}} hit during a drought. RCF promoted the concept of Vanrai Bandhara and well recharging and launched a huge drive to disseminate this knowledge to farmers. In addition, used empty bags of fertiliser required to construct the Vanrai <b>Bandharas</b> are supplied free of cost through different government agencies.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water in Murree in the 1920s, brewing was mostly transferred to Rawalpindi but malting continued at Ghora Gali until the 1940s, when this property was sold. This brewery, built in the Gothic style of architecture, was burnt during the independence of Pakistan in 1947, while the brewery in Quetta was destroyed in the 1935 Balochistan earthquake. In the 1940s, the controlling share or interest in the brewery was obtained by Peshton <b>Bandhara,</b> who used to run a liquor business in Lahore prior to the independence of Pakistan. His son, late M.P. <b>Bandhara</b> later carried on the business {{and now it is}} being run by a grandson, Mr Isphanyar <b>Bandhara.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Water is {{the most}} {{critical}} component of life support system. India shares about 16 % of the global population but it has only 4 % of the water resources. The national water policy gives priority to drinking water followed by agriculture, industry and power. The single most important task before {{the country in the}} field of India’s water resource management is to pay special attention to rainwater conservation, especially which falls on our vast rain-fed lands but most of which flows away from it. The Marathwada region is declared the drought for this year by state government, to overcome the water scarcity watershed management is decided to do near the Sataratanda it is the outskirt region of Aurangabad city. The proposed site of watershed management structure <b>bandhara</b> is located on stream flowing near the Sataratanda village. The proposed <b>bandhara</b> is design for the conservation of water and recharging into the ground to raise the water table of this particular area for the benefits to villagers, fields & farmers. Since last few decades the demand for water had rapidly grown and with the increasing population would continue to rise in future. In Maharashtra, the assessment of ground water potential and scope for artificial recharge in the overdeveloped watershed is very crucial. The total cost of cement <b>bandhara</b> works about 9 lakhs thus the scheme is found economically feasible. The quantity of water store in the <b>bandhara</b> basin is 0. 74 TCM...|$|R

Major wine producers in the Vinchur MIDC area are the Vinsura and Vinsula wineries.Other major crops include onions, grapes, soybean, tomatoes and flowers, all exported internationally, as well as wheat, gram, and other vegetables and grains (bajra, jovar, tur). Niphad is the largest grape processing location in India.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: New {{concept of}} {{drainage}} deepening and widening for groundwater recharge is emerging today. This new concept {{has been applied}} to Gadegaon village, taluka Warud, district Amravati(M. S.) has been studied carefully. In Gadegaon drainage near the public water supply well behind cement <b>bandhara</b> has been deepened by 2 meter, width 20 meter and length 140 meters. During this process silt and clay has been removed for ground water recharge purpose. Lithologically this area is overlain by shallow alluvium up to 13 meter depth. Below 13 meter vesicular basalt is present. Both alluvium and vesicular basalt are acting as potential aquifer in this region. The village Gadegaon was facing acute shortage of drinking water since long time. After water budgeting, it is observed that the shortage of water reaches about 115. 50 ham. After taking the structure of drainage deepening and widening adequate drinking water is available to public water supply well of Gadegaon village. This new concept of drainage deepening and widening can proved to be successful where weathered strata and clay over burden is present which restricts the groundwater percolation...|$|R
