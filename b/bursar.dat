50|$|The 1990s saw {{a decline}} in the number of University-employed staff in the Halls of residence, as {{contractors}} were engaged to provide most services such as cooked, cleaning, and maintenance.

The number of <b>Bursars</b> has reduced from eight - one in every hall - to only two since 2010. In 2007, the contracts for all security, maintenance, catering, and housekeeping were taken away from individual hall <b>Bursars</b> to the management of a single contract manager based at Senate House (University of London).|$|R

25|$|The faculties {{are parts}} of the {{university}}. Only the university {{as a whole is}} a legal personality. Nevertheless, the internal affairs of faculties are run by their respective self-governing bodies, which have similar rules and functions as those at the university level. Each faculty therefore has a Faculty Senate (also with students' and lecturers' curia), which among other things nominates the Dean (appointed by the Rector). As mentioned before, disciplinary misdemeanours are tried by the Faculty Disciplinary Commissions, while issues concerning study programmes are dealt with by the Faculty Scientific Boards. Each faculty has a Secretary instead of a <b>Bursar.</b>|$|E
