50|$|Gap Inc. {{acquired}} Banana Republic in 1983, eventually rebranding it as {{a mainstream}} luxury clothing retailer. The literate articles, hand-drawn catalog, and eccentric tourist-oriented items were phased out and were replaced with more luxurious, but not unique, items {{for which the}} brand is currently known. To set itself apart from Gap as a more upmarket <b>brand,</b> <b>Banana</b> Republic occasionally buys and refurbishes historic buildings for its retail locations.|$|R

50|$|Many {{mainstream}} <b>brands</b> (Gap, <b>Banana</b> Republic, Brooks Brothers) {{will use}} various (sub-)labels to differentiate their more expensive garments {{from the more}} common (e.g. Gap's 1964, Brooks' 1818 Collection), but these do not constitute lines per se. A fashion line will have its own retail outlets, design staff, offices, and often, catalogs.|$|R

50|$|His {{most recent}} book Righteous Dopefiend was co-authored with Jeff Schonberg and was {{published}} in June, 2009 by the University of California Press in their “Public Anthropology” series. The book won the 2010 Anthony Leeds Prize for Urban Anthropology. Bourgois' previous book was based on five years living with his family next to a crack house in East Harlem during the mid-1980s through the early 1990s: In Search of Respect: Selling Crack in El Barrio. It won the 1996 C. Wright Mills Award and the 1997 Margaret Mead Award among others. Many of his books and articles have been translated for foreign publication. He has also conducted research in Central America on ethnicity and social unrest {{and is the author}} of Ethnicity at Work: Divided Labor on a Central American Banana Plantation (1989) which was based on two years of living in the workers' barracks of a Chiquita <b>Brands</b> <b>banana</b> plantation spanning the borders of Costa Rica and Panama.|$|R
50|$|A {{differentiation}} {{strategy is}} appropriate where the target customer segment is not price-sensitive, {{the market is}} competitive or saturated, customers have very specific needs which are possibly under-served, and the firm has unique resources and capabilities which enable it to satisfy these needs {{in ways that are}} difficult to copy. These could include patents or other Intellectual Property (IP), unique technical expertise (e.g. Apple's design skills or Pixar's animation prowess), talented personnel (e.g. a sports team's star players or a brokerage firm's star traders), or innovative processes. Successful differentiation is displayed when a company accomplishes either a premium price for the product or service, increased revenue per unit, or the consumers' loyalty to purchase the company's product or service (brand loyalty). Differentiation drives profitability when the added price of the product outweighs the added expense to acquire the product or service but is ineffective when its uniqueness is easily replicated by its competitors. Successful brand management also results in perceived uniqueness even when the physical product is the same as competitors. This way, Chiquita was able to <b>brand</b> <b>bananas,</b> Starbucks could <b>brand</b> coffee, and Nike could brand sneakers. Fashion brands rely heavily on this form of image differentiation.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to put in evidence the interorganizational dynamics of brand alliances. More specifically {{the aim of the}} paper is to identify the business-to-business interactions within brand alliances through the governance adaptations that occur during a period of time. We show that these governance adaptations result from external (competitive pressure, value perception by consumers and customers) as well as internal forces (objectives and expectations of the partners, network positions, resources of the partners). Consequently the level of stability in the long run of brand alliances can be linked to organizational factors. To do our demonstration we propose an analytical framework that combines IMP concepts with theoretical works on dynamics of strategic alliances. The methodology follows the case study approach, with an empirical application to two examples of brand alliances: a certification <b>brand</b> with a <b>banana</b> <b>brand</b> on the Fair Trade market, and an association brand with a processed pork brand on the health food market.

50|$|In 1970 AMK {{merged with}} United Fruit Company, and adopted the name United Brands. Black became chairman, president, and CEO. At that time, United Fruit was {{importing}} {{about a third}} of all the bananas sold in the USA and owned the Chiquita <b>banana</b> <b>brand.</b> But Black soon discovered that United Fruit had far less capital than he had believed. The company soon became crippled with debt. The company's losses were exacerbated by Hurricane Fifi in 1974, which destroyed many of its banana plantations in Honduras. In 1974, United Brands reported losses of $40 million for the first three quarters of the year. Black struggled to keep the company solvent, and in December United Brands announced that it was selling its interest in Foster Grant, Inc. for $70 million.|$|R
50|$|He fathered two children, Paola and Camilo Reyes, in Bolivia with Bolivian, Ruth Argandoña, who {{had worked}} with Camilo Torres Restrepo, the priest and member of the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla {{organization}} of Colombia, but after his release, he left them. Reyes Mata escaped through eastern Bolivia across the Andes into Arica, Chile. Working from Chile, he attempted to unite the revolutionaries from Bolivia and Chile under the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) banner and participated in unionizing factory workers. He also reactivated his medical license to be able to improve health care in Chile. In Chile, he formed his last partnership, with Blanca Teresa González Iturriaga, by whom he had four more children: Chemy, Mayte, José Maria and Teresa. When Salvador Allende was overthrown in the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, Reyes Mata and his family obtained political asylum at the Honduran Embassy, until they could make arrangements to return to Central America. In March, 1979, he attended the Second Congress of the Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers (PRTC) and in April 1979 Reyes Mata was chosen as secretary general. In April, 1980, Reyes Mata was arrested during the run-up to the elections that year for a wave of pre-election violence and the kidnapping of a Texaco executive. He was released by a general amnesty that same year and briefly moved to Nicaragua to initiate plans for a RUF unit inside Honduras with Sandinista support. He returned to Honduras and kidnapped Arnold Quiros, vice president of US <b>Brands,</b> a US <b>banana</b> exporting corporation. Beginning in 1981, he conducted a recruitment campaign in Honduras for the RUF unit and sent volunteers from Managua to Cuba for military training. He was arrested later that year and convicted of the 1980 kidnapping but was later freed under a 1982 amnesty agreement. About the same time as he was released from prison, his trainees returned to Nicaragua and were placed with Sandinista units to gain combat experience.|$|R
