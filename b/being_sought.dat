5000|$|Evolutionism was {{a common}} 19th century belief that organisms {{inherently}} improve themselves through progressive inherited change over time, and increase in complexity through evolution. The belief went on to include cultural evolution and social evolution. In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was {{used to describe the}} idea [...] "that human <b>beings</b> <b>sought</b> to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".|$|R
5|$|A {{small group}} of {{toddlers}} show a distressing way of reuniting after a separation. Called a disorganized/disoriented style, this reunion pattern can involve looking dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors that seem to imply fearfulness {{of the person who}} is <b>being</b> <b>sought.</b> Disorganized attachment has been considered a major risk factor for child psychopathology, as it appears to interfere with regulation or tolerance of negative emotions and may thus foster aggressive behavior. Disorganized patterns of attachment have the strongest links to concurrent and subsequent psychopathology, and considerable research has demonstrated both within-the-child and environmental correlates of disorganized attachment.|$|E
5|$|Assisted by {{a network}} of former SS members, Mengele sailed to Argentina in July 1949. He {{initially}} lived in and around Buenos Aires, then fled to Paraguay in 1959 and Brazil in 1960 while <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> by West Germany, Israel, and Nazi hunters such as Simon Wiesenthal {{so that he could}} be brought to trial. In spite of extradition requests by the West German government and clandestine operations by the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, Mengele eluded capture. He drowned while swimming off the Brazilian coast in 1979 and was buried under a false name. His remains were disinterred and positively identified by forensic examination in 1985.|$|E

5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful and at times seemingly pointless.|$|E
5|$|Precise modern {{models of}} the Big Bang appeal to various exotic {{physical}} phenomena {{that have not been}} observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, {{but it is not clear}} whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still <b>being</b> <b>sought.</b> These are currently unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
5|$|A {{securely}} attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and {{happy to see}} the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent—showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns—and treat strangers {{much the same as}} caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is <b>being</b> <b>sought.</b> It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.|$|E

5|$|A {{video game}} {{set in the}} Mad Max {{universe}} was mentioned by franchise creator George Miller in a 2008 interview. Miller joined God of War II director Cory Barlog to develop the game after Barlog left Sony Computer Entertainment. The project was originally intended as a tie-in with a Mad Max animated film which would be released simultaneously. The film's production was suspended to allow adequate production time for the game. After Barlog announced in 2008 that a publisher for the game was <b>being</b> <b>sought,</b> no further information about the project was forthcoming. In 2010, Barlog was a consultant for Avalanche Studios, leaving in 2012 for Crystal Dynamics. A Fury Road tie-in video game was in development by Interplay Entertainment, but was scrapped when Electronic Arts acquired the franchise's video-game rights for $20 million.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1970s the museum {{acquired}} several important American aircraft; a B-17G Flying Fortress in 1978, a B-29 Superfortress in 1980, and a B-52 Stratofortress in 1983. With Duxford's {{association with the}} US Army Air Forces (USAAF), in the mid-1980s plans developed for a commemoration {{of the role of}} American air power in the Second World War. A group of American supporters was formed, and the architect Sir Norman Foster was commissioned to design a new building. Fundraising for the project began in 1987, support and funds <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> in the United States; the Founding Member was General Jimmy Doolittle in 1989. Fundraising events were held across the US in Houston (1989), Washington, D.C., (1991) and Los Angeles (1992). The project was widely supported in the United States by some 50,000 individual subscribers. A further $1million of funding was secured from Saudi Arabia, and £6.5million from the Heritage Lottery Fund. On 8 September 1995 the groundbreaking for the new building was performed by wartime 78th Fighter Group veteran, Major James E Stokes.|$|E

In May 1988, Conrail solicited proposals from developers for a building to house its corporate headquarters. On March 30, 1990, after <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> after by numerous developers in Philadelphia and its suburbs, Conrail {{announced that it would}} be leasing 27 floors of Two Commerce Square. With a lead tenant secured, construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990. Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3,000 employees in September of that year. Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper boom of the 1980s, being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Just before Edward's death, Parliament {{introduced}} {{a new form of}} taxation called the poll tax, which was levied at the rate of four pence on every person over the age of 14, with a deduction for married couples. Designed to spread the cost of the war over a broader economic base than previous tax levies, this round of taxation proved extremely unpopular but raised £22,000. The war continued to go badly and, despite raising some money through forced loans, the Crown returned to Parliament in 1379 to request further funds. The Commons were supportive of the young King, but had concerns about the amounts of money <b>being</b> <b>sought</b> and the way this was being spent by the King's counsellors, whom they suspected of corruption. A second poll tax was approved, this time with a sliding scale of taxes against seven different classes of English society, with the upper classes paying more in absolute terms. Widespread evasion proved to be a problem, and the tax only raised £18,600— far short of the £50,000 that had been hoped for.|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit <b>being</b> <b>sought.</b> Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
