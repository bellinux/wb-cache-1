5|$|On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne {{was signed}} between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under direct German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine {{became part of}} Germany. Italy would control its own zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone libre, would be governed by the newly formed Vichy {{government}} (État Français) led by Pétain. Vichy was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> was essentially a German client state.|$|E
5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> would only do so in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E
5|$|Stanisław August Poniatowski, King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was the {{commander-in-chief}} of the Polish forces, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> he delegated this position to his nephew, Prince Józef Poniatowski. Poniatowski had in theory {{at his disposal}} a 48,000 strong Crown army and the Lithuanian army more than half that size to confront them. In practice, Polish forces, still forming following the reforms of the Constitution of 3 May (which specified an army size of 100,000) numbered only 37,000. The army {{was in the midst}} of reorganizing, with key documents on unit numbers and composition passed as recently as in April; it was also short on equipment and experienced personnel.|$|E

5|$|The launch, which {{occurred}} in pre-dawn darkness, {{was the first}} American night launch since Apollo 17, and was watched by several thousand spectators. The unusual launching time was due to tracking requirements for the primary payload, INSAT-1B; the program would not have another night launch until STS-61-B in 1985. The crew had attempted to prepare for it by training in darkened simulators so as to keep their night vision, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> {{it was discovered that}} the light of the solid-fuel rocket boosters made the immediate area around the launchpad virtually as bright as a day launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} crusading {{order of}} the Knights Templar also held extensive property in England, bringing in around £2,200 per annum {{by the time of}} their fall. It comprised primarily rural holdings rented out for cash, but also included some urban properties in London. Following the dissolution of the Templar order in France by Philip IV of France, Edward II ordered their properties to be seized and passed to the Hospitaller order in 1313, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> many properties were taken by local landowners and the Hospital was still attempting to reclaim them twenty-five years later.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Greenlandic {{is highly}} synthetic and exclusively suffixing, {{with the exception}} of a single highly limited and fossilized demonstrative prefix. It creates very long words by means of adding strings of suffixes to a stem. In principle there is no limit to the length of a Greenlandic word, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> words with more than half a dozen derivational suffixes are not so frequent, and the average number of morphemes per word is 3 to 5. The language employs around 318 inflectional suffixes and between four and five hundred derivational ones.|$|E

40|$|The {{synchronization}} of asynchronous signals {{can lead}} to metastable behavior and malfunction of digital circuits. It is believed - but not proved - that metastability principally cannot be avoided. Confusion exists about its practical importance. This paper shows that metastable behavior can be avoided by usage of quantum synchronizers <b>in</b> principle, <b>but</b> not <b>in</b> <b>practice,</b> and that conventional synchronizers unavoidably show metastable behavior <b>in</b> principle, <b>but</b> not <b>in</b> <b>practice,</b> if properly designed...|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the double {{crossover}} (DX) complex, which contains two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
5|$|The {{sovereign}} may appoint anyone a Privy Counsellor, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> appointments {{are made}} {{only on the}} advice of Her Majesty's Government. The majority of appointees are senior politicians, including Ministers of the Crown, the few most senior figures of Loyal Opposition, the Parliamentary leader of the third-largest party, a couple of the most senior figures in the devolved British governments and senior politicians from Commonwealth countries. Besides these, the Council includes a very few members of the Royal Family (usually the consort and heir apparent only), a few dozen judges from British and Commonwealth countries, a few clergy and a small number of senior civil servants.|$|E
5|$|The sticky {{bomb was}} a glass flask filled with {{nitroglycerin}} and given an adhesive coating {{allowing it to}} be glued to a passing vehicle. In theory, it could be thrown, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> it would most likely need to be placed—thumped against the target with sufficient force to stick—requiring courage and good fortune to be used effectively. An order for one million sticky bombs was placed in June 1940, but various problems delayed their distribution in large numbers until early 1941, {{and it is likely}} that fewer than 250,000 were produced.|$|E

5|$|Veltmann {{scored a}} {{victory at the}} {{beginning}} of his defense: he moved and was granted that each officer's testimony could only be applied to the men they had specifically named as having been given the order to work. In principle, this ruling was favorable, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> it would only benefit the men if the court had been attentively keeping notes for each accused man. Instead, reporters observed the court to be drowsy at times, with one particular judge regularly nodding off.|$|E
5|$|In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to Philip II of France, leaving English {{power on}} the {{continent}} limited to Gascony and Poitou. John raised {{taxes to pay for}} military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a Papal fiefdom, owing allegiance to the Pope. In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the Magna Carta. The treaty would have limited potential abuses of royal power, demobilised the rebel armies and set up a power-sharing arrangement, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> neither side complied with its conditions. John and the loyalist barons firmly repudiated the Magna Carta and the First Barons' War erupted, with the rebel barons aided by Philip's son, the future Louis VIII, who claimed the English throne for himself. The war soon settled into a stalemate, with neither side able to claim victory. The King became ill and died on the night of 18 October, leaving the nine-year-old Henry as his heir.|$|E
5|$|Odaenathus {{observed}} all due formalities {{towards the}} emperor, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> ruled {{as an independent}} monarch. In 266, the king launched a second invasion of Persia but had to abandon the campaign and head north to Bithynia to repel the attacks of Germanic riders besieging the city of Heraclea Pontica. He was assassinated in 267 during or immediately after the Anatolian campaign, together with Hairan. The identities of the perpetrator or the instigator are unknown and many stories, accusations and speculations exist in ancient sources. He was succeeded by his son Vaballathus under the regency of his widow Zenobia, who used the power established by Odaenathus to forge the Palmyrene Empire in 270.|$|E

5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee for a loan to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. <b>But,</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|The Boers and {{the local}} Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his {{district}} in 1852, and in August that year he {{took part in the}} Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy. Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but only knocked him out, then later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket without wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.|$|E
5|$|The Great Fire of 1835 {{destroyed}} {{most of the}} old financial buildings, and {{in their}} place {{a wide variety of}} new buildings were erected and demolished in quick succession during the 1840s and 1850s; traveler Philip Hone suggested that the entire city was being rebuilt every decade. Most buildings adopted the Italian Renaissance inspired palazzo-style of architecture popular in England, and rose no more than five or six stories. New York did not have any restrictions on the height of buildings, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> low-rise buildings were the norm, at least until 1865, with the tallest buildings being the city's churches. New York's population tripled between 1840 and 1870, and property values soared, increasing by more than 90 percent between 1860 and 1875.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of West German Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & Froude with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice,</b> fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
5|$|When World War II {{broke out}} in 1939, the {{southern}} African territory of Southern Rhodesia had been a self-governing colony of the United Kingdom for 16 years, having gained responsible government in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. In practice, it acted as a quasi-dominion, and was treated as such {{in many ways by}} the rest of the Commonwealth. Southern Rhodesia's white population in 1939 was 67,000, a minority of about 5%; the black population was a little over a million, and there were about 10,000 residents of coloured (mixed) or Indian ethnicity. The franchise was non-racial and in theory open to all, contingent on meeting financial and educational qualifications, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>practice</b> very few black citizens were on the electoral roll. The colony's Prime Minister was Godfrey Huggins, a physician and veteran of World War I (1914–18) who had emigrated to Rhodesia from England in 1911 and held office since 1933.|$|E
