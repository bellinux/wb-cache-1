500|$|Working in {{this fashion}} profoundly {{influenced}} everyone involved with the show. Series star Kyle Chandler said: [...] "When I look back at my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [...] Peter Berg really changed my life.'" [...] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: [...] "When I first came on [...] set, I thought, it’s interesting – this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> what filmmaking was." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Cocktails" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Human Resources {{representative}} Toby Flenderson on the series. Lost series creator J. J. Abrams was hired on as episode director, his first such credit for the series. Abrams disliked the American series when it first premiered, due to his love for the original British series. The director explained, [...] "I resented it <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, because I thought, 'well, {{how are you going}} to do what Ricky and Steve did. In fact, the first season I didn't get into it at all. In the second season, they really found their voice. And that's despite having to make 22 episodes, which is twice the length of what the BBC show did. And I thought that the show became brilliant. I was really impressed by how it worked." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew I had my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E

But <b>before</b> <b>I</b> went <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that there were many others {{standing}} idle about the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why should}} he be so jealous now? Only day <b>before</b> {{yesterday}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Simpson of Duluth hand you a nosegay right before him!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course I am. He died <b>before</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him fall down--just there, {{where those}} ashes are burning now--and wondered, I remember, why it didn't help him.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "On {{that day}} of October 13, 1917, without remembering the {{predictions}} of the children, I was enchanted by a remarkable spectacle in the sky of a kind I had never seen <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it from this veranda ..." [...] —Portuguese poet Afonso Lopes Vieira.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have all}} these great stories in the book," [...] I told her, [...] "Why don't you use them in the song?" [...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book {{and walked out of the}} room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. Suddenly she was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E
60|$|I had {{to think}} for a moment <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> what he was {{referring}} to.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not before; afterwards. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> him <b>before,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{him again}} {{on this very}} night of his disappearance. In my mother's room, in fact. I left him there. You will read in this paper all that is known of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied, [...] "Oh no! I have {{a husband}} of my own, to whom <b>I</b> was married <b>before</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suddenly {{one night}} I {{woke up and}} lay still, {{and it was as}} if I had never seen Amanda <b>before.</b> Now <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her plainly, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her with that same dreadful {{clearness}} that sometimes comes at dawn, a pitiless, a scientific distinctness that has neither light nor shadow....|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard you}} {{rustling}} through the fern <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you," [...] he said, {{coming up and}} giving her his hand to help her down the slope.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{one knows}} it {{but you and}} I. The paper was left here for me by mistake. I opened it <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that it was {{addressed}} to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} bushes move long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you," [...] she began. [...] "I said first, 'it is some terrible beast;' next, 'it is a poacher;' next, 'it is a friend!'" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} <b>before</b> she knocked! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in her white face, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in her trembling hands, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it in her look at Laura.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. But I've {{been taught}} {{that it gave}} woman greater glory in heaven. There have been men here before you, men who talked to me, and <b>I</b> doubted <b>before</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> you. And afterward--I knew." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then she went, ere I {{could call}} her, With the too proud temper ruling that had parted us <b>before,</b> And <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> her form descend the slopes, and smaller grow and smaller, [...] Till I caught its course no more [...] .|$|R
6000|$|His {{companion}} grinned {{across the}} table, {{as if he}} had shared Pan's experience. [...] "Reckon you needn't tell me you're a cowpuncher. I heard you comin' <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you.... My name's Brown." ...|$|E
6000|$|Twenty-one years elapsed <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Carleton again. I {{was then}} sojourning {{with my family}} at the Schweitzerhof, in Luzerne. He called on me, shook hands cordially, and said at once, without any preliminaries, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The engine-driver and stoker {{are both}} alive," [...] the porter told him. [...] "I came across them <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you. They're both knocked sort of sillylike, but they aren't much hurt. The guard's stone dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like to {{know that}} it's all there,--and I did know it <b>before</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> you. I'm blessed if I know it now. Go down and join the ladies, will you? You ain't much of a {{companion}} up here." ...|$|R
5000|$|He showed great {{interest}} in law as a boy: [...] "The law had a perfect fascination for me <b>before</b> <b>I</b> was ten years old, and <b>I</b> think <b>before</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>saw</b> a lawyer or a court." [...] He often went to the court house in Woodstock, Vermont to listen to cases.|$|R
6000|$|... "A time passed. I don't {{know whether}} it was a minute or an hour. The heavens and the earth {{disappeared}} from <b>before</b> me. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> nothing but the double of myself, with the pointing hand. I felt nothing but the longing to kill the boy.|$|R
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} half-past seven, or nearer eight, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the door open, and that dear figure come towards {{me in the}} rain. I {{was waiting for her}} on the beach before she had crossed the sand-hills.|$|E
60|$|I had {{no sooner}} got into Dartmoor than I began to {{plan to get}} out again, and you can readily believe that, with wits {{sharpened}} by twelve years of warfare, it was not very long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my way.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that he drank at all--he {{certainly}} had not been drinking up to half an hour <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that body fall overboard," [...] she answered, [...] "for I was with him on deck up to that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] she said, [...] "Dane {{came back}} on the Orinoco, the day <b>before</b> yesterday. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{his name in the}} paper. If his voyage to England had been a success, which it could not have been, you would have heard from him before now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Prince Albert and the Queen, God wot, [...] (Be blessings on {{the glorious}} pair!) [...] <b>Before</b> us passed, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them not, [...] <b>I</b> only <b>saw</b> a cap of hair.|$|R
6000|$|Rowan {{wiped the}} sweat from his forehead. His {{breathing}} was becoming difficult. Already the excitement was affecting him. [...] "But it was there on that night!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "He took off his coat a few minutes <b>before,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him feel it in the lining." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{succeeded in}} {{frightening}} a hare, {{but that was}} all," [...] Godfrey laughed. [...] "It ran almost between my legs <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, and I think it startled me quite as much as my shot alarmed it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was well}} {{inclined}} to him <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him. I liked him when I did see him. I admire him now. There is charm in beauty for itself, Caroline; {{when it is}} blent with goodness, there is a powerful charm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, {{what shall}} I do?" [...] she queried. [...] "I'll take the back trail of these horses. They {{certainly}} hadn't been here long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them. And the rider may be close. If not I'll take the horses home." ...|$|E
60|$|The case {{looked more}} and more hopeless the longer I viewed it, yet with a {{stubborn}} persistency I forged ahead toward the foothills. Behind me no sign of pursuit developed, <b>before</b> me <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no living thing. It was as though I moved through a dead and forgotten world.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Lucy, 'I {{have heard}} {{what you say}} about those things <b>before,</b> but <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> them in {{connection}} with each other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not worry}} yourself, my dear. I am not by nature timid. I come of a {{fighting}} stock which has sent out heroes, and I {{belong to a}} family wherein is the gift of Second Sight. Why should we fear? We know! Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you in that dress <b>before.</b> Teuta, <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> you and Rupert married!" [...] This time she herself it was that seemed disconcerted.|$|R
