25|$|Besides {{the harbor}} and the beaches, there is another {{distinguishing}} feature of El Jebha: The Mosque. During the last decade El Jebha experienced an increasing population with a similar increase in size. This resulted in an overcrowded mosque, which could not hold this increasing number of people. For this reason a <b>big</b> <b>new</b> mosque {{was built in the}} tradition of Moroccan coastal places. This means that the color white prevails in both the exterior as the interior designs of the building structure.|$|E

25|$|Peckinpah {{was next}} signed to direct The Cincinnati Kid, a {{gambling}} {{drama about a}} young prodigy who takes on an old master during a <b>big</b> <b>New</b> Orleans poker match. Before filming started, producer Martin Ransohoff began to receive phone calls about the Major Dundee ordeal and was told Peckinpah was impossible to work with. In addition, Peckinpah decided to shoot {{in black and white}} and was hoping to transform the screenplay into a social realist saga about a kid surviving the tough streets of the Great Depression. After four days of filming, which reportedly included some nude scenes, Ransohoff disliked the rushes and immediately fired him. Eventually directed by Norman Jewison and starring Steve McQueen, the film {{went on to become a}} 1965 hit.|$|E

25|$|Petro-Canada {{overestimated}} {{the future}} price of oil, and consequently paid high {{prices for the}} oil assets it acquired, which subsequently fell considerably in value. Its assumption that <b>big</b> <b>new</b> oil discoveries would {{be made in the}} Arctic and off the Atlantic coast turned out to be incorrect. Petro-Canada has since abandoned all the wells Panarctic drilled, and the discoveries it did make off the Atlantic coast were fewer, more expensive, and took longer to develop than expected. Hibernia did not produce oil until 1997 and Terra Nova until 2002. The government also expected Petro-Canada to force down what it considered the high price of gasoline to consumers, but Petro-Canada's oil production was more expensive and its oil refineries less efficient than those of the competing multi-national companies, and it found itself losing money on all aspects of the oil industry.|$|E
25|$|Harvick {{was born}} in 1975 in Bakersfield, California to parents Mike and JoNell (Fitterer) Harvick. He is a <b>big</b> <b>New</b> York Yankees fan. He has a younger sister, Amber and an older brother Clayton. Harvick began kart racing at an early age, after his parents bought him a go-kart as a {{kindergarten}} graduation gift in 1980. Over the next decade Harvick achieved considerable success on the go-kart racing circuit, earning seven national championships and two Grand National championships. In 1992, he started racing late models part-time in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series and he competed there while still in high school. While in 5th grade Harvick gave a glimpse of his future career plans when he completed a class project poster listing his goals as competing in NASCAR and racing at the Indy 500. Harvick's father, a firefighter and fixture around the Bakersfield racing scene, built him his first car {{to compete in the}} lower NASCAR Series by using the money he earned to run his own garage, Harvick Motorsports. When Harvick could not race, such as in the winter, he competed on his high school wrestling team at North High School in Bakersfield winning a CIF Central Section title in his weight class his senior year. Growing up Harvick also participated in baseball, basketball, football, and soccer. Originally intending to attend college and major in architecture, Harvick took classes at Bakersfield College. However he found his heart was in racing and dropped out to continue his racing career full-time.|$|E

Matt Groening and the writers had continuous feedback on the game's content, from its [...] "look and feel" [...] to its puzzles and gameplay. The game's executive producer, Scot Amos, {{said it was an}} amazing partnership between the writers and the developers. Selman, the head writer, says the reason they decided to call it The Simpsons Game and not add a subtitle was because they felt it was a restart of [...] "the 'Simpsons' gaming franchise [...] a <b>big,</b> <b>new,</b> fresh game that takes on video games and hilarious things of all time".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{believed the}} episode [...] "got us quickly {{back on track}} after last week's lackluster tale," [...] and called the killer revelation the greatest shock she has received on the series thus far. She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just when you think they might be stuck in old habits, they come up with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one <b>big</b> <b>new</b> plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
