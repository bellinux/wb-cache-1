40|$|Buck {{regulators}} {{are used to}} efficiently step down a higher level, unregulated input voltage to a regulated output voltage. In applications requiring DC-DC conversion from a high input voltage, the <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> dramatically improves conversion efficiency relative to linear regulator alternatives. However, applying the <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> to applications with high input-to-output step-down ratios creates significant challenges for the pulse-width modulation (PWM) controller. Because the duty cycle of the <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> switch is approximately equal to VOUT/VIN, a buck DC-DC converter with high input/output voltage ratio must control very narrow PWM pulses. The switching frequency of a <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> is generally set to a high level {{to reduce the size}} of the inductor and capacitors. High switching frequency and low duty cycle translates to very short pulse durations in the controller. For example, a <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> with an input voltage of 66 V and an output voltage of 3. 3 V will require a buck switch duty cycle of approximately 5 %. At a typical switching frequency of 300 kHz, the required PWM on-time of the buck switch is a mere 166 ns. Control methods or topologies used in buck regulators include Voltage-NEXT ISSUE...|$|E

40|$|To {{maximize}} system efficiency, <b>buck</b> <b>regulators</b> minimize {{power loss}} in the switching MOSFETs, inductor, capacitors, controller, and printed circuit board traces. Fairchild’s TinyBuck ® family of synchronous <b>buck</b> <b>regulators</b> combines low RDS,ON MOSFETs with a driver capable of delivering fast switching speeds with short dead times in a single package. The fast switching speeds help minimize switching loss, but can contribute to voltage ringing on the switch node when the high-side MOSFET turns on. The ringing should be monitored and limited to levels that keep the MOSFET switches and controller pins within the safe operating region while meeting relevant derating guidelines.

40|$|Abstract – While {{naturally}} sampled {{peak and}} valley current mode control {{methods have been}} widely used, other control architectures are possible using gated sampling techniques. Theory for an emulated peak current mode control method using a gated sample and hold of the valley current is developed. This gated sampling technique removes the duty cycle dependence of the slope compensating ramp, stabilizing the modulator gain over changes in line voltage. A general solution for current mode <b>buck</b> <b>regulator</b> small signal linear equations is presented. This allows the modulator gain for any control method to be introduced into the equations, including peak, valley, average and gated sampling methods. Comparison to peak and valley is made using switching, linear and LaPlace spice models. Sub-harmonic stability bounds are demonstrated using graphical spreadsheet calculators. Theory is verified with frequency response measurements of an actual circuit.
