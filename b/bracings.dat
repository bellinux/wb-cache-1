5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical <b>bracings,</b> and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal trusses and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E

25|$|Spiritual, emotional, and {{mathematical}} intellectuality, too, {{is behind the}} family group of Archipenko. This group, in plaster, might have been made of dough. It represents a featureless, large, strong male—one gets the impression of strength from humps and lumps—an impression of a female, less vivid, and the vague knowledge that a child is mixed up in the general embrace. The faces are rather blocky, the whole group with arms intertwined—arms that end suddenly, no hands, might be the sketch of a sculpture to be. But when one gets an insight it is intensely more interesting. It is, eventually, clear that in portraying his idea of family love the sculptor has built his figures with pyramidal strength; they are grafted together with love and geometric design, their limbs are <b>bracings,</b> ties of strength, they represent, not individuals, but the structure itself of family life. Not family life as one sees it, but the unseen, the deep emotional unseen, and in making his group when the sculptor found himself verging upon the seen—that is, when he no longer felt the unseen—he stopped. Therefore the hands were not essential. And this expression {{is made in the}} simplest way. Some will hoot at it, but others will feel the respect that is due one who simplifies and expresses the deep things of life. You may say that such is literature in marble—well, it is the most modern sculpture.|$|E
500|$|Gille's battlecruiser design {{called for}} a {{displacement}} of [...] on a hull that was [...] long between perpendiculars, with a beam of [...] at the waterline and an average draft of [...] The freeboard forward was , and aft was [...] The hull lines of the ships proved to be highly efficient in tank tests during the design process. Due to the extreme weight of the main battery turrets at the bow and stern, the hull had to be strengthened to handle the strain. Very strong longitudinal bracing was incorporated, and {{the inner and outer}} skins of the hull was thickened to reinforce the <b>bracings.</b> The ships' expected metacentric height was , comparable to the British Lion class. Each ship would be crewed by 41officers and 1,258enlisted men.|$|E

60|$|Although well {{weighted}} by {{her heavy}} cargo, {{and by the}} extra planking on her sides, and extra <b>bracings</b> inside, the Ice King made good time on her trip. It was summer, yet as the vessel turned northward it became colder daily, and soon the boys were glad enough to take Barwell Dawson's advice and don heavier underwear. Then, as it grew still colder, they put on thicker outer garments also.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a time}} {{of extreme}} peril for the boys in the sawdust pit {{at the bottom of the}} wooden slide, and nobody {{realized}} this more thoroughly than did Dave. In some manner the wooden <b>bracings</b> had become loosened, and the ponderous slide was in danger of coming down with a mighty crash on their heads. If it did this, more than likely some of the lads would be seriously injured, if not killed.|$|E
6000|$|The Ice King was a two-masted steamer {{that had}} been built {{for use in the}} icy seas of the north. She was small, broad of beam, and shallow, with an outer [...] "jacket" [...] of stout oak planks, and a prow and stern of steel. Inside, all the <b>bracings</b> were extra heavy, and the {{railings}} of the deck were of the hardest kind of timber. She carried an engine of great power, and steam could be gotten up both with coal and with oil.|$|E
6000|$|As I read them, {{they were}} men wholly of this world, bent on doing {{the most in}} it, and making {{the best of it}} that they could;--men, to their death, of Deed, never pausing, changing, repenting, or anticipating, more than the {{completed}} square, ὰνευ ψογου, of their battle, their keep, and their cloister. Soldiers before and after everything, they learned the lockings and <b>bracings</b> of their stones primarily in defence against the battering-ram and the projectile, and esteemed the pure circular arch for its distributed and equal strength more than for its beauty. [...] "I believe again," [...] says M. le Duc,[16] [...] "that the feudal castle never arrived at its perfectness till after the Norman invasion, and that this race of the North was the first to apply a defensive system under unquestionable laws, soon followed by the nobles of the Continent, after they had, at their own expense, learned their superiority." ...|$|E

50|$|A {{cellular}} vessel is {{a container}} ship specially {{designed for the}} efficient storage of freight containers {{one on top of}} other with vertical <b>bracings</b> at the four corners. The majority of vessels operated by maritime carriers are fully cellular ships.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} built in an English Cottage style. It {{features}} polychrome brick, metal casement windows, a stone-arched doorway, half-timbered gables, and rustic posts and <b>bracings</b> on the drive-thru. The domestic character of the building was typical for filling stations built in the same era.|$|E
50|$|Wall <b>bracings</b> plans {{specify the}} amount and type of {{sheathing}} or lateral bracing that is needed for the house to withstand the applicable design wind speed. In higher wind speed areas, the wall bracing plans may additionally specify embedded or post-installed hold-downs, pre-fabricated steel wall panels, steel moment frames, etc.|$|E
50|$|The two-story {{sanctuary}} is cruciform {{and decorated}} with Gothic Revival woodwork. The ornamental <b>bracings</b> imitate Gothic support structures as they conceal the steel beams. The two subsequent additions, the elementary building (1931) and the education building (1963), {{are connected to the}} sanctuary by a breezeway and have the same Gothic Revival exterior.|$|E
50|$|Advance Steel has {{a library}} of more than 300 preset {{parametric}} steel connections to connect Advance elements grouped in the following categories: beam end to end joints, base plate joints, general bracing joints, cantilever beam to column joints, plate joints, clip angle joints, pylon joints, tube brace joints, purlin joints, stiffener joints, turnbuckle <b>bracings,</b> etc.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} {{the stability of the}} enormous display tombs, they have iron <b>bracings</b> and wood lining inside. This avoids both cave-ins and a buckling of the side walls from the weight of the cover. The cover of the double tomb of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband alone weighs approximately 1700 kg (3800 lb).|$|E
50|$|Originally {{the company}} was called Monington & Co. James Weston joined later. Also {{associated}} with J. Monington was D. Rogers. However {{the company was}} owned and run by William S Watts from 1911 until 1972 when it {{was taken over by}} his son Bernard. Their patent (1106) was granted on 27 April 1871 for combined wood and metal <b>bracings.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{engine and}} gearbox unit had four live rubber {{mountings}} and the silencer and exhaust pipe were similarly insulated. The frame was rigidly cross braced with the deep side members dropped {{in order to}} give a low body mounting. Where the cross <b>bracings</b> ran into the side members they were welded to form a box section which gave stiffness.|$|E
5000|$|The {{approaches}} for distance of 980 {{feet on the}} northern side, and 440 feet on the southern, are of timber in bays of four upright and two battering piles, secured by wallings and <b>bracings,</b> with openings of twenty-five feet the ballast and permanent way is laid on planking, resting on double longitudinal girders with traverse joists.|$|E
50|$|Buckenhill Grange was a L-shaped 1750 {{farmhouse}} {{built in}} the Dutch style with gables out of coarse-hewn stone. On the west gable of this home farm was added a modelled barn with strong diagonal <b>bracings.</b> It had a granary below which was a cobble-stone farm yard for free-range hens. The Buckenhill Mill was acquired by purchase by Thomas Tomkins, son of Packington in 1728.|$|E
50|$|The trussed tube, also termed braced tube, {{is similar}} to the simple tube but with {{comparatively}} fewer and farther-spaced exterior columns. Steel <b>bracings</b> or concrete shear walls are introduced along the exterior walls to compensate for the fewer columns by tying them together. The most notable examples incorporating steel bracing are the John Hancock Center, the Citigroup Center, and the Bank of China Tower.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932, {{the bridge}} was {{extensively}} rebuilt by GWR. Half the wooden piles were replaced with new creosoted pitch pine. Additional work also included changing the cross members and <b>bracings.</b> The work increased the overall width of the viaduct to 8.5 m.Despite the nationalisation of the [...] "Big Four" [...] British railway companies in 1947, the viaduct remained a privately owned toll road for traffic between Penrhyndeudraeth and Harlech.|$|E
50|$|Outram {{set out to}} {{overcome}} {{the problems with the}} Holmes Aqueduct by making the walls thicker where they joined the baseplates which were also thicker. However a major stress was the compressive force {{along the top of the}} wall plates where they bow outwards or inwards. In 1875 cross <b>bracings</b> were added to reinforce it. The Stakes Aqueduct is the oldest surviving aqueduct of its type that is still in use for its original purpose.|$|E
50|$|With the advancements in {{metallurgy}} {{throughout the}} early 20th century. Saw {{the introduction of}} tubular steel water pipes (instead of timber poles) with standardized dimensions, allowing for the industrial interchangeability of parts and improving the structural stability of the scaffold. The use of diagonal <b>bracings</b> also helped to improve stability, especially on tall buildings. The first frame system was brought to market by SGB in 1944 and was used extensively for the postwar reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the primary}} {{use for a}} bicycle stand is for parking, it is useful at times {{to use it for}} adjustments. While it is {{difficult}} to spin a rear wheel while making derailleur adjustments, if a stand were high enough to support the rear of the bike by the saddle nose, then this problem could be solved. Generally speaking, stands are not high enough for this and quite often have <b>bracings</b> and other obstructions in their construction that would prevent such use.|$|E

5000|$|Rack Phase Difference (RPD) is a {{difference}} in the elevation between rack teeth of the chords of any single leg of a jackup rig with open truss type legs. This type of jackup vessel operates with a rack and pinion drive system, as opposed to the pin-hole system found on jackups rigs with tubular legs. The legs are mostly triangular though some with rectangular designs can be found. The chords are connected via a network of <b>bracings</b> to reinforce the leg structure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} won {{status as}} a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1997. [...] According to the Landmark Commission report, {{this was not an}} expensive building for its time, and many of the structural components (like the staircase <b>bracings</b> in the stairwell) were left exposed to save money. Yet lots of thought went into humanizing the space and creating a good environment for learning, with plenty of natural light and air, expansive collaborative spaces, and lots of playful decoration thrown in for good measure: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge is}} made of {{reinforced}} concrete, with a height over the river below of less than 60 meters. The total length is 190.50 m, and the width is 8.9 m. The main arc has a span of 90 m and a rise of 38 m, and a subsidiary field of 4 × 13.5 m and 3 × 15.5 m. The main field {{is made up of}} two arched passports connected by <b>bracings.</b> The distance of the arches at the top is 6 m, at the base 8.25 m, and the peak height of the columns is 28 m.|$|E
5000|$|Monty's Hotel or Montgomery Hotel & Bar was {{established}} in 1880s at Parklane. The hotel and bar was patronised by British Officers posted in Secunderabad. The hotel has gothic traceried windows, steep pitched roofs with wooden <b>bracings</b> and an imposing European facade.Monty's Bar is a local landmark. Presently only the bar is functional. Monty's Hotel was declared as Grade IIb heritage structure by HUDA. Presently the hotel is in a dilapidated condition and poorly maintained. There was a proposal in 2009 by state government to delist it from list of Heritage structures and demolish it. However, this was stayed by AP High Court ...|$|E
50|$|One of the {{builders}} {{of the new}} $1,500,000 Meeker Avenue Bridge was John Kelly, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, who was a former Navy deep-sea diver and became famous for helping {{to work on the}} new bridge. In 1938, he completed his task of building a cofferdam, a box-like structure made of 250 steel sheets. This enabled workmen to operate and build an underwater pier in dry surroundings on the Greenpoint side of the new bridge; after that, Kelly began cutting away cofferdam <b>bracings</b> on the Queens side, at Laurel Hill Boulevard and Review Avenue. One of the tools he worked with was an underwater-operated cutting torch, which burned oxygen, hydrogen, and compressed air.|$|E
50|$|The {{monument}} {{marks the}} transition between the elevated and the underground {{structure of the}} Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit. During {{the construction of the}} transition area, cut-and-cover construction of the box culvert tunnel has to commence below the statue. The contractor for the transition area, SOWJ (Shimizu-Obayashi-Wijaya Karya-Jaya construction), created a temporary steel frame structure to protect the statue during the digging of the ground below. This protection structure consists of an H-beam kingpost, <b>bracings,</b> angle brackets, and a borepile {{at the bottom of the}} kingpost. After the completion of the work, this temporary protection structure will be demolished and the ground foundation of the statue refilled on top of the MRT's box culvert tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|Wall panels {{built of}} studs are {{interrupted}} by sections that provide rough openings for doors and windows. Openings are typically spanned by a header or lintel that bears {{the weight of}} structure above the opening. Headers are usually built to rest on trimmers, also called jacks. Areas around windows are defined by a sill beneath the window, and cripples, which are shorter studs that span the area from the bottom plate to the sill and sometimes {{from the top of}} the window to a header, or from a header to a top plate. Diagonal <b>bracings</b> made of wood or steel provide shear (horizontal strength) as do panels of sheeting nailed to studs, sills and headers.|$|E
5000|$|The new Sikorsky design, the S-42, {{had major}} {{aerodynamic}} improvements over the S-40. Igor Sikorsky said, [...] "in its very outline the S-42 represents simplicity. Diverting sharply {{from the past}} Sikorsky designs, external <b>bracings</b> {{have been reduced to}} a minimum. The tail, instead of being supported by outriggers, is attached directly to the hull." [...] The S-42 had a high wing loading which required flaps to provide acceptable takeoff and landing speeds. [...] Though Lindbergh approved of the S-42, it fell far short of his proposed range Stripped of all accommodations, with extra fuel tanks in the fuselage, the S-42 was just able to fly proving flights across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Pan Am would {{have to wait for the}} Martin M-130 to have an airliner capable of flying the Pacific with a payload.|$|E
