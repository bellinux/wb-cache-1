5|$|Naylor had scouted Australia {{to get an}} idea of {{locations}} and finance costs, with pre-production beginning in 2004 and filming planned for 2005. However, finding sufficient funding has been difficult. Naylor explained at a Red Dwarf Dimension Jump convention that the film had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> the BBC and the British Film Council. Reasons given for the rejections were that while the script was considered to be funny, it was not ready.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina Bicknell (1757 – 8 September 1843), {{better known}} as Sabrina Sidney, was a British {{foundling}} girl taken in when she was 12 by author Thomas Day, who wanted to mould her into his perfect wife. Day had been struggling to find a wife who would share his ideology and had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> several women. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's book Emile, or On Education, he decided to educate two girls without any frivolities, using his own concepts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} final issue, G.I. Joe Special #1 was {{released}} in February 1995, containing alternate art for issue #61 by Todd McFarlane. McFarlane was the original penciller for issue #61, but his artwork had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> Larry Hama as unacceptable, and so Marshall Rogers {{was brought in to}} pencil the final published version. In the years following, McFarlane became a superstar comic artist, and Marvel eventually decided to print the unpublished work.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these plans have <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> the company.

As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about ten more years of service before it needs to be replaced. No plans {{have been made}} for new trams to be ordered.|$|E

50|$|On February 2, 1819, the State Legislature {{attempted}} {{to elect a}} U.S. Senator. No candidate received {{a majority in the}} Senate. Samuel Young had 13 votes out of 28 cast.

A resolution in favor of Young <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> 14 to 13; one for Rufus King by 22 to 5; and the Senate adjourned. No candidate received a majority in the Assembly either. John C. Spencer had 51 votes out of 122 cast. Ezekiel Bacon offered a resolution to declare Spencer nominated, which <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> 72 to 54. Erastus Root offered a resolution to declare Young nominated, which <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> 82 to 44. Thomas J. Oakley offered a resolution to declare King nominated which <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> 90 to 34. Erastus Root then offered a resolution in favor of Philetus Swift, and Oakley moved to amend the resolution by striking out Swift's name, which was carried. Oakley then offered to insert the name of John Wells, of New York City, which <b>was</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> 96 to 29, and the Assembly adjourned too. The State Legislature took no more action in this matter, and the Class 3 seat in the U.S. Senate became vacant on March 4, 1819.|$|R

5|$|The 1880s {{also saw}} the {{beginnings}} of the Asian oil trade. The idea that led to moving Russian oil to the Far East via the Suez Canal was the brainchild of two men: importer Marcus Samuel and shipowner/broker Fred Lane. Prior bids to move oil through the canal had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> the Suez Canal Company as being too risky. Samuel approached the problem a different way: asking the company for the specifications of a tanker it would allow through the canal.|$|E
5|$|The Nibiru cataclysm is a {{supposed}} disastrous encounter between the Earth {{and a large}} planetary object (either a collision or a near-miss) which certain groups believe {{will take place in}} the early 21st century. Believers in this doomsday event usually refer to this object as Planet X or Nibiru. The idea that a planet-sized object will collide with or closely pass by Earth in the near future is not supported by any scientific evidence and has <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> astronomers and planetary scientists as pseudoscience and an Internet hoax.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the band trace to 1970, when bassist Gene Klein and keyboardist Brooke Ostrander {{recruited}} lead guitarist Stephen Coronel, a childhood friend and former bandmate of Klein. The group took the name Rainbow shortly thereafter. Coronel recommended rhythm guitarist Stanley Eisen, who had actually <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> the group after a previous audition. Shortly after Eisen joined, Ostrander recruited drummer Joe Davidson, and the first Rainbow lineup was completed. Davidson's stay {{did not last long}} and he was replaced by drummer Tony Zarrella.|$|E
5|$|This puffball was {{originally}} described in 1790 by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Lycoperdon utriforme, and since then, has been variously {{placed in the}} genera Bovista, Lycoperdon, Calvatia, and Utraria. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus Handkea to include species of Calvatia that had distinct microscopic features: Handkea species have a unique type of capillitium (coarse thick-walled hyphae in the gleba), with curvy slits {{instead of the usual}} pores. Although accepted by some authors, the genus concept has <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> others.|$|E
5|$|Blyton's granddaughter, Sophie Smallwood, wrote a new Noddy book to {{celebrate}} the character's 60th birthday, 46 years after the last book was published; Noddy and the Farmyard Muddle (2009) was illustrated by Robert Tyndall. In February 2011, the manuscript of a previously unknown Blyton novel, Mr Tumpy's Caravan, was discovered by the archivist at Seven Stories, National Centre for Children's Books {{in a collection of}} papers belonging to Blyton's daughter Gillian, purchased by Seven Stories in 2010 following her death. It was initially thought to belong to a comic strip collection of the same name published in 1949, but it appears to be unrelated and is believed to be something written in the 1930s, which had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> a publisher.|$|E

5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1966, Hendrix was {{struggling}} {{to earn a living}} playing the R circuit as a backing guitarist. After being referred to Chas Chandler, who was leaving the Animals and interested in managing and producing artists, Hendrix was signed to a management and production contract with Chandler and ex-Animals manager Michael Jeffery. Chandler brought Hendrix to London and began recruiting members for a band designed to showcase the guitarist's talents, the Jimi Hendrix Experience. In late October, after having <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> Decca Records, the Experience signed with Track, a new label formed by the Who's managers Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp.|$|E

In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhousesnow {{primarily}} gay-owned and operatedbecame fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for Pride Day and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, when some gay men, {{particularly those who}} had <b>been</b> <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> their families due to their sexual orientation, had nowhere else to go.

The film was originally intended as the series finale, but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.|$|E
