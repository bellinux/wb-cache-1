5|$|In the 2000s Unicamp {{consolidated}} {{itself as}} one of the leading research and education centers in Latin America but also brought new challenges: just as with other public universities in Brazil, the high payroll costs (over 90% of the total budget) constrain investment and expansion. This is further aggravated by the economic depression that <b>Brazil</b> <b>is</b> facing since 2014, the largest in the country's history.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. <b>Brazil</b> <b>is</b> the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in <b>Brazil,</b> <b>is</b> the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E

5|$|Cosmetics {{testing on}} animals is banned in India, the European Union, Israel and Norway while {{legislation}} in the U.S. and <b>Brazil</b> <b>is</b> currently considering similar bans.

France, which is home to the world's largest cosmetics company, L'Oreal, has protested the proposed ban by lodging a case at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, asking that the ban be quashed. The ban is also opposed by the European Federation for Cosmetics Ingredients, which represents 70 companies in Switzerland, Belgium, France, Germany, and Italy. In October 2014, India passed stricter laws that also ban the importation of any cosmetic products that are tested on animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} of all dance {{in a large}} country such as <b>Brazil</b> <b>is</b> rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions—Indian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeiraa dance-like fighting styleand the maculelê fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and {{the spirits of the}} ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance “game” was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century.|$|E
