50|$|During pre-war {{diplomatic}} maneuvers, the NSDAP Foreign Affairs Office took {{special interest}} in Afghanistan, believing that the German Empire had failed to exploit the country diplomatically during the First World War despite the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition. The objective was {{to ensure that the}} country would remain neutral during a possible German-British conflict, and even use it militarily against British India or Soviet Russia. Despite the NSDAP Foreign Office's good relations with the Afghan government, the Foreign Ministry under Ribbentrop favored overthrowing the current government and restoration of the rule of Amānullāh Khān, who had been living in exile since 1929. Hitler eventually came to support Rosenberg's office on this issue. After the German-French armistice of 1940, the Kabul government tried to question Berlin on German plans concerning the future of Afghanistan. Of special interest were the post-war borders of the country - the Afghan government hoped to see the liberation of 15 million ethnic Afghans living in British India, and the securing of the northern Afghan border so that an expansion towards the Indian Ocean became possible (See Pashtunistan). As the Nazi-Soviet Axis talks of October-November were then underway (and the possible expansion of the Soviet sphere of influence in south-central Asia and India was on the table), Berlin was reluctant to give any <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> to Kabul.|$|E
50|$|Five {{airlines}} {{were initially}} {{reported to be}} actually interested in the AUA (Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Turkish Airlines, Air China and S7 Airlines, a former Aeroflot subsidiary); other airlines likely also requested material necessary for bidding in attempts to obtain information about a competing company. So far, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines and S7 Airlines have confirmed the reports about their interests. British Airways was announced on 29 August 2008 {{to be among the}} twelve potential buyers, as well. The first concepts had to be submitted by 12 September 2008 and <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> by 21 October 2008, with the actual decision to be made on 27 October 2008. Turkish Airlines missed one of the first deadlines and thus dropped out, while Air China could not cope with the strict timetable; four airlines submitted preliminary by 12 September 2008 (Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, British Airways and S7 Airlines), of which three were then put on the shortlist. Reportedly, S7 Airlines offered the highest bid, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM offered less and British Airways declined to submit a binding offer. Reportedly, only Lufthansa submitted a binding offer by 21 October 2008, with Air France-KLM supposedly more interested in Alitalia and S7 Airlines pursuing cooperation with Air Berlin and FlyNiki; it was considered likely that the privatisation would postponed due to the weak participation and low offers, or that the Austrian state would have to renationalise Austrian Airlines. On 27 October 2008, the privatisation mandate was extended until 31 December 2008. Contrary to earlier reports, S7 Airlines was also still bidding, but Lufthansa was seen as the clear favorite nonetheless. On 13 November 2008, Lufthansa was declared to be the only bidder still in the race by the ÖIAG board of directors.|$|E
40|$|Conflict and {{competition}} often impose costs on both winners and losers, and conflicting parties may prefer {{to resolve the}} dispute before it occurs. The equilibrium of a conflict game with side-payments predicts that with <b>binding</b> <b>offers,</b> proposers make and responders accept side-payments, generating settlements that strongly favor proposers. When side-payments are non-binding, proposers offer nothing and conflicts always arise. Laboratory experiments confirm that binding side-payments reduce conflicts. However, 30 % of responders reject <b>binding</b> <b>offers,</b> and offers are more egalitarian than predicted. Surprisingly, non-binding side-payments also improve efficiency, although less than binding. With binding side-payments, 87 % of efficiency gains come from avoided conflicts. However, with non-binding side-payments, only 39 % of gains come from avoided conflicts and 61 % from reduced conflict expenditures. ...|$|E

50|$|Whilst {{this case}} did uphold the legal concept of {{invitation}} to treat {{way back in}} 1953, some jurisdictions have since enacted legislation in either consumer protection or fair trading that would either make such a situation a legally <b>binding</b> <b>offer</b> by the retailer, or an offence for the retailer to refuse {{to carry out the}} transaction (bait advertising or misleading/deceptive conduct).|$|R
40|$|Seven {{cases of}} {{colorectal}} adenocarcinomas were investigated {{for the presence}} of oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors. The tumours specifically bound oestradiol. This binding almost exclusively resulted from the presence of high numbers of type II oestrogen binding sites. Oestrogen receptors were absent or present at very low concentrations. Immunohistochemical investigation of nuclear oestrogen receptors gave negative results. This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites. The presence of specific type II oestrogen binding sites and progesterone <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> further evidence for a potential role for these steroids and their receptors in colorectal carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|We {{conduct an}} {{experimental}} analysis of final offer arbitration (FOA) with differentially informed players. Under FOA, the arbitrator must {{choose one of}} the two submitted offers. In our control, the uninformed player makes an offer to the informed player prior to the submission of offers to the arbitrator. The treatment allows negotiation after offers are submitted to the arbitrator. Because these offers are potentially binding, they may transmit privately held information and, thereby, lower the dispute rate. We find that allowing negotiation in the face of potentially <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> lowers the dispute rate by 27 percentage points. Copyright 2001 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{an extension of}} strategic normal form games with a phase of negotiations before the actual play of the game, where players can make <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> for transfer of utilities to other players after the play of the game, {{in order to provide}} additional incentives for each other to play designated strategies. Such offers are conditional on the recipients playing the specified strategies and they effect transformations of the payoff matrix of the game by accordingly transferring payoffs between players. We introduce and analyze solution concepts for 2 -player normal form games with such preplay offers under various assumptions for the preplay negotiation phase and obtain results for existence of efficient negotiation strategies of the players. Then we extend the framework to coalitional preplay offers in N-player games, as well as to extensive form games with inter-play offers for side payments. Comment: 40 pages, under submissio...|$|E
40|$|We {{identify}} two {{features of}} final offer arbitration (FOA) which may impede settlement in a bargaining game where asymmetric information drives {{the failure to}} settle. First, under FOA the informed party has an incentive not to voluntarily reveal private information. Revealing this information allows the previously uninformed party to submit a superior offer to the arbitrator {{to the detriment of}} the informed party. Second, in a two-type model, the uninformed player may choose to arbitrate all cases, a result which never occurs in a simple litigation game. Such a strategy allows this player to commit to an offer in arbitration that is optimal against the entire distribution of types with whom he must bargain. Each player's offer directly affects the outcome of arbitration under FOA, and it is this feature that generates impediments to settlement that are not observed in a simple litigation game. Both impediments to settlement are removed if bargaining is allowed to take place after potentially <b>binding</b> <b>offers</b> have been submitted to the arbitrator...|$|E

Such offers transform the payoff matrix of the original game and allow for some degree of cooperation between rational players while preserving the non-cooperative nature of the game. We focus on 2 -player negotiations games arising in the preplay phase when offers for payments are made conditional on a suggested matching offer {{of the same kind}} being made in return by the receiver. We study and analyze such bargaining games, obtain results describing their possible solutions and discuss the degrees of efficiency and fairness that can be achieved in such negotiation process depending on whether time is valuable or not...|$|E
