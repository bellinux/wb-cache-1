5|$|Mulgrew Miller {{was born}} in Greenwood, Mississippi, to parents who had been raised on plantations. He had three {{brothers}} and four sisters. His family was not musical, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> piano, which no-one in the house could play. Miller, however, played tunes on the piano {{from the age of}} six, playing by ear. He had piano lessons from the age of eight. As a child, he played blues and rhythm and blues for dances, and gospel music in a church. His family was Methodist, but he played in churches of various denominations. His principal influence on piano at this stage was Ramsey Lewis.|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks. The force of 122 men targeting Zacapa were intercepted and decisively beaten {{by a small}} garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers, with only 30 rebels escaping death or capture. The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it actually was.|$|E

The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|E

5|$|In India, Lee {{worked as}} a {{football}} and cricket coach for the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, but was treated more like a guest than a paid retainer. He played a few first-class matches during his time in India, and in his first match in the country, for the Maharaja's XI against Lord Willingdon's XI, Lee claimed his maiden five-wicket haul, taking five wickets and conceding eleven runs. He added another three wickets in the second innings to record the best bowling analysis of the match. In November 1918, Lee played for England against India. The Indian team did not have Test status, which was not attained until 1932, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strong team, and dominated the match against an England side which was far from representative. Lee claimed four wickets in the match for the concession of 177 runs, and made scores of eight and nine with the bat. Lee's highest score, and only century in first-class cricket in India was made in a match he was playing against the Maharaja of Cooch Behar's team. Appearing instead for MC Bird's XI, Lee opened the batting and scored 104 runs. He also claimed seven wickets in the match, which his side won by an innings.|$|E

25|$|Profiting {{from the}} {{building}} boom of Greater Romania, and the rising popularity of functionalism, Janco's Birou was in much demand. Compared with mainstream functionalist architects like Horia Creangă, Arghir Culina, Rudolf Fränkel or Marcel Locar, the Jancos received commissions that were sparse and small-scale, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> decisive role in popularizing the functionalist versions of Constructivism or Cubism. Heralding the change of architectural tastes with his articles in Contimporanul, Marcel Janco described Romania's capital as a chaotic, inharmonious, backward town, in which the traffic was hampered by carts and trams.|$|E

25|$|Gender {{roles were}} sharply defined. Men were {{primarily}} responsible for breaking the land; planting and harvesting; building the house; buying, operating and repairing machinery; and handling finances. At first there were many single men on the prairie, or husbands whose wives were still back east, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hard time. They realized {{the need for a}} wife. In 1901, there were 19,200 families, but this surged to 150,300 families only 15 years later. Wives {{played a central role in}} settlement of the prairie region. Their labor, skills, and ability to adapt to the harsh environment proved decisive in meeting the challenges. They prepared bannock, beans and bacon, mended clothes, raised children, cleaned, tended the garden, helped at harvest time and nursed everyone back to health. While prevailing patriarchal attitudes, legislation, and economic principles obscured women's contributions, the flexibility exhibited by farm women in performing productive and nonproductive labor was critical to the survival of family farms, and thus to the success of the wheat economy.|$|E

25|$|In 2013, Purser {{helped the}} Hawks return to {{championship}} contenders. The Hawks did well {{to finish the}} regular season with an 18–8 record to be second position in the standings <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> tough time of it against the Mandurah Magic in the quarter-finals. The Magic won Game 1 in Mandurah 107–96 but then the Hawks responded to win Game 2 106–90 and then the deciding third game 84–74 both at home {{to advance to the}} semi-finals. They went on to lose in straight sets to the Wanneroo Wolves in the semi-finals; the Wolves prevailed 107–91 in Game 1 in Joondalup before winning the series with a 104–98 victory in Game 2, with the Hawks bowing out of the finals at home. Purser was again a dominant force during the 2013 season, recording six double-doubles and scoring three 30+ point games. On July 26, he scored a career-high 34 points in a 104–97 win over the Perth Redbacks. Purser appeared in 29 of the Hawks' 31 games, averaging 17.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.0 steals per game.|$|E

500|$|The Warrior-class ships {{have been}} {{described}} as revolutionary, but in truth they were more evolutionary than not as everything except their wrought iron armour had been in use by ocean-going ships for years.

[...] They were designed in response to Gloire, which started an invasion scare in Britain, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line. They were designed by Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate [...] Warrior and her sister Black Prince were not intended to stand in the line of battle as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three-deck ships of the line. Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage.|$|E
