40|$|The {{final results}} are {{reported}} {{for a study}} to identify and correct the causes of nongage-section failures (notably button-head failures) in ceramic tensile specimens observed in several laboratories. Numerical modeling of several candidate specimen gripping systems has shown inherent stress concentrations near the specimen <b>button</b> <b>head</b> at which the maximum stress may approach 75 to 100 % of the gage-section stress for certain grip conditions. Empirical comparisons of both tapered- and straight-collet gripping systems revealed compromises in both systems. The straight-collet system, with deformable collets, is simpler to use but produces statistically significant greater average percent bending for all tests than those produced for the tapered-collet system, which is slightly more difficult to use. Empirical tensile tests of {approx} 50 aluminium oxide and {approx} 50 silicon nitride specimens were conducted to evaluate the loading capability of both gripping systems, the percent bending in each system, and the potential of consistently producing successful test results. These tests revealed that, due to variations in individual specimens or the individual specimen/grip interfaces, neither of the gripping systems can consistently produce bending of less than 3 to 4 % at failure although occasional values of {approx} 0. 5 % bending were attained. Refinements of grinding procedures and dimensional measurement techniques have shown critical details in both the practices and consistency of machining necessary for achieving the dimensional tolerances while minimizing subsurface damage. Numerical integration techniques indicate that up to a consistent 5. 0 % bending during fast-fracture tests can be tolerated before large influences are detected in {{the determination of the}} Weibull modulus and the Weibull characteristic strength...|$|E

These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|R
25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as <b>button</b> presses. <b>Head</b> movements cause the voxel-to-neurons mapping to change while scanning is in progress. Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues {{to refer to the}} same absolute location in space while the neurons underneath it would have changed. Another source of physiological noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds of physiological noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to total noise.|$|R
25|$|Hamilton {{closed the}} gap to Rosberg to be 1.9 seconds behind his {{teammate}} {{by the start of}} lap 50. Rosberg made his third (and final) pit stop from the lead on the same lap. Hamilton pushed hard following Rosberg's pit stop and made his own stop on the next lap and emerged narrowly behind his teammate (after being delayed by slower traffic) in second. Massa and Button made pit stops on the same lap and both drivers left the pit lane in fifth and sixth places. Button had closed up to Massa after the latter drove into the incorrect pit box. Hülkenberg was promoted into third but lost the position to Massa heading into the Senna chicane on the 54th lap. Hamilton attacked but Rosberg responded by going faster than his teammate in the middle sector but Hamilton was able to remain close with DRS assistance on the main straights. The two drivers pulled away from Massa and Button. Rosberg and Hamilton came across slower traffic but it did not affect them greatly enough to cause hindrance. On lap 61, Räikkönen—who was on 25-lap worn tyres—was pressured by <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> into the Senna chicane but Räikkönen resisted the manoeuvre. Button held the racing line and went alongside Räikkönen on the back straight before eventually passing him around the outside at the Descida do Lago turn. Räikkönen lost momentum at the corner and was passed by Vettel. Alonso began to battle teammate Räikkönen who placed his car in a defensive position over the following few laps.|$|R

50|$|On lap 39 di Resta forced Pérez wide at turn 13; as Pérez {{rejoined the}} circuit, he cut {{back across the}} front of Grosjean and the two made contact at the next corner, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Webber who was {{attempting}} to drive on the inside line. Grosjean and Webber retired because of damage to their cars and the debris on-track from the accident called for the second safety car period of the race. The safety remained out for three laps, during which marshals cleared the track of debris. Pérez was given a ten-second stop-go penalty by the stewards on the 42nd lap for which he served three laps later. Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso once the safety car came in on the end of lap 42. Alonso was also being harried by Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Vettel was in the tow of <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> towards turn eight and got a run on the McLaren driver driving into turn eleven but was unable to pass. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Vettel tried again on lap 48 and took the outside line to attempt a pass heading into turn eleven, but Button defended his position. Four laps later Vettel lined up another passing manoeuvre on Button (who went wide heading into turn ten) by employing his DRS in the run up to turn eleven and passed the McLaren driver around the outside to take over third place.|$|R
5000|$|Trulli {{improved}} his car {{on all of}} his timed laps and drafted off teammate Button on his fastest lap to secure eleventh place but lost time after running very closely behind <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> into the Curva Parabolica corner. Fisichella had a strategy to run two timed laps but his final run disrupted because of the Räikkönen and Sato incident which restricted Fisichella to twelfth. He later said he hoped of a possibility to qualify tenth and was struggling for grip. He was ahead of McNish in the slower Toyota who was satisfied despite being delayed by traffic on his second run. McNish {{was in front of}} the two Saubers (with Massa ahead of Heidfeld); Massa used scrubbed tyres which provided him with more front-end grip on his first timed run but had a large amount of understeer after new tyres were installed on his car. More downforce was added to Massa's car for his final run. Heidfeld ran wide at Curva di Lesmo's exit on his final timed lap which prevented him from recording a faster lap time. [...] Panis was sixteenth in the second BAR with Button sharing the eighth row in seventeenth. Despite the incident with Räikkonen Sato took eighteenth and said [...] "That was the most difficult qualifying session of my career". Sato had also made driving mistakes meaning he could not set a representative lap time. The two Minardi cars lined up on the final row of the grid with Webber ahead of the returning Yoong; both Webber and Yoong were affected by the red-flag period and Yoong lost his final two timed laps as a consequence.|$|R

Little was said, save a murmured doubt by Antoine as to the possibility of gaining the summit, even although they were now so near it, for the day was far spent by that time, and the rugged nature of the route over they had passed, precluded the possibility of a rapid return to the hut at the Grands Mulets.

It was just as she was that she liked her; she was so strange, so different from the girls one usually met, seemed to belong to some queer gipsy-land or transcendental Bohemia.

Moreover, the girl had moved her as she had never been moved, and the power to do that, from whatever source it came, was a force that one must admire. Her emotion was still acute, however much she might speak to her visitor as if everything that had happened seemed to her natural; and what kept it, above all, from subsiding was her sense that she found here what she had been looking for so long--a friend of her own sex with whom she might have a union of soul. It took a double consent to make a friendship, but it was not possible that this intensely sympathetic girl would refuse. Olive had the penetration to discover in a moment that she was a creature of unlimited generosity.
