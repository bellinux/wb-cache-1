25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do from what they in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E

[...] To combat this issue, Minear decided to make the remote viewer blind. He sought to make the blind woman [...] "not Audrey Hepburn", a reference to the 1967 film Wait Until Dark, in which Hepburn played the part of an innocent but terrorized blind woman. He later said, [...] "I wanted to make [...] a bitch, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> is that disability doesn't necessarily ennoble a person." [...] After several meetings with fellow writers John Shiban, Vince Gilligan, and Frank Spotnitz—who provided storyboard support—Minear was allowed to begin work on the episode.|$|E
500|$|After the war, {{many former}} Nazis fled to South America, {{especially}} to Argentina, {{where they were}} welcomed by Juan Perón's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, [...] "I will jump into my grave laughing, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I have the death of five million Jews [...] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction." [...] Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970. He died in 1971.|$|E
500|$|On 28October 1983, it was {{announced}} that the Hastings line was to be electrified. Reasons that decided the issue included a commitment by British Rail to eliminate asbestos from all stock in service by 1988 and the increasing cost of maintaining the then ageing Hastings Diesels. The scheme was to cost £23,925,000. Electrification was finally completed in 1986, the line was electrified using 750V DC third rail using standard rolling stock, and the expedient of singling the track through the narrow tunnels. The tunnels either side of Tunbridge Wells Central station were not singled <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the south portal of Wells Tunnel and north portal of Grove Hill Tunnel were at the ends of the platforms meant it was impossible to install pointwork without reducing the length of platform available. A speed restriction [...] was imposed through Wells Tunnel. Parliamentary powers were sought in 1979 to bore a second Grove Hill Tunnel, but there was much opposition from local residents. This, and the high cost, caused the proposal to be abandoned. The track in Grove Hill Tunnel was relaid on a concrete base, allowing alignment to be precisely controlled.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} criticized for its {{graphics}} and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine [...] "old" [...] and [...] "clunky", and PC Format said that [...] "the whole thing {{is limited by the}} creaking engine." [...] However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it [...] "the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented," [...] and GameSpot said that [...] "'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> is, Icewind Dale II plays great." [...] In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that [...] "in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [...] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated." [...] IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that [...] "the animations are crude by today's standards." [...] New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the [...] "dated Infinity engine" [...] could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that [...] "it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game," [...] and Computer Games Magazine said, [...] "it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts." [...] The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that [...] "the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form," [...] and Game Informer called them [...] "beautiful". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called [...] "outrageously bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{claims that}} the IDF or the Mossad may have sabotaged three of the ships before the raid.

[...] A senior IDF officer hinted to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee {{that some of the}} vessels had been tampered with to halt them far from the Gaza or Israeli coast. According to UPI press coverage, the officer alluded to [...] "grey operations" [...] against the flotilla and said that no such action had been taken against the Mavi Marmara out of fear that the vessel might be stranded {{in the middle of the}} sea, endangering the people on board.

In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned.
