5|$|In the United States and Canada, Tower Heist {{opened in}} 3,367 theaters. The film took $85,000 from midnight {{screenings}} {{and a total}} of $8.5million opening Friday, becoming the number one grossing film for the day. Although the film had been expected to be the number one film for the weekend, it took $10.5million on the opening Saturday, falling behind the animated film Puss in Boots ($15.3million). Tower Heist became the number two film for the weekend with $24million, behind Puss in Boots ($34million), with 70% of the audience <b>being</b> <b>over</b> the age of 25—the largest segment, 27%, <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 50—and 56% male. The opening audience was ethnically diverse consisting of 48% Caucasian, 21% African American, and 21% Hispanic.|$|E
5|$|The {{king was}} already {{advanced}} in {{age at the}} time of his death, <b>being</b> <b>over</b> fifty years old, to judge by the incisor teeth, which are worn and corroded by the impurities of which the Egyptian bread was full. The body, though small and emaciated, shows evidence of unusual muscular strength; the head is bald, the features are refined, and the mouth still bears an expression characteristic of shrewdness and cunning.|$|E
5|$|The route over Y Lliwedd is more {{frequently}} used for descent than ascent, and forms {{the second half}} of the Snowdon Horseshoe walk, the ascent <b>being</b> <b>over</b> Crib Goch. It is reached by following the Watkin Path down to Bwlch y Saethau, and then continuing along the ridge to the twin summits of Y Lliwedd. The path then drops down to Cwm Dyli to join the Miners' Track towards Pen-y-Pass.|$|E

50|$|Humanistic deists {{accept the}} core {{principles}} of deism but incorporate humanistic beliefs into their faith. Thus, humanistic deists {{believe in a}} personal God who created the universe. The key element that separates humanistic deists from other deists is {{the emphasis on the}} importance of human development over religious development and on the relationships among human <b>beings</b> <b>over</b> the relationships between humans and God. Those who self-identify as humanistic deists may take an approach based upon what is found in classical deism and allow their worship of God to manifest itself primarily (or exclusively) {{in the manner in which}} they treat others. Other humanistic deists may prioritize their relationships with other human <b>beings</b> <b>over</b> their relationship with God, yet still maintain a personal relationship with the Supreme Being.|$|R
5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite <b>being</b> <b>over</b> land, the NHC continued to predict a turn to the north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less verbose. The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war <b>being</b> <b>over</b> by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|The Congressional Research Service (CRS) {{estimated}} that shutting down VH-71 production, upgrading the existing fleet, and later implementing a successor program would cost $14–$21billion. It was reported {{not only that}} a new fleet would not be available until 2024 (at which point the existing helicopters would have remained in service while <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 50 years old), but that terminating the existing program would waste more than $3billion in sunk VH-71 costs. Following the President’s decision to terminate the program a variety of lawmakers, think tanks and media outlets publicly concluded {{it would be more}} cost effective and less time consuming to continue with a variation of the existing VH-71 program.|$|E

It was the ultimate development of the B-29 family, <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 50% heavier than its ancestor and had nearly double the range. Only two prototypes were built before the program was canceled {{in favor of the}} Tupolev Tu-95 bomber which was much faster and had the same range.|$|E
5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual {{irregular}} {{satellites and}} are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's <b>being</b> <b>over</b> an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the most}} eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Gladys intensified into a hurricane near the Isle of Youth on October 16. Shortly thereafter it crossed the narrow but mountainous region of western Cuba. By {{the time the}} hurricane reached the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, a deep trough was moving eastward through the United States toward a weak anticyclone off the east coast. Gladys turned more to the north, passing {{just west of the}} Dry Tortugas, before resuming its north-northwest trajectory, possibly due to a mid-level low near Alabama. Around that time, the eye was reorganizing offshore southwestern Florida, and the hurricane failed to intensify significantly due to the eastern portion of the circulation <b>being</b> <b>over</b> the state. Early on October 19, Gladys made landfall near Homosassa after turning to the northeast, with peak winds estimated at 85 mph (130 km/h). It accelerated across the state due to the approaching trough, emerging into the Atlantic near St. Augustine. Paralleling the southeastern coast of the United States, Gladys passed just east of Cape Hatteras on October 20, although by that time the strongest winds remained along the eastern periphery. The approaching trough caused Gladys to gradually lose tropical characteristics, and on October 21 Gladys became extratropical just south of Nova Scotia. A few hours later, the former hurricane was absorbed by the cold front.|$|E

5|$|After the cyclone {{bypassed}} Socotra, its convective core became better defined due {{to improved}} outflow. On 2November, Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00UTC that day, the IMD downgraded {{the system to}} a very severe cyclonic storm, after Chapala had been an extremely severe cyclonic storm for 78hours. The structure became disorganized that day due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, causing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west-northwest toward Yemen, rounding the southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:0002:00UTC on 3November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120km/h (75mph). This marked the first hurricane-intensity landfall for Yemen on record, and the first severe cyclonic storm to hit the country since May 1960. According to the JTWC, Chapala moved ashore and immediately turned back over water, although the agency soon reassessed the center as <b>being</b> <b>over</b> land. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00UTC on 4November, and weakening into a remnant low pressure area three hours later.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle's {{effectiveness}} {{was highly}} uncertain {{at the time}} of the First World War, but it was nonetheless adopted both in the UK and North America. In 1918, the Admiralty analysed shipping losses, but was unable to draw clear conclusions. Dazzle ships were attacked in 1.47% of sailings, compared to 1.12% for uncamouflaged ships, suggesting increased visibility, but as Wilkinson had argued, dazzle was not attempting to make ships hard to see. Suggestively, of the ships that were struck by torpedoes, 43% of the dazzle ships sank, compared to 54% of the uncamouflaged; and similarly, 41% of the dazzle ships were struck amidships, compared to 52% of the uncamouflaged. These comparisons could be taken to imply that submarine commanders did have more difficulty in deciding where a ship was heading and where to aim. However, the ships painted in dazzle were larger than the uncamouflaged ships, 38% of them <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 5000 tons compared to only 13% of uncamouflaged ships, making comparisons unreliable.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 60 {{years old}} and having {{been out of the}} Army for 25 years, the crisis of the Union {{compelled}} Greene to seek to rejoin the service. He was essentially apolitical and was not an abolitionist, but he was a firm believer in restoring the Union. He was appointed colonel of the 60th New York Volunteer Infantry on January 18, 1862. The regiment of upstate New Yorkers had been dissatisfied with their colonel and the company commanders had petitioned for his removal. Governor Edwin D. Morgan, although initially reluctant to appoint Greene because of his age, saw his 13 years of regular army experience as a solution to his political/military problem. During this period, Governor John A. Andrew of Massachusetts was also prepared to offer Greene a regiment, but Greene chose to serve New York. The officers of the 60th were dismayed when the elderly, gray-haired man reported for duty. They had requested that their lieutenant colonel be promoted, which would have raised many of them in rank themselves.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Birthday {{was created}} as a {{conceptual}} rebirth for Aya's character, {{as well as a}} means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it <b>being</b> <b>over</b> a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and Aya's original designer Tetsuya Nomura. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with camera control and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers have also made negative comments on Aya's portrayal.|$|E
5|$|The average {{urbanisation}} rate in Croatia stands at 56%, {{with a growing}} urban population and shrinking rural population. The largest city and the nation's capital is Zagreb, with an urban population of 686,568 in the city itself. Zagreb's metropolitan area encompasses 341 additional settlements and, by the year 2001, {{the population of the}} area had reached 978,161; approximately 60% of Zagreb County's residents live in Zagreb's metropolitan area, as does about 41% of Croatia's urban population. The cities of Split and Rijeka are the largest settlements on the Croatian Adriatic coast, with each city's population <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 100,000. There are four other Croatian cities exceeding 50,000people: Osijek, Zadar, Pula and Slavonski Brod; the Zagreb district of Sesvete, which has the status of a standalone settlement but not a city, also has such a large population. A further eleven cities are populated by more than 20,000.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest {{due to a}} strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of}} the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55km/h (35mph 1-minute winds). After <b>being</b> <b>over</b> land for most of July31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300km (185mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24km/h (15mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By the nighttime hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds). By the morning of August2, the JTWC upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, and a few hours later, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon.|$|E

5|$|Vamei {{developed}} in a vortex that appears every winter along the northwest coast of Borneo and is maintained by the interaction between monsoonal winds and the local topography. Often, the vortex remains near the coastline, and {{in an analysis of}} 51winters, only six reported the vortex as <b>being</b> <b>over</b> the equatorial waters for four days or more. As the area in the South China Sea between Borneo and Singapore is only 665km (415mi) wide, a vortex needs to move slowly to develop. A persistent northerly wind surge for more than five days, which is needed to enhance the vortex, is present, on average, nine days each winter. The probability for a pre-existing tropical disturbance to develop into a tropical cyclone is between 10–30percent. Thus, the conditions which resulted in the formation of Vamei are believed to occur once every 100–400years.|$|E
5|$|While all the cathedrals are impressive, some, {{because of}} their location, are highly {{significant}} landmarks and landscape elements. Among these is Chichester, which can be seen for many miles across a landscape of open fields {{and is the only}} one of England’s cathedrals that is visible from the sea. The grey spire of Norwich rises serenely from its surrounding city, to be a focus of the Norwich School of landscape painters. Ely, on a small hill, dominates the rural countryside and its appearance in times of flood causes it to be known as The Ship of the Fens. The three spires of Lichfield are known as The Ladies of the Vale. The “exquisite tower” of Worcester is seen best across the River Severn. Lincoln with its vast façade and three towers, the tallest <b>being</b> <b>over</b> 80 metres (270ft), rises majestically from a steep hill above the town. Salisbury Cathedral with its “faultless spire” constitutes one of the iconic views of England, made famous by the landscape painter John Constable. In the north of England, Durham makes a “spectacular” view as it sits dramatically on its steep rocky peninsula above the River Wear, “half Church of God, half castle ‘gainst the Scots”.|$|E
