However they dropped off in mid-season and won just six of their final 18 games to end the season in fourth place, 12 points behind champions Liverpool.

5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the <b>blame</b> <b>and</b> the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn’t flinch {{with the second}} swing; but again the Green Knight withholds {{the full force of}} his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the 'elderly lady' Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress Morgan le Fay, Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death. Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The Knights of the Round Table absolve him of <b>blame</b> <b>and</b> decide that henceforth that they will wear a green sash in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of social {{representation}} theory and the AIDS risk reduction model, it has been claimed that stigmatizing, <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> stereotyping attitudes make people feel less at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, and that this, in turn, results in them taking fewer precautions in their sexual behaviour. Previous research has failed to provide convincing evidence to support these claims. The present study provided {{a test of the}} claims that addressed some of the methodological issues identified in the earlier research. A sample of 460 young people from Ghana, ranging in age from 15 to 28 years (mean =  18), completed a questionnaire that measured the relevant constructs. The results supported the claims in relation to stigmatizing and intended sexual risk behaviour, but not stigmatizing and actual sexual risk behaviour. Although the latter two were correlated, this was not mediated by reduced perceptions of vulnerability. Claims in relation to <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> stereotyping were not supported. Contrary to expectation, specific <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> stereotyping attitudes that constructed HIV/AIDS as a sexual disease were associated with safer intended sexual behaviour, and this relationship was mediated by feeling at greater risk.

40|$|People {{are confronted}} with {{injustice}} and innocent victims on a regular basis. Reactions toward victims can range from going {{to great lengths to}} help or support the victims in order to alleviate their ill fate to harsh negative reactions often resulting in <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> derogating the victims for what happened to them. In my dissertation, I addressed two questions regarding social justice and reactions toward victims of injustice. Why do people <b>blame</b> innocent victims? <b>And</b> how can we transform derogatory reactions into more benevolent reactions? Previous research has shown that victim <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> derogation paradoxically stem from people’s belief in a just world (BJW). Innocent victims threaten the BJW <b>and</b> victim <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> derogation help restore the belief. Research even showed that negative reactions are enhanced when the victim is similar to the observer, presumably because victim similarity enhances experienced BJW threat. I added to these findings by showing that perpetrator similarity influences victim <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> derogation in a similar manner. Hence, proximity of the injustice in a broader sense seems to influence experienced BJW threat and subsequent reactions to resolve the threat. In subsequent studies, I showed that in today’s future-oriented society people experience more personal uncertainty. To deal with these aversive feelings, people hold on to the BJW more strongly <b>and</b> victim <b>blaming</b> <b>and</b> derogation are enhanced. Together, these lines of research help gain progressive insights into the psychological underpinnings of the paradoxical negative reactions toward innocent victims of injustice. The second part of the dissertation was devoted to incorporating the more benign reactions toward innocent victims of injustice that do occur in real life, but that have received only minor attention in social justice research. I investigated the processes that influence whether people are more prone to make sense of this injustice by either negative or positive reactions. My results indicate that people become spontaneously avoidance motivated and self-focused, when confronted with innocent victims of injustice. These factors make derogatory reactions toward victims a likely strategy {{to make sense of the}} injustice. However, these reactions can be counteracted and may even be transformed in more benign ways of dealing with injustice, such as support and help for the victims involved, by instilling an other-focus or an approach motivation. With the research presented in this dissertation, I showed that making sense of injustice can be accomplished both by benign and derogatory reactions to innocent victims...|$|R
