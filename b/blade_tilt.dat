The blocks are clamped in a carriage which slides {{back and forth across}} the <b>blade,</b> <b>tilting</b> and moving the block closer to the blade with each pass to automatically form a tapered cut of the correct thickness. The edges of the shingle are then cut with another circular saw called a [...] "trim saw", to remove irregular edges. The result is a tapered shingle sawn on all six sides. The thickness of the butt, or thicker end of the tapered cut, is usually 3/8 inch thick, but is also commonly made to be 5/8 inch, and can be made to any custom specifications.|$|R

A common {{rule of thumb is}} a [...] "shaka" [...] length, or 5 to 7 inches, above the rider's height for surfing and about 10 inches above rider's head for racing. Paddles are held with two hands, using a wide grip instead of keeping the hands close together. The proper way to hold the paddle is with the <b>blade</b> <b>tilted</b> away from the body. This propels the paddler through the water quicker. The push-pull method is the most effective way of paddling when stand up paddle boarding. This method requires inserting the paddle gently into the water ahead of the feet, and then pulling it backwards and lifting it back out of the water.|$|R

2500|$|The American-style cabinet saws {{generally}} {{follow the}} model of the Delta Unisaw, a design that has evolved since 1939. Saws of this general type are made in the USA, Canada, Taiwan, and China. These saws are characterized by a cast iron top on a full-length steel base, square in section, with radiused corners. Two 3/8" [...] deep by 3/4" [...] wide miter slots are located parallel to the blade, one {{to the left of the}} blade and one to the right. The most common type of rip fence mounted to this type of saw is characterized by the standard model made by Biesemeyer (now a subsidiary of Delta). It has a sturdy, steel T-type fence mounted to a steel rail at the front of the saw. It has replaceable laminate faces. American cabinet saws are normally designed to accept a [...] " [...] wide stacked dado blade in addition to a standard saw blade. The most common size of blade is 10" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of [...] ", but 12" [...] or 14" [...] in diameter with a blade arbor diameter of 1" [...] are found in commercial/industrial sites. American saws normally include an anti-kickback device that incorporates a splitter, toothed anti-kickback pawls and a clear plastic blade cover. American style saws have an easily replaceable insert around the blade in the table top. This allows the use of zero-clearance inserts, which greatly reduce tear out on the bottom of the workpiece. It is common for this type of saw to be equipped with a table extension that increases ripping capacity for sheet goods to 50". The saw <b>blade</b> can <b>tilt</b> to either the left side or right side of the saw, depending on {{the model of}} saw. The original Delta Unisaw and early cabinet saws based on it were all right-tilt units while newer Delta Unisaws and many competitive cabinet saws made after 2000 are left-tilt saws. The switch to left-tilt design is due to a lower perceived propensity for the cut piece to become trapped between the rip fence and blade and kick back when the <b>blade</b> <b>tilts</b> away from the rip fence (left tilt saw) versus towards the rip fence (right tilt saw.) While conceptually simple in design, these saws are highly evolved and are capable of efficient, high volume, precision work.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} types of kayaks used in flat water and white water kayaking. The sizes and shapes vary {{drastically}} depending on what type of water to be paddled on and also what the paddler would like to do. The second set of essentials for kayaking is an off-set paddle where the paddle <b>blades</b> are <b>tilted</b> to help reduce wind resistance while the other blade is {{being used in the}} water. These vary in length and also shape depending on the intended use, height of the paddler and often, the paddler's preference. Kayaks should be equipped with one or more buoyancy aid (also called flotation) which creates air space that helps prevent a kayak from sinking when filled with water; life jacket should be worn at all times (also called a personal flotation device or PFD), a helmet is also often required for most kayaking and is mandatory for white water kayaking. Various other pieces of safety gear include: a whistle for signaling for help; throwing ropes to help rescue other kayakers; and, a diving knife and appropriate water shoes should used depending upon the risks the water and terrain pose. Proper clothing such as a dry suit, wet suit or spray top also help protect kayakers from cold water or air temperatures.|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the quality of green sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) cutting for mechanized harvest, using statistical quality control tools. Cutting height and damage to ratoon stalks caused by different blade and disc combinations of the basecutter mechanism were used as indicators of quality. Cutting height showed high variability with a controlled process for some treatments. However, these treatments were incapable of producing satisfactory results. The damage index was lower in treatments that used <b>tilted</b> <b>blades,</b> but above the target for all treatments, which caused significant damage to the ratoons. In general, the process of mechanized harvest as assessed by these indicators was found incapable of achieving targeted results and staying below specification limits, and thus requires corrective actions to improve quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Energy is {{the primary}} and most {{universal}} measure {{of all kinds of}} work by human beings and nature. Everything that happens in the world is an expression of energy in one of its forms. “Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. It can only be converted from one form into another”. So can wind energy be converted from one form to another. Wind energy is readily converted into mechanical energy through the turbine blades and is further converted into electrical energy by connecting the turbine to an electrical generator. In this paper we analyze the aerofoil cross section blade using ANSYS 10. 0 and show the velocity profile for a blade which is positioned parallel to the flow of wind and another <b>blade</b> which is <b>tilted</b> at a certain angle to the flow of the wind.

40|$|With {{commercially viable}} global wind power potential, wind energy {{penetration}} is further expected to rise, as will the related problems. One {{issue is the}} collision of wind turbine blades with the tower during operation. Structured health monitoring is required to improve operational safety, {{minimize the risk of}} sudden failure or total breakdown, ensure reliable power generation, and reduce wind turbine life cycle costs. Large numbers of sensors such as fiber Bragg grating and piezoelectric devices have been attached to the structure, a design that is uneconomical and impractical for use in large wind turbines. This study proposes a single laser displacement sensor (LDS) system in which all of the rotating blades could be cost-effectively evaluated. Contrary to the approach of blade sensor installation, the LDS system is installed in the tower to enable noncontact blade displacement monitoring. The concept of a noncontact sensor and actuator and their energy delivery device installation in the tower will enable various approaches for wind turbine structural health monitoring. Blade bolt loosening causes deflection in the affected <b>blade.</b> Similarly, nacelle <b>tilt</b> or mass loss damage in the blade will result in changes in blade deflection, but the proposed system can identify such problems with ease.

40|$|Previous {{estimates}} of the efficiency of rowing have assumed (in {{the absence of any}} better data) that the water reaction force on the rowing blade, the `blade force 2 ̆ 7, acts in a direction normal to the blade chord-line (oar shaft direction). In 1967 Wellicome suggested {{that there may be a}} component of the blade force parallel to the chord-line, pointing outwards, which would make the oar more efficient in the early part of the stroke [Rowing: A Scientific Approach, A Symposium, (Williams, Scott, eds.), Kaye and Ward Ltd, London, 1967]. The recent steady-flow 1 / 4 -scale model tests of Caplan and Gardner [J. Sports Sciences, v 25 : 643 - 650, 2007] detected a small such parallel force on the asymmetrical Macon and Big Blade shapes. It is possible that this component of force is actually zero within the experimental error, but if the direction of the <b>blade</b> force is <b>tilted</b> away from normal by the amount shown in the model tests, the efficiency of rowing propulsion may be one or two percent greater than previously estimated.

40|$|Abstract. The present work {{exhibits}} a {{further development of}} a mean for furthering conventional drag-driven VAWT technology by contrasting the counter-rotating (parasitic) torque generated from drag-driven vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) blades travelling into the wind {{through the use of}} a variable rotor blade geometry. A former research on water tank experimental tests on a small rotor characterized by three horizontal blades having variable geometry has been presented [1]. Each blade was obtained by connecting a horizontal flat plate to a tilting one swinging over a horizontal axis, so that the tilt angle between the two plates could vary depending on flow field conditions. In this paper several open-field measurements at different free-stream wind velocities have been carried out, in order to characterize the energy performance of the rotor for two different blade profile architectures: first experimental investigations were performed on a fixed-angle blade configuration of 41. 3 degs between the horizontal and the inclined flat plates. Then, attention mainly focused on <b>tilting</b> <b>blades,</b> achieving a quantification of the influence of blade swinging on overall rotor performance. A full campaign of analysis was completed for both blade configurations and overall rotor torque and power were analyzed as a function of incoming wind velocity and rotor angular speed, resulting the variable-blade configuration maximum power coefficients much higher with respect to the corresponding classical drag-type fixed-blade architecture...|$|R
40|$|The study aims at testing an {{innovative}} methodology and workflow {{for the design}} of a BIPV (Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics) system. The technology consists in using standard “off the shelf” photovoltaic modules as static shadings. The solution can reduce the occurrence of excess heat in a prefabricated building presenting a huge glass façade on the southern side. The PV modules are set as an array of blades along the glazed façade and the optimization involves the tilt angle and distance between arrays in a parametric design environment. Once the COMBO (Combination Optimized to Meet Building Objectives), defined as the optimal distance between <b>blades</b> and their <b>tilt</b> angle, is found, the impact on the indoor climate is provided by using a whole-building dynamic simulation software. The case study is the paleontological deposit of “La Polledrara di Cecanibbio” located at NW of Rome (Italy) in a rural area. The building model is calibrated using hourly indoor temperature measured on-site. The methodology features two main innovations which improve speed and versatility. The optimization method does not require to run simulation for each parametric combination because {{it is based on the}} incoming irradiation on the glazed surface, greatly boosting the speed of the optimization. Given the ideal load profile provided by the simulation of building model, the algorithm searches a COMBO to minimize the solar irradiation during cooling hours and to maximize it during heating hours. The versatility of methodology relies on a ray-tracing procedure (using Radiance based Daysim) to generate the hourly irradiation profiles on the glass. The computational resources required by ray-tracing do not increase much for complex geometries and are therefore a good candidate for BIPV simulation applications. The results on the indoor climate after the proposed refurbishment, considering both thermal comfort of people and conservation in situ of paleontological remains, are shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A Light Utility Helicopter (LUH), in {{the course}} of a {{training}} flight, leaving the ground during the taxi to take off, went into an uncontrolled rolling to the right; consequently the helicopter gradually laid down on the right side. The impact with the runway destroyed the rotating blades up to the hubs rotor. The accident investigation focused on main rotor oscillatory plate servo actuators. These components, directly linked to the cloche movements, regulate main rotor <b>blades</b> plane <b>tilt</b> and pitch. Following the preliminary examination, only front servo actuator attachment was found to be broken in two parts. In detail, the present paper deals with the fracture analysis results. The servo actuator attachment material is a 2014 Aluminum alloy extrudate, undergone to T 651 heat treatment. Fracture surfaces were examined by optical and electronic microscopy in order to determine the main morphological features and consequently to trace the origin of failure mechanism and causes. The accordance with the specification requirements about alloy composition was verified by quantitative elementary analysis through inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy (ICP); furthermore, semi-quantitative elementary analysis was locally verified by Energy dispersion spectroscopy X ray (EDS_RX). Finally, the hydrogen content of the material was evaluated by the total hydrogen analysis. Microstructural and technological alloy characteristics were verified as well by using metallographic microscopy and hardness testing of the material. Macroscopic fracture surfaces evidences were characterized by the lack of any significant plastic deformations and by the presence of symmetry compared to the servo actuator axis. Microscopic fracture features of both the investigated surfaces were not coherent to the hypothesis of an impact of the main rotor to the soil. Further achieved evidences, such as grain boundary fracture propagation, the presence of corrosion products, were all in accordance with a Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) progressive fracture mechanism. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) located the highest tensile stress value, when the servo actuator is in its nominal working condition, at the same points where the corrosion products were more concentrated (i. e. in the part of the fracture exposed to oxidative air effect for the longest time). The good agreement between FEA and morphological evidences allowed to determine the progressive fracture origin area, though it was not possible to individuate the crack initiation point. In fact, in correspondence to the initiation area of both the fracture surfaces, shining and flat morphology was found;. then there were evidence of plastic deformations, due to the detachment of a servo actuator part. The ICP analysis and hardness testing results were in accordance with the material specification requirements. However, the hydrogen content was one order of magnitude greater than the required value and many and unexpected globular formations were observed on the fracture surface. Part of these were dendritic formations, while the others looked smooth and shining. Further, FESEM boundary grain observation gave evidences of a high presence of precipitates on the investigated surfaces. Hence, observed microstructural characteristics, boundary grain precipitates and globular formations allowed to hypothesize possible overheating/eutectic melting phenomena, occurred during manufacturing processes. As widely reported in literature, the AA 2014 alloy is one of the aluminum-copper-magnesium-silicon type, employing copper aluminide (CuAl 2) as the primary precipitation-hardening agent. The need for a maximum Cu phase dispersion in solid solution requires a heat treatment range with an upper limit (507 °C) that is near to the melting of the eutectics (510 °C). Moreover, since the 1960 s, AA 2014 has been defined as sensitive to SCC. This condition is mainly related to the presence of coarse-grained and aligned CuAl 2 precipitates. This arrangement is due to an overheating (more than 507 °C) or to a cooling process carried out too slowly. Microstructural analysis was carried out on three items: 1) a large portion of the broken actuator attachment; 2) on a servoactuator coming from the same production batch; 3) on a servo actuator coming from a different production batch. The microstructure from the broken actuator attachment showed a great amount of precipitates (second phases) lengthwise aligned to the boundary grain, pores, and also cavities and dendritic globular formations. Analysis results, morphology evidences and reference images available on scientific literature were found to be in excellent agreement and validated the embrittlement and subsequent SCC mechanism hypotesis (intergranular failure propagation). In conclusion, flight accident causes are attributable to main rotor actuator attachment failure. Failure mechanism is classifiable as SCC supported by microstructural anomalies of the material. The investigation of the manufacturing process highlighted how one of the servo actuator batches was not properly produced due to poor control and accuracy of heat treatment temperature and/or cooling time. This led to hydrogen embrittlement and to a microstructural problem (globular formations and boundary grain precipitates). The combination of those phenomena caused an increase of the SCC sensitivity and were the basic progressive failure driving forces. Nevertheless, as above mentioned, alloy composition was found compliant with the material specification requirements and this just because none of the scheduled quality control tests is able to determine the peculiar microstructural anomalies reported...|$|R
