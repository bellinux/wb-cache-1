50|$|The Swedish-Norwegian Rifle Commission {{only briefly}} looked into <b>bayonets,</b> {{focusing}} on selecting {{the best possible}} rifle.

50|$|The Trapdoor Springfields had {{originally}} been produced with reworked <b>bayonets</b> {{left over from the}} Civil War. When supplies of these <b>bayonets</b> ran low, Springfield Armory attempted to create a new design, as these <b>bayonets</b> were considered to be obsolete.|$|R

5|$|As {{a strong}} proponent {{for a new}} constitution, White helped Queen Liliʻuokalani draft the 1893 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Nāwahī was the other {{principal}} author, and Samuel Nowlein, captain of the Household Guard, was another contributor. These three had been meeting with the queen in secret since August 1892 after attempts to abrogate the <b>Bayonet</b> Constitution by legislative decision through a constitutional convention had proved largely unsuccessful. The proposed constitution would increase {{the power of the}} monarchy, restore voting rights to economically disenfranchised Native Hawaiians and Asians, and remove the property qualification for suffrage imposed by the <b>Bayonet</b> Constitution, among other changes. On the afternoon of January14, after the knighting ceremony of White and Nāwahī and the prorogation of the legislature, members of Hui Kālaiʻāina and a delegation of native leaders marched to ʻIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the constitution. According to William DeWitt Alexander, this was pre-planned by the queen to take place while she met with her newly appointed cabinet ministers in the Blue Room of the palace. She was attempting to promulgate the constitution during the recess of the legislative assembly. However, these ministers, including Samuel Parker, William H. Cornwell, John F. Colburn, and Arthur P. Peterson, were either opposed to or reluctant to support the new constitution.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate <b>bayonet</b> and musket battle followed.

The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being peppered with canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the 17th century, the matchlock muskets of some line {{infantry}} were equipped with <b>bayonets.</b> <b>Bayonets</b> were attached to the muzzles of muskets and were used when line troops entered melee combat. They also helped to defend against cavalry.|$|R

This was the brigade's fifth deployment since 2003, their fourth to Afghanistan as they prepare for a complete transition of the security of Afghanistan to the Afghan National Security Forces. The brigade returned in early 2013. Nine soldiers from the brigade lost their lives during the deployment.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a <b>bayonet</b> charge that repulsed the warriors. During the charge Bartholomew was shot through the lower arm, breaking both bones. He was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death.

Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the <b>Bayonet</b> Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E

5|$|On 14 May 1940, Secretary of State for War Anthony Eden {{announced}} {{the creation of}} the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV)—later to become known as the Home Guard. Far more men volunteered than the government expected {{and by the end of}} June, there were nearly 1.5million volunteers. There were plenty of personnel for the defence of the country, but there were no uniforms (a simple armband had to suffice) and equipment was in critically short supply. At first, the Home Guard was armed with guns in private ownership, a knife or <b>bayonet</b> on a pole, Molotov cocktails and improvised flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Other Russian {{forces were}} more {{successful}} {{to the north}} of the town, where they managed to capture the village of Mokre from the 28th Regiment. The regiment counter-charged the village, but was initially driven off. However, approximately 80 pieces of emplaced Polish artillery laid a 30-minute barrage on the village. It was the greatest concentration of artillery fire in the war up to that point, and had a tremendous effect on the morale of the Russian defenders. After the barrage ended Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée personally led his forces in a <b>bayonet</b> charge; the regiment re-entered Mokre at noon and the Russians fled.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman centre {{and left}} columns were skilfully led round the open {{flank of the}} infantry's entrenchments and on towards the camp and railway. After the moon had set at around 02:30, the Germans and Ottomans made a <b>bayonet</b> charge on Mount Meredith. Although vastly outnumbered, the light {{horsemen}} fought an effective delaying action at close quarters, but were forced to relinquish ground slowly and to ultimately evacuate the position by 03:00. Without the benefit of moon light, the light horsemen had fired at the flashes of the enemy's rifles until they were close enough to use bayonets. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was eventually forced back; withdrawing slowly, troop covering troop with steady accurate fire, staving off a general attack with the <b>bayonet</b> to their fall-back position; a large east/west sand dune called Wellington Ridge at {{the southern edge of}} the Romani encampment. During the retirement to Wellington Ridge, the covering squadrons on the left near Katib Gannit were also attacked, as was the squadron on the right, which was taken in the flank and suffered considerable loss, but managed to hold its ground until the position in its rear was occupied. By 03:30, all light horsemen south of Mount Meredith had been forced back to their led horses and had succeeded in disengaging and falling back to their second position. Soon after, an Ottoman machine gun was shooting down on the light horse from Mount Meredith.|$|E
