50|$|In {{laboratory}} animal husbandry, {{there is a}} huge demand for animals that have been kept in disease free conditions and housed in <b>barrier</b> <b>units</b> such as Individually Ventilated Cages. This is very important because when animals are used for scientific research, particularly drug-related research, the animals must provide accurate and valid results. Using an animal that is ill may cause the severity limit to be exceeded. If the animal already has a disease and then undergoes experimentation of a substance that also produces effects on the animals health, it could potentially worsen the effects of the agent being tested causing the animal to experience more suffering than necessary. The animals may produce false results which may prove vital at a later stage, e.g., in drug trials on humans. Not only that, the experiment will have to be performed again and the previous animals would have ended up being killed. Special caging systems are often used alongside many other barriers to keep unwanted materials out of range of the animals.|$|R

Drilling in highly mature fields is challenging, both with respect to loss of circulation and differential sticking. On the Ula field there is a pressure barrier/baffle isolating parts of the Ula reservoir <b>units.</b> This pressure <b>barrier</b> creates a pressure differential between the units. The <b>units</b> above the <b>barrier</b> (1 A 1 - 1 A 2) have been produced since 1998 without any pressure support, resulting in a pressure decrease in this zone. The <b>units</b> beneath the <b>barrier</b> (<b>Units</b> 2 - 3) have been produced since 1987 and have been supported by both water- and WAG-injection, giving a much higher formation pressure in these units compared to the <b>units</b> above the <b>barrier.</b> The pressure differential between Units 1 and 2 have produced challenges drilling this interval in terms of losses during drilling and cementing operations. This thesis describes the challenges in drilling depleted formations with respect to lost returns and differential sticking.

The study involves reviewing BP’s drilling practices on the Ula field and proposing potential recommendations and improvements.

The results postulate that the nucleation of pores {{towards the end of}} the first transient stage results from recrystallization of rare oxide lattice produced in metal vertical bar oxide interface, accommodated with Al lattice, to the surface of initially. at film forming nanocrystallites of denser oxide and crack-like holes nuclei of pores between crystallites. During the second transient stage the successive transformation nuclei -> pockets -> channel-like pores results from simultaneous continuing production of oxide at a slightly declining rate, gradual localization of charge transfer processes from the. at surface to their bottom, recrystallization of oxide in the barrier layer establishing finally a stable gradient of density rising to electrolyte and conversion of barrier layer from. at to close packed shell shaped units accommodating these changes. The enhanced recrystallisation and density rise towards the pore base and wall surface and the necessity for equilibration of stresses inside each <b>barrier</b> layer <b>unit</b> and between neighbouring <b>units</b> yield hemispherical <b>barrier</b> layer <b>units,</b> self-ordering of porous structure approaching the highest possible 2 D hexagonal symmetry infinite surface domains and permanent growth of structure in steady state.

40|$|Abstract [652] Along time, {{architecture}} {{has shown}} a constant trend for clean style and pure plastic lightness. In consequence, the acoustic performance of buildings has become poorer in respect to their sound insulation. At {{the same time that}} the building envelope became more permeable to sound, urban environment developed and noise sources in cities became more diversified. Noise break-in works against an advantage that modern man acquired: the sensation of protection and privacy provided by their homes. Unless there are strict building regulations, which has not been true in Brazil so far, the contemporary residential building components can be considered as being physical <b>barriers</b> between <b>units,</b> but party walls and façades do not offer sufficient sound insulation, especially in a noisy metropolis. This paper proposes a critical analysis of the history of housing as far as its acoustic degradation is concerned. An architectural timeline structures the investigation, being a guide in historical evolution. The classical division in architectural styles has been disregarded, because their changes do not normally affect the building performance. On the other hand, changes in building systems or components that even unnoticed by the users made an impact on the sound insulation performance of buildings are under investigation. The evolution of houses is the main focus of the research. The decrease in building envelopes efficiency is correlated to the evolution in the use of houses and the changes in family habits and building technology. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, we {{experimentally}} study the evaporation modes and kinetics of sessile {{drops of water}} on highly hydrophobic surfaces (contact angle 160) 4 heated to temperatures ranging between 40 and 70 C. These surfaces were initially constructed by means of controlled tailoring of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) substrates. The evaporation of droplets was observed to occur in three distinct phases, which were {{the same for the}} different substrate temperatures. The drops started to evaporate in the constant contact radius (CCR) mode, then switched to a more complex mode characterized by a set of stick-slip events accompanied by a decrease in contact angle, and finally shifted to a mixed mode in which the contact radius and contact angle decreased simultaneously until the drops had completely evaporated. It is shown {{that in the case of}} superhydrophobic surfaces, the energy <b>barriers</b> (per <b>unit</b> length) associated with the stick-slip motion of a drop ranges in the nJ m(- 1) scale. Furthermore, analysis of the evaporation rates, determined from experimental data show that, even in the CCR mode, a linear relationship between V- 2 / 3 and the evaporation time is verified. The values of the evaporation rate constants are found to be higher in the pinned contact line regime (the CCR mode) than in the moving contact line regime. This behavior is attributed to the drop s higher surface to volume ratio in the CCR mode. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
