500|$|The company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California {{produced}} {{some of the}} equipment. The film {{was reported to be}} the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld <b>beamsplitter</b> mirror rig. 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion. Webb wanted a new 3D experience for Spider-Man: [...] "Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view– so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets." [...] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they [...] "started making the movie around the time Avatar came out" [...] which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films. Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.|$|E

Also, in real interferometers, the thicknesses of the <b>beamsplitters</b> may differ, and the path lengths are not necessarily equal. Regardless, {{in the absence of}} absorption, conservation of energy guarantees that the two paths must differ by a half wavelength phase shift.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} are presented for implementing a simple method for aligning {{the object and}} image planes of linear arrays of elemental detectors.

A neutral density filter is located along the beam path and an optical microscope is located beyond the exit plane of the <b>beamsplitters.</b> In the first variant, the beam is tuned to the spectral sensitivity of the elements. In the second version, a lens and a microscope are situated outside the exit plane of the <b>beamsplitters,</b> and spectral tuning is unnecessary.

50|$|The {{specimen}} is illuminated {{with light}} of a specific wavelength (or wavelengths) which is absorbed by the fluorophores, causing them to emit light of longer wavelengths (i.e., of a different color than the absorbed light). The illumination light is separated from the much weaker emitted fluorescence {{through the use of}} a spectral emission filter. Typical components of a fluorescence microscope are a light source (xenon arc lamp or mercury-vapor lamp are common; more advanced forms are high-power LEDs and lasers), the excitation filter, the dichroic mirror (or dichroic <b>beamsplitter),</b> and the emission filter (see figure below). The filters and the dichroic <b>beamsplitter</b> are chosen to match the spectral excitation and emission characteristics of the fluorophore used to label the specimen.
