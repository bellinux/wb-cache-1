25|$|Buspirone is {{a member}} of the azapirone {{chemical}} class, and consists of azaspirodecanedione and pyrimidinylpiperazine components linked together by a <b>butyl</b> chain.|$|E
25|$|PCBs readily {{penetrate}} skin, PVC (polyvinyl chloride), and latex (natural rubber). PCB-resistant materials include Viton, polyethylene, {{polyvinyl acetate}} (PVA), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), <b>butyl</b> rubber, nitrile rubber, and Neoprene.|$|E
25|$|In general, <b>butyl,</b> polysulfide, polyurethane, {{and other}} {{inorganic}} or rubber-based sealants are reasonably compatible with copper. Acrylic, neoprene, and nitrile-based sealants actively corrode copper. Silicone sealants are somewhat successful with copper but their suitability should be verified before application.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} or, in some cases, use of {{the following}} substances may result in exposure to n-butanol: artificial leather, <b>butyl</b> esters, rubber cement, dyes, fruit essences, lacquers, motion picture, and photographic films, raincoats, perfumes, pyroxylin plastics, rayon, safety glass, shellac varnish, and waterproofed cloth.|$|E
25|$|After the N–H proton, the {{hydrogen}} at C2 {{is the next}} most acidic proton on indole. Reaction of N-protected indoles with <b>butyl</b> lithium or lithium diisopropylamide results in lithiation exclusively at the C2 position. This strong nucleophile can then be used as such with other electrophiles.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, Weizmann {{was invited}} by President Franklin D. Roosevelt {{to work on}} the problem of {{synthetic}} rubber. Weizmann proposed to produce <b>butyl</b> alcohol from maize, then convert it to butylene and further to butadiene, which is a basis for rubber. According to his memoirs, these proposals were barred by the oil companies.|$|E
25|$|The largest use of {{n-butanol}} is as {{an industrial}} intermediate, {{particularly for the}} manufacture of <b>butyl</b> acetate (itself an artificial flavorant and industrial solvent). It is a petrochemical, manufactured from propylene and usually used close {{to the point of}} manufacture. Estimated production figures for 1997 are: United States 784,000tonnes; Western Europe 575,000tonnes; Japan 225,000tonnes.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of strong acids and water, carbon monoxide reacts with alkenes to form carboxylic acids in {{a process known as}} the Koch–Haaf reaction. In the Gattermann–Koch reaction, arenes are converted to benzaldehyde derivatives in {{the presence}} of AlCl3 and HCl. Organolithium compounds (e.g. <b>butyl</b> lithium) react with carbon monoxide, but these reactions have little scientific use.|$|E
25|$|Because DMSO easily penetrates the skin, {{substances}} {{dissolved in}} DMSO may be quickly absorbed. Glove selection is important {{when working with}} DMSO. <b>Butyl</b> rubber, fluoroelastomer, neoprene, or thick (15 mil) latex gloves are recommended. Nitrile gloves, which are very commonly used in chemical laboratories, may protect from brief contact but {{have been found to}} degrade rapidly with exposure to DMSO.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{the sale}} of {{products}} containing <b>butyl</b> nitrite has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers. In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs. After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the Council of State {{on the grounds that}} the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.|$|E
25|$|Alkylation {{occurs when}} a {{molecule}} replaces a hydrogen atom with an alkyl group that generally comes from an organic molecule. Alkyl groups that are found naturally occurring in the environment are organometallic compounds. Organometallic compounds generally contain a methyl, ethyl, or <b>butyl</b> derivative which is the alkyl group that replaces the hydrogen. Other organic compounds, such as methanol, can provide alkyl groups for alkylation. Methanol is found naturally in the environment in small concentrations, and {{has been linked to}} the release from biological decomposition of waste and even a byproduct of vegetation. The following reactions are alkylations of soluble compounds found in creosote preservatives with methanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{tertiary}} <b>butyl</b> {{group in}} salbutamol {{makes it more}} selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from field corn was spurred in the U.S. {{by the discovery}} that methyl tertiary <b>butyl</b> ether (MTBE) was contaminating groundwater. MTBE use as an oxygenate additive was widespread due to mandates of the Clean Air Act amendments of 1992 to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. As a result, by 2006 MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states. There was also concern that widespread and costly litigation might be taken against the U.S. gasoline suppliers, and a 2005 decision refusing legal protection for MTBE, opened a new market for ethanol fuel, the primary substitute for MTBE. At a time when corn prices were around US$2 a bushel, corn growers recognized the potential of this new market and delivered accordingly. This demand shift took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising.|$|E
25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking. Experiments on chemical attractants of V. pensylvanica and other generalist wasps show {{the effectiveness of}} using acetic acid in combination with these chemicals separately: isobutanol, heptyl butyrate, and <b>butyl</b> butyrate. Acetic acid alone {{did not have the}} same attractive effects as the chemical combinations. Using a vial dispenser, releasing up to an estimated 2.3 mg of heptyl butyrate per hour increased the number of yellowjackets attracted. In Hawaii, the Christmas tree is a large seasonal import each year. Over 90% of these trees contain live insects. Although V. pensylvanica typically resides in ground nests, queens occasionally choose these trees as overwintering sites. One potential strategy {{to reduce the number of}} yellowjackets and other generalist predators is applying preharvest permethrin sprays in combination with mechanical tree-shaking.|$|E
25|$|Overexposure to {{ethyl acetate}} may cause {{irritation}} of the eyes, nose, and throat. Severe overexposure may cause weakness, drowsiness, and unconsciousness. Humans {{exposed to a}} concentration of 400ppm in 1.4mg/L ethyl acetate {{for a short time}} were affected by nose and throat irritation. Ethyl acetate is an irritant of the conjunctiva and mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Animal experiments have shown that, at very high concentrations, the ester has central nervous system depressant and lethal effects; at concentrations of 20,000 to 43,000ppm (2.0–4.3%), there may be pulmonary edema with hemorrhages, symptoms of central nervous system depression, secondary anemia and liver damage. In humans, concentrations of 400ppm cause irritation of the nose and pharynx; cases have also been known of irritation of the conjunctiva with temporary opacity of the cornea. In rare cases exposure may cause sensitization of the mucous membrane and eruptions of the skin. The irritant effect of ethyl acetate is weaker than that of propyl acetate or <b>butyl</b> acetate.|$|E
25|$|Membrane {{dry suits}} {{are made from}} thin {{materials}} which have little thermal insulation. They are commonly made of stockinette fabric coated with vulcanized rubber, laminated layers of nylon and <b>butyl</b> rubber known as Trilaminate or Cordura proofed with an inner layer of polyurethane. With {{the exception of the}} rubber-coated stockinette, membrane dry suits typically do not stretch, so they need to be made slightly over-sized and baggy to allow flexibility at the joints through the wearer's range of motion and to allow the hands and feet to pass through without difficulty. This makes membrane dry suits easy to put on and take off, provides a good range of motion for the wearer when correctly sized and sufficiently inflated, and makes them relatively comfortable to wear for long periods out of the water compared to a wetsuit or close-fitting neoprene dry suit, as the wearer does not have to pull against rubber elasticity to move or keep joints flexed.|$|E

500|$|The {{demand for}} ethanol fuel {{produced}} from field corn in the United States was {{stimulated by the}} discovery in the late 90s that methyl tertiary <b>butyl</b> ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive in gasoline, was contaminating groundwater. Due to the risks of widespread and costly litigation, and because MTBE use in gasoline was banned in almost 20 states by 2006, the substitution of MTBE opened a new market for ethanol fuel. This demand shift for ethanol as an oxygenate additive took place {{at a time when}} oil prices were already significantly rising. By 2006, about 50 percent of the gasoline used in the U.S. contained ethanol at different proportions, and ethanol production grew so fast that the US became the world's top ethanol producer, [...] Brazil in 2005. This shift also contributed to a sharp increase in the production and sale of E85 flex vehicles since 2002.|$|E
500|$|The {{new owners}} {{set to work}} immediately. The dry section was {{excavated}} and lined with a <b>butyl</b> liner to prevent leakage. The canal was reopened in 1971. Navigation was restricted to unpowered boats, {{with the exception of}} a maintenance boat that was used for cutting weed, while the final section from Fossend to Lowdwells, which would have been part of the original main line to Exeter, is designated as a nature reserve, and so all navigation and angling is discouraged. The canal is now a designated country park, and a horse-drawn tourist narrowboat runs from Tiverton. Since 2003 powered boats have been allowed on the Canal, subject to Licence from Devon County Council. The Canal is also a very popular Coarse Fishing spot [...] and angling rights on the Canal are leased to the Tiverton and District Angling Club. In addition to holding a valid Environment Agency Rod Licence, a permit must be purchased in advance.|$|E
