In this area, 739 sharks were caught at depth between 84 m and 867 m, and the living of sharks of 15 genus 20 species was confirmed. Many of the species caught were rare or unrecorded from the area, and as particularly rare spesies from within these shaks, Odontaspis ferox, Pseudotriakis acrages, Scapanorhynchus owstoni and Echinorhinus cookei were remarkable, while Centrophorus tessellatus was particularly common shark, accounting for 47. 7 % of the total catch. For the distinctive characters of these sharks, we obtained some obervations as the following. 1. a. The total length composition of sharks caugth showed in figure 3. b. The relation between length and weight of sharks caught showed in figure 4. c. As shown in figure 5. the fishing depth range for each shark is different. 2.

In this paper we provide detailed time-at-depth information for two blue marlin released alive from pelagic longline gear with pop-up archival satellite tags (PSATs) programmed to release from the animals after 30 days. Both blue marlin made several dives each day. The fish moved quickly to depth, and the times at depth were greater than those spent in descent or ascent. The depth of dives was greater during daylight hours. These data are suggestive of feeding excursions to deeper waters, movements for which these fish are well adapted with large eyes and a brain (eye) heating organ. If billfish undertake specific feeding movements to depth, then one would expect increased catch rates for deeply <b>set</b> <b>longline</b> gear. Researchers have recently attempted to standardize catch rates of billfish on pelagic longline for the time fish spend at depth (habitat-based models). However, if feeding motivation is not the same for an animal at all depths, then such standardizations will significantly bias catch rates and lead to errors in assessment...|$|R
