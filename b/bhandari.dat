5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the violence there were widespread calls for Modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Telugu Desam Party (allies in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled Parliament over the issue. Modi submitted his resignation at the April 2002 BJP national executive meeting in Goa, but it was not accepted. His cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 July 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the Gujarat Governor S. S. <b>Bhandari,</b> and the state assembly was dissolved. Despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, Modi succeeded in advancing the election to December 2002. In the elections, the BJP won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. Although Modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-Muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the BJP profited from religious polarisation among the voters. Modi hired the public relations firm APCO Worldwide to manage his image. He won the Maninagar constituency, receiving 1,13,589 of 1,54,981 votes and defeating INC candidate Yatin Oza by 75,333 votes. On 22 December 2002, <b>Bhandari</b> swore Modi in for a second term. Modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon Gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the BJP winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.|$|E

In a dream, he sees Banai and falls in love with her. He goes on a hunt in the forest, gets away from the army and stays with Banai for twelve years. He marries her in non-ritualistic marriage and brings her back to Jejuri. A variant describes how Khandoba arrives in Chandanpur on a hunting expedition and becomes thirsty. A Dhangar directs him to Banai's vada. Banai offers him water or sends a pot of water, in which Khandoba reads Banai's name. In another version, the pot with nine jewels is a sign for Khandoba to recognise Banai, the girl he saw in his dream. He falls for her and loses purposefully in saripat with Mhalsa and accepts a twelve-year exile. In this period, he disguises himself as an impoverished, old leper and becomes a man-servant of Banai's father. Some folk songs have erotic overtones, for example, some songs give erotic descriptions of Banai's beauty which maddens Khandoba.|$|E
5|$|Although Badrinath {{is located}} in North India, the head priest, or Rawal, is {{traditionally}} a Nambudiri Brahmin chosen from the South Indian state of Kerala. This tradition {{is believed to have}} been initiated by Adi Shankara, who was a South Indian philosopher. The Rawal (chief priest) is requested by the Government of Uttarakhand (Uttar Pradesh government before the formation of Uttarakhand state) to the Kerala Government. The candidate should possess a degree of Acharya in Sanskrit, be a bachelor, well-versed in reciting mantras (sacred texts) and be from the Vaishnava sect of Hinduism. The erstwhile ruler of Garhwal, who is the tutelary head of Badrinath, approves the candidate sent by the Government of Kerala. A Tilak Ceremony is held to instate the Rawal and he is deputed from April to November, when the temple remains open. The Rawal is accorded high holiness status by Garhwal Rifles and the state governments of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. He is also held in high esteem by the Royals of Nepal. From April to November, he performs his duties as a temple priest. Thereafter, he either stays in Joshimutt or returns to his native village in Kerala. The duties of the Rawal starts at 4 a.m. every day with the Abhisheka. He should not cross the river until Vamana Dwadasi and must adhere to Brahmacharya. The Rawal is assisted by the Garhwali Dimri Pundits belonging to the Village Dimmer, Nayab Rawals, Dharmadikari, Vedapathi, a group of priests, Pandas Samadhini, <b>Bhandari,</b> Rasoiyas (cook), devotional singer, clerk of devashram, Jal Bhariya (water keeper) and temple guards.

50|$|The strongest {{level of}} entrenchment exists in those constitutions that state {{that some of}} their most {{fundamental}} principles are absolute, i.e. certain articles may not be amended under any circumstances. An amendment of a constitution that is made consistently with that constitution, except that it violates the absolute non-modifiability, can be called an unconstitutional constitutional law. Ultimately it is always possible for a constitution to be overthrown by internal or external force, for example, a revolution (perhaps claiming to be justified by the right to revolution) or invasion.In the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court has created the Doctrine of Basic Structure in Kesavananda Bharti's case (1973) stating that the essential features of the Basic structure cannot be amended by the Parliament. The Court has identified judicial review, independence of Judiciary, free and fair election, core of Fundamental Rights as a few of the essential features which are unamendable. However, the Supreme Court did not identify specific provisions which are in the category of absolute entrenchment. A critical analysis of the Doctrine of Basic Structure appears in Professor M.K. <b>Bhandari's</b> book Basic Structure of Indian Constitution - A Critical Reconsideration.|$|R

40|$|This {{beautiful}} flora covers {{one of the}} world’s most arid regions, 650, 000 sq. km of sand, gravel, and limestone, {{a desert}} sparsely adorned by 565 species out of 322 genera of plants. Of these, 392 species and 236 genera are native; among the most extreme desertplants {{there are a few}} endemics. The most important families in number of native species are the Compositae (50, in 33 genera), the Grasses (47, resp. 31), the Chenopodiaceae (35, resp. 17), the Leguminosae (34, resp. 16), and the Cruciferae (30, resp. 22). A comparison with <b>Bhandari’s</b> ‘Flora of the Indian desert’, reviewed in this same issue, is interesting: though the area covered there is much smaller (some 25, 000 sq. km), the numbers of genera and species as well as the most important families are nearly the same, the latter with two notable exceptions, viz. the Chenopodiaceae with 4 genera and 8 species and the Cruciferae with 6 genera and 7 species only. A few short introductory chapters give a concise but clear introduction to the topography, climate, plant geography, and vegetation. The flora proper gives keys to the families, genera, and species which seem to work well. The families and genera are provided with short descriptions. Literature was not cited, also not with the species. Under the species still commonly used synonyms, if any, are mentioned; description, habitat, distribution incl. citation of collections, vernacular names, and uses are given. Often, notes mainly on systematic questions, and sometimes rather extensive ones, are added. The book is illustrated by beautiful colour photographs, 7 of landscapes and some 250 of plants. These and the clear descriptions make drawings nearly unnecessary; these are only given for the inflorescence types of the Grasses; a few more schematic drawings, especially of the spikelet of the Grasses, could be helpful. The book is finished up by a rather extensive glossary of botanical terms, a gazetteer to the localities mentioned, a bibliography, lists of vernacular names, and an index rightly called general, as everything not yet covered in one of the other indexes seems to have been included...|$|R
