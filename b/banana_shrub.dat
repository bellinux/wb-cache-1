50|$|In 1744 Walker was {{appointed}} professor of moral philosophy at Cambridge, and in 1745 {{he was nominated}} rector of Thorpland in Norfolk, a living which he exchanged in 1757 for that of Upwell. He was devoted to horticulture, and had a small garden within the precincts of Trinity College which was famous for exotic plants, including the pineapple, <b>banana,</b> coffee <b>shrub,</b> logwood tree, and torch thistle, which, {{with the aid of}} a hothouse, he was able to raise. On 16 July 1760 he purchased land from Richard Whish, a vintner, and on 25 Aug. 1762 conveyed the principal part to the university in trust for the establishment of the Cambridge University Botanic Garden which occupied the site until its move one mile south in 1846. In 1763 he published anonymously A Short Account of the late Donation of a Botanic Garden to the University of Cambridge. He died at Cambridge, unmarried, on 15 December 1764.|$|R
40|$|The plot for {{the study}} on {{vegetation}} changes was established in a deforested area of the Maeklong Watershed Research Station, Kanchanaburi, western Thailand. The plot (100 x 400 m 2) was divided into four hundred 10 x 10 m 2 sub-quadrats. We found six major vegetation types in the sub-quadrats: bamboo, woody <b>shrub,</b> <b>banana</b> (Musa acuminata), and three grasses Eupatorium ordotarum, Arundo donax and Bothrichloa sp. types. The aboveground biomass (kg m- 2) of each dominant vegetation type was measured as follows: 4. 1 for the bamboo type, 7. 6 for the woody shrub type, 0. 84 for the banana type, 2. 0 for the E. ordotarum type, 2. 3 for the A. donax type, and 0. 8 for Bothrichloa type. The changes in dominant vegetation types have been monitored from 1992 to 1995. In 1992, the percentages of dominance for E. ordotarum, woody shrub, and A. donax were 39 %, 20 %, and 17 % respectively. The transition matrices were calculated from the replacement patterns of vegetation types in the same quadrats. The vegetation change projected using the transition matrices suggested that the bamboo areas will increase while the woody shrubs and E. ordotarum areas will decrease in the future. Total bimass changes, calculating from the project, show that the total biomass of this pilot will increase due to the accumulation of woody shrub biomass. However, frequent fire disturbance will largely influence the speed of biomass accumulation in the plot...|$|R
