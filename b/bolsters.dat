However, on Benchmade's offering the titanium <b>bolsters</b> and micarta scales were replaced with G10 fiberglass scales, the slotted screws were replaced by Torx head screws, and the pocket clip was repositioned so that the knife could be carried in the pocket in a tip-down position.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this <b>bolsters</b> the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and <b>bolsters</b> but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium were its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

3000|$|<b>Bolstered</b> {{estimation}} {{was proposed}} in [27]. It has shown promising performance for small sample sizes {{in terms of}} root mean square error. While it is comparable to bootstrap methods in many cases, <b>bolstered</b> estimators are typically much more computationally efficient than the bootstrap. The main idea of <b>bolstering</b> is to put a kernel {{at each of the}} sample point, called [...] "bolstering kernel" [...] to smooth the variance of counting-based estimation methods (in this paper, we adopt Gaussian <b>bolstering</b> kernels). When the classifiers are overfitted, and hence, resubstitution estimates are optimistically biased, then <b>bolstering</b> at a misclassified point will increase this bias. Semibolstering is suggested for correcting this, by conducting no <b>bolstering</b> at misclassified points. We refer the reader to [27] for the full details (in this paper, we employ the <b>bolstered</b> and semibolstered resubstitution estimators of [27]).|$|R
3000|$|Swing <b>Bolster</b> with Circular Arc Guide This is {{a natural}} tilting {{solution}} used in early Japanese tilting trains. In this system, the car body sits on air springs, which is mounted on a swing <b>bolster</b> (tilting <b>bolster).</b> The tilting <b>bolster</b> in turn sits on rollers or bearings which allow motion along a circular path. According to Persson [3], the car body’s centre of gravity is located about 600 – 900  mm lower than {{the location of the}} tilt centre. There are two major tilting components in this system. The first is the tilting <b>bolster</b> and the second is the roller bearings which the <b>bolster</b> sits on. This system allows a 5 °– 6 ° tilt capability of the car body. The system uses roll dampers which are installed between the bogie frame and tilting <b>bolster</b> to limit overshooting [3].|$|R
5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric <b>bolsters</b> and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear bumper reinforcement addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E

25|$|Steel blades are {{commonly}} shaped by forging or stock removal. Forged blades {{are made by}} heating {{a single piece of}} steel, then shaping the metal while hot using a hammer or press. Stock removal blades are shaped by grinding and removing metal. With both methods, after shaping, the steel must be heat treated. This involves heating the steel above its critical point, then quenching the blade to harden it. After hardening, the blade is tempered to remove stresses and make the blade tougher. Mass manufactured kitchen cutlery uses both the forging and stock removal processes. Forging tends to be reserved for manufacturers' more expensive product lines, and can often be distinguished from stock removal product lines by the presence of an integral bolster, though integral <b>bolsters</b> can be crafted through either shaping method.|$|E
