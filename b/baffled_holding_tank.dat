50|$|A dump {{station is}} a place where raw sewage may be entered into a {{sanitary}} sewer system in a safe and responsible way. Dump stations are often used by owners of motorhomes, campervans, recreational vehicle or boats that are equipped with toilet facilities and a sewage <b>holding</b> <b>tank,</b> also known as a blackwater <b>holding</b> <b>tank.</b> The <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> can be safely emptied at a dump station.

50|$|A <b>holding</b> <b>tank,</b> {{also called}} a waste water <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> or black (water) tank, is a {{container}} for storing sewage in {{vehicles equipped with}} toilets. Vehicles that employ <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> include recreational vehicles (RVs), trucks (U.S. usage) or lorries (UK usage), railroad trains, boats, aircraft, and even spacecraft. The contents are emptied into a dump station, which discharges the raw sewage into a sewage treatment system.|$|R
50|$|The {{operator}} connects a hose to {{the discharge}} outlet on the recreational vehicle, boat or building and pumps the waste into the wagon's <b>holding</b> <b>tank.</b> When the tank is full, the operator should {{empty the tank}} at an approved <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> dump station or sewage lagoon.|$|R

Simply, the HTSS provides a means to collect and temporarily store sewage from a facility or dwelling, for subsequent removal and transport to an approved treatment and disposal site. The required storage capacity of a <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> depends upon two items: daily sewage flow, and available or optimal pumping service frequency.|$|R

40|$|Hauled {{liquid waste}} as a {{pollutant}} of soils and waters in Poland. Improperly maintained <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> are often underestimated {{source of contamination}} of soil, groundwater and surface water. As a rule, wastewater stored in <b>holding</b> <b>tanks,</b> should be transported and treated in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). There are 2, 257, 000 <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> in Poland, located mainly in rural areas. The article {{presents the results of}} analysis of wastewater management in 20 rural and urban-rural communes, which were chosen at random from the total number of 2, 174 communes in Poland. The only criterion of commune selection was total or partial lack of sewerage system. Analysis of the collected data showed that on average only 27 % of liquid waste from <b>holding</b> <b>tanks</b> ended at the WWTPs. The median is even lower and amounts to 17. 5 %. More than 4, 000 Mg of P and 26, 000 Mg of N is dispersed in the environment in uncontrolled manner.

40|$|Seawater in {{a fishing}} port was electrolyzed to induce {{hypochlorite}} up to approximately 1 mg/L for {{the reduction of}} viable bacterial count because disinfection of seawater {{is important for the}} prevention and control of hazards in seafoods. The number of viable bacteria in a fish <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> was lowered from 10 ^ 4 - 10 ^ 5 mg/L to 10 ^ 0 - 10 ^ 1 mg/L after electrolization of seawater and the low level of viable bacterial count was kept for at least 3 hours. The reduction rate of chlorine concentration of the electrolyzed seawater in the fish <b>holding</b> <b>tank</b> was reduced by the addition of ice and by covering with a thermal insulating sheet. However, the chlorine concentration decreased when fish were put into the fish <b>holding</b> <b>tank.</b> In a fisher-boat tank, viable bacterial count remained less than 100 CFU/mL for at least 60 minutes when ice was present.
