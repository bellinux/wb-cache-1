40|$|Lyssavirus {{surveillance}} <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> {{was performed}} <b>in</b> Bangladesh during 2003 and 2004. No virus isolates were obtained. Three serum samples (all from Pteropus giganteus, n = 127) of 288 total serum samples, obtained from <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> 9 different taxa, neutralized lyssaviruses Aravan and Khujand. The infection occurs <b>in</b> <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> Bangladesh, but virus prevalence appears low...|$|R
5|$|Philadelphia {{scored in}} the first inning for the third {{consecutive}} game, taking a 2–0 lead when Shane Victorino and Pedro Feliz <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell respectively. Tampa Bay cut the lead in half in the fourth inning; Carlos Peña doubled and was <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> on Evan Longoria's single, both players' first hits of the Series. The Rays then tied the game in the sixth inning when B. J. Upton scored from second base on a Peña single. The game was suspended after the top of the sixth inning due to rain, making it the first game in World Series history to not be played through to completion or declared a tie.|$|E
5|$|Kelly is {{a two-time}} World Series {{champion}} (1921 and 1922). He led the National League in home runs once (1921) and runs <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> twice (1920 and 1924), and {{was elected to}} the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973. However, his selection is regarded as controversial, as many believe he is undeserving of the recognition and was only elected by the Veterans Committee because it consisted of his former teammates.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, in a 10–5 {{win over}} the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, Posey hit two three-run home runs {{en route to a}} career-high six runs <b>batted</b> <b>in.</b> It is the second most RBIs in a single game by a Giants catcher in the San Francisco Era.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Sounds players {{have led the}} league in {{multiple}} statistical categories during a single season. Balboni led the 1980 season in five categories: runs (101), runs <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (122), total bases (288), home runs (30), and fielding percentage among first basemen (.990). In 1990, Hammond {{led the league in}} wins (15), winning percentage (.938 (15–1)), earned run average (2.17), and strikeouts (149). Durham, Ruffcorn, and Wever have also led a single season in three areas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} of the Interstate League season, Levan was called up to the Phillies.

The following day, he helped pitcher Curt Simmons, a former teammate in American Legion Baseball, earn his first victory over Andy Hansen of the Giants by hitting safely twice in four times at bat and scoring one run.|$|E
50|$|The cave {{has been}} home to large groups of <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> the past. Despite the cave's {{entrance}} being covered by grills the cave was entered by youths who set off fireworks to disturb the <b>bats.</b> <b>In</b> November 1966, the cave was surveyed by the Gibraltar Cave Research Group; a painted sign on the cave's wall mentions this. An estimated 5000 Schreibers' bats Miniopterus schreibersii and 1000 large mouse-eared bats Myotis myotis were there in the 60s. There were no <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> 2002, despite it being an offence to interfere with <b>bat</b> populations <b>in</b> caves in Gibraltar.|$|R
5|$|Flower {{became the}} first player to carry his <b>bat</b> <b>in</b> two {{different}} international formats when he also carried his <b>bat</b> <b>in</b> a Test against Pakistan at Bulawayo in 1998; since then, Anwar, Stewart, Gayle and Javed Omar of Bangladesh have also managed this feat.|$|R

5|$|Clean-up hitter {{and first}} baseman Ryan Howard {{was named the}} {{recipient}} of the Babe Ruth Home Run Award (in MLB) and the Negro Baseball League Museum's Josh Gibson Legacy Award, as the NL leader in home runs. Howard hit 48 home runs in 2008, more than any other player in the National League. Howard also <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> 146 runs, and finished the regular season with 11 homers and 32 RBIs during September. Second baseman Chase Utley also won his third consecutive Silver Slugger Award, given annually to the best hitter in each league at his position.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{struggles in}} the Test arena, Brown had {{success in the}} tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|During the Tests, Miller usually batted at No. 5, {{except in}} the Fourth Test when he batted at No. 4 due to the injury-enforced absence of opener Barnes, which {{resulted}} in a reshuffle in the batting order. Miller totalled 1,088 first-class runs for the tour, the seventh highest aggregate, although his average of 47.30 was only the eighth highest in the squad. During the tour matches, he <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> a variety of positions, as did all of the squad, because Bradman used a rotation system to rest his team because many matches were played consecutively.|$|E
5000|$|He <b>batted</b> [...]241 <b>in</b> 216 at <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> 2010, playing {{right field}} (77 games) and left field (13 games), {{and as the}} {{designated}} hitter (11 games).|$|R
5000|$|Brown divided {{his major}} league {{career as an}} outfielder, first baseman, pinch hitter and {{designated}} hitter. He is best remembered for his contribution to the 1968 World Series champion Detroit Tigers. In his pinch hitting at <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> the 1968 season, Brown hit for a [...]450 batting average, the eighth highest single season batting average for a pinch hitter (minimum 30 at <b>bats)</b> <b>in</b> major league history. Brown holds the American League record for the most pinch-hit at <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> a career, with 414.|$|R
50|$|Non heraldic {{organizations}} {{also use}} <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> their symbols. Certain Spanish football clubs including Valencia CF and Levante UD use <b>bats</b> <b>in</b> their badges. The burgee of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club (Reial Club Nàutic de València) displays a bat on a golden field in its center.|$|R
5|$|During the tour, Hamence played 19first-class {{matches and}} scored 582runs {{at an average}} of 32.33. An {{occasional}} bowler who delivered 56.3 overs of medium pace during the tour, he took seven wickets at 21.42 and completed nine catches. He was the most successful of the specialist batsmen with the ball, occasionally opening the bowling in the tour matches, such as in both innings of the second match against Surrey and the second innings of the second match against Yorkshire. This allowed Bradman to rest his first-choice bowlers to keep them fresh for the Tests. Hamence's primary role was to allow the leading batsmen an opportunity to conserve energy for the Tests; the Australians generally had six days of play scheduled every week. In most of the matches, Hamence <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> the middle order at Nos. 5, 6 and 7.N- Along with Loxton, he was given 22 first-class opportunities with the bat, whereas the other eight frontline batsmen had at least 26 innings. Loxton scored 973 runs, while the others all scored more than 1,000. All of the batsmen other than Loxton averaged at least 47.30. and as Australia won many of their matches by an innings or by eight or more wickets, he seldom <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> the second innings. On four occasions, he was unbeaten when Australia either declared, reached their target or time ran out.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} major league debut on September 7, 2010, as a pinch hitter for Denard Span, {{striking}} out against Kansas City Royals' pitcher Jesse Chavez. He {{remained in the}} game, replacing Span in center field. He recorded his first major league run <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (RBI) on September 18, 2010, when he grounded out to score J. J. Hardy {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. He recorded his first major league hit a day later.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Davis led all MLB batters in {{home runs}} (53), runs <b>batted</b> <b>in</b> (138), extra-base hits (96), and total bases (370). His 53 home runs, 96 extra-base hits and 199 strikeouts all set new Orioles single-season records. In {{addition}} to these statistics, which were all career highs, he also set new career highs in games played (160), hits (167), doubles (42), runs scored (103), walks (72), stolen bases (4), batting average (.286), on-base percentage (.370), slugging percentage (.634), and OPS (1.004). In AL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting, Davis finished third behind Cabrera and Mike Trout, as the Orioles failed {{to return to the}} playoffs.|$|E
