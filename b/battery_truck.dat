40|$|The use of {{heavy-duty}} <b>battery</b> electric <b>trucks</b> for long-haul {{transportation is}} challenging {{because of the}} required high energy amounts and thus the high capacity of traction batteries. Furthermore a high capacity battery implies high initial costs for the electric vehicle. This study investigates the required battery capacity for <b>battery</b> electric <b>trucks</b> considering the requirements of long-haul transportation in Germany and compares the life cycle costs of <b>battery</b> electric <b>trucks</b> and conventional diesel trucks in different transportation scenarios. The average consumption is simulated for different <b>battery</b> electric <b>truck</b> configurations on the main German highways and transportation scenarios incorporating battery charging during driver rest periods. The results show that in average case the required battery would restrict the payload to only 80 % of a usual diesel truck payload that might be acceptable considering the statistical payload use. The life cycle costs in the examined scenarios also considering the charging infrastructure show that <b>battery</b> electric <b>trucks</b> can already perform on the same costs level as diesel trucks in certain scenarios...|$|R

5000|$|Truck stop {{electrification}} {{allows a}} trucker to “plug-in” to power their on and off-board electrical needs. There {{are two types}} of truck stop electrification, on-board and off-board systems. On board TSE solutions allow trucker’s the ability to recharge their <b>batteries</b> at <b>truck</b> stops via standard 120 Volt electrical outlets. Truckers can then utilize the <b>truck’s</b> <b>batteries</b> to power appliances and provide heating and cooling to the truck cab. Typically, on-board TSE solutions require some vehicle modification. Off-board TSE solutions do not typically require any vehicle modifications, as they provide heating and air conditioning services via an overhead unit and hose that connects to the truck’s window. In addition to heating and cooling, these connections can also offer standard electrical outlets, internet access, movies and satellite programming. [...] Normally, private companies provide and regulate either system and can charge an hourly rate for services, typically around $1.00-$2.00 an hour. [...] Both of these options can generate revenue for truck stop operators, and decrease operating expenses for truckers relative to the cost of diesel fuel. The cost of electricity to provide overnight power to trucks can save up to $3,240 of fuel that would normally be consumed by idling per parking space. Truck stop electrification can allow truck drivers to abide local idling regulations and reduce noise to neighboring establishments.|$|R

5000|$|During the Victorian era {{a number}} of factors led to large demand for cranes, {{particularly}} the number of major construction projects being undertaken and the large volumes of goods to lift in factories, railways and canals.Railways, docks, canals and construction sites used large numbers of small steam cranes, either mounted on quays or on railway wheels so they could be moved around site, usually four wheels but occasionally more for larger cranes. A number of local firms in Leeds produced quite similar designs with the jib and boiler counterbalanced around a tall column pivot. These very stable machines are often refared to as 'Leeds Type' cranes.Significant construction sites to use Booths cranes include the Tower Bridge, as this {{had a great deal of}} metal framework many cranes were required in its construction. The steam cranes used in the Tower Bridge construction have been included in scenes from the 2009 Sherlock Holmes film. One less successful project to employ Booths cranes was the Wembley Park Tower project. The Wembley Park Tower was meant to be London's rival to the Eiffel Tower in Paris but was however dogged by financial problems. In 1902 the Railway Magazine commented [...] "If the Wembley Tower Company could have raised the money as quickly as these cranes raised the girders, the growth of the tower would not have ceased so abruptly." [...] A less glamorous project was the Northern Outfall Sewer in London however company advertising of the time mentioned that their cranes could be seen at work here.Some larger rail mounted cranes were produced for the railways for use as breakdown cranes and in the Civil Engineering departments. A particularly well known examples of these being the ten 8 wheel cranes supplied to BR's Western Region in 1958/59 as these became well known to many railway modellers as a result of the kit that was available from Airfix, Booths helped Airfix produce this model by supplying various plans to the firm. Other railway civil engineering cranes include those used to build the Lower Zambezi BridgeFrom 1898 Booths were producing electrically powered cranes. Producing the motors in house the components were also put to use in other products. Booths produced battery locomotives for mines and industry under the 'Union' brandname. and <b>battery</b> <b>trucks</b> and tractors for factories.As well as complete cranes the company produced winches and hoists which found many uses in the factories of the timeFrom 1875 onwards Booths made large numbers of overhead cranes for use in factories. The Sultan of Morocco had a Booths crane and this was put to use lifting the stills used for the production of perfumes for the palace harem. In later years as the railways declined overhead cranes became the bulk of the business and sales of rail mounted cranes declined.|$|R

50|$|The middle {{nineteenth century}} {{through the early}} 20th century saw the {{developments}} that led to today's modern forklifts. The forerunners of the modern forklift were manually powered hoists {{that were used to}} lift loads. In 1906 the Pennsylvania Railroad introduced <b>battery</b> powered platform <b>trucks</b> for moving luggage at their Altoona, Pennsylvania train station. World War I saw the development of different types of material handling equipment in the United Kingdom by Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies of Ipswich. This was in part due to the labor shortages caused by the war. In 1917 Clark in the United States began developing and using powered tractor and powered lift tractors in their factories. In 1919 the Towmotor Company, and Yale & Towne Manufacturing in 1920, entered the lift truck market in the United States. Continuing development and expanded use of the forklift continued through the 1920s and 1930s. The introduction of hydraulic power and the development of the first electric power forklifts, along with the use of standardized pallets in the late 1930s, helped to increase the popularity of forklift trucks.|$|R
40|$|In modern {{heavy duty}} <b>trucks</b> the <b>battery</b> {{is a central}} component. Its {{traditional}} role as an energy source for engine cranking has been extended to include powering a number of elec- trical components on the truck, both during driving and during standstill. As a consequence of this {{it is important to}} know how much a battery in use has aged and lost in terms of ca- pacity and power output. The difficulty in measuring these factors on a battery in use causes problem, since heavy duty <b>truck</b> <b>batteries</b> are often replaced too early or too late, leading to unnecessary high replacement costs or truck standstill respectively. The overall goal of the effort, of which this thesis is a part, is to use a model of the cranking behaviour of a heavy duty truck engine, which depends on the battery condition, to estimate the ageing and wear of a heavy duty <b>truck</b> <b>battery.</b> This thesis proposes a modelling approach to model the components involved in engine cranking. In the thesis work, system identification is made of the systems forming part of the cranking of a heavy duty truck engine. These components are the starter battery, the starter motor and its electrical circuit and the internal combustion engine. Measurement data has been provided by Scania AB for the evaluation of the models. The data has been collected from crankings of a heavy duty diesel engine at different temperatures and battery charge levels. For every cranking lapse the battery voltage and current have been measured as well as the engine rotational speed. A starter battery model is developed and evaluated. The resulting battery model is then incorporated into two different engine cranking models, Model 1 and Model 2, including a starter motor model and an internal combustion engine model apart form the battery model. The two cranking models differ in several aspects and their differences and resulting evalu- ations are discussed. The battery model is concluded to be sufficiently accurate during model verification, however the two cranking models are not. Model 2 is verified as more correct in in its output than Model 1, but neither is sufficiently accurate for their purpose. The conclusion is drawn that the modelling approach is sound but development of Model 2 is needed before the model can be used in model-based condition estimation. ...|$|R

Issues associated with the increasing power requirements of the distribution center operation, along with high ambient temperature {{in the summer and}} other operating conditions (such as air quality and floor surface condition), surfaced opportunities for improving Nuvera’s PowerEdge fuel cell system design in high-throughput forklift environments. The project included on-site generation of hydrogen from a steam methane reformer, called PowerTap™ manufactured by Nuvera. The hydrogen was generated, compressed and stored in equipment located outside H-E-B’s facility, and provided to the forklifts by hydrogen dispensers located in high forklift traffic areas. The PowerEdge fuel cell units logged over 25, 300 operating hours {{over the course of the}} two-year project period. The PowerTap hydrogen generator produced more than 11, 100 kg of hydrogen over the same period. Hydrogen availability at the pump was 99. 9 %.

Carrying heavy batteries reduces the payload and therefore complicates the financial feasibility of electric propulsion with batteries. Analysis of the container flows at the port area of Rotterdam has shown a big difference based on distance, closed track or open road, type of energy, and energy distribution. In terms of organization, five different situations can be distinguished: (i) Central Exchange Route (CER), (ii) Inter-terminal, (iii) DCs (Distribution Centres) in HIC, (iv) (intermodal) inland terminals in the Netherlands and (v) the long-distance transport. The CER proves to be an ideal solution to start the introduction of zero emission AGTs. In terms of innovative technology all lights for actual implementation have been switched into green. However, the major challenge now emerging at the Port of Rotterdam is how to mobilize all key stakeholders {{in such a way that}} the estimated benefits outweigh estimated costs and really leads to the implementation of this new autonomous and zero emission system in practice.
