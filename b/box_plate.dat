50|$|The Victoria Bridge over Nepean River, officially {{known as}} The Nepean Bridge, is a wrought iron <b>box</b> <b>plate</b> girder bridge that crosses the Nepean River at Penrith {{in the western}} suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales Australia. Completed in 1867 under the {{supervision}} of John Whitton, the Engineer-in-Chief of New South Wales Government Railways, the bridge initially carried rail and horse-drawn traffic, and was converted in 1907 to exclusively carry the Great Western Highway. The bridge is managed by Roads and Maritime Services and is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E
5000|$|The XV Corps' badge was {{a shield}} with a {{cartridge}} {{box in the}} middle with the Corps motto [...] "40 Rounds." [...] The badge and motto originated from the Western XV Corps' rivalry with the eastern XII Corps. When the Western and Eastern soldiers finally met up near Chattanooga in late 1863, the XI and XII Corps soldiers bragged about their crescent and star-shaped corps badges. When asked what badge the XV Corps had (The XV Corps did not have one yet at the time), an Irish soldier of the XV Corps said, [...] "Moon and stars is it? Sure it was the light of both ye needed to find your way home from Chancellorsville!" [...] (The XI Corps had been routed at that battle) whereupon he slapped his cartridge box and said, [...] "Corps badge? This is the badge of the Fifteenth Corps; 40 rounds!" [...] This saying eventually reached the ears of General Logan. He soon sent out the following circular to his men: [...] 'The following is announced as the badge of this corps: A miniature cartridge box, black, set transversely on a field of cloth or metal: above the cartridge <b>box</b> <b>plate</b> will be stamped or marked in a curve, the motto [...] "Forty Rounds".' ...|$|E

40|$|Geosynthetic {{separation}} boxes {{made from}} recycled polymeric materials were designed to increase the waste landfill amount and develop the hydraulic performance in steep slope sides in the waste landfills. To evaluate the advantages of these geosynthetic separation boxes, index tests were conducted in order to compare the geonet composites and geosynthetic separation boxes. The tensile strength retention of the geosynthetic separation <b>box</b> <b>plates</b> exposed to UV light and leachate solutions was better {{than that of the}} geonet composites. The drainage performance of the geosynthetic separation boxes was compared with that of the geonet composites at a slope angle corresponding to a real waste landfill site. The drainage performance of the geosynthetic separation <b>box</b> <b>plates</b> was better than that of the geonet composites...|$|R

40|$|Deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH) is a dinuclear iron enzyme {{required}} for hydroxylation of the aminobutyl side chain of deoxyhypusine in eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 A (eIF- 5 A), {{the second step}} in hypusine biosynthesis. DOHH has been recently identified in P. falciparum and P. vivax. Both enzymes have very peculiar features including E–Z type HEAT-like repeats and a diiron centre in their active site. Both proteins share only 26 % amino acid identity to the human paralogue. Hitherto, no X-ray structure exists from either enzyme. However, structural predictions based on the amino acid sequence of the active site {{in comparison to the}} human enzyme show that four conserved histidine and glutamate residues provide the coordination sites for chelating the ferrous iron ions. Recently, we showed that P. vivax DOHH is inhibited by zileuton (N-[1 -(1 -benzothien- 2 -yl) ethyl]-N-hydroxyurea), a drug that is known for inhibiting human 5 -lipoygenase (5 -LOX) by the complexation of ferrous iron. A novel discovery program was launched to identify inhibitors of the P. falciparum DOHH from the Malaria Box, consisting of 400 chemical compounds, which are highly active in the erythrocytic stages of Malaria infections. In a first visual selection for potential ligands of ferrous iron, three compounds from different scaffold classes namely the diazonapthyl benzimidazole MMV 666023 (Malaria <b>Box</b> <b>plate</b> A, position A 03), the bis-benzimidazole MMV 007384 (plate A, position B 08), and a 1, 2, 5,-oxadiazole MMV 665805 (plate A, position C 03) were selected and subsequently evaluated in silico for their potential to complex iron ions. As a proof of principle, a bioanalytical assay was performed and the inhibition of hypusine biosynthesis was determined by GC–MS. All tested compounds proved to be active in this assay and MMV 665805 exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect. Notably, the results were in accordance with the preliminary quantum–mechanical calculations suggesting the strongest iron complexation capacity for MMV 665805. This compound might be a useful tool as well as a novel lead structure for inhibitors of P. falciparum DOHH...|$|E
40|$|The work {{deals with}} a few {{different}} ideas and phenomena. Among them are ambiguity, illusion, anti-illusion, the future, present, past, people (their effects, invisible and otherwise), comfort, discomfort, uncertainty, unexpectancy, states of mind, natural phenomena (magnetism, gravity, light), chaos, life, art/non-art, and questions. The pieces have no titles. I wanted to leave them open and uncertain. The work involves no one style. Someone said they saw art as an open spot in society [...] a free spot where anything could happen [...] I believe this. No statements. The invisible forces manifested in the pieces with magnets (plates 1 & 2) are the main interests of those works. The magical qualities of the forces and their characteristics of either holding things together or pulling them apart are part of it, however, I also see them as an analogy of the forces people or things exert on one another. The television (plate 3) {{is a continuation of}} this phenomenon. The way one effects the T. V. by one's position to it expresses this. I taped off two areas and by standing in one of these areas or the other one could create either a clear picture on the television screen or a distorted one. I also see the T. V. work on other levels. One is that it acts as a very strong symbol, perhaps for a generation or perhaps for a segment of America. Another level is its expression of the idea of something happening miles away being simultaneously viewed somewhere else. In other words, when viewed this way it expresses the idea of bringing an action or something happening outside, to view inside. The light <b>box</b> (<b>plate</b> 5) functions as a visual experience. The piece was built to be walked into. Inside it is completely dark except for 1 / 16 inch holes drilled two inches apart that run diagonally across all four walls. A viewer could receive a number of experiences once inside. They range from total perception loss and imbalance to a serene and spacious feeling. (See more in text...|$|E

5000|$|Wedgwood {{began to}} {{manufacture}} majolica {{about ten years}} after Mintons. Wedgwood's glazes and modelling were denser and more formal than Minton's, but there were many pieces that displayed the naturalism and humour of Minton shapes. Wedgwood's majolica included cachepots, jugs, candlesticks, cheese bells, umbrella stands, sardine <b>boxes,</b> <b>plates</b> in naturalistic patterns, bread trays, etc. In Wedgwood's [...] "greenware" [...] the green glaze emphasizes the low relief patterning, typically of basketwork and foliage. Numerous smaller factories in the Staffordshire Potteries specialised in such green majolica wares in which the translucent glaze brought out the low relief of the cast body: some, like Wedgwood, marked their majolica with impressed stamps.|$|R

50|$|Again, {{as part of}} {{the major}} {{refurbishment}} scheme of the Class 37 locomotives in the 1980s, another freight dedicated fleet of 44 Class 37s was created; the Class 37/7 subclass which was very similar to the 37/5 subclass except for plating over of a bodyside window and the addition of a ballast weight to give extra 'pulling power' when hauling heavy freight trains such as the metals trains in South Wales. Again, like the 37/5s, there were two batches completed; from phase 1 and phase 2 Class 37/0 locos. The batch numbered 37701 upwards were from phase 1 build locos and have the flush front ends and the batch numbered from 37899 downwards were rebuilds from phase 2 locos, having the central headcode <b>box</b> (<b>plated</b> over).
