At every LBO, copmanies make different values of the target company to finally come upp to a final bid. The final bid may in many cases be made of a surplus value, which is the differens between the value of the net-assets and the final bid. This we call goodwill and it has been a target in many discussions. Goodwill is valued by a subjective judgment about how much you think the comapny will be able to generate in future synergies by a purchase of the target company. Today, there is no limit on how much goodwill company may disclose, which makes goodwill affect business in a more cunstructive way. Problem: "How much of a company's total assets consist of goodwill, and how will the company be affected if you take away the goodwill as an asset"? Purpose: The study aims to provide insight and understanding of goodwill. From different perspectives goodwill will be studied and described, about how this intangible asset affects companies. Method: A comparative study has been carried out, where only written sources, secondary data have been used. A quantitative method has been chosen.

Pressure reducing stations (PRSs) equipped by either pressure reducing valves or motor driven regulating valves are commonly used to dissipate excess hydraulic head in WDNs. An integrated new technical solution with economic and system flexibility benefits is presented which replaces PRSs with pumps used as turbines (PATs). Optimal PAT performance is obtained by a Variable Operating Strategy (VOS), recently developed for the design of small hydropower plants on the basis of valve time operation, and net return determined by both energy production and savings through minimizing leakage. The literature values of both leakages costs and energy tariffs are used to develop a <b>buisness</b> plan model and evaluate the economic benefit of small hydropower plants equipped with PATs.

Australian Bureau of Statistics “journey to work ” data from 1996 revealed that 801 people were riding to work compared to 85, 000 people travelling by car.

In his thesis Lars Hansson studies how class relations were shaped and transformed within this rural industry. The producer co-operative slaughter associations consisted {{of a large number of}} members from smallholders to large scale agrarian producers. The power of the associations was concentrated in the hands of the big producers, but the manangers also had a considerable power, due to their expert knowledge of the <b>buisness</b> and the bacon markets in U. K. The workers of the producer co-operative slaughter houses were mostly unskilled workers, with little or no knowledge of butchering. From the 1910 ’s the workers unionized but their organisation was not accepted by the employers and harsh labour disputes took place during the 1920 ’s. From the 1930 ’s the farmers producer co-operative movement grew all over Sweden and they formed a political alliance with the Social democratic Party. The Swedish labour market became more peaceful as the employers and the unions began to co-operate to a greater extent. The Food Workers Union was more and more integrated in the Swedish society and thereby lost its earlier antisystemic character and were more and more transformed into a systemic movement.

40|$|An {{important}} factor of regional development is innovative process. The innovations include new products, new technologies, {{new ways of}} commercial use of goods, conquering of new markets, new sources of raw materials and other qualitative trahsformations which can change current economic situation. Now they become the basic <b>buisness</b> strategies, main sources of welfare and development in which knowledge and social capital create the competitive advatages of regions more than their natural resources. The main methodological problem of modeling such processes {{is that they are}} incorporated into real picture of development whereas it is necessary to separate them from other processes to perform their fruitful analysis, in particular to compare the related costs with the total resulted effect. Our approach to solve this problem is to modify a familiar previously created model without innovations via addition a special submodel which describe visually the innovative processes, as favorable change of originally constant model parameters. The main difficulty arise when we attempt to present strictly the dynamics of great amount of the original model parameters (about square of the number of original variables). To overcome this difficulty the opportunity of aggregative description of innovative block with different levels of aggregation variable is provided. The modified model structure becomes essentially nonlinear and does not allow to apply strictly the special high effective optimization method which make use of lineariyies in the original model. For this reason a multistep optimization procedure is developed where optimization of the original model with given parameters is accompanied by their inprovement on account of control in the innovative submodel. The approach proposed is demonstrated by concrete application to Pereslavl region of Russia. ...|$|E

Communities, networks and the developments in information communication technologies have enabled the average consumer to become {{an active participant in}} creating and recreating value. This thesis identified three categories of the Web 2. 0 environment Open Source, social networks and blogs to illustrate that valuable information exists in these platforms. This information {{is at the core of}} the collaboration activities and provides opportunities to develop competence in market knowledge. New ways of doing research and creating dialogue are needed in these collaborative platforms. This thesis reports on the five studies conducted in the Web 2. 0 environment and the impact on collaboration and communication with the market. In the first instance, the nature of Open Source projects creates opportunities for organizations to collaborate and create value. Secondly, networks provide organizations with valuable information specifically with regards to structure and relationships. Lastly, this thesis discusses the importance of learning about blogs and the collaborative nature of these tools by including the perceptions of both blog readers and bloggers. Furthermore organizations need to understand the structure of such tools in order to leverage on its collaborative capabilities. The thesis concludes with the insights gained from these issues to provide organizations the opportunity to listen to the voice of the market in an attempt to optimize on the opportunities that exist.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} a simple model of the capitalist economy that generates business cycles in an endogenous manner. Embedded relationships that permeate the interaction modes of economic agents are shown to be responsible for this characteristic macrodynamic phenomenon of market economies. These relationships are competing claims on income, the dual nature of the wage-profit relation, and the dependence of investment on profits. These relationships constitute institutional barriers within the market economy that prevent the attainment of full employment and equilibrium predicted by neoclassical theory. In the next section, a discussion of Marx's theory of the business cycle is presented. More attention is given to the reserve army of labor variant of Marx's cycle theory because it provides the link between labor market conditions and profits in the economy. Following that a theoretical review of the Keynesian vs. classical assumptions on the wage-profit relationship is presented. This paper argues, following recent macroeconomic models (Bowles and Boyer 1991; Marglin and Bhaduri 1991; Sherman 1991) that the capitalist economy generates an asymmetric macroeconomic regime structure. The macroeconomic regime, depending on employment or output levels, can be in either a cooperative Keynesian regime or a conflict-ridden Marxian regime.

A Classical-Keynesian Model of Macroeconomic Fluctuations 13 further argues that this asymmetric structure is produced by the nonlinearity of the wage-profit relation. The paper develops a nonlinear business cycle model that takes into account this nonlinearity and the dependence of investment on profits. The model is shown to produce business cycle solutions endogenously. PublishedN/...|$|E
