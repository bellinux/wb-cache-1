40|$|Abstract. An {{action of}} a Lie algebra g on a {{manifold}} M {{is just a}} Lie algebra homomorphism ζ: g → X(M). We define orbits for such an action. In general the space of orbits M/g is not a manifold and even has a bad topology. Nevertheless for a g-manifold with equidimensional orbits we treat such notions as connection, curvature, covariant differentiation, Bianchi identity, parallel transport, basic differential forms, basic cohomology, and characteristic classes, which generalize the corresponding notions for principal G-bundles. As one of the applications, we derive a sufficient condition for the projection M → M/g to be a bundle associated to a principal <b>bundle.</b> <b>Table</b> of contents 1.

[2003], [2008], [2009]; Bashir et al. [2006]; Ishimaru et al. [2006]; Lee et al. [2009]; Nozoye et al. [2011]; Ogo et al. [2014]), where they are thought to be involved in Fe transport to shoot tissues. DMA has been detected in rice xylem and phloem sap (Mori et al. [1991]; Kakei et al. [2009]). Moreover, the Fe(III)-DMA complex has been identified as the primary chemical form of Fe in phloem sap (Nishiyama et al. [2012]). These findings indicate that DMA is responsible not only for Fe uptake from the rhizosphere, but also for internal Fe translocation. OsYSL 15 and OsYSL 16 are expressed in vascular bundles, where they are thought to transport Fe(III)-DMA for phloem Fe transport (Inoue et al. [2009]; Lee et al. [2009], [2012]; Kakei et al.

40|$|Cross-match {{spatially}} {{clusters and}} organizes several astronomical point-source measurements {{from one or}} more surveys. Ideally, each object would be found in each survey. Unfortunately, the observation conditions and the objects themselves change continually. Even some stationary objects are missing in some observations; sometimes objects have a variable light flux and sometimes the seeing is worse. In most cases {{we are faced with}} a substantial number of differences in object detections between surveys and between observations taken at different times within the same survey or instrument. Dealing with such missing observations is a difficult problem. The first step is to classify misses as ephemeral - when the object moved or simply disappeared, masked - when noise hid or corrupted the object observation, or edge - when the object was {{near the edge of the}} observational field. This classification and a spatial library to represent and manipulate observational footprints help construct a Match table recording both hits and misses. Transitive closure clusters friends-of-friends into object bundles. The bundle summary statistics are recorded in a <b>Bundle</b> <b>table.</b> This design is an evolution of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey cross-match design that compared overlapping observations taken at different times.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{long-term}} changes in homogamy during industrialization are studied. According to the `sexual revolution thesis' of Shorter industrialization weakened homogamy mainly {{by changing the}} preferences of young people. Others point {{to the importance of}} changes in social control by parents and peers and in the opportunities of potential marriage partners to meet. Both ethnographic data on <b>bundling</b> and <b>tables</b> of occupational homogamy in Sweden in the nineteenth century are used to describe changes in homogamy and to shed light on potential causes of these changes. In particular it is tested whether homogamy weakened during industrialization and whether homogamy was weaker when parental control was less, {{as is the case with}} one parent families. The second claim was substantiated, the first claim only very partially so. Bundling with its clearly marked stages from communal nightly visits to intercourse as a prelude to marriage declined, but the proportion of men and women marrying outside their class did not rise consistently over time as industrialization progressed. Even after taking changing group sizes into account, there were no signs of decreasing homogamy. Thus the data do not support Shorter's theory of an increase in romantic love. ...|$|R

He is now seen to be a stout, tall man between forty and fifty, clean shaven, with a midnight oil pallor emphasized by stiff black hair, cropped short and oiled, and eyebrows like early Victorian horsehair upholstery. Physically and spiritually, a coarsened man: in cunning and logic, a ruthlessly sharpened one.

40|$|Linguistic usage {{patterns}} {{are not just}} coincidental phenomena on the textual surface but constitute a fundamental constructional principle of language. At the same time, however, linguistic patterns are highly idiosyncratic {{in the sense that}} they tend to be item-specific and unpredictable, thus defying all attempts at capturing them by general abstract rules. […] What all these approaches [that deal with constructions, collocations, patterns, etc. K. S. ] share, in addition to their interest in recurrent patterns, is a strong commitment to the value of usage, be it in the wider sense of usage as an empirical basis for sound linguistic analysis and description or in the narrower sense of usage as constituting the basis for the emergence and consolidation of linguistic knowledge. (Herbst et al. 2014 : 1) In consequence of the feasibility of studying language data in new quantitative dimensions, the phraseology faces a paradigm shift. The traditional focus on strongly lexicalized, often idiomatic multi-word expressions (MWE) has led to an overestimation of their unique status in the mental lexicon. The majority of MWEs are typical lexical realisations of templates (‘MW patterns’) that emerged from repeated usage and can be instantiated with ever changing lexical elements. The – primarily functional – pattern restrictions cannot always be predicted with rules, but are the result of recurring context factors. In this article, at first, it has been shown the nature and the interrelations of MW patterns that are reconstructed with complex corpus-driven methods. Furthermore, a vision of a new phraseography of MW pattern that described their hierarchies and functions based on authentic corpus data like KWIC <b>bundles,</b> slot filler <b>tables</b> and collocation profiles has been discussed...|$|R
