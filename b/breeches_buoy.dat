Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the external scenic elevator allowing twelve people, including Mueller, the children, and a fireman one trip down, with the remaining eight being ladies chosen by lottery, including Roberts' girlfriend Susan. An explosion leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, where Mueller falls to her death. A Navy helicopter saves the rest.|$|E

While {{alongside}} New Orleans to refuel two days later, Aylwin rigged <b>breeches</b> <b>buoys</b> forward and aft, and took on board 37 officers and 92 enlisted men from Lexington and one Yorktown pilot, Lt. (jg.) E. S. McCuskey, of VF-2, who would later become an [...] "ace" [...] in the Battle of Midway. The destroyer cast off and resumed her screening duties.|$|R
25|$|On 5 February 1896 the Lamington, hauling {{fruit from}} Valencia, Spain to New York City ran aground 15 {{miles east of}} the Fire Island Lighthouse. Life saving crews from the Coast Guard Stations at Blue Point, Lone Hill and Bellport were able to rescue much of her crew from the wreck using <b>breeches</b> <b>buoys</b> on the first day. Salvage {{operations}} began almost immediately by men and tugs from the Merritt Wrecking Company, which likely kept her from breaking up during a storm that swept waves in over the deck and pushed her farther inland. At the first break in the storm the remaining crew, and one small Spanish pony, were rescued. After her cargo was removed, she was refloated on 26 February and towed to New York.|$|R
25|$|In {{heavy seas}} on 8 July 1948 a French steamer {{by the name}} of Francois Tixier Bound from Goole to the French inland port of Rouen, got into {{difficulties}} of the north Norfolk coast four miles (6km) off Sheringham. The steamer was laden with a cargo of coal and in worsening gale she capsized. With the Sheringham lifeboat undergoing a refit at Oulton Broad, Henry Blogg was launched to the steamer's aid and stood by. With the Francois Tixier heavily listing on the port the lifeboat went alongside but the captain and his crew refused to leave the stricken vessel. Despite the attempts by the crew to secure the cargo, it shifted further to port. With their failed attempts to steady the vessel the captain and crew agreed to leave their ship. One crew man jumped into the water and was rescued; another reached the lifeboat by rope passed between the boats. Using a <b>Breeches</b> <b>buoy,</b> eight more of the crew were rescued. After the eleventh crewman was rescued using the <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> the stricken steamer rolled over and began to sink. The last five remaining crew scrambled on to the stern and as the steamer slipped below the waves they scrambled on to a raft and were picked up by the lifeboat shortly after. The sixteen rescued French seaman were landed at Great Yarmouth by the Henry Blogg. In recognition of their efforts Coxswain Henry Davies and his crew were presented with awards by the French government.|$|E
25|$|On 20 January 1966, a Force 8 gale blew up and Mi Amigos anchors {{broke and}} the ship started to drift. This went unnoticed by the crew, who were {{watching}} a programme about the singer-songwriter Donovan, broadcasting having ended. The final song played that night had been Eve of Destruction by Barry McGuire. Dave Lee Travis went aloft to adjust the TV aerial and noticed that the ship was close to shore. He was also unable to see the Radio London ship Galaxy. Walton-on-the-Naze Coastguards were unable to raise the crew, and the tender Offshore One was sent to her aid. One of the methods of alerting the crew tried was an item on the television news. This was missed by the crew as they had turned the television off as they had lost the signal due to the ship moving from its normal position. Mi Amigo was driven ashore at Frinton-on-Sea, Essex and the crew were rescued by <b>Breeches</b> <b>buoy.</b>|$|E
500|$|The next day, as {{the seas}} {{battered}} {{the ship and}} drove her farther on the rocks, two Coast Guard boats took 31 men from the ship. American-Hawaiian announced that a Los Angeles salvage firm had been hired to retrieve the [...] cargo, which included explosives and oil. Two heavy-duty electric pumps were lowered to the ship via the <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy,</b> and plans were drawn up for connecting them to the San Francisco municipal electric system in order to pump out the ship.|$|E
50|$|After {{the boat}} had been rowed to within 50 ft of the listing Florida, Manning had a line thrown {{across to the}} eager crew of the distressed {{freighter}} One by one, the 32 men from the Italian ship came across the rope. By the time the last of them, the ship's captain, had been dragged on board the pitching lifeboat, the winds had reached gale force, with violent snow and rain squalls, with a high, rough, sea running. Then, via ladders, ropes, cargo nets, and two homemade <b>breeches</b> <b>buoys,</b> sailors on board America brought up Florida's survivors, until all 32 were safe and sound. Finally, they pulled their shipmates from the rescue party back on board. Chief Officer Manning was brought up last. Captain Fried {{felt that it was}} highly dangerous to attempt to hoist the number one lifeboat on board and, rather than risk lives, ordered it cut adrift.|$|R
5000|$|The CLSS {{was later}} renamed the Coast and Cliff Rescue Service (CCRS). In 1979 there were 54 stations, 51 {{equipped}} with <b>breeches</b> <b>buoys</b> and three only with ladders for cliff rescue. A 1990 inquiry into air sea rescue chaired by retired Garda Commissioner Eamonn Doherty recommended transferring responsibility from the Irish Air Corps {{to a new}} emergency service. The then government accepted the recommendation in August 1990, and the service {{was established in the}} then Department of the Marine by minister Michael Woods in May 1991 under the name [...] "Slánú — The Irish Marine Emergency Service" [...] (IMES), and subsumed the CCRS. In February 2000 the name was changed to the Irish Coast Guard in accordance with the wishes of many of its personnel. The spelling [...] "Coast Guard" [...] (as opposed to [...] "Coastguard") is intended to hark back to its nineteenth-century origins; the British Coastguard adopted the single-word spelling in 1925, after the Free State had separated.|$|R
5000|$|Rescue {{attempts}} promptly {{followed the}} accident. Local ranchers, who were alerted by the commotion of the disaster, rigged up <b>breeches</b> <b>buoys</b> {{from the surrounding}} clifftops and lowered {{them down to the}} ships that had run aground. Fishermen nearby who had seen the tragedy picked up members of the crew from USS Fuller and USS Woodbury. The crew aboard the capsized Young was able to climb to safety on the nearby USS Chauncey via a lifeline. The four destroyers in Destroyer Squadron Eleven that avoided running aground at Honda Point were also able to contribute to rescue efforts by picking up sailors who had been thrown into the water and by assisting those who were stuck aboard the wreckage of other ships. After the disaster, the government did not attempt to salvage any of the wrecks at Honda Point {{due to the nature of}} the damage each ship sustained. The wrecks themselves, along with the equipment that remained on them, were sold to a scrap merchant for a total of $1,035. [...] The wrecked ships were still not moved by late August 1929 for they may be clearly seen in film footage taken from the German airship Graf Zeppelin as she headed towards Los Angeles on her circumnavigation of the globe; the film footage is used in the documentary film Farewell (2009).|$|R
500|$|The {{crowds of}} onlookers {{continued}} {{to watch as}} salvage efforts progressed; a 75-year-old woman from Oakland fell down the embankment while watching the action on 13 October. The mayor of San Francisco, Angelo J. Rossi, rode the <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> to the ship and toured it for 45 minutes on 19 October. On 22 October, the Los Angeles Times ran an Associated Press story saying that marine experts were considering {{the use of a}} method first patented by Abraham Lincoln in May 1849 in order to re-float the stranded ship. All efforts, however, were unsuccessful, and by 31 October, American-Hawaiian placed an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times requesting bids for the purchase of the ship and her cargo [...] "as and where she now lies ... on the rocks near Point Lobos, San Francisco". E. J. Mitchell was the winning bidder, securing rights to the ship and its cargo for $2,800.|$|E
500|$|In {{early morning}} hours of 8 October 1936, however, Ohioan ran aground near Seal Rock on the south shore of the Golden Gate, just outside San Francisco Bay. The ship, sailing in a dense fog, strayed too close to shore and {{grounded}} on the rocks, sending a shower of sparks that lit up the night. When the fog cleared later in the morning, the ship was firmly seated on the rocks {{at the base of a}} [...] cliff, and some [...] from the mainland. Coast Guardsmen on shore attached three lines to the ship and set up a <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> to take off the harbor pilot, but the crew stayed on board the ship in hopes that the high tide would free her from the rocky perch. As word of the shipwreck spread, spectators clambered over the cliff to get a view of the scene; one man died from a heart attack and two women broke ankles in separate falls. Newsboys soon arrived on the scene, selling newspapers telling of Ohioans woe within sight of the stranded ship. Policemen were called out to keep order as the crowd grew into the thousands.|$|E

6000|$|When {{it arrives}} at the wreck the order is, [...] "Women first." [...] But the women are too terrified, it may be, to venture. Can you wonder? If you saw the boiling surf the heaving water, the roaring and rushing waves, with black and jagged rocks showing here and there, over which, and partly through which, {{they are to be}} dragged, you would respect their fears. They shrink back: they even resist. So the captain orders a 'prentice boy to jump in and set them the example. He is a fine, {{handsome}} boy, with curly brown hair and bright black eyes. He, too, hesitates for a moment, but from a far different motive. If left to himself he would emulate the captain in being that proverbial [...] "last man to quit the wreck," [...] but a peremptory order is given, and, with a blush, he jumps into the bag, or <b>breeches,</b> of the <b>buoy,</b> through which his legs project in a somewhat ridiculous manner. A signal is then made to the shore. The coastguardsmen haul on the whip, and off goes our 'prentice boy like a seagull. His flight is pretty rapid, considering all things. When about half-way to land he is seen dimly in the mist of spray that bursts wildly around and over him. Those on the wreck strain their eyes and watch with palpitating hearts. The ship has been rolling a little. Just then it gives a heavy lurch shoreward, the rope slackens, and down goes our 'prentice boy into the raging sea, which seems to roar louder as if in triumph! It is but for a moment, however. The double-block tackle, already mentioned as being attached to the shore-end of the hawser, is manned by strong active fellows, whose duty it is to ease off the rope when the wreck rolls seaward, and haul it in when she rolls shoreward, thus keeping it always pretty taut without the risk of snapping it.|$|R
2500|$|Combined with {{efforts of}} the ship's crew, 8 of the 17 persons aboard were saved using several methods {{including}} a <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> {{before it was too}} dark to continue. Johanne Jørgensen, the pregnant young wife of Captain Jørgen M. Jørgensen, and their 4-year-old son Carl Zealand Jørgensen, were among those who drowned in a final escape attempt as the ship broke up. One more sailor survived, but other five sailors were also drowned. The Captain was somehow spared and washed ashore semi-conscious, but still alive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with a Dobbins type lifeboat and a McClelland surfboat, which were launched into the surf from a four-wheel hand or horse-drawn carriage. [...] The station was also equipped {{with a variety of}} rescue equipment, including the Lyle gun, the <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy,</b> and Coston flares. [...] At times, surfmen rode horses to patrol the beaches [...] The station could call upon the assistance of a seaside railroad, the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, to move rescue boats up and down the beach to get closer to a wreck before launching.|$|E
2500|$|On 17 November 1962 the [...] Louisa Ann Hawker was {{launched}} in a northerly gale to assist the Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker Green Ranger which had broken free from her tug and run aground on rocks near Hartland Point. While the lifeboat found the tanker they could not find any of her crew. The lifeboat stood by for some time until {{it became clear that}} the crew had already been saved by <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy,</b> so it returned through the dangerous waters at the estuary mouth to its berth by the boat house. Despite not saving anyone, the RNLI awarded Sidney Cann, the coxswain, a Silver Medal for his work in extremely difficult seas that night.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{a dog that}} {{is thought to have}} been a Newfoundland saved 92 people who were on the SS Ethie which was wrecked off of the Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland during a blizzard. The dog {{retrieved}} a rope thrown out into the turbulent waters by those on deck, and brought the rope to shore to people waiting on the beach. A <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> was attached to the rope, and all those aboard the ship were able to get across to the shore including an infant in a mailbag. Wreckage of the ship can still be seen in Gros Morne National Park. E. J. Pratt's poem, [...] "Carlo", in the November 1920 issue of The Canadian Forum commemorates this dog.|$|E
2500|$|With the dawn, the Star of Bengals crew {{realized}} how dangerous the ship's position was, just [...] from the rocky beach of Coronation Island, barely held by her anchors amidst the storm. By 7:00a.m., the wind turned into gale, reaching [...] With no tugs in sight, the crew started {{preparing for the}} worst. All men aboard received life-preservers, however most of the Chinese passengers did not put them on. Captain Wagner called for volunteers who would attempt to reach the shore in a lifeboat to secure a line on the shore in order to evacuate the passengers with a <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy.</b> The crew dumped oil into the sea to calm down the waves, but the first attempt to lower a lifeboat failed, as it immediately smashed into pieces.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{attempt to}} lower the boat was successful, and manned by four {{volunteer}}s, the boat reached the shore and broke into pieces on the impact with the rocky beach. All four men survived the crash, and by 9:00a.m. they managed to secure a rope from the Star of Bengal to a tree. The donkey boiler was used to keep the rope strained. However, as another volunteer was climbing along the rope with the <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy,</b> the ship's anchors finally gave in to the storm. The rope became unstable and unsuitable for evacuation, and the volunteer was slingshot [...] {{into the air and}} killed as he landed on the ship's deck. At 9:32a.m. the ship struck the rocks. During the next 54 minutes, the ship's hull broke in three pieces, and she sank at [...] with just her mizzen topmast visible above water.|$|E
2500|$|The Vigili del Fuoco di Genova ("Genovese Fire Service") ashore fired a <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> {{from the}} mole to the midships {{accommodation}} block. This was made fast on the ship, and the firemen hauled three Indian crewmen to safety. Captain Muir persuaded his wife Dorothy to go next, but the buoy jammed and flung Mrs Muir from the harness {{to her death}} on the rocks below. Some sources suggest that {{the breaking of the}} ship into two coincided with the fire service's attempt to winch Mrs Muir to safety, that this caused the breeches buoy's [...] nylon rope to flex and this was what caused it first to jam and then to fling Mrs Muir onto the rocks. A fireman, Giuliano Macchi, tried several times to reach her but without success. Captain Muir leapt after his wife into the sea. He was later seen in the water with one leg seriously injured, and then was not seen again.|$|E
2500|$|By 09:00 on 25 October, {{the wind}} was rising towards gale strength. [...] Ledbetter was having {{difficulty}} keeping Cedar on station, and the smaller rescue boats that had run for shelter {{on the evening of}} the 24th were unable to return to the reef. [...] Ledbetter decided he would try to anchor Cedar about 500 yards downwind of the reef, shoot a line to Sophia (possibly using a Lyle gun), and then evacuate the passengers by <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy.</b> [...] This would have been extremely hazardous {{and it would have been}} unlikely that over 300 people could be removed by this method, but it seemed the only thing that could be done. [...] Ledbetter twice tried to drop anchor, but each time it failed to catch on the bottom. [...] Locke could see this effort was failing, and radioed to Ledbetter that it was no use, they would have to wait for low tide when perhaps conditions might be better. [...] There was nothing else that could be done.|$|E
2500|$|One bomb {{struck the}} flight deck centerline, {{penetrating}} to the hangar deck, causing destruction and igniting fires through {{the second and third}} decks, and knocking out the Combat Information Center and air plot. The second hit aft, tearing through two decks. At the time she was struck, Franklin had 31 armed and fueled aircraft warming up on her flight deck. The hangar deck contained planes, of which 16 were fueled and five were armed. [...] The forward gasoline system had been secured, but the aft system was operating. The explosion on the hangar deck ignited the fuel tanks on the aircraft, and gasoline vapor explosion devastated the deck. Only two crewmen survived the fire. The explosion also jumbled aircraft together on {{the flight deck}} above, causing further fires and explosions and detonating 12 [...] "Tiny Tim" [...] air-to-surface rockets. Franklin was dead in the water, without radio communications, and broiling in the heat from enveloping fires. On the bridge, Captain Gehres ordered Franklin's magazines flooded but this could not be carried out as the ship's water mains were destroyed by the explosions or fire. Admiral Ralph Davison transferred his flag to the destroyer USS Miller by <b>breeches</b> <b>buoy</b> and suggested abandoning ship, but Gehres refused to scuttle the Franklin as there were still many men alive below deck.|$|E

Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, señorita.
