40|$|The {{bluntnose sixgill shark}} Hexanchus griseus, predominately a deep-water species (maximum depth: 2500 m), was {{captured}} approximately 30 km up a river on a <b>bottom-set</b> <b>longline.</b> Although this species has previously been reported moving into shallow waters at night in {{other regions of the}} world, this is the first confirmed report of a sixgill shark in a river...|$|E
40|$|Carcharhinus isodon (finetooth shark) is a migratory shark {{found in}} coastal {{waters of the}} southeastern United States and is well {{documented}} {{in the waters of}} north Florida in both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. The southernmost reports are from Lemon Bay (27 °N), just north of Charlotte Harbor on the west coast and from Port Salerno (27 °N) on the east coast. Four C. isodon were captured on <b>bottom-set</b> <b>longline</b> in Florida Bay, just north of 25 °N latitude, during routine sampling for Pristis pectinata (smalltooth sawfish). These captures extend the southern range of C. isodon in Florida to approximately 25 °N and increase the likelihood of exchange between the Atlantic and Gulf stocks...|$|E
40|$|White sharks Carcharodon carcharias {{are widely}} {{distributed}} within New Zealand’s {{exclusive economic zone}} (EEZ), occurring in coastal and oceanic waters from at least 33 o S to 52. 5 o S, and are taken {{in a number of}} non-commercial and commercial fisheries. Recreational taken since 1975. All sharks taken are disposed of at sea unless requested for research (L. Bell, DCC, pers. comm.). White sharks are not considered capable of sustaining a target fishery in New Zealand and commercial fisheries regulations prohibit directed fisheries (Francis 1998). They are taken as bycatch, however, in <b>bottom-set</b> <b>longline,</b> dropline and gill net fisheries, and occasionally in trawl and tuna longline fisheries (Ministry of Fisheries Catch Effort Database, Duffy unpubl. data). Landings and sale of bycatch is permitted. Commercial catch Reported commercial landings have averaged only 197 kg (s. e. ± 84) green weight per year for the last nine years (Table 1). However...|$|E
40|$|Information about {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability in the distribution and abundance of shark-populations are required for their conservation, management and to update measures designed to mitigate human-shark interactions. However, because some species of sharks are mobile, migratory and occur in relatively small numbers, estimating their patterns of distribution and abundance can be very difficult. In this study, we used a hierarchical sampling design to examine differences {{in the composition of}} species, size- and sex-structures of sharks sampled with <b>bottom-set</b> <b>longlines</b> in three different areas with increasing distance from the entrance of Sydney Harbour, a large urbanised estuary. During two years of sampling, we obtained data for four species of sharks (Port Jackson, Heterodontus portusjacksoni; wobbegong, Orectolobus maculatus; dusky whaler, Carcharhinus obscurus and bull shark, Carcharhinus leucas). Only a few O. maculatus and C. obscurus were caught, all in the area closest to the entrance of the Harbour. O. maculatus were caught in all seasons, except summer, while C. obscurus was only caught in summer. Heterodontus portusjacksoni were the most abundant species, caught in the entrance location mostly between July to November, when water temperature was below 21. 5 °C. This pattern was consistent across both years. C. leucas, the second most abundant species, were captured in all areas of Sydney Harbour but only in summer and autumn when water temperatures were above 23 °C. This study quantified, for this first time, how different species utilise different areas of Sydney Harbour, at different times of the year. This information has implications for the management of human-shark interactions, by enabling creation of education programs to modify human behaviour in times of increased risk of potentially dangerous sharks...|$|R
