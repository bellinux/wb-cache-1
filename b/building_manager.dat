40|$|AbstractThis paper {{discusses}} the interview part of data collection, of an in-progress research on universal design implementation in public buildings, in Putrajaya. Main issues include {{public awareness of}} PWD rights and the true concepts of universal design. Main purposes were to investigate the level of awareness and perception of <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> regarding current and future plan of building's accessibility, and to study their knowledge on universal design theory. Semi-structured interview was carried out with <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> from three public buildings in Putrajaya.

40|$|<b>Building</b> <b>managers</b> have {{specific}} duties and certain outputs {{that are required}} of them. Without the necessary data, information, tools, and time, {{they are unable to}} adequately meet their organisational goals. Scenario modelling enables explicit and unambiguous coupling of building functions with other pivotal aspects of building operation in a method that specifically considers the education and technical expertise of <b>building</b> <b>managers.</b> This new method captures, transforms, and communicates the complex interdependencies of environmental and energy management in buildings through an easily navigable, holistic, and reproducible checking mechanism that compares actual performance with predicted performance and completes the “plan-do-check-act” cycle for <b>building</b> <b>managers.</b> Most important, the structured nature of this method caters to the diverse profile of <b>building</b> <b>managers,</b> making it applicable for widespread deployment. This paper demonstrates the benefit of using the new method by examining its application to a performance analysis of two existing buildings...|$|R

40|$|In Malaysia, {{most of the}} <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> faced {{problems}} in conducting maintenance operation due to unclear plan and unsystematic approach. Improper maintenance management and practices could affect the performance levels of the maintenance works and the productivity of the building users. This paper aims to examine the issues and challenges faced by government office <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> in selecting an appropriate maintenance strategies. This study adopted mixed method which {{is a combination of}} both qualitative and quantitative methods. Three government office buildings in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia were selected as the case study. Structured interviews were conducted with the <b>building</b> maintenance <b>managers</b> and 200 questionnaires were distributed to the buildings occupants. A total of 67. 5 % questionnaires were valid for data analysis. The results showed that there are significant correlation between the frequency of services breakdown and the productivity of the building user. Top management, human resource and technical problems were identified as the issues and challenges faced by <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> in conducting maintenance work. Based on the data obtained, the performance level of building maintenance services are analysed using three selected performance indicators. From the findings, it is proven that the issues and challenges faced affect the performance levels of the maintenance works. In contrast, if the <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> do not face too many issues and challenges in implementing the maintenance works, the maintenance strategies will perform in an optimum level...|$|R

Following Somers' departure in late 1981, Jenilee Harrison joined the cast as Chrissy's first cousin Cindy Snow, who was soon replaced by Priscilla Barnes as Terri Alden.

40|$|Detailed and {{accurate}} energy accounting {{is an important}} first step in improving energy efficiency within buildings. Based on this information, <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> can perform active energy management, especially during demand response situations that require load shedding over short time scales. While individual plug-loads are an important target for demand response, they pose significant challenges due to their distributed nature and the significant diversity of devices that are deployed. This paper presents the design and implementation of our energy accounting and management system which is specifically geared towards managing plug-loads within enterprise buildings. Our system provides fine-grained visibility and control of plug-loads to <b>building</b> <b>managers,</b> allowing them to deal with demand response situations through userspecified actuation policies. At its core, our system consists of our wireless smart energy meter with actuation capabilities, ZigBee-based wireless network infrastructure, and our Demand Response Server, an analysis engine that provides interfaces for initiating load-shedding policies. Our microbenchmarks show the different methods that <b>building</b> <b>managers</b> can utilize to efficiently manage devices during demand response events...|$|R

25|$|Two changes {{took place}} in the fall of 1979, at the {{beginning}} of the fourth season. The first was the addition of Lana, an older woman who chased Jack around. She liked to pursue him but he did not appreciate her advances. Since Ann Wedgeworth did not appreciate her diminishing role in the series, Lana was dropped from the show without any explanation before the season was half over. The other new addition that fall was the new <b>building</b> <b>manager,</b> Ralph Furley (played by Don Knotts), whose brother Bart bought the building from the Ropers. Mr. Furley pursued Lana unsuccessfully, as she unsuccessfully pursued Jack. Unlike Lana, Mr. Furley appeared until the end of the series.|$|E

He claims to have been lent a badly needed £85,000 in December 1962 by a bank manager who retired the same day. Later, during the 1990s, Heseltine joked about how he had avoided bankruptcy by such stratagems as paying bills only when threatened with legal action, although he eventually settled all his debts. It was during this stressful period of his life that he took up gardening as a serious hobby.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} {{missions}} was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, {{was the most important}} industry of any mission. Prior to the establishment of {{the missions}}, the native peoples knew only how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to be self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions {{under the supervision of the}} padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California). The <b>building</b> <b>manager</b> was , who was poisoned by his Indian cook Nazario before the project was completed.

We primarily focus on demand response. Methods discussed include graphical representations of electric load data, a regression-based electricity load model that uses a time-of-week indicator variable and a piecewise linear and continuous outdoor air temperature dependence, and the definition of various parameters that characterize facility electricity loads and demand response behavior. In the future, these methods could be translated into easy-to-use tools for <b>building</b> <b>managers...</b>|$|R

Pyne introduced Baker to both polo and auto racing, sports he quickly mastered. Baker remained well known from his time at Princeton; marquees at his home arena, which was shared with Princeton, often said [...] "Hobey Baker Plays Tonight". This made Baker uncomfortable and he eventually asked the <b>building</b> <b>manager</b> to take down the sign.

[...] "There is no reason why", he said, [...] "any well-designed office building need be torn down because of obsolescence." [...] Skidmore & Owings, who had pioneered functional design, were retained to lead a $125,000 program ($ in [...] dollars) to restyle the main entrance, remodel the lobby and ground floor shops, modernize all the public spaces, and progressively modernize office suites as demand required. The modernization included covering the mosaic floors with rubber tile and terrazzo, enclosing the elevators and ornamental stairways, and replacing the marble and oak finishes in the corridors and offices with modern materials.
