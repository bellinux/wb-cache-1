Considerable epidemiological {{research indicates that}} whole grain foods are associated with lower risk of chronic diseases. However, Americans consume far below the recommended 3 daily servings of whole grains. Little {{research has focused on}} factors that influence consumption of specific foods, such as whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread.</b> Examining sensory and behavioral factors through the theory of planned behavior may provide a comprehensive explanation for liking and consumption of whole <b>grain</b> <b>breads.</b> In Phase 1, using descriptive analysis, a lexicon was developed to describe the sensory attributes of 12 commercial 100 % whole <b>grain</b> <b>breads.</b> Five breads were representative of the range of breads analyzed, and selected for use in the subsequent bread liking study. Phase 2, part 1 included development and testing of a questionnaire associated with whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption. Next the theory-based questionnaire was used to determine factors that influence whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption among 270 bread consumers recruited at a local grocery store. The mean daily whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> intake was 1. 3 servings. Liking, whole grain versus refined <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> preference, and usual whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> consumption pattern were significant predictors of intention to consume whole <b>grain</b> <b>bread</b> and significantly increased the variance explained by the model compared to the standard model.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I improve Gardner's surplus {{transformation}} curve framework by assuming {{that government is}} able to vary many policy instruments simultaneously instead of only one. I use my framework to find {{the combination of the}} currently used instruments which provides the most efficient income redistribution for the Austrian <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> market. Contrasting the most efficient policy to the actual policy reveals that 464 million Austrian shillings were wasted. I theoretically compare for a small country the transfer efficiency of every possible pair of the four major agricultural policy instruments: floor price, production quota, coresponsibility levy, and deficiency payments. Without considering the marginal cost of public funds (MCF), deficiency payments cum quota (equal to a fully-decoupled direct income support) is the most efficient policy, succeeded by floor price cum quota, and floor price cum deficiency payments. If the MCF is taken into account, the ranking crucially depends on the market parameters, the transfer level, and the value of the MCF. For the Austrian <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> market, I empirically demonstrate, that given the present support level, a fully-decoupled direct income support redistributes income most efficiently as long as the MCF is lower than 1. 17. Beyond this value a floor price cum quota policy becomes more efficient. A floor price cum deficiency payments policy is never superior to the floor price cum quota. 2 1...|$|E
40|$|A common {{finding in}} {{agricultural}} policy analysis is that agricultural policies fail {{to achieve their}} main objective of farm income support efficiently.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of an extensive inquiry into urban consumption of foodstuffs in Flanders between 1800 and 1860. The octroi tax, an indirect tax levied on various consumer items, formed the principal source. During the initial phase of Belgian industrialisation the inhabitants of the eight cities under study (Antwerp, Bruges, Brussels, Courtrai, Ghent, Lokeren, Leuven and Mechelen) experienced a sharp decrease in the consumption of <b>bread</b> <b>grains,</b> meat, fish, beer, wine and gin. A number of other indicators suggest at the same time an accelerated widening of the gap between rich and poor. This process of impoverishment and pauperisation, which occurred in all cities (small or large, industrial or merchant centre), is explained as a result of Malthusian tensions. The rapid population growth, which started around 1750, generated the division of arable land and a sharp increase in land prices. The growing demand for food, stagnating agricultural output, and the trade and agricultural policy of the government led to {{a significant increase in the}} price level of foodstuffs. The capitalism hypothesis of Lis and Soly, elaborated for Antwerp, is rejected. ...|$|E
40|$|Cereal {{foods are}} an {{important}} source of carbohydrates and dietary fiber in our diet. Epidemiological evidence increasingly demonstrates that a diet rich in whole grain is protective against development of diet-related disorders such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The majority of cereal foods today, however, are made from refined wheat flour. The grain processing industry therefore faces challenges and opportunities to produce new ingredients and foods with added value for consumer health. Against this background, the European Community decided to support the HEALTHGRAIN project (www. healthgrain. org) over the 2005 - 2010 period as part of the 6 th Framework Food Research Program. HEALTHGRAIN aims to improve the well-being of humankind and {{to reduce the risk of}} metabolic syndrome-related diseases in Europe by increasing the intake of protective compounds in whole grains or their fractions. It presents an integrated, multidisciplinary effort to determine the variation in composition, process-induced changes, and human metabolism of bioactive compounds in the major European <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> wheat and rye and to reveal the physiological mechanisms underlying their role in the prevention of metabolic syndrome and related diseases.

Also, other product characteristics that may add to the metabolic benefits of whole grain products are promoted.

Analiziraju se izvještaji Velike župe Dubrava kao i njezinih kotarskih oblasti i oružničkih zapovjedništava upućenih nadležnim ministarstvima i zapovjedništvima talijanskih vojnih snaga stacioniranih u Velikoj župi Dubrava. Iz njih je vidljivo da su postojali veliki problemi u organizaciji prehrane stanovništva, da je stanovništvo uvelike oskudijevalo osnovnim životnim namirnicama, te da je hrana neredovito pristizala i da su se iz mjeseca u mjesec smanjivali obroci hrane po glavi stanovnika. Od gladi se umiralo kao i od zaraznih bolesti koje je glad prouzrokovala. The Great County of Dubrava {{was one of}} the twenty-two {{counties}} in the Independent State of Croatia. It spread in the south-eastern part of the country, and encompassed the following districts: Dubrovnik, Trebinje, Bileća, Gacko, Stolac, Čapljina and Ravno. The Great County of Dubrava was a multi-national county, which included the Croats, the Serbs and the Muslims. The population of the Great County of Dubrava started to feel food shortage soon after its establishment; the shortage continuously increased. Due to food shortage, rationed distribution of most of the basic products (wheat, corn, flour, oil, fat, sugar, meat, potatoes, beans, etc.) was introduced, whereby the price of every individual product was maximised. Municipal approvisation committees carried out the distribution. In addition to having been sold by approvisation, food was also sold over the counter, at much higher prices. Here the smugglers played the leading role. Since the area of the Great County of Dubrava was not a grain region, <b>bread</b> <b>grains</b> and most other agricultural products had to be acquired from the northern parts of the country. Due to armed conflicts led {{in the area of the}} Great County of Dubrava, the food was arriving late, whilst to some areas where armed conflicts were led, the food was arriving with a two-, even four-month delay. Insurgents were demolishing railways and bridges, putting up roadblocks, etc. Reporters from particular districts, gendarmerie stations and gendarmerie headquarters presented the state regarding nourishment as chaotic, desperate, critical, and miserable. In the reports, it was emphasised that people were so utterly exhausted and sick that they resembled saints rather than mortals. People were dying of famine and of infectious diseases, such as typhus. The prices of food in the over-the-counter sale were astronomically high in comparison with the low wages employees were receiving. Life was difficult both in rural and in urban environments. In the country, people were dying not only of famine, but also as a result of persecution and robberies committed by participants in armed conflicts. In addition, they could not cultivate their own fields; consequently, the needed food could not have been produced. All armies were involved in stealing cattle. Hence, people left the country and moved to fortified towns, where famine awaited them again. People there lived of employee’s wages, which however did not correspond with the increase in the prices of food. Refugees, whose position was the worst, represented a major burden to the towns regarding nourishment. The leadership of the Independent State of Croatia did not succeed in ensuring sufficient nourishment for the population in the first two years of war; nourishment-related problems continued in 1943 and 1944 as well, after the Partisan Army had in October 1942 invaded the area of the Great County of Dubrava...|$|E
