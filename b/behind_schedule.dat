5|$|From 1969 to 1975, Baxter was {{part-time}} and unpaid {{chairman of}} the Sydney Opera House Trust. He had recently retired from the UNSW, but the job was no sinecure.

Baxter put the project under his unpopular but decisive grip, and brought the Sydney Opera House to completion and opening on 20 October 1973.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{algorithmics}} of checking atomicity of in concurrent programs. Unearthing fundamental results <b>behind</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms in database control, we build space-efficient monitoring algorithms for checking atomicity. Second, by interpreting the monitoring algorithm as a deterministic automaton, we solve several key model checking problems for checking atomicity of finite-state concurrent models. We establish two main results: that checking atomicity for concurrent regular Boolean programs is PSPACE-complete, and that checking concurrent recursive programs is decidable. The results are based summarizing programs using profiles of runs, and checking if the profiles witness non-serializability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{monitoring}} concurrent program runs for atomicity violations. Unearthing fundamental results <b>behind</b> <b>scheduling</b> algorithms in database control, we build space-efficient monitoring algorithms for checking atomicity that use space polynomial {{in the number of}} active threads and entities, and independent of the length of run monitored. Second, by interpreting the monitoring algorithm as a finite automaton, we solve the model checking problem for atomicity of finite-state concurrent models. This remedies incorrect proofs published in the literature. Finally, we exhibit experimental evidence that our atomicity monitoring algorithm gives substantial time and space benefits on benchmark applications. ...|$|R

5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92.

5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area.

One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell <b>behind</b> <b>schedule</b> due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E

5|$|In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee {{selected}} Dworsky {{as executive}} architect {{to work with}} designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, {{the cost of the}} project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years <b>behind</b> <b>schedule).</b> Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} meet {{production}} targets, GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month. Production fell <b>behind</b> <b>schedule</b> {{during the first half}} of 1987, however, as a result of inefficiencies at the company's factory and industrial relations problems. GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year, though some components that were planned to be manufactured in Australia were purchased from companies in the United States instead. The final cost of the Hornet project was A$4.668 billion; after adjusting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar this was $186 million less than the initial estimate.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, on the 28th Brigade's {{left flank}} the Shropshires met slight resistance, {{securing}} Hill 210 southwest of Kowang-San by 10:10.

5|$|The mix of {{engraving}} styles was criticised; {{line engraving}} {{was considered the}} superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell <b>behind</b> <b>schedule,</b> delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, {{at a lower price}} to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.|$|E

5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's upkeep and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell <b>behind</b> <b>schedule.</b> Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams.

5|$|<b>Behind</b> <b>schedule</b> and over-budget, the {{production}} crew struggled to complete production {{in time for}} the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15m) of water, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.|$|E
