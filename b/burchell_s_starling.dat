40|$|Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) are robin-sized birds {{weighing}} about 3. 2 ounces (90 g). Since their introduction into New York in the 1890 <b>s,</b> <b>starlings</b> {{have spread}} across the continental United States, northward to Alaska and the southern half of Canada, and southward into northern Mexico. Starlings are found {{in a wide variety}} of habitats including cities, towns, farms, ranches, open woodlands, fields, and lawns. Starlings consume a variety of foods, including fruits and seeds of both wild and cultivated varieties. European starlings were brought into the United States from Europe. Starlings are frequently considered pests because of the problems they cause, especially at livestock facilities and near urban roosts. European starlings are not protected by federal law and in most cases not by state law...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background European {{starlings}} (Sturnus vulgaris) are an invasive {{bird species}} {{known to cause}} damage to plant and animal agriculture. New evidence suggests starlings may {{also contribute to the}} maintenance and spread of diseases within livestock facilities. Identifying and mitigating the risk pathways that contribute to disease in livestock is necessary to reduce production losses and contamination of human food products. To better understand the impact starlings have on disease transmission to cattle we assessed the efficacy of starling control as a tool to reduce Salmonella enterica within a concentrated animal feeding operation. We matched a large facility, slated for operational control using DRC- 1339 (3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline hydrochloride, also 3 -chloro p-toluidine hydrochloride, 3 -chloro- 4 -methylaniline), with a comparable reference facility that was not controlling birds. In both facilities, we sampled cattle feed, cattle water and cattle feces for S. enterica before and after starling control operations. Results Within the starling-controlled CAFO, detections of S. enterica contamination disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following starling control operations. Within the reference facility, detections of S. enterica contamination increased substantially within feed bunks and water troughs. Starling control was not observed to reduce prevalence of S. enterica in the cattle herd. Following starling control operations, herd prevalence of S. enterica increased on the reference facility but herd prevalence of S. enterica on the starling-controlled CAFO stayed at pretreatment levels. Conclusions Within the starling-controlled facility detections of S. enterica disappeared from feed bunks and substantially declined within water troughs following control operations. Since cattle feed and water are obvious routes for the ingestion of <b>S.</b> enterica, <b>starling</b> control shows promise as a tool to help livestock producers manage disease. Yet, we do not believe starling control should be used as a stand alone tool to reduce S. enterica infections. Rather starling control could be used as part of a comprehensive disease management plan for concentrated animal feeding operations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Patterns of {{resource}} partitioning among 4 sympatric sturnids: [black-collared starling (Sturnus nigricollis), pied <b>starling</b> (<b>S.</b> contra), common myna (Acridotheres tristis) and crested myna (A. javanicus) were determined {{based on their}} food habits, foraging and nesting microhabitat selection, morphology and behavior. The study was conducted from March 1986 to June 1988 at and around Bang Pra Game Sanctuary, Cholburi, Thailand. Diets of adults and nestlings of all species were significantly different. The 4 species exhibited significant differences in morphology, primarily in trophic (bill shape and length) and locomotive (wing shape and size) appendages that affect selection of foraging microhabitat and hence choice of diets. Selection of nest site characteristics was significantly different among the species and was associated with types of tree i. e., palm vs non-palm (trees with forks or branches), distance of nest tree from human habitation and distance of nest tree from seasonal or permanent waters. The pied starling, common myna and crested myna all selected different foraging habitats and used different techniques for foraging,-however the black-collared starling shared foraging habitat with the other 3 species. Breeding success, breeding chronology, and clutch sizes were similar for the 4 species. These 4 sympatric sturnids partitioned their resources through differences in morphology, which, in turn, affected their foraging habitat selection and modes of foraging, and hence, differences in diet. Behavioral differences also segregated their foraging techniques and nest site selection...|$|R
40|$|The 1969 - 70 {{nationwide}} winter {{inventory of}} blackbird-starling roosts and populations was {{conducted during the}} period December 20 -January 31 by the Division of Wildlife Research, U. S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife. The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center coordinated the survey for the East (31 States), and the Denver Wildlife Research Center for the West (17 States). Success depended on extensive cooperation from many sources: Bureau agencies, especially the Division of Wildlife Services; other Federal and State conservation and agricultural departments; the Audubon Society; ornithological clubs; and individual bird students. In all, 674 roosts were reported-— 262 in the East and 412 in the West. The total estimated population was 340 million birds: 267 million blackbirds and starlings in the East and 73 million in the West. The national population was composed of 10 species, about as follows: 40 percent red-winged blackbirds, 20 percent starlings, 20 percent common grackles, 15 percent brown-headed cowbirds, 3 per¬cent Brewer 2 ̆ 7 s blackbirds, and 1 percent rusty blackbirds; the other 1 percent included boat-tailed grackles, yellow-headed blackbirds, tricolored blackbirds, and bronzed cowbirds. Of the 262 roosts reported in the East, 77 were classed as major (a million or more birds each) and 57 as large (hundred thousand—million birds each); these 134 roosts contained 265 million of the 267 million blackbirds and starlings reported in the East. Of the 412 roosts in the West, 24 were major and 41 were large; these 65 roosts contained 70 of the 73 million Western birds reported. Thus, 98 ½ percent of the U. <b>S.</b> blackbirds and <b>starlings</b> found were in 199 roosts (101 major roosts and 98 large roosts), or in 30 percent of the 674 reported roosts...|$|R
