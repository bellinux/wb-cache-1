50|$|The {{evergreen}} <b>bagworm</b> (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis), {{commonly known}} as <b>bagworm,</b> eastern <b>bagworm,</b> common <b>bagworm,</b> common basket worm, or North American <b>bagworm,</b> is a moth that spins its cocoon in its larval life, decorating it with bits of plant material from the trees on which it feeds.|$|E
50|$|The Psychidae (<b>bagworm</b> moths, also simply bagworms or bagmoths) are {{a family}} of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). The <b>bagworm</b> family is fairly small, with about 1350 species described. <b>Bagworm</b> species are found globally, with some, such as the snailcase <b>bagworm</b> (Apterona helicoidella), {{settling}} continents where they are not native in modern times.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bagworm</b> {{begins to}} build its case {{as soon as it}} hatches. Once the case is built, only adult males ever leave the case, never to return, when they take flight to find a mate. Bagworms add {{material}} {{to the front of the}} case as they grow, excreting waste materials through the opening in the back of the case. When satiated with leaves, a <b>bagworm</b> caterpillar secures its case and pupates. The adult female, which is wingless, either emerges from the case long enough for breeding or remains in the case while the male extends his abdomen into the female's case to breed. Females lay their eggs in their case and die. The female evergreen <b>bagworm</b> (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) dies without laying eggs, and the larval <b>bagworm</b> offspring emerge from the parent's body. Some <b>bagworm</b> species are parthenogenetic, meaning their eggs develop without male fertilization. Each <b>bagworm</b> generation lives just long enough as adults to mate and reproduce in their annual cycle.|$|E
50|$|In the larval stage, <b>bagworms</b> {{extend their}} head and thorax from their mobile case to devour {{the leaves of}} host plants, often leading {{to the death of}} their hosts. Trees infested with <b>bagworms</b> exhibit {{increasingly}} damaged foliage as the infestation increases until the leaves are stripped bare. Some <b>bagworms</b> are specialized in their host plants (monophagous), while others can feed on a variety of plant species (polyphagous). A few species also consume small arthropods (such as the camphor scale Pseudaonidia duplex, a scale insect).|$|R
50|$|Ten subfamilies {{and about}} 240 genera are {{recognized}} among the <b>bagworms.</b>|$|R
50|$|These <b>bagworms</b> are of {{significance}} because their pupae are harvested {{for human consumption}} in quantity.|$|R
50|$|The grass <b>bagworm</b> (Eurukuttarus confederata) is {{a species}} of <b>bagworm</b> that only eats grass. These bagworms make cases less than two cm in length from silk and grass, {{starting}} out with a green color, but turning brown as the grass ages.|$|E
50|$|Sapheneutis is a <b>bagworm</b> genus.|$|E
50|$|Thyridopteryx is a genus of <b>bagworm</b> moth.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bagworms</b> are {{commonly}} parasitized by ichneumonid wasps, notably Itoplectis conquisitor. Predators include vespid wasps and hornets. Woodpeckers and sapsuckers can {{feed on the}} larva from their cases.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{common name}} for the Psychidae is [...] "case moths", {{but this is just}} as well used for the case-bearers (Coleophoridae). The names refer to the habits of {{caterpillar}} of these two families, which build small protective cases in which they can hide. The <b>bagworms</b> belong to the superfamily Tineoidea, which is a basal lineage of the Ditrysia just as the Gelechioidea, in which the case-bearers are placed. This means that the <b>bagworms</b> and case-bearers are only as closely related to each other as either is to butterflies (Rhopalocera).|$|R
5000|$|Balsam twig aphids (Mindarus abietnus) {{are another}} type of tree pest which affects fir and spruce trees in the spring. The aphids can cause stunted growth in trees with heavy infestations {{rendering}} badly damaged trees unsellable. Other species of adelgids also infest fir trees, those include the pine bark adelgid, the Cooley spruce gall adelgid (Adelges cooleyi), and the {{eastern spruce gall adelgid}} (Adelges abietis). Another serious pest are <b>bagworms.</b> These pests can defoliate a tree completely if present in large enough numbers. Additionally, the damage caused by the silk of <b>bagworms</b> can last years.|$|R

50|$|They are {{case bearing}} moths, {{spinning}} a loose shell {{of their own}} which they carry around with them as protection, like <b>bagworms.</b> The specific snails they eat are of the Tornatellides genus.|$|R
5000|$|Tineoidea is the ditrysian {{superfamily}} of moths {{that includes}} clothes moths, <b>bagworms</b> and relatives. There are six families usually included within it, Eriocottidae, Arrhenophanidae, Lypusidae, Acrolophidae, Tineidae and Psychidae, whose relationships are currently uncertain.|$|R
50|$|There {{are over}} 50 species of Psychidae {{and at least}} two species of Liothula in New Zealand. Māori names for <b>bagworms</b> include pū a Raukatauri meaning 'flute of Raukatauri', the goddess of music; whare atua meaning 'house of the spirit'; or kopi meaning 'shut'.|$|R

50|$|Weeds {{growing in}} the polybags must be {{carefully}} pulled out. Herbicides should not be used. Numerous insects (ants, armyworms, <b>bagworms,</b> aphids, thrips, mites, grasshoppers, and mealybugs) and vertebrates (rats, squirrels, porcupines, wild boar, and monkeys) are pests in oil palm nurseries and must be carefully identified before control measures are implemented.|$|R
50|$|The {{evergreen}} <b>bagworm's</b> case {{grows to}} {{a length of}} over 6 cm, tapered and open on both ends. Newborn larva are blackish and turn brown to tan as they grow, mottled with black. The heads and thorax develop a yellow tint as they grow to a full length of 24 to 32 mm. Adult males resemble bees, having a 25 mm wingspan with transparent wings (thuris window + pterux wing) and black furry bodies. Adult females are maggot-like with yellowish-white soft bodies 19 to 23 mm long and small tufts of hair {{near the end of}} the abdomen. The cream-colored eggs are 0.75 mm in diameter.|$|R
50|$|Like other <b>bagworms,</b> L. omnivora {{caterpillars}} {{construct and}} live within a small, mobile, tapering bag of silk, which provides camouflage and protection to the caterpillar. The bag is lengthened at the broad or mouth end as the caterpillar grows. The caterpillar secures itself within the bag using hooks on its anterior prolegs, {{allowing it to}} extend the head and thorax while dragging the bag behind it. When threatened, it quickly retreats into the bag and draws the mouth tightly closed. The caterpillar begins construction of its bag {{within a few days}} of hatching. Initially the bag is held erect, but as the caterpillar grows larger the bag trails behind and beneath the insect.|$|R

50|$|Cryptothelea gloverii is {{a species}} of <b>bagworm</b> moth. Its native range {{includes}} Central America.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{materials}} in nature act as ready made [...] "building blocks" [...] {{to the animals}} in question, such as feathers and leaf petioles for some birds and animal hair for the chaffinch. Other materials need to be [...] "processed". Caddisfly larvae use stone pieces and also cut sections from green leaves for use in construction. The stone pieces are selected as per their size and shape from a large variety. In the case of leaf sections, these are cut and shaped to required size. Similarly <b>bagworms</b> cut and shape thorns or twigs to form their case. Some sphecid wasps collect mud and blend them with water to construct free standing nests of mud. Paper wasp queens build with paper pulp which they prepare by rasping wood with their jaws and mixing with saliva, a case of collecting, processing and blending raw materials.|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} {{implementation}} of an Integrated Pest Management program {{in a public school}} system, an inventory of woody plants was created for 12 schools and key plants and key pests in the landscape were identified. In addition, the use of alternative tactics was examined for the control of insect and weed problems. The cost and efficacy of hand removal of <b>bagworms</b> (Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis) from Leyland cypress (X Cupressocyparis leylandii) was compared to chemical treatment. Both treatments were effective, but handpicking was more costly. The efficacy and costs of the natural product based herbicides glufosinate, pelargonic acid, and acetic acid were compared to glyphosate for weed control in hardscape areas. The natural alternatives were effective, but at a higher cost. An alternative management program that eliminated the use of preemergent herbicides for weed control on athletic fields was also studied. The alternative program did not yield satisfactory results...|$|R
