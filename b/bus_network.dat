5|$|There is an {{extensive}} <b>bus</b> <b>network</b> {{that covers the}} entire city by three bus services, but no tram or subway exists. The three bus operators are partially owned by the city (KPKM, KPK and KZK) and each shares approximately {{a third of the}} lines and the bus fleet.|$|E
40|$|Our {{aim is to}} find <b>bus</b> {{interconnection}} <b>networks</b> which connect as many processors as possible, for given upper bounds on {{the number}} of connections per processor, the number of processors per <b>bus</b> and the <b>network</b> diameter. Point-to-point networks are a special case of <b>bus</b> <b>networks</b> in which every bus connects only two processors. In this case de Bruijn and Kautz networks and their generalizations are known to be among the best families of networks with respect to the aforementioned criteria. In this paper, we present the directed de Bruijn <b>bus</b> <b>networks,</b> which connect two or more processors on a bus, and contain the point-to-point de Bruijn networks and their generalization as a special case. We study two different schemes of the directed de Bruijn <b>bus</b> <b>networks.</b> We also show that the directed Kautz <b>bus</b> <b>networks</b> can be defined in the same manner. 1 Introduction A <b>bus</b> interconnection <b>network</b> is a collection of processing elements (processors) and communication elements (buses).

5|$|Journey {{times from}} Knowle West {{to the city}} centre have been {{identified}} as hampering employment opportunities for residents and proposals for a Greater Bristol <b>Bus</b> <b>Network</b> and a rapid transit scheme have noted the need to provide better connectivity for the area. A journey from Filwood Park to the city centre takes around 50 minutes and from Inns Court to Broadmead takes over 30 minutes. Proposed extensions to the A4174 ring road, which would pass along the southern part of Knowle West, have been claimed to reduce delays across the Greater Bristol area by 6%, and lead to a 9% increase in public transport use. The plans were approved by the Department for Transport in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|London's <b>bus</b> <b>network</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} in the world, running 24 hours a day, with about 8,500 buses, more than 700 bus routes and around 19,500 bus stops. In 2013, the network had more than 2 billion {{commuter}} trips per annum, more than the Underground. Around £850million is taken in revenue each year. London has the largest wheelchair accessible network in the world and, from the 3rd quarter of 2007, became more accessible to hearing and visually impaired passengers as audio-visual announcements were introduced. The distinctive red double-decker buses are an internationally recognised trademark of London transport along with black cabs and the Tube.|$|E
5|$|Skopje has a <b>bus</b> <b>network</b> {{managed by}} the city and {{operated}} by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948.

However, most of the network {{is still in the}} hands of JSP which operates 67 lines on 80. Only 24 lines are urban, the others serving localities around the city. Many of the JSP buses are (by Chinese buse builder Yutong) red double-decker buses designed to look like the British-made buses that were in use in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|English local {{authorities}} {{are required to}} produce Local Transport Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport {{as part of a}} longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 2006–2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for {{the first five years of}} the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the <b>bus</b> <b>network</b> including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough is at {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. There are three subway stations in Scarborough: Victoria Park, Warden, and Kennedy. Beginning at Kennedy station, Line 3 Scarborough, {{also known as the}} Scarborough RT, runs north and east toward Scarborough City Centre. It runs at grade for two stops until Ellesmere Road where it becomes elevated until it reaches its terminus at McCowan Road. The system is nearing the end of its life and the city is planning an extension of the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth subway line to Scarborough Centre with construction slated to commence in 2018. In addition to the subway and RT, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) runs an extensive <b>bus</b> <b>network</b> throughout Scarborough. Many of the bus lines run to and from the subway and RT stations.|$|E

The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional <b>bus</b> <b>network.</b> In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.|$|E

While airline and railway networks have been extensively studied, a comprehensive {{study on the}} structure and growth of <b>bus</b> <b>networks</b> is lacking. In India, where bus transport {{plays an important role}} in day-to-day commutation, it is of significant interest to analyze its topological structure and answer basic questions on its evolution, growth, robustness and resiliency. Although the common feature of small-world property is observed, our analysis reveals a wide spectrum of network topologies arising due to significant variation in the degree-distribution patterns in the networks. We also observe that these networks although, robust and resilient to random attacks are particularly degree-sensitive. Unlike real-world networks, such as Internet, WWW and airline, that are virtual, <b>bus</b> <b>networks</b> are physically constrained. Our findings therefore, throw light on the evolution of such geographically and constrained networks that will help us in designing more efficient <b>bus</b> <b>networks</b> in the future...|$|R
