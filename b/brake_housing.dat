25|$|The Chrysler 4-wheel {{disc brake}} system was {{more complex and}} {{expensive}} than Crosley's, but far more efficient and reliable. It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the <b>brake</b> <b>housing.</b> The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler {{developed}} a unique braking system, offered from 1949 to 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner {{surface of a}} cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the <b>brake</b> <b>housing.</b> The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders. Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, {{at a time when}} an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Chrysler discs were [...] "self energizing," [...] in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the brake surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums. Today's owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|Electro-mechanical disk brakes operate via {{electrical}} actuation, but transmit torque mechanically. When {{electricity is}} applied to the coil of an electromagnet, the magnetic flux attracts the armature to the face of the brake. As it does so, it squeezes the inner and outer friction disks together. The hub is normally mounted on the shaft that is rotating. The <b>brake</b> <b>housing</b> is mounted solidly to the machine frame. As the disks are squeezed, torque is transmitted from the hub into the machine frame, stopping and holding the shaft.|$|E

25|$|In {{vehicles}} with rear disc brakes, the parking brake either actuates the disc calipers (again, with much less force) {{or a small}} drum <b>brake</b> <b>housed</b> within the hub assembly (the inner circumference of the disc is often used instead of a separate drum).|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, {{the area has}} {{developed}} into a historic market district with many ethnic food purveyors, some art studios, antique dealers, unique boutiques, and other businesses setting up shop where trains once delivered produce by the ton. The lack of weekday activity is in someways compensated by retail and leisure facilities which are used primarily on weekends. Particularly in the summer months, there are open-air farmers' markets, a range of street vendors and facilities to enjoy open air drinks. Residential developers have begun to convert old factory and warehouse buildings into apartments and lofts. Examples include the Armstrong Cork Factory, <b>Brake</b> <b>House</b> Lofts, and the Otto Milk Building. A mixed-use tower is planned for the Ayoob Fruit Warehouse site.|$|R

50|$|Permanent magnet type - A {{permanent}} magnet holding brake looks {{very similar to}} a standard power applied electromagnetic brake. Instead of squeezing a friction disk, via springs, it uses {{permanent magnet}}s to attract a single face armature. When the brake is engaged, the permanent magnets create magnetic lines of flux, which can in turn attract the armature to the <b>brake</b> <b>housing.</b> To disengage the brake, power {{is applied to the}} coil which sets up an alternate magnetic field that cancels out the magnetic flux of the permanent magnets.|$|E
50|$|Housings for bicycle brakes {{need not}} be quite so compressionless, but need to be stronger, and items {{currently}} sold for this purpose use a close-wound spiral support wire. One end of a <b>brake</b> <b>housing</b> is tight-terminated in an end cap or ferrule that makes a loose fit within a barrel adjuster, {{and the other in}} any of a variety of fittings that includes end caps, or parts to effect a smooth change of direction. In any case, {{at the point where the}} cable emerges for attachment to the brake arms, is fitted a nipple. In view of the wide array of cable constructions on offer, confusion as to the best housing can easily result. In general, a housing sold for one purpose should not be used for any other, and in any case the advice of the manufacturer should be followed. In particular, longitudinally reinforced housings should not be used for bicycle brakes, since they are weaker than the spirally wound housings.|$|E

50|$|Prussian state {{railways}} {{coaches were}} equipped with standard bogies with two and later three spring systems. Most coaches were 18.55 m long. Initially Westinghouse brakes were used, but after 1900 they were fitted with standard Knorr brakes. The hand <b>brake</b> was <b>housed</b> {{in a separate}} brakeman's cabin {{at one end of}} the coach. These were removed in 1930.|$|R
40|$|Magneto-rheological (MR) fluid is {{well-known}} as a “smart ” fluid with its controllable characteristics. Its rheological properties vary {{in response to}} an action of magnetic field. The MR fluid typically consists of micron-sized of pure magnetic particles and carrier liquid such as mineral oil, water [...] . etc. MR fluids are now being developed and used in shocks absorber for vehicles, damper for anti-vibration of washing machine, prosthetic limbs (leg, hand in medicine), exercise equipment, and surface polishing of processing machine parts. In this paper, a proposed MR brake using MR fluid is brought into comparison with the conventional one. In this experiment, by using a small steel ball with its hydrodynamic form, an over 10 Nm braking torque with 100 mm of diameters and 45 mm of thicknesses of the proposed MR <b>brake’s</b> <b>housing</b> was generated. This torque is considerable higher than 4 Nm, the value of conventional torque. Moreover, the influence of magnetic field in the magnetic circuit and the preventing of the deposition of pure particles in MR fluid are considered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{mathematical}} model for microstructure formation and porosity prediction during solidification process of SG iron casting was established {{and applied to}} a practical <b>brake</b> <b>housing</b> casting. Quantitative microstructure analysis of specimens machined from the castings was compared with the simulation, and the two results are in acceptable agreement on nodule counts and size, pearlite fractions and hardness. It is indicated that the model can calculate the fraction of ferrite and pearlite more accurately, and specially can reflect the effect of both under-cooling during solidification and the nodules formed in eutectic period on the pearlite content. The present porosity prediction was {{compared with those of}} a former method and commercial software, which leads to that the current methods used for porosity prediction should be investigated and improved further...|$|E
25|$|At {{stations}} {{a smaller}} pipe was laid alongside {{the track and}} a piston in this {{was connected to the}} train by a rope to start it moving. On arrival at the next station it was up to the driver to bring the train to a stop using its <b>brakes.</b> Engine <b>houses</b> were situated at every station except Exeter St Thomas where the driver had to hold the train against the atmospheric pressure with the brakes.|$|R

50|$|In 1731, the old Fischerhaus, <b>Brake's</b> oldest {{maintained}} <b>house,</b> was built. In 1756 came Brake's first documentary mention as a port city. During the 19th century, Brake {{became an}} important industrial centre for shipping, and the port facilities along the Weser were further expanded. In 1814, Brake set up its first council, Amt Brake. In 1835, Brake was declared a free port. In 1846, the telegraph {{was set up to}} relay shipping news between Bremen and Bremerhaven. In 1848-52 Brake was the first base of the German Imperial Fleet under Admiral Karl Rudolf Brommy, the first ever commander of a unified German fleet.|$|R
50|$|The {{company also}} {{supplied}} vehicles for the London Underground. In August 1905, they delivered two battery-electric locomotives, which {{were used for}} the construction of the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, and subsequently for the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway. They were 50.5 ft long, with a cab at both ends and a compartment behind one of the cabs, which <b>housed</b> <b>braking</b> and traction control equipment. 80 batteries, arranged as two rows of 40, occupied the central section of the vehicle, which was lower than the cabs. Chloride Electrical Storage Company supplied the batteries, which had to be charged at charging stations. The vehicles weighed 55 tons, and were not fitted with current collector shoes, since none of the rails were electrified during construction.|$|R
50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the manual brake release under the C brake while the other ran the control panel <b>brake</b> in the <b>house.</b> One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C brake was pulled to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|R
5000|$|The Senate {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1867, when the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the British North America Act 1867 (BNA Act), uniting the Province of Canada (which was separated into Quebec and Ontario) with Nova Scotia and New Brunswick into a single federation, a dominion called Canada. The Canadian parliament {{was based on the}} Westminster model (that is, the model of the Parliament of the United Kingdom). Canada's first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, described it as a body of [...] "sober second thought" [...] that would curb the [...] "democratic excesses" [...] of the elected House of Commons and provide regional representation. He believed that if the House of Commons properly represented the population, the upper chamber should represent the regions. It was not meant {{to be more than a}} revising body or a <b>brake</b> on the <b>House</b> of Commons. Therefore, it was deliberately made an appointed house, since an elected Senate might prove too popular and too powerful and be able to block the will of the House of Commons.|$|R
40|$|Despite often stated {{sustainability}} goals, much {{of traditional}} planning practice remains concerned with facilitating {{the market and}} maintaining the status quo rather than challenging and transforming it. In this chapter, the planning system {{is the focus of}} a sociotechnical systems perspective analysis. This chapter examines strategic spatial planning at regional and city scales through the lens of sociotechnical transitions concepts to provide insight into the role and capacity of spatial plans and planning processes to challenge the status quo and achieve sustainable urban transitions. We present two cases of strategic planning during {{the first decade of the}} 2000 s at a national and metropolitan scale in Ireland and Melbourne (Australia), respectively - two cases where strategic spatial plans aimed to achieve sustainable land-use outcomes but where planning failed to act as a <b>brake</b> on booming <b>housing</b> markets and related urban sprawl. This chapter also reflects on the lessons from spatial planning processes to inform sociotechnical systems research pointing to the need to incorporate conceptualisations of space, place and context-specific governance in problem framing particularly in considering the challenges of long-term sustainable land-use transitions. We query whether the prevailing planning system common in most developed contexts can be treated as a stable regime, and if so, what benefit this perspective may provide to planning practitioners...|$|R
