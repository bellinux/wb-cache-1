40|$|International audienceThree clones of E. coli, one {{of which}} was {{harbouring}} a tetracycline resistance plasmid were inoculated together into the stomach of axenic mice. Without antibiotic selective pressure, the R-Plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> became dominant in the faeces of mice, while the R-plasmid free strain was eliminated. When the R-plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> was given to mice 4 days after the inoculation with the R-plasmid free strain, it was repressed and remained at the stable level of 10 (4. 5) organisms per g of faeces. But a rapid spread of the R-plasmid was observed, tetracycline resistant bacteria become dominant within one day, and replace the tetracycline sensitive E. coli. The tetracycline resistance plasmid did not disadvantage the mediating strain in the gut, {{even in the absence of}} antibiotic pressure. In contrast Lebek and Egger (1983), studying the same strains in vitro, found that in a chemostat the plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> was overgrown by the plasmid free strain. These results strongly suggest that in vitro interactions between E. coli strains cannot be directly extrapolated to in vivo conditions. For the determination of the no-effect level of antibiotic residue on the selection of R-factor in the gut, studies should be made in vivo...|$|E
40|$|The turbidimetric {{responses}} of {{a strain of}} Escherichia coli K 12 to gentamicin and tobramycin were investigated. Both agents showed antibacterial activity below the conventionally measured minimum inhibitory concentration, but exposure to such subinhibitory concentrations of either agent generated a bacterial population which was able to grow in previously inhibitory concentrations at a rate equivalent {{to that of the}} parent culture. The increase in resistance was non-specific in that both aminoglycosides were equally affected, and was unstable on multiple passage in drug-free broth. The response to tobramycin was unaffected by the presence of an R factor conferring gentamicin resistance, but exposure of the R factor <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> to gentamicin caused a concomitant increase in the resistance to tobramycin, apparently by a non-specific adaptive mechanism similar to that observed with the parent strain.

30|$|Different <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> {{distributions}} {{and failure}} behaviors of differently oriented bearing specimens were observed using DIC. The RL specimen with a 12  mm drift pin {{was found to}} have highest bearing strength of 22.57  MPa, whereas the LR specimen had the lowest bearing strength of 6.47  MPa. Although different bearing strength and mixed failure behaviors from the differently oriented bearing specimens were found, {{based on the results of}} load–displacement curves, statistical analysis, and failure behaviors, the design bearing strength values and failure behaviors could largely be divided into three groups as RL and TL, RT and TR, and LT and LR. The strain distributions at the bearing area from DIC showed that the lower strain values from RL and TL were found compared to the LR and LT. It can be speculated that different load-slip modulus was related with the orientation of the specimens. The results indicated that the bearing strength from the three groups should be established for the reliable drift pin connection design using glulam with drift pins.|$|E

Damage characterisation is monitored using Digital Image correlation (DIC) for open-hole testing and X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) for double-lap bearing strength test. The off-axis notched 3 D woven composites exhibits minor reduction (less than 10 %) of the notched strength compared to the un-notched strength. DIC strain contour clearly show stress/strain localisation regions around the hole periphery and stress/strain redistribution away from the whole due to the z-binder existence, especially for ORT architecture. Up to 50 % <b>bearing</b> <b>strain,</b> {{no significant difference in}} the bearing stress/bearing strain response is observed. However when ORT architecture was loaded up to failure, it demonstrates higher strain to failure (~ 140 %) followed by AI (~ 105 %) and lastly LTL (~ 85 %).

The F(ab) ' 2 fragments were much more efficient as inhibitors in this system than the Fab fragments. F(ab) ' 2 at 0. 06 mg/ml and 0. 45 mg/ml Fab produced comparable degrees of suppression. The F(ab) ' 2 at 0. 06 mg/ml completely suppressed DNP copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-lysine (GL) -stimulated tritiated thymidine incorporation.

Addition of the intact alloantisera can be delayed 3 h after initiation of the antigen-stimulated cultures with no loss of suppression. After a delay of 6 h 45 % suppression was observed. The requirement for the divalent molecule and the observation that effective suppression of the in vitro responses is still obtained when the alloantiserum is added several hours after initiation of the cultures both suggest that the immunosuppression results from an active process affecting the lymphocyte membrane that renders the cell refractory to the antigenic stimulus...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Selection of the K 103 N {{mutation}} {{is associated}} with moderately reduced in vitro fitness of HIV. Strains bearing K 103 N in vivo tend to persist, {{even in the absence}} of additional drug pressure, as minority quasispecies, often undetectable in genotyping resistance testing assays, performed at standard conditions. Here, we report on the rapid and long lasting selection of a K 103 N <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> as the dominant quasispecies after very short exposure to efavirenz in vivo. CASE PRESENTATION: A 55 -year-old Caucasian man was switched to efavirenz, zidovudine and lamivudine in February 2003, while on viral suppression in his first-line highly active anti-retroviral treatment regimen. One month later, he reported inconsistent adherence and his viremia level was 5700 c/mL. He did not attend further checkups until September 2005, when his viral load was 181, 000 c/mL. The patient reported interrupting his medications approximately three weeks after simplification. The genotyping resistance testing assay was performed both on HIV RNA and HIV DNA from plasma, yielding an identical pattern with the isolate presence of the K 103 N mutation in the prevalent strain. CONCLUSION: Persistence of the K 103 N mutation as a majority quasispecies may ensue after a very short exposure to efavirenz. Our case would therefore suggest that the presence of the K 103 N mutation should always be ruled out by genotyping resistance testing assays, even after minimal exposures to efavirenz...|$|E

40|$|Fifty-one mutants of Kluyveromyces lactis that cannot grow on lactose (Lac-) were {{isolated}} and characterized. All of the mutations are in nuclear genes, are recessive in their wild-type allele and define seven complementation groups, which we designate lac 3 through lac 9. <b>Strains</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations in lac 3, lac 5, lac 7, lac 8 and lac 9 are also unable to grow on galactose (Gal-). Since the Gal- and Lac- phenotype co-segregate, {{they are probably}} due to a single mutation. <b>Strains</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations {{in any of the}} seven complementation groups grow normally on glucose. However, <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations in lac 3, lac 5 and lac 6 do not grow on glucose if lactose is also present in the medium. Likewise, <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations in lac 3 and lac 5 do not grow on glucose in the presence of galactose. Complementation groups lac 4 and lac 5 are loosely linked and map within a cluster of auxotrophic mutations on a chromosome that we designate chromosome 2. The remaining five groups are unlinked. Thus, there is no evidence for clustering of Lac genes into an operon-like regulatory unit. ——To further characterize the nature of the Lac- phenotype, the basal and inducible level of β-galactosidase activity were measured. All mutants had nearly normal basal enzyme levels, except those in lac 4, which had barely detectable levels. Inducible enzyme levels varied from barely detectable levels in mutants bearing lac 4 mutations up to four-fold inducible levels in <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> mutations in other complementation groups. In all cases, however, induction levels were below the 30 -fold level obtained in wild-type cells. Three <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> lac 5 mutations contain increased enzyme activity in the absence of inducer, indicating constitutive synthesis of β-galactosidase. In summary, these data indicate that several genes are necessary for synthesis of β-galactosidase activity...|$|R

30|$|The primary {{limitations}} of the growth competition p 53 assay as designed and presented in this work were the inability to accurately measure mutant activities in the 30 – 55 % wild type activity range and the inability to quantitatively measure the growth rates of strains expressing low activity p 53 mutants. We hypothesize that both limitations arise from suboptimal assay design, i.e. a non-linear response in growth rate of the mutant <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> {{to changes in the}} specific activity of the mutant p 53 being expressed by the strain. It may be possible to overcome these limitations by optimizing several parameters. For example, {{it may be possible to}} discriminate lower activity mutants under conditions of high p 53 protein concentration or to discriminate high activity mutants under limiting protein concentrations. To this end, the assay could be redesigned to express p 53 under the control of a variable strength promoter such as CUP 1 (Robinson et al. 1996) or GAL 1 (Inga et al. 2002) or under the control of an optimized fixed strength promoter. A second parameter of the assay that might be optimized is the rate of reporter molecule production which allows growth in the presence of active p 53. Several options are available to this end. The most attractive would involve switching the reporter from the ADE 2 system to a HIS 3 reporter. The His 3 p enzyme is stoichiometrically inhibited by 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole (AT) (Bitter et al. 2002). Therefore, varying amounts of AT could be used to modulate His 3 p levels to concentrations appropriate to discriminate different levels of activity in p 53 mutants. Alternatively, different p 53 response elements could be utilized in the reporter construct which result in different levels of reporter transcription (Tomso et al. 2005; Inga et al. 2002; Campomenosi et al. 2001; Resnick and Inga 2003).|$|E
40|$|Isoelectric {{focusing}} {{was used}} to compare the complement of phosphoglucose isomerase isoenzymes in a wild-type strain of Saccharomyces cereuisiae and in a strain with a deletion in the PGt l structural gene. Deletion of the PGt 1 gene did not result {{in the absence of the}} high-K, isoenzyme I but the low-K, isoenzyme I 1 was absent. Hence, the isoenzymes must be the products of two genes. If PGIl were the sole structural gene its deletion would result in the disappearance of both isoenzymes. After a temperature shift-up a cdc 30 -bearing strain had cell cycle arrested and contained only 8 % of the polysaccharide in the wild-type. Phosphoglucose isomerase is required for the synthesis of fructose 6 -phosphate (F 6 -P), a precursor of the cell wall components chitin and mannoprotein (‘mannan’), which are a polysaccharide and contain polysaccharide, respectively. Since the cdc 30 mutation confers a temperature-sensitive phosphoglucose isomerase, the likely explanation for cell cycle arrest caused by this mutation is that the defective phosphoglucose isomerase results in a reduction of F 6 -P and hence an inability to synthesize the mannan and chitin needed for cytokinesis and cell separation. Revertants of apgil- 1 <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> were selected for their ability to grow on glucose at 25 “C and this yielded a number of different phenotypes. Amongst the isolates was a strain which had undergone an intragenic reversion at the pgil locus, designated pgil- 1, 100. This mutation permits growth and cell division at 25 “C but results in cell cycle arrest at 36 O C. These results are all consistent with the notion that in S. cereuisiae there are two genes (PGIl and CDC 30) which encode the low-K, and high-K, isoenzymes, respectively, of phosphoglucose isomerase and that the two gene products physically interact for activity...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY The turbidimetric {{responses}} of {{a strain of}} Escherichia coli K 12 to gentamicin and tobramycin were investigated. Both agents showed antibacterial activity below the conventionally measured minimum inhibitory concentration, but exposure to such subinhibitory concentrations of either agent generated a bacterial population which was able to grow in previously inhibitory con-centrations at a rate equivalent {{to that of the}} parent culture. The increase in resistance was non-specific in that both aminoglycosides were equally affected, and was unstable on multiple passage in drug-free broth. The response to tobramycin was unaffected by the presence of an R factor conferring gentamicin resistance, but exposure of the R factor <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> to gentamicin caused a concomitant increase in the resistance to tobramycin, apparently by a non-specific adaptive mechanism similar to that observed with the parent strain. It is suggested that prior treatment of a gentamicin-resistant organism with gentamicin (as may occur during blind therapy) may adversely affect the subsequent response to other aminoglycosides. Gentamicin is now widely used as the treatment of choice for many serious Gram-negative infections. Tobramycin has a similar spectrum of activity to gentamicin (Benveniste and Davies, 1973; Andrews et al., 1973) but is unaffected by some of the bacterial enzymes which inactivate gentamicin. The difference between an adequate therapeutic dosage and toxic dosage of these drugs is small, especially in patients with renal failure (Noone et al., 1974; Mawer et al., 1974). It is therefore desirable that the most efficient way of using them be established. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the interaction between drug and bacterium we have investigated the response of a strain of Escherichia coli K 12 to various concentrations of gentamicin and tobramycin by continuous turbidimetric monitoring and have attempted to assess the effect of possession of an R factor conferring resistance to gentamicin alone on the responses to gentamicin and tobramycin...|$|E

Markers of different immune cells were analyzed by immune-flow cytometry and secretary cytokines by ELISA, besides monitoring tumor growth. Increase in the expression of innate (NK and monocytes) and adaptive CD 4 +cells, and a decrease in B cells (CD 19) have been observed after the combined treatment, suggestive of activation of anti-tumor immune response. Interestingly, immature dendritic cells were found to be down regulated, while their functional markers CD 86 and MHC II were up regulated in the remaining dendritic cells following the combination treatment. Similarly, decrease in the CD 4 (+) naïve cells with concomitant increase in activated CD 4 + cells corroborated the immune activation. Further, a shift from Th 2 and Th 17 to Th 1 besides a decrease in inflammatory cytokines was also observed in the animals showing complete response (cure; tumor free survival). This shift was also complimented by respective antibody class switching followed by the combined treatment. The immune activation or alteration in the homeostasis favoring antitumor immune response may be due to depletion in T regulatory cells (CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) FoxP 3 (+)). Altogether, these results suggest that early differential immune activation is responsible for the heterogenous response to the combined treatment.

However, glucose is expensive for industrial applications and starch is an economical alternative. Simultaneous cold starch hydrolysis and fermentation was investigated for ethanol production from wheat starch particles. With {{a view to}} minimize process costs while maintaining a satisfactory ethanol yield, both a recombinant yeast cell and an inexpensive medium were tested for their fermentation abilities. Initially, NRRL Y 132 strain was compared to Muntons yeast for their abilities to produce ethanol from glucose. Both the wild-type and the recombinant NRRL Y 132 strains were cultured on soluble starch {{to determine if the}} plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> could produce ethanol without the addition of α-amylase. Finally, Muntons yeast was cultured on starch particles using both expensive and inexpensive media. Sequential hydrolysis and fermentation runs were performed using the inexpensive medium, with hydrolysis carried out at 30 °C, 37. 5 °C, 45 °C and 52. 5 °C. The wild-type, NRRL Y 132 strain grew faster and produced more ethanol than Muntons yeast when cultured on glucose. Compared to the wild-type strain, the recombinant NRRL Y 132 strain did not show enhanced ethanol production from soluble starch. The results of the simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation runs showed that the ethanol yields for runs performed in expensive medium (0. 41, 0. 38 and 0. 42 g ethanol / g glucose) were slightly lower than those for runs performed in the inexpensive medium (0. 46, 0. 44 and 0. 43 g ethanol / g glucose). The growth rates for the expensive and inexpensive media runs were comparable. Hence, it was concluded that the inexpensive medium can be used for ethanol production from starch particles with good ethanol productivities. For the sequential hydrolysis and fermentation runs, it was observed that the growth rates (0. 11, 0. 10, 0. 10 and 0. 11 h- 1) as well as the ethanol yields (0. 44, 0. 37, 0. 44 and 0. 39 g ethanol / g glucose) were similar in spite of the four different hydrolysis temperatures. Therefore, it was concluded that increasing the temperature above 30 °C for enhancing starch particle hydrolysis does not increase fermentation productivity significantly...|$|E
40|$|White {{biotechnology}} {{has demonstrated}} a vast growth {{during the last}} decade, mainly thanks to its sustainable advantages compared to classical chemical processes. To maintain this growth, different micro-organisms are being studied as potential cell factories. Among these micro-organisms, Streptomyces lividans has received increasing attention as a host {{for the production of}} heterologous proteins. To enable rational strain improvement strategies, a thorough understanding of the impact of introducing heterologous genes in S. lividans is indispensable. This dissertation focusses on understanding the metabolic burden in S. lividans TK 24 caused by the introduction of a heterologous gene. This is achieved by comparing a 13 C-metabolic flux analysis of a cellulase A producing strain and an empty plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain,</b> yielding a quantitative characterisation of the central carbon metabolism during exponential growth. This dissertation reports the first implementation of 13 C-metabolic flux analysis in the research group as well as the first 13 C-analysis of a heterologous protein producing S. lividans overall. Since flux estimation accuracy in 13 C-metabolic flux analysis is heavily influenced by the used 13 C-tracer (mixture), wet lab experiments are preceded by an optimal experimental design study. A complete framework for cost-effective design of 13 C-tracer experiments is built and illustrated on two different networks to demonstrate its generic nature. Firstly, the search for the optimal design is implemented based on a linearised and a non-linear approach. In both cases, validation is based on a single scalar value, i. e the D-criterion and the S-criterion, respectively. It is demonstrated that both approaches lead to the same optimal design. Secondly, this optimal design is further complemented with a simultaneous minimisation of experimental cost. Optimal mixtures are obtained which pose a noticeable decrease in cost as compared to 100 % 1, 2 -GLC, which was identified in previous research as the most effective tracer. This deviation from previous defined optimal mixtures highlights the importance for an a priori experimental design when studying a new organism or strain. The multi-objective approach also offers a way to evaluate the information loss when budget is constrained. Flux distributions in the central carbon metabolism are finally calculated for a recombinant S. lividans strain, producing a thermostable cellulase, and a S. lividans reference strain. A comprehensive, stationary 13 C-metabolic flux analysis is applied on both strains, including the application of the implemented optimal experimental design framework. Replicate batch tracer experiments are performed with the optimally determined glucose tracer mixture. Mass isotopomer data are obtained by setting up GC-MS protocols for the analysis of proteinogenic amino acids. Highest flux estimation accuracy is finally obtained by fitting the experimental data of two tracer experiments simultaneously, thereby accounting for biological variations. This framework now forms the basis for any future work on 13 C-metabolic flux analysis with S. lividans. A clear metabolic shift is observed in the recombinant protein producing strain compared to the reference strain, clearly indicating a metabolic burden. Most prominent differences are the increased secretion of organic acids, suggesting a possible imbalance in the production of precursor metabolites, and the increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and the citric acid cycle, leading to an excess cofactor generation. The quantified impact of introducing a heterologous gene in S. lividans can now be applied in rational strain improvement strategies. An increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway during enhanced protein production is confirmed to be a recurring observation in heterologous protein producing micro-organisms. Overexpression of these genes offers a first rational strain improvement strategy for S. lividans based on fluxomic analysis. In addition, the found flux map can be used as additional constraints in genome-wide genetic modification simulations. When implemented, the envisioned modifications of these engineered strains can easily be quantified due to availability of an in- house multi-objective framework for 13 C-MFA. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a {{high value}} {{biopolymer}} that has numerous biomedical and cosmetic applications. It is currently derived from two sources, namely animal tissues and bacterial fermentation (Fong Chong et al. 2005).

High Mw HA has surgical applications, and therefore constitutes {{a major component of}} the lucrative HA market. The current need is largely met by extraction from animal tissues, e. g., rooster comb and bovine vitreous humor (Shiedlin et al. 2004). However, the potential of contamination with adventitious agents (e. g., viruses) have raised regulatory concerns regarding the use of animal extracts in pharmaceutical products. Moreover, with recent reports of zoonotic diseases (e. g., bovine spongiform encephalitis and avian influenza virus), pharmaceutical companies are moving towards microbial HA sources. Although HA obtained from bacterial fermentation does not have the problem of viral contamination, this approach has not yet resulted in a process where HA of sufficiently high Mw for surgical applications can be derived. While {{attempts have been made to}} produce higher Mw HA through cross-linking, cross-linked HA is undesirable for certain medical procedures (e. g., ophthalmic applications) which requires a natural polymer with a short half-life. Nevertheless, due to its availability and the relative ease of purification, bacterial fermentation has the potential of replacing extraction from animal tissues as a preferred commercial source of HA. This thesis presents a good example of a metabolic engineering study where modern techniques (e. g., molecular biology, fermentation and omics technologies) are used to explain complex cell metabolism. The hypothesis for this study was that the precursors to HA, i. e., UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and consequently the genes involved in precursor generation, are important for HA Mw. However, environmental manipulation, e. g., anaerobic versus aerobic or glucose versus maltose, often results in large global changes in metabolite concentration and enzyme activities. This makes it impossible to resolve issues related to Mw control. Classical statistical methods do not provide a meaningful inference as the number of explanatory variables always exceeds the number of independent observations. Hence, it is difficult to distinguish between causative and accidental correlation. This work first examined the influence of manipulation of metabolite concentrations in the hyaluronan pathway to find an explanation for the mechanism of Mw control. To achieve this, the five essential genes of the hyaluronan synthesis (has) operon in Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus) were first examined. These genes are involved in two pathways which lead to the production of either UDP-glucuronic acid or UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Overexpression of genes involved in UDP-glucuronic acid biosynthesis decreased HA Mw, while overexpression of genes involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthesis increased HA Mw. The Mw variation generated provided a stepping stone for further understanding of Mw control of HA. The highest Mw observed was achieved with combined overexpression of pgi and glmU. This study proved that there is a positive correlation between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw. The first model for HA Mw control based on the concentration of activated sugar precursors is described in this study (Chapter 3). This correlation observed led to the hypothesis that high Mw HA can be achieved when an appropriate balance of the two HA precursor is maintained. Three genes in the two precursor pathways are not found in the has operon of S. zooepidemicus. To obtain a complete overview of all genes in the HA pathway, these genes were also examined using overexpression studies. Individual overexpression of these genes had negligible effects on HA Mw and production. Despite the positive correlation previously observed between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw, sequential overexpression of genes involved in the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine precursor pathway did not increase Mw of HA produced. This is surprising since the highest pool of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine was achieved in this case. This suggests that a threshold effect is present in the correlation between UDP-N-acetylglucosamine and Mw. This threshold effect may be defined by a balance between the two precursors. To investigate this phenomenon further, the precursor ratio was also manipulated by co-metabolising glucose and N-acetylglucosamine. Similar to the previous experiment, a significant increase in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine levels was observed despite only a marginal increase in Mw (Chapter 4). Surprisingly, an increase in Mw was observed with the introduction of a plasmid in S. zooepidemicus. This plasmid effect was studied on a global scale using transcriptome and proteome analysis to understand the changes occurring in the system. The increase in Mw due to the plasmid effect is independent of the functions, i. e., nisin promoter or antibiotic resistance, encoded in the plasmid. A gene involved in UDP-N-acetylglucosamine production, UDP-N-acetylglucosamide 1 -carboxivinyltransferase (murA), was significantly down-regulated in both the plasmid <b>bearing</b> <b>strain</b> and the high Mw strain (pgi). In addition, overexpression of murA decreased both the concentration of activated sugar precursors and HA Mw. There was however no evidence of down-regulation of murA in the plasmid containing strain from transcriptomics data. This suggests that control is exerted either at the translation level or by protein degradation (Chapter 5). This thesis contributes and represents an ongoing effort to understand the elusive mechanism of Mw control of HA...|$|E

In subjects <  65 years old (153  cases, 153  controls), cagA seropositivity {{was associated with a}} 1. 80 -fold increase (95 % CI 1. 07  to 3. 03, p =  0. 02) in myocardial infarction risk, which increased further to 2. 25 -fold (95 % CI 1. 12  to 4. 53, p =  0. 01) in subjects <  55 years. There was no significant association of cagA status with classical coronary heart disease risk factors. H pylori seropositivity was present in 60. 2 % of cases and 53. 7 % of controls (odds ratio 1. 12,  95 % CI 0. 83  to 1. 51, p =  0. 43). H pylori seropositivity was not increased in young cases and did not show any interaction with age.  CONCLUSIONS—The association of chronic H pylori infection with risk of myocardial infarction appears to be restricted to cagA <b>bearing</b> <b>strains.</b> The association is age dependent and stronger in younger subjects. Genetic heterogeneity of H pylori may explain some of the discordant findings with regard to the association of H pylori with coronary heart disease.    Keywords: coronary heart disease; risk factors; Helicobacter pylor...|$|R

The plasmids were either repressed or derepressed in conjugal genetic transfer functions. The <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> pF 54 and pH 247 repressed in transfer functions (pColVF 54 luminal diameter r and pColVH 247 luminal diameter r) adhered in higher numbers to the murine tissue than did the host strain lacking the plasmid or the strains containing the plasmids with active transfer functions (pColVF 54 drd and pColVH 247 drd). The number of cells (CFU) of strain 291 (pColVF 54 luminal diameter r) adherent to the tissue was related directly to the time of incubation (up to 30 min) and to the number of cells (CFU) to which the tissues were exposed. As indicated by tests for sensitivity to F factor (F) -pilus-specific bacteriophages, the cells of <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> the plasmids derepressed for conjugal functions had F pili on their surfaces, while such structures were missing from cells of the parental strain (291) and the strains containing the plasmids in repressed form. This finding was supported by transmission electron microscopy of cells of strain 291, 291 (pColVF 54 luminal diameter r), and 291 (pColVF 54 drd). F pili could be seen on cells of the latter strain but not on those of the parental strain or the <b>strain</b> <b>bearing</b> pColVF 54 luminal diameter r. Pili other than F pili were not seen on cells of the <b>strains</b> <b>bearing</b> pF 54 in either form. Strains 291 (pColVF 70 drd) and 291 (pColVF 70 luminal diameter r) adhered to the tissues in numbers comparable to those of strain 291. Nevertheless, these findings are further evidence that for certain colicin V plasmids (A. M. Nilius and D. C. Savage, Infect. Immun. 43 : 947 - 953, 1984), conjugal genetic transfer functions influence properties that may be important in the pathogenesis of invasive E. coli strains...|$|R
