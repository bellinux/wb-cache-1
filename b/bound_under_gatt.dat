40|$|GATT’s framers {{realized}} that trade liberalization would require periodic adjustments {{to take into}} account particular problems that would arise in particular industries. The original GATT provided that tariff reductions that led to such problems could be renegotiated. In an emergency, a country could raise its tariff first, then negotiate compensation with the principal exporting countries. GATT also includes a long list of other provisions that allow import restrictions, and over time, these provisions have proven to be quite fungible. Whatever the reason behind a government’s “need ” to raise a tariff rate, the action could be given legal cover under any number of provisions. Over time, countries whose tariffs have been effectively <b>bound</b> <b>under</b> the <b>GATT</b> have used different instruments to deal with troublesome imports: renegotiations were eventually replaced by negotiated quantitative restraints (VERs), VERs in turn gave way to antidumping. The problem was always the same [...] troublesome imports [...] but the politically and legally most convenient instrument to deal with these troublesome imports changed. From the perspective of both economic and political sense, none of these instrument...|$|R

The mechanism <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> 1947 had many weaknesses which resulted to the need of reform. The procedure <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> 1947 was not contradictory and {{all members of the}} Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) were entitled to use the veto right when adopting the reports. The contracting parties were conscious of such weaknesses and they have agreed on a new dispute settlement system during the Uruguay round. The Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) is part of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The new system remains inter-state mechanism and as a consequence, available only to the Member States, excluding individuals and business operators. The dispute settlement under WTO has become compulsory while leaving each member the choice between this standard procedure and other dispute modes, such as Good Offices, Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. The dispute settlement system has been unified and has become more judicial. It excludes national jurisdictions and means strengthening the multilateralism. The dispute settlement is administrated by the Dispute Settlement Body, [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international dispute settlement procedures can contribute to states’ compliance with these dispute settlement mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose <b>under</b> <b>GATT)</b> and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO). In {{each of the four}} comparisons the US acted more in accordance with the judicial WTO dispute settlement procedures than with the diplomatic GATT procedures. We can therefore say that contrary to realist assumptions, the judicialization of dispute settlement procedures can contribute to their effectiveness. However, contrary to idealist assumptions the effectiveness of international dispute settlement procedures does not automatically follow from their judicialization. Yet, as assumed by institutionalists, judicialized dispute settlement procedures are better than diplomatic dispute settlement mechanisms in sustaining states’ compliance with these procedures precisely because of their normative and strategic effects...|$|R

40|$|This article 2 ̆ 7 s {{examination}} {{of the status of}} third parties <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> is important for several reasons, one of which is the proliferation of third party participation as demonstrated by Bananas III. A second reason for its importance is that there has been little written about third parties <b>under</b> <b>GATT.</b> This neglect stands in sharp contrast to ample literature on the related subject of greater public participation in the WTO. The oversight could be a function of GATT dispute resolution, which did not always enjoy the level of public attention it garners today. Until recently the GATT system handled no more than about a dozen disputes a year. 2 ̆ 2 Many countries were often content to ignore GATT dispute resolution, either because the system itself was poorly understood or because GATT was perceived as irrelevant to national development.

40|$|The {{subject-matter}} of {{this article}} is the recently altered trade policy and practice of Australia and their consistency with the WTO multilateral trading policies and principles. Following its unhappy experience with the power and politics driven trading <b>under</b> <b>GATT,</b> Australia unequivocally supported the legalistic approach of the WTO trading system during the Uruguay Round. Its active participation in the WTO has given it a fair share of global free trade. The rule-based trading framework of the WTO protects, more often than not, Australia from powerful trading states and blocs using their economic clout to gain unfair terms of trade. Australia has recently opted to pursue its multi-track trading together with its commitments to WTO multilateral trade liberalization. Since 2002, it has been negotiating a preferential bilateral free trade agreement with its preferred trading partners. The flurry of such negotiations has resulted in the conclusion of a preferential bilateral free trade agreement with Singapore in 2003. Negotiation towards a similar agreement with the U. S. is ongoing. A preferential trade agreement (PTA) is by nature discriminatory and as such inconsistent with the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) rule <b>under</b> <b>GATT</b> Article I. Despite this apparent contradiction, GATT Article XXIV permits bilateral PTAs as an exception to the MFN rule under certain explicit conditions, which militate against discriminatory, differential and unequal trading deals among WTO members. This article examines {{the extent to which the}} existing and potential PTAs of Australia comply with the conditions of GATT Article XXIV. It concludes that these PTAs are not complementary, if not obstructive alternatives, to the WTO multilateral free trading system. They are not in the best long-term trading interest of Australia either. 19 page(s...|$|R

In this book, Petros Mavoidis offers detailed examination of the GATT regime for international trade, discussing the negotiating record, policy background, economic rationale, and case law. Mavroidis offers a substantive first chapter that provides a detailed historical background to GATT that stretches from the 1927 World Economic Conference through Bretton Woods and the Atlantic Charter. Each of the following chapters examines the disciplines agreed to, their negotiating record, their economic rationale, and subsequent practice. Mavroidis focuses on cases that have influenced the prevailing understanding of the norm, as well as on literature that has contributed to its interpretation, and the final outcome. In particular, he examines quantitative restrictions and tariffs; the most favored nation clause (MFN), the cornerstone of the GATT edifice; preferential trade agreements and special treatment for products originating in developing countries; domestic instruments; and exceptions to the obligations assumed <b>under</b> <b>GATT.</b> This book’s companion volume examines World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements regulating trade in goods.

This paper argues that, from the perspective of the poorest countries, a multi-pronged strategy is required to strengthen the global trading system and that much of the agenda must be addressed outside the WTO. The most important contribution the WTO can make from a development perspective is to improve market access conditions for goods and services and ensure that trade rules are useful to developing countries. Enhancing trade capacity requires concerted action outside the WTO (aid for trade) as well as unilateral actions by both industrialized and developing countries to reduce anti-trade biases. ...|$|R
