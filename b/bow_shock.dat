5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E

5|$|At about 75 Jupiter radii {{from the}} planet, the {{interaction}} of the magnetosphere with the solar wind generates a <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a magnetosheath—a region between it and the <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> The solar wind interacts with these regions, elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from the solar wind.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bow</b> <b>shocks</b> {{are also}} a common feature in Herbig Haro objects, in which a much {{stronger}} collimated outflow {{of gas and dust}} from the star interacts with the interstellar medium, producing bright <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> that are visible at optical wavelengths.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the comet-solar wind {{interaction}} is studied by analyzing the detailed evolution of the plasma wave spectra of Comet Giacobini-Zinner across the interaction region. Electron heat fluxes and associated electron plasma waves, steepened low-frequency wave packets, and density fluctuations observed upstream of Giacobini-Zinner shocks are also found upstream of quasi-parallel <b>bow</b> <b>shocks.</b> Downstream, the pulsations in the cometary magnetic field magnitude, {{in addition to the}} large density spikes, are usually also found downstream of quasi-parallel <b>bow</b> <b>shocks.</b> Other similarities to interplanetary <b>shocks</b> and terrestrial <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> are described...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMassive {{stars that}} have been ejected from their parent cluster and supersonically sailing away through the {{interstellar}} medium (ISM) are classified as exiled. They generate circumstellar bow-shock nebulae that can be observed. We present two-dimensional, axisymmetric hydrodynamical simulations of {{a representative sample of}} stellar wind <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> from Galactic OB stars in an ambient medium of densities ranging from n_ISM =  0. 01 up to 10. 0 [*]cm^− 3. Independently of their location in the Galaxy, we confirm that the infrared is the most appropriated waveband to search for <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> from massive stars. Their spectral energy distribution is the convenient tool to analyse them since their emission does not depend on the temporary effects which could affect unstable, thin-shelled <b>bow</b> <b>shocks.</b> Our numerical models of Galactic <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> generated by high-mass (≈ 40 [*]M_⊙) runaway stars yield H α fluxes which could be observed by facilities such as the SuperCOSMOS H-Alpha Survey. The brightest bow-shock nebulae are produced in the denser regions of the ISM. We predict that <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> in the field observed at H α by means of Rayleigh-sensitive facilities are formed around stars of initial mass larger than about 20 [*]M_⊙. Our models of <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> from OB stars have the emission maximum in the wavelength range 3 [*]≤[*]λ[*]≤[*] 50 [*]μm which can be up to several orders of magnitude brighter than the runaway stars themselves, particularly for stars of initial mass larger than 20 [*]M_⊙...|$|R
5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|The shell {{would be}} {{vulnerable}} to impacts from interstellar bodies, such as comets, meteoroids, and material in interstellar space that is currently being deflected by the Sun's <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> The heliosphere, and any protection it theoretically provides, would cease to exist.|$|E
5|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the denser and colder solar wind's plasma from the hotter and less dense one within Jupiter's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The distance from the magnetopause {{to the center of}} the planet is from 45 to 100 RJ (where RJ=71,492km is the radius of Jupiter) at the subsolar point—the unfixed point on the surface at which the Sun would appear directly overhead to an observer. The position of the magnetopause depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. In front of the magnetopause (at a distance from 80 to 130RJ from the planet's center) lies the <b>bow</b> <b>shock,</b> a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's <b>bow</b> <b>shock,</b> {{where the}} {{magnetosphere}} begins {{to slow the}} solar wind, occurs {{at a distance of}} 34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} is {{a complex}} structure comprising a <b>bow</b> <b>shock,</b> magnetosheath, magnetopause, magnetotail, magnetodisk, and other components. The magnetic field around Jupiter emanates {{from a number of}} different sources, including fluid circulation at the planet's core (the internal field), electrical currents in the plasma surrounding Jupiter and the currents flowing at the boundary of the planet's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is embedded within the plasma of the solar wind, which carries the interplanetary magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The {{interaction}} between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects {{similar to that of}} the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere. The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bow</b> <b>shocks</b> are {{stationary}} and {{are formed}} when two particle streams collide with each other. They are present near the hottest {{stars in the}} nebula where the stellar wind speed {{is estimated to be}} thousands of kilometers per second and in the outer parts of the nebula where the speeds are tens of kilometers per second. <b>Bow</b> <b>shocks</b> can also form at the front end of stellar jets when the jet hits interstellar particles.|$|R
40|$|N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that the dynamical decay of the young (∼ 1 Myr) Orion Nebula cluster could be responsible for the loss of at least half of its initial content of OB stars. This result suggests that other young stellar systems could also lose a significant fraction of their massive stars {{at the very beginning of}} their evolution. To confirm this expectation, we used the Mid-Infrared Galactic Plane Survey (completed by the Midcourse Space Experiment satellite) to search for <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> around a number of young (< ∼ several Myr) clusters and OB associations.

5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be understood as the field lines wrapping around an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a <b>bow</b> <b>shock,</b> magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
5|$|All Galilean moons have thin atmospheres with surface {{pressures}} {{in the range}} 0.01–1nbar, which in turn support substantial ionospheres with electron densities {{in the range of}} 1,000–10,000cm−3. The co-rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres, creating wedge-shaped structures known as Alfvén wings. The interaction of the large moons with the co-rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non-magnetized planets like Venus, although the co-rotational speed is usually subsonic (the speeds vary from 74 to 328km/s), which prevents the formation of a <b>bow</b> <b>shock.</b> The pressure from the co-rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons' atmospheres (especially from that of Io), and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co-rotation. This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent. In effect, the Galilean moons (mainly Io) serve as the principal plasma sources in Jupiter's inner and middle magnetosphere. Meanwhile, the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons' surfaces (except Ganymede's).|$|E
5|$|At the {{subsolar point}} the <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> stands 1900km (0.3 Rv, where Rv is the radius of Venus) {{above the surface}} of Venus. This {{distance}} was measured in 2007 near the solar activity minimum. Near the solar activity maximum it can be several times further from the planet. The magnetopause {{is located at the}} altitude of 300km. The upper boundary of the ionosphere (ionopause) is near 250km. Between the magnetopause and ionopause there exists a magnetic barrier—a local enhancement of the magnetic field, which prevents solar plasma from penetrating deeper into the Venusian atmosphere, at least near solar activity minimum. The magnetic field in the barrier reaches up to 40nT. The magnetotail continues up to ten radiuses from the planet. It is the most active part of the Venusian magnetosphere. There are reconnection events and particle acceleration in the tail. The energies of electrons and ions in the magnetotail are around 100eV and 1000eV respectively.|$|E

Bipolar outflows are {{often found in}} dense, dark clouds. They tend {{to be associated with}} the very youngest stars (ages less than 10,000 years), and are closely related to the molecular <b>bow</b> <b>shocks.</b> Indeed, the <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> are thought to sweep up or [...] "entrain" [...] dense gas from the surrounding cloud to form the bipolar outflow.|$|R
5|$|Classified as a red supergiant of {{spectral}} type M1-2, {{the star}} {{is one of the}} largest and most luminous stars visible to the naked eye. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, wholly engulfing the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and possibly Jupiter. Calculations of its mass range from slightly under ten to a little over twenty times that of the Sun. It is calculated to be 640 light-years away, yielding an absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this runaway star has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30km/s, creating a <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to explode as a supernova within the next million years.|$|E
25|$|As with Earth's magnetosphere, the {{boundary}} separating the solar wind's plasma from that within Saturn's magnetosphere {{is called the}} magnetopause. The magnetopause distance from the planet's center at the subsolar point varies widely from 16 to 27Rs (Rs=60,330km is the equatorial radius of Saturn). The magnetopause's position depends on the pressure exerted by the solar wind, which in turn depends on solar activity. The average magnetopause standoff distance is about 22Rs. In front of the magnetopause (at the distance of about 27Rs from the planet) lies the <b>bow</b> <b>shock,</b> a wake-like disturbance in the solar wind caused by its collision with the magnetosphere. The region between the <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> and magnetopause is called the magnetosheath.|$|E
25|$|Astrophysical environments feature many {{different}} types of shock waves.

Another interesting type of shock in astrophysics is the quasi-steady reverse shock or termination shock that terminates the ultra relativistic wind from young pulsars.|$|E
40|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} the {{compressed}} interstellar medium around runaway O stars can produce high-energy non-thermal diffuse emission, in particular, non-thermal X-ray and γ-ray emission.

We present a search for non-thermal diffuse X-ray emission from <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> using archived XMM-Newton observations for a clean sample of 6 well-determined runaway O stars. We find {{that none of these}} objects present diffuse X-ray emission associated to their <b>bow</b> <b>shocks,</b> similarly to previous X-ray studies toward ζ Oph and BD+ 43 ^∘ 3654.

40|$|A fundamental, unsolved {{problem in}} Solar System {{formation}} is explaining the melting and crystallization of chondrules found in chondritic meteorites. Theoretical models of chondrule melting in nebular shocks {{has been shown}} to be consistent with many aspects of thermal histories inferred for chondrules from laboratory experiments; but, the mechanism driving these shocks is unknown. Planetesimals and planetary em-bryos on eccentric orbits can produce <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> as they move supersonically through the disk gas, and are one possible source of chondrule-melting shocks. We investigate chondrule formation in <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> around planetoids through 3 D radiation hydrody-namics simulations. A new radiation transport algorithm that combines elements of flux-limited diffusion and Monte Carlo methods is used to capture the complexity of radiative transport around <b>bow</b> <b>shocks.</b> An equation of state that includes the rota-tional, vibrational, and dissociation modes of H 2 is also used. Solids are followed di-rectly in the simulations and their thermal histories are recorded. Adiabatic expansion creates rapid cooling of the gas, and tail shocks behind the embryo can cause secondary heating events. Radiative transport is efficient, and <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> around planetoids can have luminosities ∼few× 10 − 8 L. While barred and radial chondrule textures could be produced in the radiative shocks explored here, porphyritic chondrules may only be possible in the adiabatic limit. We present a series of predicted cooling curves that merit investigation in laboratory experiments to determine whether the solids produced by <b>bow</b> <b>shocks</b> are represented in the meteoritic record by chondrules or other solids.

Kappa Cassiopeiae is a blue supergiant of spectral type BC0.7Ia that is some 302,000 times as luminous as the Sun and has 33 times its diameter. It is a runaway star, moving at around 2.5 million mph relative to its neighbors (1,100 kilometers per second). Its magnetic field and wind of particles creates a visible <b>bow</b> <b>shock</b> 4 light-years ahead of it, colliding with the diffuse, and usually invisible, interstellar gas and dust.
