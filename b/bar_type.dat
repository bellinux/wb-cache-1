2500|$|People {{who choose}} to treat navicular disease through shoeing may use a shoe {{designed}} to lift and support the heels. [...] This can sometimes be accomplished with a flat shoe and trimming alone. Wedge pads or wedged shoes are often used, but can amplify heel-related problems if present. Another strategy {{is to use a}} <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> shoe. Often, an egg-bar shoe, or straight bar shoe. [...] Some horses benefit from shoes that change the breakover of their foot (like a rolled toe). With or without shoes, the hoof must be trimmed {{in such a way as}} to restore the balance and angle that may have been lost. Horses with long toe-low heel conformation need careful trimming to counter this. Horses with upright feet may need their heels lowered and a shoe that will allow their heels to spread. Early intervention is key; in one study, shoeing was successful in 97% of horses treated within ten months of the onset of signs, while only 54% of horses lame for over a year responded.|$|E
2500|$|The Silverliner IVs {{have never}} been officially rebuilt, {{but there have been}} a number of {{modifications}} to the class. [...] The propulsion system was initially upgraded from the original mercury arc–based Ignitron rectifiers to more reliable solid state silicon controlled rectifiers and later the main transformers had their coolant replaced with one that did not contain PCBs. [...] As this change was carried out in the early 1990s, all of the 9000 series Reading cars and some of the Penn Central cars were renumbered into the series 400 through 460 to help keep track of which units had undergone the modification. [...] When the Center City Commuter Connection opened in 1984, the Reading cars were converted to full train automatic door operation to take advantage of the high level platforms at the new Market East Station (now Jefferson Station) and others on the former PRR [...] "side" [...] of the system. [...] In the late 1990s the fleet received its most noticeable upgrade with the original [...] "ketchup and mustard" [...] colored interior replaced with a softer gray motif as well as softer seating. [...] Around 2004 SEPTA began to replace the cowcatcher pilots equipped on the original Reading cars with a <b>bar</b> <b>type</b> pilot to match those on the PRR cars. [...] Starting in 2009 SEPTA began to replace the original Faiveley pantographs with more modern Schunk type units.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of various steel bars exposed to high temperature ("residual" properties) are experimentally investigated up to 850 Â°C, {{with reference to}} a number of steel and <b>bar</b> <b>types</b> (carbon and stainless steel; quenched and self-tempered bars; hot-rolled and cold-worked bars; smooth and deformed bars). The aim is to clarify to what extent the thermal sensitivity of the different bars affects the ultimate capacity of a typical R/C section subjected to an eccentric axial force, past a fire ("residual" capacity). As usual in the design of R/C sections under combined bending and axial loading, the ultimate behavior is represented through the "M-N envelopes", where the materials strength decay due to high temperature is taken into account. The results show that quenched and self-tempered bars (QST), very popular in Europe, are more temperature-sensitive above 600 Â°C than the carbon-steel bars extensively used in the States and nowadays rarely used in Europe. Furthermore, the best response is exhibited by the stainless-steel bars, provided that they are hot rolled, as it is generally the case for medium- and large-diameter bars. Similar conclusions can be drawn for the sections reinforced with the different <b>bar</b> <b>types.</b> 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 105 - 107). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Corrosion of steel reinforcement in bridge decks results in high repair costs, unwanted traffic disruption, and unsafe structures. To help alleviate this problem, non-metallic fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars are being studied as an alternate type of reinforcement in bridge decks. In order to determine the suitability of the use of FRP bars, a number of tests have been performed on FRP bars to evaluate their long-term performance. These tests include uniaxial tension tests under a variety of environmental conditions and thermal expansion of the bars embedded in concrete. In an effort to characterize the FRP bars and to gain insight into their long-term performance, batteries of tests have been carried out. Samples from three different manufacturers were exposed under different environmental conditions and tested in uniaxial tension. For one of the <b>bar</b> <b>types,</b> the strength increased, while the other two <b>bar</b> <b>types</b> lost strength. In all cases, the modulus of the bars increased with exposure time. In addition, FRP reinforced concrete specimens were evaluated for thermal expansion. The results indicate that thermal cracking of the concrete by FRP bar expansion is not a significant problem...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the stem clamp area, the shifter and/or brake lever and grip area on a bar can have several different diameters. For traditional road and mountain handlebars, these diameters are standard and so there has historically been little confusion except when mixing road and mountain components. However, in recent years there have been cross-over <b>bar</b> <b>types</b> that do not fall into one category or the other, and which can conceivably use either type of shifter, brake lever or grip (an example is the upright style bar). For this reason, certain handlebars are now available in multiple sizes related to the shifter or brake lever clamp diameter.|$|R
