40|$|Business process {{reengineering}} {{has been the}} focus of attention of businesses since the early 1990 <b>s</b> (<b>Hammer</b> and Champy 1993). To an extent, existing business process modeling tools (Spurr et al. 1994) provide features to analyze business processes. However, the decision support provided by these tools is often too limited (Yu et al. 1996). For instance, many modeling tools based on IDEF, DFD, etc. lack the necessary means to support the representation of time and resource constraints and most ignore the human and behavioral aspects of reengineering (Davenport and Stoddard 1994). This research depicts the critical aspects of business processes in terms of a four dimensional framework composed of workflow structure, decision structure, information structure, and agency structure. The framework is used to develop a simulation test bed that allows computational modeling of interdependencies among agents, activities, and resources in a business process.

40|$|Adverse {{clinical}} outcomes {{have been associated}} with cumulative anticholinergic burden (to which low-potency as well as high-potency anticholinergic medicines contribute). The clinical indications for which anticholinergic medicines are prescribed (and thus the 'phenotype' of patients with anticholinergic burden) have not been established. We sought to establish the overall prevalence of prescribing of anticholinergic medicines, the prevalence of prescribing of low-, medium- and high-potency anticholinergic medicines, and the clinical indications for which the medicines were prescribed in an older primary care population. This was a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study of Australian early-career general practitioners' (GPs') clinical consultations - the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. In ReCEnT, GPs collect detailed data (including medicines prescribed and their clinical indication) for 60 consecutive patients, on up to three occasions 6 months apart. Anticholinergic medicines were categorized as levels 1 (low-potency) to 3 (high-potency) using the Anticholinergic Drug Scale (ADS). During 2010 - 2014, 879 early-career GPs (across five of Australia's six states) conducted 20 555 consultations with patients aged 65 years or older, representing 35 506 problems/diagnoses. Anticholinergic medicines were prescribed in 10 · 4 % [95 % CIs 9 · 5 - 10 · 5] of consultations. Of the total anticholinergic load of prescribed medicines ('community anticholinergic load') 72 · 7 % [95 % CIs 71 · 0 - 74 · 3] was contributed by Level 1 medicines, 0 · 8 % [95 % CIs 0 · 5 - 1 · 3] by Level 2 medicines and 26 · 5 % [95 % CIs 24 · 8 - 28 · 1] by Level 3 medicines. Cardiac (40 · 0 %), Musculoskeletal (16 · 9 %) and Respiratory (10 · 6 %) were the most common indications associated with Level 1 anticholinergic prescription. For Level 2 and 3 medicines (combined data), Psychological (16 · 1 %), Neurological (16 · 1 %), Musculoskeletal (15 · 7 %) and Urological (11 · 1 %) indications were most common. Anticholinergic medicines are frequently prescribed in Australian general practice, and the majority of the 'community' anticholinergic burden is contributed by 'low'-anticholinergic potency medicines whose anticholinergic effects may be largely 'invisible' to prescribing GPs. Furthermore, the clinical 'phenotype' of the patient with high anticholinergic burden may be very different to common stereotypes (patients with urological, psychological or neurological problems), potentially making recognition of risk of anticholinergic adverse effects additionally problematic for GPs.

Acute supplementation of N-acetylcysteine {{does not}} affect muscle blood flow and {{oxygenation}} characteristics during handgrip exercise. Physiological Reports, 4 (7), 1 - 10. doi: 10. 14814 /phy 2. 12748 N-acetylcysteine (NAC; antioxidant and thiol donor) supplementation has improved exercise performance and delayed fatigue, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. One possibility is NAC supplementation increases limb blood flow during severe-intensity exercise. The purpose {{was to determine if}} NAC supplementation affected exercising arm blood flow and muscle oxygenation characteristics. We hypothesized that NAC would lead to higher limb blood flow and lower muscle deoxygenation characteristics during severe-intensity exercise. Eight healthy nonendurance trained men (21. 8 ± 1. 2 years) were recruited and completed two constant power handgrip exercise tests at 80 % peak power until exhaustion. Subjects orally consumed either placebo (PLA) or NAC (70 mg/kg) 60 min prior to handgrip exercise. Immediately prior to exercise, venous blood samples were collected for determination of plasma redox balance. Brachial artery blood flow (BABF) was measured via Doppler ultrasound and flexor digitorum superficialis oxygenation characteristics were measured via near-infrared spectroscopy. Following NAC supplementaiton, plasma cysteine (NAC: 47. 2 ± 20. 3 ?mol/L vs. PLA: 9. 6 ± 1. 2 ?mol/L; P = 0. 001) and total cysteine (NAC: 156. 2 ± 33. 9 ?mol/L vs. PLA: 132. 2 ± 16. 3 ?mol/L; P = 0. 048) increased. Time to exhaustion was not significantly different (P = 0. 55) between NAC (473. 0 ± 62. 1 sec) and PLA (438. 7 ± 58. 1 sec). Resting BABF was not different (P = 0. 79) with NAC (99. 3 ± 31. 1 mL/min) and PLA (108. 3 ± 46. 0 mL/min). BABF was not different (P = 0. 42) during exercise or at end-exercise (NAC: 413 ± 109 mL/min; PLA: 445 ± 147 mL/min). Deoxy-[hemoglobin+myoglobin] and total-[hemoglobin+myoglobin] were not significantly different (P = 0. 73 and P = 0. 54, respectively) at rest or during exercise between conditions. We conclude that acute NAC supplementation does not alter oxygen delivery during exercise in men. © 2016 Published by the American Physiological Society and The Physiological Society...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with placing the American hard-boiled detective hero—and Raymond Chandler 2 ̆ 7 s Philip Marlowe in particular—within a context of a critique of American individualism. Whereas earlier and contemporary hardboiled detectives display the self-sufficient, self-aggrandizing traits of classic rugged American individualism, Marlowe possesses a more socially conscious code of ethics and a quality of reflection geared toward democratic consideration of the thoughts, beliefs, and ethics of the clients, criminals, and cops with whom he identifies. Where rugged individualist private eyes, such as Dashiell Hammett 2 ̆ 7 s Continental Op and Mickey Spillane 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Mike <b>Hammer,</b> cut themselves off from society and arrogate to themselves the power to judge and condemn others, Marlowe connects members of society that would normally not meet or would be irrevocably antagonistic upon meeting, and prefers negotiation among warring factions over violence. In doing so he reflects the reformation of {{the ideology of the}} autonomous individual insisted upon by John Dewey: Chandler 2 ̆ 7 s hero is a “new” individual inasmuch as he is willing to learn from others, valorizes cooperative action and rigorously monitors and criticizes his own actions. The introduction situates Marlowe historically and generically in the dizzyingly diverse world of crime fiction and, in answer to critics who view him as a socially aloof, quietist, even reactionary figure, emphasizes his liberal credentials. Chapter two defines Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s role as a peacemaker and negotiator, and traces the history of individualism in the United States in order to understand this hero 2 ̆ 7 s actions. The third chapter focuses on his interactions with duly constituted law enforcement officials, underscoring the value of the private detective as a critic of corrupt law enforcement. In chapter four the focus shifts to Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s dealings with members of the underworld and it problematizes the accepted (simplistic) definitions of legitimate and illegitimate activity. The conclusion reiterates the emphasis on non-violence and underscores Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s ability to influence others to perform communal acts. It recognizes the use of the metaphor of social groups as anomic circles and Marlowe 2 ̆ 7 s willingness to work within and across them, Suggesting, in Deweyan fashion, that forging a better society depends on face-to-face association. ...|$|R

50|$|About any mediaeval institutions, {{nothing is}} known, but {{there might have}} been a prayer room on hand in the earlier half of the 15th century, when there were four or five Jewish {{families}} in town. The modern Jewish community, too, began with a prayer room in the 17th or 18th century. Beginning in 1816, this was to be found in a private house (the Werner house at Marumstraße 20). As early as the late 1830s, the building police were threatening to close the roughly 25 m² room as it had become too small for the swelling Jewish community. First, the community strove to secure a plot on Marumstraße (later the site of the Bottlinger house), but this proved to be too small for a new building. Only in 1858, amid great financial sacrifice, was a synagogue built on what is now called Gymnasialstraße, on a piece of land where once had stood a barn. It was a Late Classicist sandstone-block building with round-arched windows and a pyramid roof. The original building was - in comparison with the one that has been preserved - smaller by one window axis; this area was to be occupied by a schoolhouse. About the synagogue’s consecration on 18 June 1858, performed by Chief Rabbi Dr. Auerbach together with the Sobernheim cantor and schoolteacher Alexander Cahn, a newspaper report from the Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums survives from 19 June 1858, written by “Master <b>Bricklayer</b> <b>S.</b> Hadra”:Sobernheim, 18 June 1858. On this day, the local Jewish community celebrated the consecration of its newly built House of God. This is, in relation to the not very numerous Jewish population, built very roomily, so that in the case of growth thereof by as many again, there would still not be a lack of room. The building itself is built in a suitable modern style. The community spared no expense furnishing its House of God in the worthiest way. They even enjoyed valuable donations and contributions from non-resident members. The consecration celebrations were conducted with great pomp. Many friends from near and far attended to participate on this festive day. The festive procession moved from the old prayer house to the new synagogue. Forth under the grand baldachin of the Chief Rabbis, Dr. Auerbach from Bonn and the local cantor and schoolteacher, Mr. Cahn, followed by the bearers of the Scroll of Law. Hereupon followed the choir that has been newly instituted here by Sobernheim’s young women and men, the officials who were invited to the festivities and other members of the community. The synagogue at this memorable celebration was adorned with leaves and wreaths of flowers by the teacher. Chief Rabbi Dr. Auerbach gave a deeply gripping sermon characterizing the day’s importance. On Saturday, the Jewish community’s schoolteacher and cantor Mr. Kahn preached on the theme “Build me a House of God and I shall live among you.” S. Hadra, Master Bricklayer.In 1904, the synagogue was thoroughly renovated and expanded towards the west. About the completion of this work and the synagogue’s reconsecration on 11 and 12 November 1904, a magazine report from Der Israelit survives from 24 November 1904:Sobernheim. 14 November 1904. The 11th and 12th of November were high festive days for the local community, as on these days, the expanded and beautified synagogue was consecrated. To the festivities, many guests from here and elsewhere were invited and they showed up. The consecration service held on Friday afternoon, at which, among others, the mayor, the town executive, the Royal District School Inspector, the principal of the local Realschule and representatives of the schoolboards took part, was opened with the motet “Gesegnet sei, wer da kommt im Namen des Herrn” (“Blessed be He who Cometh in the Lord’s Name”), presented by the synagogue choir. Hereupon, the community’s schoolteacher, Mr. Berendt, read out, in an upliftingly expressive voice, Psalm 110. After the choir then sang Ma Tovu (מה טבו), leadership member Mr. Michel’s eldest daughter presented a prologue in exemplary fashion and handed the community head, Mr. M. Marum, the key to the holy ark. He then gave a speech thanking, in brief but heartfelt words, all those who had contributed to the completion of the building work. Upon this, Mr. Marum opened the holy ark and bestowed upon it its ceremonial function. While the choir sang Vaychi benisa (ויחי בנסע), leadership member Mr. Löb took out one of the Torah scrolls and handed it to Mr. Berendt, who with a festive voice spoke the following: “And this is the teaching that Moses set before the Children of Israel, and in this teaching is the Word that served Israel as a banner on its long wandering through history, around which it gathered, the Word, which was its guiding star in friendly and dreary days: Hear, O Israel, the Everlasting, our God, the Everlasting, is the only one.” After the choir and the community had repeated the last words in Hebrew, the Torah scroll was put into the holy ark amid song from the choir for that occasion. Deeply moving and seriously thought-out was Mr. Berendt’s celebratory sermon that followed about the Word of the prophet Isaiah: “ביתי בית תפלה יקרא לכל העמים” (“My house shall be a house of prayer and a house for all people”). After the consecration hereafter performed by him and the reading of the general invocation, the aaronitic blessing was then conferred in Hebrew and German and the consecrational song was presented by the choir. The celebratory service obviously left all participants with an impression fully matching the dignity of the celebration. After a short break, קבלת שבת took place (onset of Shabbat), at which our splendid House of God shone as surely as it had at midday in glorious electric light. On Saturday morning, the main service was held, whereupon the religious celebration concluded. At four o’clock in the afternoon, a banquet began in the hall at the “high castle”. This event, too, went off in the loveliest way, making the festival into a harmonic whole, honouring its organizers and giving all participants a lasting memory. To the following goes credit for the embellishment of the House of God: Mrs. Jakob Kaufmann née van Geldern, who by collections among the women made possible a magnificent parochet; Mr. Ferdinand Herz, who endowed a sumptuous shulchan cover (for the lectern); Mrs. Else Jakobi née Marum from Grünstadt and Mr. B. Steinherb from Aachen, who each donated a richly ornamented Torah mantle. The Family Jakob Marum from Karlsruhe gave a rare carpet that decorates the inside of the House of God.In 1929, the synagogue’s roof was renovated. In August 1930, a memorial tablet to the fallen from Sobernheim in the First World War was put up at the synagogue. On Kristallnacht (9-10 November 1938), the synagogue was demolished and desecrated. The prayer books were burnt. Somebody managed to save the Torah scrolls and the parochet. The memorial tablet to the fallen was broken to bits, but Alfred Marum safely gathered up the bits (he put it back together and on 15 October 1950, set it in the memorial at the graveyard, fractured though it still was; the Jewish worship community of the Bad Kreuznach and Birkenfeld districts replaced it with a replica of the original in January 2005). In 1939, the synagogue was sold to the town, who had in mind to turn the building into an atrium for the Gymnasium. In the Second World War, however, the synagogue was used as a storage room by the Wehrmacht. In 1953, after the war, the building was sold to the owner of the Schmidt department store and thereafter used for furniture storage. Intermediate floors were built inside. In 1971, the building was threatened with being torn down. A broad bypass road was, according to the plans then put forth, to lead right across the plot occupied by the synagogue. Only with great effort could the application to put the building under monumental protection be put through. The town and the owner objected, albeit unsuccessfully. In 1986, the building was once again sold, and then used for drink storage and stockpiling. On 9 November 1989 - the 51st anniversary of Kristallnacht - the Förderverein Synagoge Sobernheim e.V. (Sobernheim Synagogue Promotional Association) was founded. It set itself the goal of conserving the legacy of Jewish culture in Bad Sobernheim. Central to its purpose from the outset were the preservation and renovation of the synagogue. The House of God was to be led to a use that was wise and in line with its dignity. The use to which the building was to be led turned out to be as the new home for the town’s public library, which would allow the space formerly used for worship to keep its original shape (the intermediate floors were to be torn out). In 2001, the town of Bad Sobernheim acquired the synagogue. Through a usage and maintenance agreement, the building passed into the promotional association’s care. In 2002, the roof and the windows were repaired. The Family Marum’s descendents donated a new Star of David for the roof. At once, several memorial events, concerts and even Jewish religious services took place inside, even though at first, it did not look very appealing. In connection with this, close contacts were developed between the promotional association, the Zentralwohlfahrtsstelle der Juden in Deutschland (Central Welfare Post of the Jews in Germany, represented locally by Max-Willner-Haus in Bad Sobernheim) and the Jewish worship community in Bad Kreuznach. In 2003, the first Jewish religious service in 65 years took place at the synagogue. Between 2005 and 2010, the restoration of the old synagogue was undertaken, and it was turned into the Kulturhaus Synagoge. This was festively dedicated on 30 May 2010. The address in Bad Sobernheim is Gymnasialstraße 9.|$|R

Recent phylogenetic analyses provided the first insights into generic relationships within the tribe, {{with a number of}} novel generic relationships discovered. The tribal phylogeny recovered 12 large clades, of which the Conophytum-clade was one the most morphologically diverse based on leaf and capsule characters. The Conophytum-clade is an early-diverging lineage of the Ruschieae and includes the following 10 genera: Cheiridopsis N. E. Br., Conophytum N. E. Br., Enarganthe N. E. Br., Ihlenfeldtia H. E. K. Hartmann, Jensenobotrya A. G. J. Herre, Namaquanthus L. Bolus, Octopoma N. E. Br., Odontophorus N. E. Br., Ruschianthus L. Bolus and Schlechteranthus Schwantes. The present study presents an expanded phylogenetic analysis of the Conophytum-clade, with the sampling of the majority of species in the genera and a representative sampling (56 % of species) of the speciose genus Conophytum. Phylogenetic data for up to nine plastid gene regions (atpB–rbcL, matK, psbJ–petA, rpl 16, rps 16, trnD– trnT, trnL–F, trnQᶷᶷᶢ–rps 16, trnS–trnG) were produced for each of the sampled species. The produced plastid data was analyses using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. The combined plastid phylogenetic analyses were used in combination with morphological, anatomical and palynological data to assess generic and subgeneric circumscriptions within the clade. Upon assessment of generic circumscriptions in the Conophytum-clade, the number of recognised genera in the clade decreased from ten to seven. Arenifera A. G. J. Herre, which had not been sampled in any phylogeny of the Ruschieae, and Octopoma were recovered as polyphyletic, with species placed in the Conophytum-clade, while the type species was placed in the xeromorphic clade of the tribal phylogeny. The species of Arenifera and Octopoma placed in the Conophytum-clade were subsequently included in Schlechteranthus upon assessment of generic circumscriptions between the taxa. Two morphological groupings were recognised within Schlechteranthus, one including the species of Schlechteranthus and the other including species previously recognised as Arenifera and Octopoma. These two morphological groupings were treated as subgenera, with the erection of the new subgenus Microphyllus R. F. Powell. A detailed taxonomic revision of subgenus Microphyllus is presented with a key to species, descriptions of the species (including a new species: S. parvus R. F. Powell & Klak), known geographical distributions and illustrations of the species. In addition to the changes mentioned above, the expanded sampling and phylogenetic analyses of the Conophytum-clade recovered Ihlenfeldtia and Odontophorus embedded in Cheiridopsis. The species of Ihlenfeldtia were recovered with species of heiridopsis subgenus Aequifoliae H. E. K. Hartmann, while the species of Odontophorus were recovered as polyphyletic within the Cheiridopsis subgenus Odontophoroides H. E. K. Hartmann clade. Cheiridopsis was subsequently expanded to include the species of Ihlenfeldtia and Odontophorus, with these species accommodated in the subgenera of Cheiridopsis. The phylogenetic placement and relationship of these species was supported by the shared capsule morphology. The expanded sampling of the clade did not resolve the phylogenetic relationship of the monotypic genera Enarganthe, Jensenobotrya, Namaquanthus and Ruschianthus, with these genera unresolved in the Conophytum-clade. These genera however, exhibit a unique combination of morphological characters, such as a glabrous leaf epidermis and variation in pollen exine and colpi structure, in contrast to the other genera of the clade. The assessment of the generic circumscription of these genera, based on the molecular, morphological, anatomical and palynological data suggested that the generic statuses of these monotypic genera should be maintained. The expanded phylogenetic sampling of the morphologically diverse and speciose genus Conophytum recovered the genus as monophyletic. This monophyly was supported by the unique floral type in Conophytum, with the fused petaloid staminodes forming a tube. None of the sectional classifications were recovered as monophyletic but the phylogenetic analyses did recover a few clades which more or less corresponded to the current sectional classification of the genus. A number of clades were also recovered which included species from a range of different sections. Diverse leaf and floral traits were shown to have evolved numerous times across the genus. This was particularly interesting with regards to the selected floral traits, as the phylogeny indicated a number of switches in floral morphologies across the genus. The floral diversity was assessed in complex species communities of Conophytum across the GCFR, where up to 11 species of Conophytum are found occurring sympatrically, and floral traits were shown to be different across the species within the communities. Pollination competition and adaptation were suggested as possible drivers of floral diversity in the genus, with differences in phenology, anthesis and floral morphology within the species complex communities. The unique floral type of Conophytum has enabled the species to develop a diverse range of specialised flowers, with a variety of structures, scents and colours, resulting in the diverse floral morphologies found across the genus. The complex Conophytum species communities included both closely as well as distantly related species, suggesting the soft papery capsules of Conophytum are wind dispersed. This adaptation to long distance seed dispersal resulted in a significantly higher phylogenetic diversity in Conophytum when compared to its sister genus, Cheiridopsis. A population genetics study of Conophytum also suggested that the capsules may be wind dispersed, with an indication of genetic connectivity between the geographically isolated populations of C. marginatum Lavis across the Bushmanland Inselberg Region. Although the capsules are dispersed by wind, the seeds are released from the hygrochastic capsules by runoff during rainfall events. The relationship between seed dispersal and runoff is evident from the genetic structure of populations of C. maughanii N. E. Br. and C. ratum <b>S.</b> A. <b>Hammer</b> that occur on the tops and the surrounding bases of the inselbergs, as the drainage pattern was found to directly influence population structure in these species. In addition, the AFLP analyses provided insight into the conservation of the flagship species C. ratum. The summit populations of this species were shown to sustain the populations {{at the base of the}} Gamsberg. This finding is especially important, as the distribution of the species is restricted to the Gamsberg inselberg, where mining has already commenced as of this year.
