He is seen wearing clown masks and wigs made from plastic and later kissing drag queen Raven.|$|E
5|$|Tony Gardner ({{designer}}) and {{his company}} Alterian, Inc. were hired to design and create the look of Edna Turnblad on John Travolta. Costume designer Rita Ryack wanted to put Edna into several revealing outfits, so Travolta ended up being encapsulated in prosthetics. He wore silicone prosthetics {{on his head and}} neck, and foam latex arms and legs that connected to a spandex and foam <b>body</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

25|$|Phineas and Ferb: The Best LIVE Tour Ever was a touring two-act {{stage of}} the TV show. A {{projection}} system played video in the same style as the TV show on {{the rear of the}} stage; the characters were first introduced there in their cartoon forms, but then used a backyard slide that continued into a physical slide out of which the live cast members emerged into the real world. The performers wore prosthetics to make their characters resemble their cartoon counterparts-- mostly head pieces, but a full <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> in the cases of Buford and Perry. The 2011-2012 season of the tour began on August 21, 2011 in Lakeland, Florida and ended on April 22, 2012 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The 2012-2013 season began on August 23, 2012 in Wheeling, West Virginia and ran until February 18, 2013 in Chattanooga, Tennessee.|$|E

One of Björk's most avant-garde music videos, it: [...] "plays with minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body". Red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon. Björk actually wore a very close-fitting <b>body</b> <b>suit.</b> Although not as controversial as the [...] "Pagan Poetry" [...] music video, it was still banned from MTV.

During the bridge, the video fades to {{black and white}} and Knowles appears wearing the gold robot suit, and gold and diamond nail rings valued at $36,000 and {{designed}} by Bijules designer Jules Kim. She executes some robotic movements. As the chorus begins to play for the third and final time, digital doubling and mirroring are used to create a collection of dance moves and multiple images Knowles arching her back. The gold outfit is then reused, this time in color. Knowles performs another dance routine with her two backup dancers, then says, [...] "Turn the lights out", and the video ends.|$|E
40|$|<b>Body</b> <b>suits</b> {{harnessed}} to {{systems of}} elastic tethers {{have been proposed}} as means of approximating the effects of normal Earth gravitation on crewmembers of spacecraft in flight to help preserve the crewmembers physical fitness. The suits {{could also be used}} on Earth to increase effective gravitational loads for purposes of athletic training. The suit according to the proposal would include numerous small tether-attachment fixtures distributed over its outer surface so as to distribute the artificial gravitational force as nearly evenly as possible over the wearer s body. Elastic tethers would be connected between these fixtures and a single attachment fixture on a main elastic tether that would be anchored to a fixture on or under a floor. This fixture might include multiple pulleys to make the effective length of the main tether great enough that normal motions of the wearer cause no more than acceptably small variations in the total artificial gravitational force. Among the problems in designing the suit would be equalizing the load in the shoulder area and keeping tethers out of the way below the knees to prevent tripping. The solution would likely include running tethers through rings on the sides. <b>Body</b> <b>suits</b> with a weight or water ballast system are also proposed for very slight spinning space-station scenarios, in which cases the proposed <b>body</b> <b>suits</b> will easily be able to provide the equivalency of a 1 -G or even greater load...|$|R

While further accompanying J Balvin for his rap cameo, the video ends with her staring at the camera before the screen becomes dark. Scenes interspersed through the main plot present Inna playing in sand and touching her body, angle shots of her standing on a rock, or shadowed singer and men with instruments in their hands.|$|E

This distraction allowed Moolah to pull The Kat out of the ring, and when Venis saw {{her out of the}} ring, he declared Runnels the winner. Post-match, The Kat attacked Runnels by stripping her black <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> off to expose her nude colored thong. The rivalry continued in an arm wrestling match at Insurrextion.

500|$|The {{cover sleeve}} and images were shot by Sednaoui. Inspired by French and Japanese pop culture, Sednaoui took {{inspiration}} from Nobuyoshi Araki's work, {{and tried to}} convey a similar aesthetic to the photoshoot. The cover depicts Minogue sitting and surrounded by swirling multi-coloured lights, dressed in a blue Véronique Leroy mini dress. Because Deconstruction wanted to distribute a limited-edition version of the album, Sednaoui had to photograph a separate artwork and dedicate it to those editions. The lenticular sleeve required multiple static cameras to shoot Minogue in the dark. In order to create the long-exposure effect of the lights circulating around the singer, Sednaoui fully dressed himself in a black <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> so he couldn't {{be seen in the}} final shot. However, Minogue remarked that [...] "the shoot was so very difficult but we knew that once we got it right it would be amazing." ...|$|E

In Smallville, Doomsday is represented as a [...] "nice guy" [...] paramedic, who grew up moving from foster home to foster home. His storyline is considered [...] "very dark" [...] in that the character uncovers horrible truths about himself as season eight progresses. Brian Peterson explained that he, {{and the rest of}} the new executive producers, were looking for a villainous character that was [...] "as great as Lex", with Michael Rosenbaum's departure at the end of the seventh season, and Doomsday fit what they were looking for. Although Witwer portrays Davis Bloome, who becomes the creature known as Doomsday, he does not actually wear the prosthetic <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> that was created for when Davis transforms into his monstrous counterpart. Instead Dario Delacio, a stunt double, who stands at 6-foot-8, performs the role of [...] "Doomsday" [...] when the creature appears throughout the season.|$|E

The Fifth Element was selected as the opening film for the 1997 Cannes Film Festival and its worldwide box office gross was over $263 million, more than three times its budget of $80 million. The Fifth Element was often praised for its visual style; critic James Berardinelli wrote, [...] "Jovovich makes an impression, although her effectiveness has little to do with acting and less to do with dialogue". Jovovich was nominated for [...] "Favorite Female Newcomer" [...] at the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards and [...] "Best Fight" [...] at the MTV Movie Awards. The film inspired a video game and a planned Leeloo action figure, but the figure was never released due to licensing problems. In a 2003 interview, Jovovich said Leeloo was her favorite role.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Cocoon" [...] {{was directed by}} Eiko Ishioka and shot in April 2001 in New York City.

Its treatment was described as playing with [...] "minimalist white for both costume and bleached eyebrows, treating Björk as a geisha whose makeup extends over her entire nude body". The video begins with many apparently nude Björks singing. Throughout the video, red threads emerge from her nipples and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon.

500|$|Although {{the song}} is 4 minutes and 27 seconds long, the video is 3 minutes and 17 seconds long due to the {{omission}} of the second verse. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine and Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the fact that Beyoncé wears several different clothes including the dress that was worn during her performance at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. The clip starts with a casually dressed Beyoncé moving in coordination with her male back-up dancers who are also wearing casual clothes and Nike Dunks. Wearing a black <b>body</b> <b>suit</b> with black hose, Beyoncé puts on a display of footwork before breaking into the song. About halfway through, the visuals suddenly switch to night as the singer lights up the space in various formal looks, including a gold pantsuit, white suit, and finally a tuxedo complete with coattails, top hat, and cane. The choreography from here resembles that of the 1960s male groups. The wardrobe changes in fact correspond with every key change, except the final one. The video ends with Beyoncé yelling [...] "cut!" [...] and the shot returns to them at rehearsal.|$|E
