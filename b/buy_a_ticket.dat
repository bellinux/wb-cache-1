25|$|When Guy Murchie {{graduated}} from Harvard in 1929, {{he set out}} on an overseas journey, not even bothering to attend commencement, packing notepads in anticipation of publishing a travelogue. He began by working as an able-bodied seaman through the Panama Canal and up to Alaska, working the rails up to Whitehorse, and rowing himself down the Yukon River, then hiking, hitching a ride, and riding freight trains down to Seward. Unable to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket,</b> he stowed away back to San Francisco, ultimately having {{to pay for the}} ride, and from there joined ship's crews to Hawaii and then to Japan.|$|E

25|$|Upon <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket,</b> each {{traveler}} {{is required}} to validate it inside the rail car, and the fine for not doing so (or not <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket)</b> is NIS 186. This has created considerable controversy, and CityPass {{has been accused of}} handing out fines indiscriminately in order to raise its income—the company made NIS 2.4 million in the first half year on fines. Litigative and legislative efforts have been made to curb CityPass's power in this regard. An appeal committee will be created to deal with requests to cancel fines.|$|R

25|$|Raymond J. Place first aroused the {{suspicion}} {{of law enforcement}} officers as {{he was standing in}} line at the Miami airport waiting to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> to New York's LaGuardia Airport. The officers approached him {{on his way to the}} gate and asked him for identification. Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E
25|$|The next day, the park's {{official}} public opening day, crowds {{gathered in}} line {{as early as}} 2:00am. The first person to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> and enter the park was David MacPherson with ticket number 2, as Roy O. Disney arranged to pre-purchase ticket number 1 from Curtis Lineberry, the manager of admissions. However, an official picture of Walt Disney and two children, Christine Vess Watkins (age 5) and Michael Schwartner (7), inaccurately identifies them as the first two guests of Disneyland. Both received lifetime passes to Disneyland that day, and MacPherson was awarded one shortly thereafter, which was later expanded to every single Disney-owned park in the world. Approximately 50,000 guests attended the Monday opening day.|$|E
25|$|As {{his celebrity}} {{grew in the}} late 1950s, he grew tired of being {{approached}} by strangers, and particularly disliked being visited by them at home. Another of his unverifiable stories had him keeping a suitcase {{by the front door}} so that he could claim to be just leaving, a practice he claimed to have abandoned after a helpful young man insisted on taking him to the railway station and had to be sent off to buy a paper so that Lowry could <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> for just one stop without revealing his deceit. However, he was polite to the residents of Mottram, who respected him and his privacy; he used the bus to get about the area in his retirement. A bronze statue of him was erected at the traffic lights in the village.|$|E

A local news story on the lottery {{influences}} Peter to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> in hopes that he will win and set the family on a better financial platform.

Defiant, Peter decides to begin living lavishly, and quits his job.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the ticket has changed with time. At first, tickets were {{identical}} on all local lines, and were small cardboard rectangles, often with a hole pierced in the middle. Tickets then became orange, with a white strip on one end for stamping information about the station and time of validation. The SKM then moved to light blue tickets, also with a white stripe which were only valid on its lines. Originally, this new layout had a list of stops printed on the reverse. Recently, this {{has been replaced by}} advertisements, or information about the possibility of advertising. There are also blank tickets, sold by train conductors to sell tickets at stops where no ticket office is available. These have a list of stops with boxes to note start and destination of the journey, type of discount (if any) and number of tickets. An extra fee for sale on the train can also be noted on these tickets, for instance if a passenger boards at a stop where he could <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> normally.|$|E

Ebert and Claudia Puig of USA Today called the film the [...] "mother of all disaster movies".

500|$|The ride's {{construction}} took seven months, and 120 {{construction workers}} and project managers participated. Testing took two months. The park conducted a [...] "pull-through" [...] by pulling a train along {{the course to}} ensure proper clearance. The ride was inspected and tested with water-dummies on the trains. The first media event was held on May 11, 2000, and the ride {{opened to the public}} on May 13. When it opened, it broke six world records. It was the first Giga Coaster and was the world's fastest complete-circuit roller coaster, but was later overtaken by other rides. About a month after Millennium's debut, Cedar Point introduced a new queuing system called [...] "Ticket to Ride" [...] to reduce the waiting times, which allowed visitors to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> then return later and wait in a shorter line. In August, Cedar Point engaged John Hancock and Associates and Stalker Radar of Indianapolis to measure the height and speed of Millennium Force. The height was measured at , and the speed was measured at , slightly faster than what the park had been advertising (92mph).|$|E

The studio was initially hesitant to cast someone who {{did not seem to}} fit the ranks of [...] "adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans", but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal in the range of $3 to $4million with higher salary options for two sequels. To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique. Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnidlike motion, and had a special diet. The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Edward Furlong, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Chris Klein, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger. Edward Furlong had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1996, while Raimi joked of Prinze that [...] " [...] won't even be allowed to <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> <b>ticket</b> to see this film."
