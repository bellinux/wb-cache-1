5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and man-made. Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold gripped the entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E

5|$|Contractors in {{this type}} of {{construction}} faced many obstacles, <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and man-made. They had to deal with rock formations and ground water, which required pumps. Twelve miles of sewers, as well as water and gas mains, electric conduits, and steam pipes had to be rerouted. Street railways had to be torn up to allow the work. The foundations of tall buildings often ran near the subway construction, and in some cases needed underpinning to ensure stability.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to urbanisation, agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E

5|$|The crew took {{advantage}} of <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and practical light at filming locations. The director sought various approaches to the lighting setups, for example choosing several urban locations for the city lights' effects on the shots' backgrounds. He and the crew also embraced fluorescent lighting at other practical locations to maintain an element of reality and to light the prostheses depicting the characters' injuries. On the other hand, Fincher also ensured that scenes were not so strongly lit so the characters' eyes were less visible, citing cinematographer Gordon Willis' technique as the influence.|$|E

5|$|The golden white-eye is {{endemic to}} the Northern Mariana Islands {{in the western}} Pacific Ocean, where it {{currently}} occurs on the islands of Saipan and Aguijan. Within its range, it occupies a variety of habitats, <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and man-made. It is common in native forests, particularly limestone forests, but also occurs in open shrubland and suburban areas. On Saipan, the only habitats it is absent from are the marshes around Lake Susupe and grassy savannas.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of its habitat affords some {{protection}} for A.bradleyi. Quarrying and strip mining may threaten the sandstone cliffs, {{especially on the}} Cumberland Plateau. Rock climbers and botanical collectors have also damaged populations of the fern. Toxic runoff from atop cliffs can affect them, and {{they may also be}} threatened by <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and anthropogenic shading of cliffs due to increased tree growth at the cliff base, invasive vines overrunning the cliff face, or the piling of slash against the cliff after logging.|$|E
5|$|Uranium has {{the highest}} number (25) of <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and {{synthetic}} isotopes. They have mass numbers of 217–242, and three of them, 234U, 235U and 238U, are present in appreciable quantities in nature. Among others, {{the most important is}} 233U, which is a final product of transformations of 232Th irradiated by slow neutrons. 233U has a much higher fission efficiency by low-energy (thermal) neutrons, compared e.g. with 235U. Most uranium chemistry studies were carried out on uranium-238 owing to its long half-life of 4.4 years.|$|E

5|$|When {{multiple}} different alleles for a gene {{are present}} in a species's population it is called polymorphic. Most different alleles are functionally equivalent, however some alleles can give rise to different phenotypic traits. A gene's most common allele is called the wild type, and rare alleles are called mutants. The genetic variation in relative frequencies of different alleles in a population is due to <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> selection and genetic drift. The wild-type allele {{is not necessarily the}} ancestor of less common alleles, nor is it necessarily fitter.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Bamford Cott, (6 July 1900 – 18 April 1987), was a British zoologist, an {{authority}} on <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and military camouflage, and a scientific illustrator and photographer. Many of his field studies took place in Africa, where he was especially interested in the Nile crocodile, the evolution of pattern and colour in animals. During the Second World War, Cott worked as a camouflage expert for the British Army and helped to influence War Office policy on camouflage. His book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940), popular among serving soldiers, was the major textbook on camouflage in zoology of the twentieth century. After the war, he became a Fellow of Selwyn College, Cambridge. As a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London, he undertook expeditions to Africa and the Amazon to collect specimens, mainly reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|It {{also has}} a more {{extensive}} classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack {{and the formation of}} ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). <b>Both</b> <b>natural</b> isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the ethics of birth control. The Roman Catholic Church officially only accepts natural family planning, {{although}} large numbers of Catholics in developed countries accept and use modern methods of birth control. Among Protestants {{there is a wide}} range of views from supporting none to allowing all methods of birth control. Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E
5|$|The main {{threat to}} this species is habitat disturbance, <b>both</b> <b>natural</b> and human caused. They are also under great threat of white nosed syndrome, {{pollution}} (especially water pollution) and human disturbance during hibernation. Very {{low levels of}} light, noise and heat are sufficient enough to wake hibernating bats. Once awoke the bats begin to expend energy and deplete critical fat reserves. If these disturbances are repeated bats, especially juveniles become very susceptible to death. White nosed syndrome is a fungal infection that attacks bats while they hibernate. 7 million bats of 6 different species are estimated to have been killed since 2006. There has been a 12 percent decline in eastern small-footed bats from white nosed syndrome alone. Due to their dependency on rare ecological features where they nest they are at particularly high risk from mining, quarrying, oil and gas drilling and other mineral extraction, as well as logging, highway construction, wind energy {{and other forms of}} agricultural industrial and residential development.|$|E
