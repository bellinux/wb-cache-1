5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of us away from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E
5|$|The World Science Festival {{was founded}} by Brian Greene, a Columbia University physics {{professor}} and author of several popular-science books (such as The Elegant Universe), and his wife, Emmy Award-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by {{a visit to the}} 2005 Festival della Scienza in Genoa, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.|$|E

25|$|The fear {{of being}} {{identified}} as gay {{can be considered as}} a form of social homophobia. Theorists including Calvin Thomas and Judith Butler have suggested that homophobia can <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in an individual's {{fear of being}} identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity. For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the subculture of its supporters that is considered stereotypically male, such as association football and rugby.|$|E

25|$|The second {{school of}} thought focuses on {{socio-economic}} factors and claims that those factors drive the caste system. It believes caste to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in the economic, political and material history of India. This school, which is common among scholars of the post-colonial era such as Berreman, Marriott, and Dirks, describes the caste system as an ever-evolving social reality {{that can only be}} properly understood by the study of historical evidence of actual practice and the examination of verifiable circumstances in the economic, political and material history of India. This school has focused on the historical evidence from ancient and medieval society in India, during the Muslim rule between the 12th and 18th centuries, and the policies of colonial British rule from 18th century to the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|These stories, {{written down}} some 40-odd years later, seem to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in later smear campaigns which {{were meant to}} bring disrepute on Eadwig and his marital relations. Although both Lives focus on the {{personal}} dimension of the affairs {{from the perspective of}} their protagonists, the effects of factional rivalries loom in the background. It is known that in 958 Archbishop Oda of Canterbury, a supporter of Dunstan, annulled the marriage of Eadwig and Ælfgifu {{on the basis of their}} consanguinity. The underlying motive for this otherwise surprisingly belated decision may well have been political rather than religious or legal. It bolstered Edgar's status as heir to the throne. There is a good possibility that Oda’s act had been spurred on by Edgar’s sympathisers, the sons of Æthelstan Half-King, and in particular by their ally Dunstan, whose monastic reform they generously supported.|$|E
25|$|Women “all {{over the}} world are {{evaluated}} and oppressed by their appearances”; be it age, skin tone, or size. Men are falling victims to this issue as well. A large facet of “social currency for girls and women continues to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in physical appearance”. With accessories and apparel designed to enhance a look; social media, magazines, and marketing campaigns and advertisements, also add to the burden of perfection. This is still prevalent today, whereby female bodies are staged as the ultimate commodity, and used for the selling of products. The ultimate purpose of advertisements is thus to appeal to the insecurities of individuals, in hopes of selling them the solution. Marketers fuelling negative body imagery are also highly aware that those who undergo these problems, are more likely to purchase. For that reason, advertisements regularly advocate the ability to achieve a particular look through retouched images, the sexual objectification of women, and products accompanied with explicit messages.|$|E

25|$|The records between 1998 and 2000 {{showed the}} basis of the Magnétophone sound to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in the {{electronic}} field, but it was also moving outside of it as its 'organic-ness' and obvious human intervention and performance appeared to be informed by guitar bands like My Bloody Valentine and MC5, and it is this that separates them from other electronica records of the same period and which caught the attention of 4AD's A department. These records were still instrumental and took in elements of drum'n'bass, IDM, ambient-techno and avant-garde sound sculpting, and were tied together by strong, though sometimes hidden or intermittent melodies. The pieces were performed live and captured as whole performances, rather than being multi-tracked. John Peel was an ardent supporter of the band's output at this time and they recorded two Peel sessions, one at the BBC Maida Vale Studios, and one at the Irish Centre in a live performance in Birmingham in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Left-wing market anarchism is {{associated}} with scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles Johnson, Brad Spangler, Samuel Edward Konkin III, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and Gary Chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed freed markets to distinguish them from the common conception which these libertarians believe to be riddled with statist and capitalist privileges. Referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly liberal or radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality, and race. This strand of left-libertarianism tends to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> either in the mutualist economics conceptualized by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, American individualist anarchism, or in a left-wing interpretation or extension of the thought of Murray Rothbard.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion that}} Rognvald could {{hand over his}} Northern Isles estates to his brother has been {{interpreted}} in various ways. For example, {{it may be that}} he was aware of ongoing Viking raiding in the area and considered the gift from the king as a mixed blessing. This is also {{one of a number of}} instances in which the writer of the Orkneyinga saga attempts to reconcile the conflicting themes of independence from Norway (Rognvald gifts the islands to Sigurd) and dependence on royal authority (Harald formalises the process by confirming Sigurd as earl). Beuermann (2011) speculates that Rognvald's transfer of power to his brother may have been an attempt by the saga writers to imply that the Orkney earldom had more independence from Norway than that of Møre and that Rognvald's holdings in Caithness may have allowed for an even greater degree of freedom of action. Such implications are more likely to <b>be</b> <b>rooted</b> in the writer's interest in emphasising Orcadian independence at the time of writing rather than the 9th/10th century events they purport to describe.|$|E
