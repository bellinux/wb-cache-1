5000|$|Under the {{armistice}} conditions the Vichy regime {{was allowed to}} use 64 Panhards for police service. These vehicles, mainly taken from the May-June production batches, had their guns removed and replaced with an additional machine gun. On orders of the Army, the Camouflage du Matériel <b>branch,</b> <b>Engineer</b> J. Restany, using the false name [...] "J-J. Ramon", from April 1941 clandestinely produced 45 new turrets, fitted with a 47 mm SA 35 (about twenty) or a 25 mm gun in order to equip {{an equal number of}} hulls hidden from the Germans; some were eventually combined with the hulls for trial purposes. The turrets were of a new design but strongly resembled Restany's 47 mm turret of June 1940. They used twenty millimetre armour plates for the vertical surfaces and ten millimetre plate for the top. To the top hatch a rear hatch was added. On 28 January 1942 all turrets had been finished. Later, {{to the right of the}} main armament a 7.5 mm FM 24/29 machine-gun was fitted. These hulls and cars were partly hidden or dumped in lakes when the whole of France was occupied in November 1942. Some vehicles however, were used by the Germans in the Sicherungs-Aufklärungs-Abteilung 100. In the summer of 1944 some were perhaps taken into use by the resistance.|$|E

One of the problems Robonaut developers encountered was that the robot s interface offered an extremely limited field of vision. Johnson robotics engineer, Darby Magruder, explained that the 40 -degree field-of-view (FOV) in initial robotic prototypes provided very narrow tunnel vision, which posed difficulties for Robonaut operators trying to see the robot s surroundings. Because of the narrow FOV, NASA decided {{to reach out to the}} private sector for assistance.
