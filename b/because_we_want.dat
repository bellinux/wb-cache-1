The decision not to show the animation in the North American version of the game was a subject of controversy, leading to a petition to restore it. According to producer Yoshinori Ono regarding not showing her butt slap, [...] "Those changes came up internally. We decided to remove that <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> the biggest possible number of people to play, and we don’t want to have something in the game that might make someone uncomfortable."

Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years?

2500|$|Although {{romance novels}} {{featuring}} African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists {{are becoming more}} popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare.

The Caste system is a social division of people of the same race." [...] Various sociologists, anthropologists and historians have rejected the racial origins and racial emphasis of caste and consider the idea to be one that has purely political and economic undertones. Beteille writes that [...] "the Scheduled Castes of India taken together are no more a race than are the Brahmins taken together.

2500|$|Agápē is {{the second}} mixtape by American pop-R singer JoJo. It is of EP length, unlike the {{previous}} mixtape. The mixtape was announced in early November 2012. JoJo recorded material specifically intended for the mixtape as {{she did not want}} to keep her fans waiting for new music any longer. Released on her 22nd birthday on December 20, 2012, it marked the follow-up to her 2010 mixtape Can't Take That Away from Me, which spawned the single and video for [...] "In the Dark". The mixtape's first single [...] "We Get By" [...] was released for free online on November 15, 2012 on JoJo's official Soundcloud with a limited number of downloads, with JoJo stating that [...] "there's a limit on the download <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> you to download the entire mixtape once it's released".

2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited.

The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to do it again and again and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E

She told it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park but they eventually filmed the series in New York. Savage explained their choice to film there: [...] "There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you could see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people." [...] Schwartz added: [...] "What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> New York to be a character in the show."

2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 3 May President Tandja {{made his}} first visit to Agadez in over two years.

[...] Tandja drove through the streets of Agadez, met with local leaders, and for the first time, met with representatives of the rebel groups. The President broadcast as statement saying [...] "We have asked them to put down their weapons and come build the country with us.

[...] Prior to the meeting, the MNJ released the last FAN prisoner it had held, an Army captain taken in July 2007, whom rebels had previously accused of killing civilians. Rebels and government continued negotiations, now reportedly on the practical process of turning in weapons. While all sides released positive statements, an FFR spokesman warned [...] "The process of turning in weapons will be a rather long one." [...] The MNJ briefly announced it would not agree to any disarmament until several of its political demands had been met, but later backed away from this statement. Four party talks between the Nigerien minister of the Interior and the leadership of the Niger Movement for Justice (MNJ) Front of Forces for Rectification (FFR) and Niger Patriotic Front (FPN) continued through May and into June, hosted by Libya.|$|E
2500|$|Monty, {{who left}} the series in 1986, {{returned}} in 1991 with the hope she would again raise the ratings of the show. She brought Geary back to General Hospital that same year as Luke's look-alike cousin, Bill Eckert. The actor had refused {{to return to the}} show as Luke without Laura. The unpopularity of the Bill Eckert character led to ABC's firing Monty, killing off Bill, and bringing Luke and Laura back, played by Geary and Francis. Upon their return, the actors took more control of the writing for their characters. Geary, along with a writer friend, Irene Suver, developed the story for Luke and Laura's return. Geary's contract allowed him to rewrite his dialogue at his discretion. Francis and Geary were also known for fighting over story direction with executive producer Wendy Riche and the show's writers. The departure of head writer Richard Culliton days after a tense meeting with Geary caused rumors to circulate that the actor threatened to quit if Culliton were not fired. [...] "The meeting did not go well, but I made no ultimatums and there was certainly no violence," [...] Geary said. [...] "I really don't know if I {{had anything to do with}} his departure, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I did." [...] Francis supported Geary in what they considered to be standing up for the [...] "integrity" [...] of their characters and protecting the [...] "Spencer franchise." [...] "Sometimes people think we're difficult because of that, but we're only difficult <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to live up to the high standards we've set," [...] Francis said.
