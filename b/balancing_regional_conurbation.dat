40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{important}} economic sectors in China, tourism must be supported in a way that will encourage <b>balanced</b> <b>regional</b> economic development. The spatial distribution of tourism should be evaluated to assess the role of growing tourism in regional economic inequality. Unlike previous studies that focus on international tourism, this paper compares the spatial distributions of international and domestic tourism by using the Mean Log Deviation decomposition method, within and between China’s three economic regions over the period from 1997 to 2010. The results show that, compared with regional economic distribution, imbalance in the spatial distribution of tourism is more pronounced. However, from a dynamic and comparative perspective, this paper asserts that tourism, especially domestic tourism, is a more effective instrument for China’s <b>balanced</b> <b>regional</b> economic development than international tourism.

40|$|The bicentric {{conurbation}} formed now by two regional cities, Hradec Králové and Pardubice, was {{a significant}} industrial and farming region of Eastern Bohemia from 1986 to 2000. The development of this conurbation was regulated by the Territorial Plan for the Large Territorial Unit Hradec Králové – Pardubice <b>regional</b> <b>conurbation</b> which was approved in 1989. The urbanistic conception of the entire territory was designed with an outlook for 2000. Anticipated development of industry and agriculture, including housing development pointed out to increased demands on transport and engineering infrastructure. The proposal was supported by increased demands on urbanistic development with increased demands on dwelling, civic amenities and on industrial and agricultural production. After 2000, significant transformation of primary and secondary into higher civic amenities, i. e. so far the tertiary bicentric regional Hradec Králové – Pardubice conurbation was formed by the main centres, Hradec Králové – the regional city and Pardubice, the district city.

40|$|This article defines and investigates {{regional}} {{migration in}} Croatia. It {{shows that the}} regions of emigration are developed below the average, that they have fewer people employed in the socially-owned sector, have a greater participation of agricultural inhabitants, a smaller participation of the immigrant population in the total population and {{that the process of}} emigration is the basic cause of depopulation. In regions of immigration all the characteristics listed have the opposite sign. Regional socio-economic differences correspond in a great measure with migrational polarization so that migration flows can be optimalized through the continuous and uniform development of the republic as a whole. More evenly <b>balanced</b> <b>regional</b> development should be based on a restrictive migration policy and a policy supporting the return of migrants through integral development planning in regions of emigration. It is considered that a more evenly <b>balanced</b> <b>regional</b> development will gradually alleviate the negative aspects of migration, and so will the already partly exhausted migrant population. It must be also mentioned that the effects of the social crisis will be felt until practically the end of the century, and this will make the regions of immigration less attractive (unemployment, housing crisis, ecological problems, etc. ...|$|R
