5|$|Poisonous <b>bromomethane</b> {{was widely}} used as {{pesticide}} to fumigate soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E

40|$|Oxidation {{mechanisms}} in air nonthermal plasma (NTP) {{at room temperature}} and atmospheric pressure were investigated in a corona reactor energized by +dc, -dc, or +pulsed high voltage. The two <b>bromomethanes</b> CF 2 Br 2 and CH 2 Br 2 were chosen as model organic pollutants because of their very different reactivities with OH radicals. Thus, they served as useful mechanistic probes: they respond differently {{to the presence of}} humidity in the air and give different products. By FT-IR analysis of the postdischarge gas the following products were detected and quantified: CO 2 and CO in the case of CH 2 Br 2, CO 2 and F 2 C=O in the case of CF 2 Br 2 center dot F 2 C=O is a long-lived oxidation intermediate due to its low reactivity with atmospheric radicals. It is however removed from the NTP processed gas by passage through a water scrubber resulting in hydrolysis to CO 2 and HF. Other noncarbon containing products of the discharge were also monitored by FT-IR analysis, including HNO 3 and N 2 O. Ozone, an important product of air NTP, was never detected in experiments with CF 2 Br 2 and CH 2 Br 2 because of the highly efficient ozone depleting cycles catalyzed by BrOx species formed from the <b>bromomethanes.</b> It is concluded that, regardless of the type of corona applied, CF 2 Br 2 reacts in air NTP via a common intermediate, the CF 2 Br radical. The possible reactions leading to this radical are discussed, including, for -dc activation, charge exchange with O- 2 (-), a species detected by APCI mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a three-step bromine-mediated process for oxidative coupling of methane using O 2 as oxidant. In the first step, a supported metal bromide solid is treated with O 2 to generate Br 2 and supported metal oxide. The Br 2 thus formed reacts with excess CH 4, giving {{a mixture of}} CH 4, <b>bromomethanes,</b> and HBr. This mixture is passed over a CaO/zeolite composite which condenses bromocarbons with 100 % conversion to products, and neutralizes HBr to reform the metal bromide. The resulting product contains higher hydrocarbons, excess CH 4, and water. Once the HBr neutralizing capacity of the CaO is spent, the supported CaBr 2 /ZSM- 5 may also serve as catalyst for methyl bromide coupling. The effect of temperature, pressure, and reaction time on the intermediate methane bromination {{as well as on}} the overall partial oxidation product distribution is discussed. Incorporation of this scheme into a reactor into which only methane and O 2 are fed is described...|$|R
40|$|Identification and {{monitoring}} of halocarbons {{in the atmosphere}} remains important {{for the purposes of}} regulation and prediction of stratospheric ozone depletion. Measurements of these and other compounds have created a demand for techniques that improve the number of atmospheric compounds analysable. A prototype time-of-flight gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GCMS) was characterised for atmospheric measurements. Instrument performance was found to be {{at the lower end of}} expectations. A comparison to a quadrupole GC-MS indicated that the TOF GC-MS would be suitable for measurements in polluted environments. As part of this comparison, a number of halocarbons were analysed in London, U. K. as part of the ClearfLo campaign. HCFCs were found at higher concentration than their Northern Hemispheric (NH) baseline values. Furthermore, HFC- 134 a and HFC- 227 ea were almost double their NH baseline. CH 2 Cl 2, C 2 Cl 4 and C 2 HCl 3 were encountered at high concentrations and sources of very short-lived <b>bromomethanes</b> (VSLB) were identified close to London. As part of the CARIBIC project, five VSLB were measured in the mid-latitude upper troposphere/ lower stratosphere and tropical troposphere. Higher mixing ratios were encountered over Southeast Asia, likely due to a locally longer CH 2 Br 2 lifetime. Total bromine derived from these five VSLB is at the lower end of the quantity required to balance the stratospheric bromine budget. During the SAMBBA project, biomass burning and natural sources of COS, methyl halides and other halocarbons were assessed over Brazil. Methyl halide emissions from rainforest and savannah fires were quantified. The Cerrado savannah was found to be a strong source of COS. Regional biomass burning emission estimates indicate that this is an important region for emissions of these compounds. Terrestrial, natural sources of CH 3 Cl, CH 3 Br and CHCl 3 were confirmed over the Amazon rainforest. Emissions from a localised source of CHCl 3 were identified and wetlands or agricultural soil disturbance were hypothesised as a likely cause...|$|R

500|$|Organobromides are {{the most}} common organohalides in nature, even though the {{concentration}} of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br+, a potent electrophile.

40|$|Short-lived organic {{brominated}} compounds make up {{a significant}} part of the organic bromine budget in the atmosphere. Emissions of these compounds are highly variable and there are limited measurements, particularly in the extra-tropical upper troposphere/lower stratosphere and tropical troposphere. Measurements of five very short-lived <b>bromomethanes</b> (VSLB) were made in air samples collected on the CARIBIC project aircraft over three flight routes; Germany to Venezuela/Columbia during 2009 - 2011, Germany to South Africa during 2010 and 2011 and Germany to Thailand/Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during 2012 and 2013. In the tropical troposphere, as the most important entrance region to the stratosphere, we observe a total mean organic bromine derived from these compounds across all flights at 10 - 12 km altitude of 3. 4 +/- 1. 5 ppt. Individual mean tropical tropospheric mixing ratios across all flights were 0. 43, 0. 74, 0. 14, 0. 23 and 0. 11 ppt for CHBr 3, CH 2 Br 2, CHBr 2 Cl, CHBrCl 2 and CH 2 BrCl respectively. The highest levels of VSLB-derived bromine (4. 20 +/- 0. 56 ppt) were observed in flights between Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur indicating that the South China Sea is an important source region for these compounds. Across all routes, CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2 accounted for 34 % (4. 7 - 71) and 48 % (14 - 73) respectively of total bromine derived from the analysed VSLB in the tropical mid-upper troposphere totalling 82 % (54 - 89). In samples collected between Germany and Venezuela/Columbia, we find decreasing mean mixing ratios with increasing potential temperature in the extratropics. Tropical mean mixing ratios are higher than extra-tropical values between 340 - 350 K indicating that rapid uplift is important in determining mixing ratios in the lower tropical tropopause layer in the West Atlantic tropics. O- 3 was used as a tracer for stratospherically influenced air and we detect rapidly decreasing mixing ratios for all VSLB above similar to 100 ppb O- 3 corresponding to the extratropical tropopause layer...|$|R

50|$|In 1999, an {{estimated}} 71,500 tonnes of synthetic methyl bromide were used annually worldwide. 97% of this estimate {{is used for}} fumigation purposes, whilst 3% {{is used for the}} manufacture of other products. Moreover, 75% of the consumption takes place in developed nations, led by the U.S. (43%) and Europe (24%). Asia and the Middle East combine to use 24% whereas Latin America and Africa have the lowest consumption rates at 9%.Until its production and use was curtailed by the Montreal Protocol, <b>bromomethane</b> was widely applied as a soil sterilant, mainly for production of seed but also for some crops such as strawberries and almonds. In commercial large-scale monoculture seed production, unlike crop production, it is of vital importance to avoid contaminating the crop with off-type seed of the same species. Therefore, selective herbicides cannot be used. Whereas <b>bromomethane</b> is dangerous, it is considerably safer and more effective than some other soil sterilants. Its loss to the seed industry has resulted in changes to cultural practices, with increased reliance on soil steam sterilization, mechanical rogueing, and fallow seasons. <b>Bromomethane</b> was also used as a general-purpose fumigant to kill a variety of pests including rats and insects. <b>Bromomethane</b> has poor fungicidal properties. <b>Bromomethane</b> is the only fumigant allowed (heat treatment is only other option) under ISPM 15 regulations when exporting solid wood packaging (forklift pallets, crates, bracing) to ISPM 15 compliant countries. <b>Bromomethane</b> is used to prepare golf courses, particularly to control Bermuda grass.
