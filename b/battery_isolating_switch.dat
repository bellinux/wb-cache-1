40|$|Bibliography: pages 95 - 99. The aim of {{this project}} was to characterise an early histone gene <b>battery</b> <b>isolated</b> from Parenchinus angulosus. An early histone gene battery (named H 27) which was {{believed}} to have been isolated from Parenchinus angulosus, appeared by restriction enzyme mapping and partial sequencing to be identical to H 22, an early histone gene <b>battery</b> <b>isolated</b> from Psammechinus miliaris. (This latter gene was obtained from M. Birnstiel.) This was further confirmed by electron microscopy, and proved to be a convenient testing ground for the electron microscopic techniques of denaturation mapping and heteroduplex anlysis. Another gene battery (named SU 1) isolated fromParenchinus angulosus, was then characterised using the techniques developed whilst studying H 27. The restriction enzyme map of this clone is different to that of H 22, indicating that differences do indeed exist between these two early histone gene batteries. SU 1 also showed the expected order of the five histone genes, as determined by hybridization against the coding regions of H 22. The denaturation map of SU 1 showed AT rich spacer regions and GC rich coding regions. Heteroduplex analysis indicated that the spacer regions between the Hl and H 2 A, the H 2 A and H 3, and the H 3 and the H 2 B gene coding areas are essentially nonhomologous. The H 4 structural gene and corresponding spacer regions were not included in this analysis. Because it is known that all the five histones are coded for on the same strand of DNA in H 22, and that each of the genes is transcribed in the same direction, it follows that, the same holds for, at least, the Hl, H 2 A, H 3 and H 2 B genes of SU 1...|$|R
50|$|Residential {{dwellings}} {{almost always}} take supply {{from the low}} voltage distribution lines or cables that run past the dwelling. These operate at voltages of between 110 and 260 volts (phase-to-earth) depending upon national standards. A few decades ago small dwellings would be fed a single phase using a dedicated two-core service cable (one core for the active phase and one core for the neutral return). The active line would then be run through a main <b>isolating</b> <b>switch</b> in the fuse box and then split into one or more circuits to feed lighting and appliances inside the house. By convention, the lighting and appliance circuits are kept separate so the failure of an appliance does not leave the dwelling's occupants in the dark. All circuits would be fused with an appropriate fuse based upon the wire size used for that circuit. Circuits would have both an active and neutral wire with both the lighting and power sockets being connected in parallel. Sockets would also be provided with a protective earth. This would {{be made available to}} appliances to connect to any metallic casing. If this casing were to become live, the theory is the connection to earth would cause an RCD or fuse to trip—thus preventing the future electrocution of an occupant handling the appliance. Earthing systems vary between regions, but in countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia both the protective earth and neutral line would be earthed together near the fuse box before the main <b>isolating</b> <b>switch</b> and the neutral earthed once again back at the distribution transformer.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{function of the}} bacterial flagellar switch, which determines the direction of flagellar rotation and is essential for chemotaxis, has remained an enigma for many years.

We provide evidence that FRD binds to preparations of <b>isolated</b> <b>switch</b> complexes, forms a 1 : 1 complex with the switch protein FliG, and that this interaction is required for both flagellar assembly and switching the direction of flagellar rotation. We further show that fumarate, {{known to be a}} clockwise/switch factor, affects the direction of flagellar rotation through FRD. These results not only uncover a new component important for switching and flagellar assembly, but they also reveal that FRD, an enzyme known to be primarily expressed and functional under anaerobic conditions in Escherichia coli, nonetheless, has important, unexpected functions under aerobic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—For {{experiments}} to be reproducible, {{it is important}} to have a known and controlled environment. This requires isolation from the surroundings. For security experiments, e. g. with hostile software, this is even more important as the experiment can affect the environment in adverse ways. In a normal campus laboratory, isolation can be achieved by network separation. For an online environment, where remote access is essential, full separation is not possible, and therefore the security implications must be carefully considered. In this paper, a way to enable remote experiments is described, where users are given full control over the computer installation. Automating the install procedure and dynamically creating isolated experiment networks provide remote users with the tools needed to do experiments in a reproducible and secure environment. The installation is done by automatically installing prepared clone images, which contains a hard drive representation, to the machines own hard drive. When an experiment starts, the machines in the experiment are automatically booted and placed on an <b>isolated</b> (<b>switched)</b> network. This way experiments are isolated from each other. By using firewall techniques, connections from outside the laboratory can only be made from the user’s machine into his/her experiment.

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of natural resources}} and renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) energy, has been highlighted for global energy solution. The PV power control unit in the PV power-generation technology requires a high step-up DC–DC converter. The conventional step-up DC–DC converter has low efficiency and limited step-up ratio. To overcome these problems, a novel high step-up DC–DC converter using an <b>isolated</b> <b>switched</b> capacitor cell is proposed. The step-up converter uses the proposed transformer and employs the switched-capacitor cell to enable integration with the boost inductor. The output of the boost converter and isolated switched-capacitor cell are connected in series to obtain high step-up with low turn-on ratio. A hardware prototype with 30 V to 40 V input voltage and 340 V output voltage is implemented to verify the performance of the proposed converter. As an extended version, another novel high step-up isolated switched-capacitor single-ended DC–DC converter integrated with a tapped-inductor (TI) boost converter is proposed. The TI boost converter and isolated-switched-capacitor outputs are connected in series to achieve high step-up. All magnetic components are integrated in a single magnetic core to lower costs.

40|$|Hybrid {{systems are}} a {{powerful}} formalism for modeling and reasoning about cyber-physical systems. They mix the continuous and discrete natures {{of the evolution}} of computerized systems. Switched systems are a special kind of hybrid systems, with restricted discrete behaviours: those systems only have finitely many different modes of (continuous) evolution, with <b>isolated</b> <b>switches</b> between modes. Such systems provide a good balance between expressiveness and controllability, and are thus in widespread use in large branches of industry such as power electronics and automotive control. The control law for a switched system defines the way of selecting the modes during the run of the system. Controllability is the problem of (automatically) synthezing a control law in order to satisfy a desired property, such as safety (maintaining the variables within a given zone) or stabilisation (confinement of the variables in a close neighborhood around an objective point). In order to compute the control of a switched system, we need to compute the solutions of the differential equations governing the modes. Euler's method is the most basic technique for approximating such solutions. We present here an estimation of the Euler's method local error, using the notion of " one-sided Lispchitz constant " for modes. This yields a general control synthesis approach which can encompass several features such as bounded disturbance and compositionality...|$|R
