The covered analytes belong to the prominent pathways in <b>biochemical</b> carbon <b>oxidation</b> such as glycolysis or the tricarboxylic acid cycle and, for the most part, share unfavorable properties such as a high polarity, chemical instability or metal-affinity. The topic is introduced by selected examples on successful applications of metabolomics in the clinic. In the core part of the paper, the structural features of important analyte classes such as nucleotides, coenzyme A thioesters or carboxylic acids are linked to "problematic hotspots" along the analytical chain (sample preparation and-storage, separation and detection). We discuss these hotspots from a chemical point of view, covering issues such as analyte degradation or interactions with metals and other matrix components. Based on this understanding we propose solutions wherever available. A major notion derived from these considerations is that comprehensive carbon metabolomics inevitably requires multiple, complementary analytical approaches covering different chemical classes of metabolites.

As high fetal hemoglobin level in thalassemia patients interferes with measurement of glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A 1 C), fructosamine evaluation as an alternative approach is suggested.

An emerging theme in this chemistry is that spin state changes can play important roles, and a ‘two-state’ reactivity model has been extensively applied especially in iron-porphyrin systems. Herein we explore the gas phase oxygen-atom transfer chemistry of meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl) porphyrin (TPFPP) chromium complexes, as well as some other tetradentate macrocyclic ligands. Electrospray ionization in concert with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) spectrometry has been used to characterize and observe reactivity of the ionic species [(TPFPP) CrIII]+ (1) and [(TPFPP) CrVO]+ (2). These are an attractive system to examine the effects of spin state change on oxygen atom transfer because the d 1 CrV species are doublets while the CrIII complexes have quartet ground states with high-lying doublet excited states. In the gas phase, [(TPFPP) CrIII]+ forms adducts with a variety of neutral donors but O-atom transfer is only observed for NO 2. Pyridine N-oxide adducts of 1 do yield 2 upon collision induced dissociation (CID), but the ethylene oxide, DMSO, and TEMPO analogs do not. [(TPFPP) CrVO]+ is shown by its reactivity and by CID experiments to be a terminal metal-oxo with a single vacant coordination site. It also displays limited reaction chemistry, being deoxygenated only by the very potent reductant P(OMe) 3. In general, [(TPFPP) CrVO]+ species are much less reactive than the Fe and Mn analogs.

The analysis of existing methods for purification of ground water from hydrogen sulfide {{has been given}} in the paper. The paper has established shortcomings of physical and chemical purification of ground water. While using aeration methods for removal of hydrogen sulfide formation of colloidal sulfur that gives muddiness and opalescence to water occurs due to partial chemical air oxidation. In addition to this violation of sulfide-carbonate equilibrium {{taking place in the}} process of aeration due to desorption of H 2 S and CO 2, often leads to clogging of degasifier nozzles with formed CaCO 3  that causes serious operational problems. Chemical methods require relatively large flow of complex reagent facilities, storage facilities and transportation costs. In terms of hydrogen sulfide ground water purification the greatest interest is given to the biochemical method. Factors deterring widespread application of the biochemical method is its insufficient previous investigation and necessity to execute special research in order to determine optimal process parameters while purifying groundwater of a particular water supply source. <b>Biochemical</b> methods for <b>oxidation</b> of sulfur compounds are based on natural biological processes that ensure natural sulfur cycle. S. Vinogradsky has established a two-stage mechanism for oxidation of hydrogen sulfide with sulfur bacteria (Beggiatoa).

40|$|The first {{molecular}} {{and genetic}} characterization of a <b>biochemical</b> pathway for <b>oxidation</b> of the reduced phosphorus (P) compounds phosphite and hypophosphite is reported. The pathway was identified in Pseudomonas stutzeri WM 88, which {{was chosen for}} detailed studies {{from a group of}} organisms isolated based on their ability to oxidize hypophosphite (+ 1 valence) and phosphite (+ 3 valence) to phosphate (+ 5 valence). The genes required for oxidation of both compounds by P. stutzeri WM 88 were cloned on a single ca. 30 -kbp DNA fragment by screening for expression in Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Two lines of evidence suggest that hypophosphite is oxidized to phosphate via a phosphite intermediate. First, plasmid subclones that conferred oxidation of phosphite, but not hypophosphite, upon heterologous hosts were readily obtained. All plasmid subclones that failed to confer phosphite oxidation also failed to confer hypophosphite oxidation. No subclones that conferred only hypophosphite expression were obtained. Second, various deletion derivatives of the cloned genes were made in vitro and recombined onto the chromosome of P. stutzeri WM 88. Two phenotypes were displayed by individual mutants. Mutants with the region encoding phosphite oxidation deleted (based upon the subcloning results) lost the ability to oxidize either phosphite or hypophosphite. Mutants with the region encoding hypophosphite oxidation deleted lost only the ability to oxidize hypophosphite. The phenotypes displayed by these mutants also demonstrate that the cloned genes are responsible for the P oxidation phenotypes displayed by the original P. stutzeri WM 88 isolate. The DNA sequences of the minimal regions implicated in oxidation of each compound were determined. The region required for oxidation of phosphite to phosphate putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent phosphite transporter, an NAD+-dependent phosphite dehydrogenase, and a transcriptional activator of the lysR family. The region required for oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphite putatively encodes a binding-protein-dependent hypophosphite transporter and an α-ketoglutarate-dependent hypophosphite dioxygenase.
