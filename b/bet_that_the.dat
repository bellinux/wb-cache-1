5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

25|$|Rex Sorgatz, {{designer}} of Mediaite and CMO of Vyou, issued a <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> redesigns would fail {{to bring in}} traffic, and Nick Denton took him up on it. The measure {{was the number of}} page views by October recorded on Quantcast. Page views after the redesign declined significantly—Gawker's sites had an 80% decrease in overall traffic immediately after the change and a 50% decrease over two weeks—with many users either leaving the site or viewing international versions of the site, which hadn't switched to the new layout. On 28 February 2011, faced with declining traffic, Gawker sites allowed for visitors to choose between the new design and the old design for viewing the sites. Sorgatz was eventually determined to be the winner of the bet, as at the end of September, 2011, Gawker had only 500 million monthly views, not the 510 million it had had prior to the redesign. However, on 5 October 2011, site traffic returned to its pre-redesign numbers, and as of February 2012, site traffic had increased by 10 million over the previous year, according to Quantcast. As of March 23, 2012, commenting on any Gawker site required signing in with a Twitter, Facebook, or Google account.|$|E

Mr. Burns makes a large <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team will win and brings in nine ringers from the [...] "big leagues" [...] to ensure his success.

The job would have been done– and done right– half a century sooner, with vastly less human misery, and with almost no bloodshed... The only way slavery has ever been ended, anywhere, is by introducing industry...

The hundred days allotted for her construction passed on 12 January, but the Navy chose not to penalize the consortium. The name [...] "Monitor", meaning [...] "one who admonishes and corrects wrongdoers", was proposed by Ericsson on 20 January 1862 and approved by Assistant Secretary of the Navy Gustavus Fox. [...] While Ericsson stood on its deck in defiance of all his critics who thought she would never float, Monitor was launched on 30 January 1862 to the cheers of the watching crowd, even those who had <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship would sink straight to the bottom, and commissioned on 25 February.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginning}} of the end occurred on 16 January 1995, when Leeson placed a short straddle in the Singapore and Tokyo stock exchanges, essentially <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese stock market would not move significantly overnight. However, the Kobe earthquake hit early in the morning on 17 January, sending Asian markets, and Leeson's trading positions, into a tailspin. Leeson attempted to recoup his losses by making a series of increasingly risky new trades (using a long-long future arbitrage), this time <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Nikkei Stock Average would make a rapid recovery.

500|$|The koala is {{well known}} {{worldwide}} and is a major draw for Australian zoos and wildlife parks. [...] It has been featured in advertisements, games, cartoons, and as soft toys. It benefited the national tourism industry by over an estimated billion Australian dollars in 1998, a figure that has since grown. In 1997, half of visitors to Australia, especially those from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, sought out zoos and wildlife parks; about 75% of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala {{at the top of}} their list of animals to see. According to biologist Stephen Jackson: [...] "If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most closely associated with Australia, it's a fair <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> koala would come out marginally in front of the kangaroo". Factors that contribute to the koala's enduring popularity include its childlike body proportions and teddy bear-like face.|$|E
500|$|By this time, the 9th Division {{was about}} [...] East of Lae, while the 7th Division was [...] away and [...] "it {{appeared}} an odds-on <b>bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 9th would reach Lae first". The 7th Division resumed its advance at dawn on 16 September. The last ten Japanese troops facing the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion {{were killed and}} the 2/25th Infantry Battalion passed through its position and headed for Lae. As they moved down the Markham Valley Road, they occasionally encountered sick Japanese soldiers who held the column momentarily. Brigadier Eather came up in his jeep and started urging the diggers to hurry up. They were unimpressed. Eather, armed with a pistol, then acted as leading scout, with his troops following in a column of route behind him. The column entered Lae unopposed by the Japanese but aircraft of the Fifth Air Force strafed the 2/33rd Infantry Battalion and dropped parachute fragmentation bombs, wounding two men. Whitehead soon received a message sent in the clear from Vasey that read: [...] "Only the Fifth Air Force bombers are preventing me from entering Lae." [...] By early afternoon, the 2/31st Infantry Battalion reached the Lae airfield where it killed 15 Japanese soldiers and captured one. The 25th Infantry Brigade then came under fire from the 9th Division's 25-pounders, wounding one soldier. Vasey and Eather tried every available means to inform Wootten of the situation. A message eventually reached him through RAAF channels at 14:25 and the artillery was silenced.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{theory is}} <b>that</b> Magnetar Capital was {{essentially}} <b>betting</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans {{was more likely}} than {{was reflected in the}} price of the higher tranches.

5000|$|In finance, a {{range accrual}} {{is a type}} of {{derivative}} product very popular among structured-note investors.

When gold had surpassed $155 an ounce on Friday September 24, Grant ordered Boutwell to release $4 million in gold and buy $4 million worth of bonds. Within minutes {{the price of gold}} immediately dropped from $160 an ounce to $138. Gould's and Fisk's gold corner was broken.

2500|$|On 26 December 2011, an {{accident}} occurred during a maintenance drill involving {{one of the}} systems. While loading missiles into a launcher vehicle from a bunker at the Air Defense Network's school near kibbutz Mashabei Sadeh in the Negev, two soldiers caused twenty Tamir interceptors to {{fall from a height}} of four meters near soldiers and officers without detonating, causing no injury, but making them unserviceable. Ynetnews reported that the soldiers were never in danger because the interceptor missiles are equipped with a security mechanism that prevents premature explosions. The IDF Spokesperson's Unit said that the Air Force commander, Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan, appointed a committee to examine the accident and ordered an immediate stop to all Air Defense Network maintenance work until a preliminary investigation was concluded. It also said that during the following week actions would be taken to [...] "improve skills and safety awareness". A security official told Reshet <b>Bet</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> failure was twofold in that the soldiers and their commander deviated from severely strict safety protocols, and 20 costly interceptors were lost. Walla! website reported that the soldiers made a mistake in loading the missiles and they fell backwards. The website calculated the damage at $1 million USD (at $50,000 per missile). The missiles were transferred back to Rafael to determine whether they could be repaired.|$|E

On July 11, 2011, several demo songs that Clarkson recorded, ranging from 50 to 70, were leaked into the internet, some of which were recorded in 2002 while Clarkson was still recording Thankful, and for Stronger.
