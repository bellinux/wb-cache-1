50|$|The <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> {{has become}} the cause of problem and concern, however. The <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> is rigid and is not customizable. Because of this, many games are {{difficult}} to play. All Neo Geo AES fighting games have very awkward control schemes and glitches when changed to GameCube controllers. Nintendo has acknowledged this issue but has not put any efforts towards fixing it on the Wii. Currently, all Wii U Virtual Console games support customizable button mappings.|$|E

50|$|The harmony 550/555 remotes are {{variants}} of the 525 remote. Compared {{to the model}} 525, the 550 and 555 have two extra buttons, and are made of higher grade materials with different colors. The 550 and 555 models both have a sound and a picture button that changes the <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> on the remote, allowing for reuse of the same physical buttons for different set of functionality. 52 buttons.|$|E
50|$|The {{firmware}} is upgradeable, and {{can also}} be user modified with various programs to change things such as the <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> and graphics. The latest firmware (version 7.300) allows for many new features, including play lists {{and the ability to}} remember its place in four different files at once. The latter feature makes it more suitable for audio books, as it makes searching for where one left off unnecessary. The original YP-55 models came with a gray cloth case, later models used a plastic case which allows access to all the controls without opening it.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{large part}} of the {{development}} process, the board was an extension controller to a normal Wii remote.

50|$|Gameplay {{is based}} on the {{successful}} formula created for the first Guitar Hero game; the player may use the guitar peripheral to play scrolling notes by holding the corresponding fret button on the guitar neck and simultaneously pressing the strum bar. Alternatively, one can play with the DualShock 2 or Xbox 360 controller by using four shoulder buttons and a face <b>button,</b> <b>mapped</b> to specific fret keys.|$|R
50|$|The Pistol Grip is a gun shell for Wands, {{similar in}} design to Nyko's (mechanical) Perfect Shot, with digital inputs using Trans-Port. It is {{intended}} for use with light gun games, and features digital hammer and trigger <b>buttons</b> <b>mapped</b> to the Wand's A and B buttons, with a switch allowing their functions to be inverted depending on the game's controls. It also includes a rumble motor for haptic feedback, and a pass-through port for attaching other accessories to the Pistol Grip. Due to its reliance on features of the Wand, it is not compatible with other devices.|$|R
50|$|Some reviewers have {{reported}} that games play differently due to the different controllers. For example, Super Mario World is often cited as being more difficult to play due to the GameCube controller's <b>button</b> <b>mapping.</b> The Classic Controller has a button layout more {{like that of the}} Super NES controller, and an adapter has been released that enables a player to plug an actual Super NES controller into one of the Wii's GameCube controller ports. Similarly, most N64 Virtual Console games have mapped the Z button to the L, ZL and ZR buttons and the C-buttons to the right analog stick on the Classic Controller, which some reviewers have described as awkward. Furthermore, the mapping of the left analog stick for N64 Virtual Console games does not use the full range of the stick, and instead uses a range of approximately 67%, likely due to the differences in design of the N64 controller's control stick and the GameCube style analog stick. This has been noted to provide a significantly different sensitivity when compared to the original N64 mapping.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—As Digital Television is {{becoming}} popular, an ever-growing number of television operators is providing interactive applications for its viewers. Due to the nature, usual employ and limited interaction possibilities with the device, an intensive use similarly to computer is hardly recommended. Instead, recurring to more casual and lightweight interfaces such as widgets, and obtaining {{information about the}} viewed contents has been considered a more appropriate employ of the potential of such a technology. This paper describes a recommendation system to be integrated with Digital TV Widget applications, which, by considering the user’s program choices, is capable of presenting related commercial products and upcoming events, matching therefore the user’s interests. The interface design {{is meant to be}} as simple and intuitive as possible, yet compatible with existing widget systems. This is achieved by recurring to similar <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> and presenting color and geometric clues for its handling. This approach intends to offer simple, enjoyable, yet efficient personalized advertising features. Digital TV; IPTV; Human computer interaction; Recommender system I...|$|E
40|$|In {{the early}} 20 th century, the Bauhaus revolutionised art & design by using simple colours and forms. Wassily Kandinsky was {{especially}} interested in the relationship of these two visual attributes and postulated a fundamental correspondence between colour and form: yellow triangle, red square and blue circle. Subsequent empirical studies also used preference judgments to test Kandinsky’s original colour-form combinations, usually yielding inconsistent results. We have set out to test the validity of these postulated associations by using the Implicit Association Test. Participants pressed one of two buttons on each trial. On some trials they classified shapes (e. g. circle or triangle). On interleaved trials they classified colours (e. g. blue or yellow). Response times should theoretically be faster when the <b>button</b> <b>mapping</b> follows Kandinsky’s associations: For example, when the left key is used to report blue or circle and the right is used for yellow and triangle, than when the response mapping {{is the opposite of}} this (blue or triangle, yellow or circle). Our findings suggest that there is no implicit association between the original colour-form combinations. Of the three combinations we tested, no response time differences were significantly greater than zero, although there was a marginal effect in one experiment. It can be concluded that our IAT does not support all Kandinsky’s postulated colour-form associations, and these are probably not an aesthetic universal...|$|E
5000|$|All Virtual Console {{games have}} their <b>buttons</b> <b>mapped</b> to the {{respective}} {{buttons on the}} controllers, however, in certain circumstances users can use X and Y instead of A and B, if the original controller does not have X and Y buttons (for example the NES). In certain titles, such as Nintendo 64 games, there may be specific controls tailored to the Classic Controller or GameCube Controller. Nintendo 64 titles that originally provided force feedback via the Nintendo 64 controller's Rumble Pak peripheral however, are {{not supported by the}} built-in [...] "Rumble" [...] feature of the GameCube controller.|$|R
50|$|The Remote Touch controller, which (including the {{directional}} input, buttons, and palmrest) measures 88 mm {{in width}} x 20 mm in length, and is 95 mm tall, is {{placed at the}} base of the center console. Two large buttons (Enter) on both sides of the controller at thumb level are used to select icons, along with three secondary <b>buttons</b> (<b>Map,</b> Scroll, and Display). With the replacement of the touchscreen, the navigation screen is now recessed and placed closer to eye level on the dashboard. Remote Touch has two motors and an encoder, with the motors programmed to reset the controller to a neutral position when the navigation system is activated.|$|R
50|$|Also of note is {{that for}} the first time in the Armored Core series, analog {{controls}} are supported.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} new {{principles}} for visual information seeking (VIS). A key concept {{is to support}} browsing, which is distinguished from familiar query composition and information retrieval because of its emphasis on rapid filtering to reduce result sets, progressive refinement of search parameters, continuous reformulation of goals, and visual scanning to identify results. VIS principles developed include: dynamic query filters (query parameters are rapidly adjusted with sliders, <b>buttons,</b> <b>maps,</b> etc.), starfield displays (two- dimensional scatterplots to structure result sets and zooming to reduce clutter), and tight coupling (interrelating query components to preserve display invariants and support progressive refinement combined {{with an emphasis on}} using search output to foster search input). A FilmFinder prototype using a movie database demonstrates these principles in a VIS environment. (Also cross-referenced as CAR-TR- 638) (Also cross-referenced as ISR-TR- 93 - 71...|$|R

5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Flight Stick EX" [...] in Japan. It {{is very similar}} to the Saitek X45 HOTAS {{joystick}} / throttle system popular with PC flight simulation players. The throttle unit is identical, while the control column is slightly different (likely to better accommodate Xbox <b>button</b> <b>maps).</b> The top of the X45 stick featured two 8-way hat switches, one on the left and one at the bottom, and three thumb buttons above them with one under a safety cover; the Ace Edge retains the left 8-way hat switch, but swaps the positions of the thumb buttons and the second hat switch, with three of the Xbox controller's four main buttons in a rearranged order (Y, B and X, left to right, A being the trigger) below an analog mini-stick rather than a second hat switch. The stick also featured both a flexible sleeve over the shaft and spring, and a wrist pad, neither present on the Saitek X45.|$|R

40|$|International audienceInput {{devices such}} as Nintendo Wiimotes are often used to select and {{manipulate}} virtual objects. While simple to use and easily available, these devices have some limitations. When used with common large displays such as televisions, they support only indirect manipulation. These devices also require the user to learn and remember which <b>buttons</b> <b>map</b> to which functions. We propose overcoming these limitations by using a smartphone as an interaction device. Smartphones, like Wiimotes, are readily available and easy to operate. Unlike the Wiimote, the smartphone has a touchscreen that can display the selected object, allowing the user to directly manipulate the object. Further, the touchscreen can customize the interface and provide buttons with clearly labeled functions specific to the object. We report on the lessons learned in integrating and using a smartphone as the interaction device for two applications. The first is a mixed reality game focused on general object selection and pose manipulation. We used this game in a pilot study evaluating usability. The second is an adaptation of an existing virtual reality application. This application demonstrated the ease of adaptation as well as improvements from using a smartphone...|$|R
40|$|Touch screens are on {{the rise}} and replace {{traditional}} knobs and buttons at a fast pace. However, their lack of tangible guidance and feedback can become a problem in scenarios where visual attention is scarce. Besides dynamic tactile feedback by vibrations, the usability of touch screens can be improved by static haptic structures such as shaped or struc-tured surfaces. In this paper we describe the prototype of an in-vehicle application using unimanual four-finger interac-tion and haptic guidance in order to avoid visual distraction from the primary task of driving. We built a low fidelity prototype with static haptics using an Android tablet and silicone foil. A user study showed that flexible positioning of touch <b>buttons</b> <b>mapped</b> to the user’s fingers was more convenient and produced fewer errors than fixed position-ing. A curved haptic border provided the user with orienta-tion and allowed a new selection mode: dragging buttons over the edge resulted in a reduced interaction time when compared to double tapping. We present several different variants for unimanual multifinger interaction on planar and non-planar surfaces. Our results can support the develop-ment of future concepts for blind interaction.

50|$|Dark Adventure can {{be played}} by up to three players, with a {{different}} character assigned to each control panel. Each character starts {{the game with a}} different default weapon: Labryna (the leftmost player) wields a sword, Condor (the center player) uses a whip, and Zorlock (the rightmost player) carries a spear. The controls for each player consists of an eight-way joystick to move their character and three action buttons for jumping, attacking and throwing dynamite. The dynamite throw button only works when the player has acquired the required power-up. There's also a <b>map</b> <b>button</b> that can be used by any of the three players. When held, the <b>map</b> <b>button</b> will pause the game and display the location of keys and exits in places explored by the player, although this function is not available in every area. The objective the game is to pick up the keys and unlock exits until the player has reached the lair of the final boss. There are a total of 40 areas to explore. Enemy creatures include minotaurs, skeleton warriors, swamp monsters, man-eating trees, giant spiders and rats.|$|R
