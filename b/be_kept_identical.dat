40|$|The {{effect of}} {{respiratory}} gating {{on the major}} diffusion-imaging metrics and that of cardiac gating on mean kurtosis (MK) are not known. For evaluation of whether the major diffusion-imaging metrics-MK, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) of the brain-varied between gated and non-gated acquisitions, respiratory-gated, cardiac-gated, and non-gated diffusion-imaging of the brain were performed in 10 healthy volunteers. MK, FA, and MD maps were constructed for all acquisitions, and the histograms were constructed. The normalized peak height and location of the histograms were compared among the acquisitions by use of Friedman and post hoc Wilcoxon tests. The effect of the repetition time (TR) on the diffusion-imaging metrics was also tested, and we corrected for its variation among acquisitions, if necessary. The results showed {{a shift in the}} peak location of the MK and MD histograms to the right with an increase in TR (p <= 0. 01). The corrected peak location of the MK histograms, the normalized peak height of the FA histograms, the normalized peak height and the corrected peak location of the MD histograms varied significantly between the gated and non-gated acquisitions (p < 0. 05). These results imply an influence of respiration and cardiac pulsation on the major diffusion-imaging metrics. The gating conditions must <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>identical</b> if reproducible results are to be achieved...|$|E
40|$|There is much {{progress}} in Yb-fiber oscillator-amplifier systems, which enable generation of high-repetition-rate, microjoule energies and sub-picosecond pulse widths [1, 2]. Given the extremely large total gain factors to reach microjoules starting from nanojoules, {{which is often}} {{in the range of}} 40 - 60 dB, due to losses, and the impact of mismatched high-order dispersion as temporal stretching and compression of pulses by large factors (30 - 40 dB) need to be employed. As a result of these challenges, most of the Yb-fiber amplifiers have resulted in pulse durations of several 100 fs or longer. While pulse durations in this range are suited for some applications, there are many cases where 100 -fs or shorter pulses in microjoule range are required. Gain narrowing can be effectively countered by self-phase modulation (SPM) [3] by limiting amplification factor in each stage of amplification and through careful optimization of SPM and inversion level along the gain fiber. The conceptual template is readily present {{in the evolution of the}} pulse inside the oscillator cavity, where gain factors are often in the 10 - 50 range per roundtrip. To the extend that the B-integral and the gain distribution along the amplifier can <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>identical</b> to the oscillator by proper scaling of the chirped pulse width and fiber mode area, the original oscillator can be preserved in arbitrary number of amplification stages. Here, we demonstrate a highly fiber-integrated master-oscillator power-amplifier (MOPA) system, from which - 1 μJ pulses are extracted and externally compressed to 100 fs by arranging amplification in each stage as close as possible to the intra-cavity evolution. To our knowledge, these results are the shortest demonstrated from all-fiber-integrated amplifier at the microjoule level. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently a {{shakedown}} {{approach has}} been proposed for structural design of flexible road pavements (Wang and Yu, 2013 a). This new approach makes use of both elastic and plastic properties of materials, and therefore represents an advance from the existing analytical design approach in the UK where pavement life is related with elastic strains at critical locations using empirical equations. However, no direct comparison between designs using these two approaches {{has been made to}} date. In this paper, following a brief review of both approaches, the shakedown approach based on Wang and Yu (2013 a) is used to design layer thicknesses for a typical asphalt pavement considered in the analytical approach TRRL Report LR 1132. Typical values of plastic parameters are chosen for pavement materials at temperature 20 ̊C, while stiffness moduli of materials <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>identical</b> with the analytical design.

40|$|Early {{propagation}} effect (EPE) is {{a critical}} problem in conventional dual-rail logic implementations against Side Channel Attacks (SCAs). Among previous EPE-resistant architectures, PA-DPL logic offers EPE-free capability at relatively low cost. However, its separate dual core structure is a weakness when facing concentrated EM attacks where a tiny EM probe can be precisely positioned closer {{to one of the}} two cores. In this paper, we present an PA-DPL dual-core interleaved structure to strengthen resistance against sophisticated EM attacks on Xilinx FPGA implementations. The main merit of the proposed structure is that every two routing in each signal pair <b>are</b> <b>kept</b> <b>identical</b> even the dual cores are interleaved together. By minimizing the distance between the complementary routings and instances of both cores, even the concentrated EM measurement cannot easily distinguish the minor EM field unbalance. In PA- DPL, EPE is avoided by compressing the evaluation phase to {{a small portion of the}} clock period, therefore, the speed is inevitably limited. Regarding this, we made an improvement to extend the duty cycle of evaluation phase to more than 40 percent, yielding a larger maximum working frequency. The detailed design flow is also presented.
