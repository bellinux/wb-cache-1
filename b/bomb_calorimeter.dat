The dependence is described in regression equa-tions which permit prediction of the cncrgy content with an accuracy of about + 5 % (P> 0. 95). Even {{the use of the}} mean conversion factor of 46 kJ g-l organic carbon yields considerably more accurate results than the use of a general conversion factor for ash-free dry weight. Accurate energy values of animals are essential for studies of animal energetics. Determination of the energy content of animals with the aid of <b>bomb</b> <b>calorimeters</b> now used requires samples relatively large in comparison with the small size of most freshwater invertebrates. Most scientists use dry weight or ash-free dry weight to estimate biomass. As the energy content of dry or ash-free dry biomass varies consid-erably from species to species (e. g. Cum-mins and Wuycheck 1971)) and within one species from season to season (e. g. Schind-ler et al. 1971; Wissing and Hasler 1971; Snow 1972), the use of general energy equivalents for dry or ash-free dry weight does not yield very accurate values. As noted earlier by Platt and Irwin (1973)) the energy equivalent for biomass expressed in terms of organic carbon should theoretically vary less than the energy equivalent for biomass expressed in terms of dry or ash-free dry weight. The use of 41. 9 k J g-l C (= 10 kcal g-l C) as an ap-proximate conversion factor has been rec-ommended by Winberg (1971 a).

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the present work was the development of micro combustion calorimetry apparatus and methods to study organic compounds. A micro rotating <b>bomb</b> combustion <b>calorimeter</b> requiring only 10 mg to 30 mg samples for a precise determination of the energies of combustion of solid organic compounds was developed. The accuracy of the apparatus was tested by determining the standard molar enthalpy of formation of 4 chlorobenzoic acid in the crystalline state at 298. 15 K (Chapter 2). An attempt was made, to adapt the gravimetric method of carbon dioxide analysis, {{used to assess the}} completeness of the combustion reactions in macro combustion reactions in macro combustion calorimetry to the micro scale. This work required the design and construction of a new micro combustion bomb with two inlet valves, that can be adapted to the calorimetric apparatus referred to above and a CO_ 2 absorption line. Tests made with benzoic acid indicate that the procedure used in this Thesis needs improvement (Chapter 2). An apparatus for the determination of enthalpies of sublimation by the Knudsen effusion method, previously developed at the Instituto Superior Tecnico Thermochemistry Laboratory, was modified to extend the temperature range of the measurements up to ca. 500 K (Chapter 2). The reliability of the apparatus was checked by measuring of the standard molar enthalpies of sublimation of ferrocene and titanocene dichloride.

The calorific value of all organic compounds has the sign corresponding to an exothermic reaction (negative in the standard chemical convention) because the double bond in molecular oxygen is much weaker than other double bonds or pairs of single bonds, particularly those in the combustion products carbon dioxide and water; conversion of the weak bonds in O2 to the stronger bonds in CO2 and H2O releases energy as heat.|$|E
