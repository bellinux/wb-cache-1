50|$|Export subsidy {{is known}} for being abused. For example, some {{exporters}} substantially over declare {{the value of their}} goods so as to benefit more from the export subsidy. Another method is to export a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to a foreign country but the same goods will be re-imported by the same trader via a circuitous route and changing the product description so as to obscure their origin. Thus the trader benefits from the export subsidy without creating real trade value to the economy. Export subsidy as such can become a self-defeating and disruptive policy.|$|E

30|$|Let us {{take a look}} at {{the first}} {{horizontal}} capital circulation period. The period for the value realization from material to product lasts about 3  months. Therefore, many textile enterprises (the large subcontractors) do not pay their workers in the first 3  months: the payment for the first month is distributed in the fourth month and so on. The remaining 3 -month payments are distributed at the end of the year, 13 which suggests that the payment for the first <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> at the beginning of a year is deferred for 3  months. As a result, the production and management period of orders is just right for the conventions of settlement prevalent in the community, such as settlements according to season. The 3 -month payment is deferred by taking advantage of the social time mechanism. The batches of production are lastingly cumulative, as a result of which the draining speed of capital in upstream transactions is still faster than the capital settlement period upstream. The social time mechanism plays a crucial role because the time period is settled according to the cooperation between the upstream and the downstream, that is, settled according to the settlement conventions instead of the consistency of economic production and the transaction period. Depending on these two kinds of capital circulation periods, the subcontractors not only accumulate capital but also effectively utilize their present capital.|$|E

30|$|In {{the period}} of {{subcontracting}} {{there are two different}} kinds of capital circulation periods in the production capital chain (Fig.  3 presents more details). The first capital circulation period is between the material suppliers, the subcontractors, and the clients. The second is the circulation period between the subcontractors and the households. The latter adjusts itself according to the period from production to sale, which means adjusting according to {{the period of}} orders. Generally speaking, in Pu Town, the period from the material purchase to the production of white fabric and delivery to the clients lasts from 2 to 3  months. In the case of foreign transactions, the time for dyeing and finishing as well as export transportation must be added into the whole period, which amounts to about 45  days. Thus, for subcontractors working on foreign transactions, the capital circulation period of a <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is roughly 4  months, while domestic transactions are about 2 to 3  months. The social time for the second capital circulation period in settling puts off the payment time as much as possible in regard to the speed of capital circulation, which makes the speed of the first capital circulation period go far beyond its circulation speed. It is basically suggested that the first capital circulation period does not need to pay the processing fee in full for the households timely after getting profits in trading. Instead, it saves a large part for daily circulating or capital accumulation.|$|E

40|$|Egg {{quality is}} a complex {{biological}} trait and {{a major determinant of}} reproductive fitness in all animals. This study delivered the first proteomic portraits of egg quality in zebrafish, a leading biomedical model for early development. Egg <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and poor quality, evidenced by embryo survival for 24 h, were sampled immediately after spawning and used to create pooled or replicated sample sets whose protein extracts were subjected to different levels of fractionation before liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained spectra were searched against a zebrafish proteome database and detected proteins were annotated, categorized and quantified based on normalized spectral counts. Manually curated and automated enrichment analyses revealed poor quality eggs to be deficient of proteins involved in protein synthesis and energy and lipid metabolism, and of some vitellogenin products and lectins, and to have a surfeit of proteins involved in endo-lysosomal activities, autophagy, and apoptosis, and of some oncogene products, lectins and egg envelope proteins. Results of pathway and network analyses suggest that this aberrant proteomic profile results from failure of oocytes giving rise to poor quality eggs to properly transit through final maturation, and implicated Wnt signaling in the etiology of this defect. Quantitative comparisons of abundant proteins in good versus poor quality eggs revealed 17 candidate egg quality markers. Thus, the zebrafish egg proteome is clearly linked to embryo developmental potential, a phenomenon that begs further investigation to elucidate the root causes of poor egg quality, presently a serious and intractable problem in livestock and human reproductive medicine...|$|R

40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization (MALDI) mass {{spectrometry}} was investigated {{as a method}} for the rapid determination {{of the extent of}} polymer coupling in polyethylene glycol- (PEG) conjugated superoxide dismutase (SOD). PEG-conjugated SOD, an antioxidant with an extended in vivo circulation lifetime compared to that of superoxide dismutase, is being evaluated as an effective therapeutic agent for the treatment of injuries and arthritis. The mass spectra <b>of</b> a standard <b>batch</b> <b>of</b> PEG-conjugated bovine SOD showed the presence of identifiable and well resolved peaks that correspond to 0 – 7 PEG molecules attached to bovine SOD. The area of each of the peaks provides a determination of the amount of PEG-conjugated SOD with a given number of bound PEG groups. SOD is a noncovalent dimer of two identical subunits that dissociates in MALDI. The information obtained in the mass spectra thus corresponds to a monomer of SOD. Each SOD monomer contains 10 lysines, which are the sites of PEG-conjugation. Multiple MALDI determinations <b>of</b> two <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> samples indicated <b>good</b> reproducibility for routine determination of the extent of polymer content. The amount of PEG-conjugated SOD that contained a given number of PEG molecules, determined by MALDI, was compared with the value deduced from the amount of PEG-conjugation at each attachment site measured by a peptide mapping method. Agreement between the data obtained in the two techniques (MALDI and peptide mapping) indicates that MALDI may be used to obtain quantitative information on PEG-conjugated SOD to determine the amounts of PEG-conjugated protein each with a different number of PEG groups attached. Measurement <b>of</b> several <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> samples stored at a higher temperature showed a lower extent of PEG-conjugation in PEG-conjugated SOD. This reduction in the PEG content resulted from the PEG-deconjugation of PEG-conjugated SOD at a higher temperature. Thus, MALDI can be used to examine the stability of PEG-conjugated SOD. The high sensitivity, relatively straightforward data interpretation, speed <b>of</b> analyses, and <b>good</b> reproducibility in measurements make this technique a useful analytical tool for fingerprinting PEG-conjugated SOD as well as potentially other polymer-conjugated proteins...|$|R

40|$|It {{is a well}} {{recognized}} {{problem that}} sample derived transferrin-bound iron (Tf-Fe) interferes with radio-iron incorporation into heme in the in vitro assay of erythropoietin (Ep) using fetal mouse liver cells (FMLC). This paper describes a mathematical procedure to correct for the unknown quantity of "cold" Tf-Fe in a plasma sample, being assayed for Ep in the FMLC. Excellent recovery of Ep activity was obtained with this method of correction, when testing solutions containing Step III sheep Ep with and without human Tf-Fe. The distorted dose response curves, obtained, when testing specimens of rat plasma, showed, after correction, linearity and parallelism to a Step II Ep dose response curve, permitting valid estimation of the potency ratio.

The samples were collected from different <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and wDDGS produced from the same and newly build bioethanol plant in western Canada with updated bioethanol processing technology [...] The results of chemical composition analysis showed significant differences (P< 0. 05) among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. The variation in term of range among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) were 2. 1, 2. 5 and 1. 0 %DM, respectively. Among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS, the variation in CP, NDF and ADF were 3. 9, 5. 2 and 3. 8 %DM, respectively. The soluble crude protein (SCP) content ranged by 7. 2 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and by 4. 2 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. In mineral profiles, variation among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and wDDGS in sulfur were 0. 03 and 0. 34 % of DM, respectively. In mineral profiles, higher phosphorus and sulfur content associated with wDDGS could be a concern. The sulfur content ranged by 0. 3 % of DM among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS with a mean of 1. 1 %DM. For the estimated subfractions with Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS), the immediately rumen available PA fraction (NPN) ranged by 14. 8 % of CP among the <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wheat and by 2. 7 % <b>of</b> CP among <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS. The particle size analysis revealed the small particle size in all three <b>batches</b> <b>of</b> wDDGS with the geometric mean of ranging from 650 - 690 µm. In situ rumen degradation kinetic results showed a significant differences (P< 0. 05) among both wheat and wDDGS batches.
