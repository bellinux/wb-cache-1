5|$|The Arena <b>browser</b> (also {{known as}} the Arena WWW <b>Browser)</b> is an early (now discontinued) testbed Web <b>browser</b> and Web {{authoring}} tool for Unix. Originally authored by Dave Raggett in 1993, the <b>browser</b> continued its development at CERN and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and subsequently by Yggdrasil Computing. As a testbed <b>browser,</b> Arena was used in testing the implementation for HTML version 3.0, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), and libwww. Arena was widely used and popular {{at the beginning of}} the World Wide Web.|$|E
5|$|The Arena <b>browser</b> {{served as}} the W3C's testbed <b>browser</b> from 1994 to 1996 when it was succeeded by the Amaya project.|$|E

40|$|The web <b>browsers</b> are the {{application}} software {{that are used}} to access information from the World Wide Web. With the increas-ing popularity of the web <b>browsers,</b> the modern web <b>browsers</b> are designed to contain more features as compared to the exist-ing web <b>browsers.</b> For the transferring of information through these <b>browsers,</b> various protocols have been implemented on these modern web <b>browsers</b> to make these <b>browsers</b> more efficient. Different protocols used in different layers have different functions and by increasing the efficiency of these protocols we can make the working of <b>browsers</b> more efficient...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{are some of the}} more popular mobile <b>browsers.</b> Some mobile <b>browsers</b> are really miniaturized Web <b>browsers,</b> so some mobile device providers also provide <b>browsers</b> for desktop and laptop computers.|$|R
5|$|In 1993, Dave Raggett, then at Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Bristol, England {{devoted his}} spare time to {{developing}} Arena on which he hoped to demonstrate new and future HTML specifications. Development of the <b>browser</b> was slow because Raggett was the lone developer and HP, which like many other computer corporations at the time, was unconvinced that the Internet would succeed and thus did not consider investing in web <b>browser</b> development. Raggett demonstrated the <b>browser</b> at the first World Wide Web Conference in Geneva, Switzerland in 1994 and the 1994 ISOC conference in Prague to show text flow around images, forms, {{and other aspects of}} HTML later termed as the HTML+ specification. Raggett subsequently partnered with CERN, to develop Arena further as a proof of concept <b>browser</b> for this work. Using the Arena <b>browser,</b> Dave Raggett, Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, Håkon Wium Lie and others demonstrated text flow around a figure with captions, resizable tables, image backgrounds, HTML math, and other features. At the Web World conference in Orlando, in early 1995, Raggett demonstrated the different new features of Arena.|$|E

5|$|Beta-3a {{released}} on 14 August 1996 and Beta-3b {{released on}} 16 September 1996 introduced {{support for the}} Linux operating systems on m68k and DEC Alpha. CSS 1 support was enhanced and the internationalized version was also updated. Between the two beta-3 releases the W3C was already looking at a new testbed and switched later to the Amaya <b>browser.</b> Beta-3 was the last involvement of the W3C {{in the development of}} Arena. On 17 February 1997, Yggdrasil Computing took over the role of developing the <b>browser.</b>|$|E
40|$|Research area: Information Security and Cryptography, Internet Security, Wireless and Mobile NetworkingMobile web <b>browsers</b> now provide nearly {{equivalent}} features {{when compared}} to their desktop counterparts. However, smaller screen size and optimized features for constrained hardware make the web experience on mobile <b>browsers</b> significantly different. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of the display-related security issues in mobile <b>browsers.</b> We identify two new classes of display-related security problems in mobile <b>browsers</b> and devise a range of real world attacks against them. Additionally, we identify an existing security policy for display on desktop <b>browsers</b> that is inappropriate on mobile <b>browsers.</b> Our analysis is comprised of eight mobile and five desktop <b>browsers.</b> We compare security policies for display in the candidate <b>browsers</b> to infer that desktop <b>browsers</b> are significantly more compliant with the policies as compared to mobile <b>browsers.</b> We conclude that mobile <b>browsers</b> create new security challenges and are not simply miniature versions of their desktop counterparts...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>browsers</b> {{display a}} warning if they receive an invalid certificate. Older <b>browsers,</b> when {{connecting}} {{to a site}} with an invalid certificate, would present the user with a dialog box asking whether they wanted to continue. Newer <b>browsers</b> display a warning across the entire window. Newer <b>browsers</b> also prominently display the site's security information in the address bar. Extended validation certificates turn the address bar green in newer <b>browsers.</b> Most <b>browsers</b> also display a warning to the user when visiting a site that contains a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted content.|$|R
50|$|The Flexible Box Module is {{supported}} {{in all of}} the modern <b>browsers.</b> Older <b>browsers</b> still have issues, but most of those (mainly Internet Explorer 9 and below) are no longer supported by their vendors. Many designers will choose to provide compatible styling for older <b>browsers,</b> to be overridden in modern <b>browsers</b> by the new syntax. In spite of the continued existence of legacy <b>browsers,</b> this module is currently touted as a solution to the Holy Grail issue.|$|R

5|$|Microsoft has {{integrated}} Cortana into numerous {{products such}} as Microsoft Edge, the <b>browser</b> bundled with Windows 10. Microsoft's Cortana assistant is deeply integrated into its Edge <b>browser.</b> Cortana can find opening-hours when on restaurant sites, show retail coupons for websites, or show weather information in the address bar. At the Worldwide Partners Conference 2015 Microsoft demonstrated Cortana integration with upcoming {{products such as}} GigJam. Conversely, Microsoft announced in late April 2016 that it would block anything other than Bing and Edge from being used to complete Cortana searches, again raising questions of anticompetitive behavior by the company.|$|E
50|$|Early web <b>browsers</b> {{supported}} only a {{very simple}} version of HTML. The rapid development of proprietary web <b>browsers</b> {{led to the development}} of non-standard dialects of HTML, leading to problems with interoperability. Modern web <b>browsers</b> support a combination of standards-based and de facto HTML and XHTML, which should be rendered in the same way by all <b>browsers.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, {{no other}} major <b>browsers</b> (Mozilla Firefox, Opera nor WebKit based <b>browsers)</b> support this writing-mode property. However, all major {{standards-compliant}} <b>browsers</b> now support CSS3 rotation for block elements, {{which makes the}} visual rotation of HTML text available.|$|R

5|$|Norton Internet Security version 1.0 for Mac was {{released}} November 1, 2000. It can identify and remove both Windows and Mac viruses. Other features include a firewall, advertisement blocking in the <b>browser,</b> parental controls, {{and the ability}} to prevent confidential information from being transmitted outside the computer. Users are prompted before such information is able to be transmitted. The incorporation of Aladdin Systems' iClean allows users to purge the <b>browser</b> cache, cookies, and browsing history within Norton's interface. Operating system requirements call for Mac OS 8.1. Hardware requirements call for 24 MB of RAM, 12 MB of disk space, and a PowerPC processor.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} {{development}} team and the complexity of porting the whole <b>browser</b> to a new backend caused Epiphany to re-release version 2.22 with bugfixes instead of the actual development code, so <b>browser</b> development remained stagnant until , when the project team announced that Epiphany 2.26 would be the final Gecko-based version. Eventually, in September 2009 the Webkit-powered Epiphany 2.28 was released, as part of GNOME 2.28.|$|E

5|$|Windows 95 was {{released}} without a web <b>browser</b> as Microsoft {{had not yet}} developed one. The success of the web caught them by surprise and they subsequently approached Spyglass to license their <b>browser</b> as Internet Explorer. Spyglass went on to later dispute {{the terms of the}} agreement, as Microsoft was to pay a royalty for every copy sold. However, Microsoft sold no copies of Internet Explorer, choosing instead to bundle it for free with the operating system.|$|E
5|$|Arena {{was built}} using the multi-threaded library of common code called the W3C Reference Library, now called libwww. Originally, the Arena <b>browser</b> {{was built on}} top of Xlib as Raggett {{considered}} the programming manuals for Motif and other X libraries to be rather daunting.|$|E
5|$|Arena, which predated Netscape Navigator and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, {{featured}} {{a number of}} innovations used later in commercial products. It was the first <b>browser</b> to support background images, tables, text flow around images, and inline mathematical expressions.|$|E

We identified 23 SNOMED CT <b>browsers</b> that have been developed, and inspected 17. We enumerate and provide test criteria for a ‘master list’ of 143 browsing features supported {{by at least one}} inspected browser; future work will determine which of these features are implemented by individual <b>browsers.</b> Only 5 features were common to all 17 browsers; 89 were found in less than one third of <b>browsers.</b> We recommend that a core set of browsing features be defined and harmonized across <b>browsers,</b> particularly for text-to-concept search operations...|$|R
5000|$|While JavaScript feature {{detection}} and [...] rules {{can help to}} target <b>browsers</b> that require fallback functionality, they will not address bugs in specific <b>browsers</b> or enable that advanced functionality.

Since polyfills add or fix functionality in <b>browsers</b> that don't have it, they serve a different purpose than feature queries, but can be used in combination with them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Mobile <b>browsers</b> are {{increasingly}} being relied upon to perform security sensitive operations. Like their desktop counterparts, these applications can enable SSL/TLS to provide strong security guarantees for communications over the web. However, the drastic reduction in screen size and the accompanying reorganization of screen real-estate significantly changes the use and consistency of the security indicators and certificate information that alert users of site identity {{and the presence of}} strong cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we perform the first measurement of the state of critical security indicators in mobile <b>browsers.</b> We evaluate ten mobile and two tablet <b>browsers,</b> representing over 90 % of the market share, against the recommended guidelines for web user interface to convey security set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C). While desktop <b>browsers</b> follow the majority of guidelines, our analysis shows that mobile <b>browsers</b> fall significantly short. We also observe notable inconsistencies across mobile <b>browsers</b> when such mechanisms actually are implemented. We show where and how these failures on mobile <b>browsers</b> eliminate clues previously designed for, and still present in, desktop <b>browsers</b> to detect attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle. Finally, we offer advice on where current standards are unclear or incomplete. Index Terms—Measurement, mobile security, SSL indicators, web <b>browsers.</b> ...|$|R
