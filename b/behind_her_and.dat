5|$|Later, when Ava and Andy {{are alone}} together, she lets the Acheri demon into the building, {{and uses a}} new ability to command it to kill him. After {{revealing}} to Sam that she has actually been in the town all the months she has been missing, killing off other psychic children that Azazel has sent there, she sets the Acheri demon on him. However, Jake sneaks up <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> uses his superhuman strength to break her neck, prompting the now free Acheri demon to flee. As Sam and Jake then start to leave the town, Jake attacks him out of distrust, but Sam gains the upper hand and apparently knocks him unconscious. However, as Sam is distracted by an arriving Dean and Bobby, Jake regains consciousness and fatally stabs him. Dean assures his brother that he {{will take care of}} him, but Sam dies in his arms.|$|E
5|$|In July 2016 García, who was Real Sociedad's only {{representative}} in the squad, captained Spain to {{a silver medal}} at the UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship, losing 2–1 in the final to hosts France. She had two opportunities to draw Spain level but found herself {{the victim of a}} waterlogged pitch, missing a penalty in the opening half before skying a near-open goal opportunity in injury-time {{as a result of the}} on-field conditions. The match was suspended for over two hours after half-time due to the weather conditions and upon the players' return to the pitch certain sections of the field were entirely waterlogged. García was ridiculed by large sections of the media for the miss but received overwhelming support from her fan-base, prompting her to take to Instagram following the tournament to thank those who stood <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> the team. The showpiece match was her third appearance in a continental final, having previously ended as runner-up in the tournament's previous edition and as well as in the UEFA Women's Under-17 Championship in 2014. The record is one which she shares with teammates Andrea Sánchez Falcón and Naria Garrote.|$|E

25|$|Maria Theresa (1741–80) {{faced an}} {{immediate}} challenge from Prussia's Frederick II {{when she became}} head of the House of Habsburg. In 1741 she appeared before the Diet of Budapest holding her newborn son and entreated Hungary's nobles to support her. They stood <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> helped secure her rule. Maria Theresa later took measures to reinforce links with Hungary's magnates. She established special schools to attract Hungarian nobles to Vienna.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, {{with his hands in}} front of his face and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|During the 1770s and 1780s Gainsborough {{developed}} {{a type of}} portrait in which he integrated the sitter into the landscape. A splendid {{example of this is}} his portrait of Frances Browne, Mrs John Douglas (1746-1811) which can be seen at Waddesdon Manor. The sitter has withdrawn to a secluded and overgrown corner of a garden to read a letter, her pose recalling the traditional representation of Melancholy. Gainsborough emphasised the relationship between Mrs Douglas and her environment by painting the clouds <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> the drapery billowing across her lap with similar silvery mauves and fluid brushstrokes. This portrait was included in his first private exhibition at Schomberg House in 1784.|$|E

25|$|Her coach {{had advised}} her {{to hold back}} on her swim speed, {{otherwise}} she {{might not be able}} to complete the race; together with the lack of power in her left arm, that meant her swim was much slower than usual at 61minutes. In contrast with her previous races at Kona, where Wellington had dominated on the bike, she started the marathon stage with five women still in front of her. Wellington's main concern, though, was Mirinda Carfrae, the 2010 champion who was only a little over three minutes <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> the only woman who had run faster than her on this course – a serious worry, given Wellington's injuries.|$|E
25|$|Both Matthews and Cuthbert {{won their}} heats with Matthews setting an Olympic record of 11.5seconds in hers. Cuthbert broke that {{record in the}} {{following}} heat {{with a time of}} 11.4seconds. The world record of 11.3 was held by another Australian, Shirley Strickland who was eliminated in her heat. In the final Matthews felt she got a bad start and was last at the 50metre mark. Cuthbert sensed Isabella Daniels from the USA close <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> pulled out a little extra to win Australia’s first gold at the Games in a time of 11.5seconds, Matthews was third. The result was repeated in the 200m final. Cuthbert won her second gold breaking Marjorie Jackson’s Olympic record. Mathews was third again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Melba {{embarked}} on an affair with Prince Philippe, Duke of Orléans. They were seen frequently together in London, which excited some gossip, but far more suspicion arose when Melba travelled across Europe to St Petersburg to sing for Tsar Nicholas II: the Duke followed closely <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> they were spotted together in Paris, Brussels, Vienna and St Petersburg. Armstrong filed divorce proceedings {{on the grounds of}} Melba's adultery, naming the Duke as co-respondent; he was eventually persuaded to drop the case, but the Duke decided that a two-year African safari (without Melba) would be appropriate. He and Melba did not resume their relationship. In {{the first years of the}} decade, Melba appeared in the leading European opera houses, including Milan, Berlin and Vienna.|$|E

25|$|Keyes brings Jackson to Los Angeles, suspecting {{that the}} man aboard the train had not been Dietrichson, but rather had been Phyllis' {{accomplice}} in Dietrichson's murder. After examining photographs of Dietrichson, Jackson is sure {{that the man}} he met was not that old, but at least ten years younger. Now certain that he can prove murder, Keyes is eager to reject the claim and force Phyllis to sue. Neff warns Phyllis not to pursue the insurance claim in court and admits {{that he has been}} talking to Lola about her past. Phyllis, however, insists on filing suit to pursue the claim despite the risk to both her and Neff. Lola eventually tells Neff that she has discovered that her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr), has been seeing Phyllis <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> (<b>and</b> Neff's) back.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> {{turns to see}} Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|Before Robin's funeral, Emma {{stands at}} Hook's grave and cries, {{trying to cope}} {{with the fact that he}} is truly gone now. Suddenly, a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called from <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>and</b> turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back as a reward for {{stopping}} Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides to break the news about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.|$|E
