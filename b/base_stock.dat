5|$|The {{origins of}} the breed are not fully documented, but some {{evidence}} points to the ancestors of the Jutland {{being used by the}} Vikings during the early 9th century. Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern Jutland. Some of those horses may have been left behind, contributing to the <b>base</b> <b>stock</b> from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed. Horses from Jutland were exported to England, Germany and France during the Middle Ages, and were popular mounts for knights, especially for use in jousting. The first mention of the Jutland type is from the 12th century, when they are documented as war horses with many useful attributes. The Jutland horse appears in the Danish ballad Svend Felding's Kamp med Risen, in which mythic hero Svend Fælling goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant. Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant, therefore Svend obtains a Jutland horse from a passing miller, who claims that it is strong enough to carry fifteen skippund. Mounted on the Jutland, Svend succeeds in killing the giant.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, <b>base</b> <b>stock</b> model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E
500|$|Pain {{was one of}} Henry's [...] "new men", who owed their {{positions}} and wealth to the king. The medieval writer Orderic Vitalis described them as a group as [...] "of <b>base</b> <b>stock</b> who had served him [...] well, raised them, so to say, from the dust" [...] and that the king [...] "stationed them above earls and famous castellans". Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status, this was probably an exaggeration on the chronicler's part. Pain's family was respectable enough, as his father held a number of properties directly from the king. It appears that Pain did not always take the king's side; the historian C. Warren Hollister has argued that Pain was not among the supporters of Henry's only surviving legitimate child, Matilda, in 1126, when Henry had his nobility swear that they would recognise her as his heiress. Hollister feels that the removal of Waleran from Pain's custody {{was a sign that}} Pain had not supported Matilda.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{reports a}} series of studies on the {{lubricant}} properties, elastohydrodynamic film thickness, and coefficients of friction of several commercially available ester <b>base</b> <b>stocks,</b> i.e., diisooctyl phthalate (DIOP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), diisotridecyl phthalate (DITDP), diisooctyl sebacate (DOS), diisotridecyl sebacate (DTDS), trihydroxymethylpropyl trioleate (TMPTO), and pentaerythritol tetraoleate (PETO). The results include densities and viscosities from 303 to 398 K, and elastohydrodynamic lubricant film thicknesses and friction in the boundary, mixed and full-film lubrication regimes measured at several temperatures, loads, and speeds. These ester <b>base</b> <b>stocks</b> have different lubrication abilities owing to their chain lengths, geometric configurations, and molecular rigidity. This study provides quantitative insight into the use of ester-based lubricants for low friction through the entire lubrication regime (boundary to full film) by utilization of suitable type and size of the ester <b>base</b> <b>stocks.</b>|$|R
