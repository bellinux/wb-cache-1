5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as {{they would not be}} sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits {{of the rest of the}} team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

25|$|Edith Hamilton again, {{considering}} {{the position of}} women, wrote that the Old Testament writers considered them just as impartially as they did men, free from prejudice and even from condescension.

25|$|It can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{movement}} for freedom struggle against foreign rulers in Bharuch started in 1905.

25|$|After a 30-year void, when LH {{materials}} were finally demonstrated, it could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> designation of negative refractive index {{is unique to}} LH systems; even when compared to photonic crystals. Photonic crystals, like many other known systems, can exhibit unusual propagation behavior such as reversal of phase and group velocities. But, negative refraction does not occur in these systems, and not yet realistically in photonic crystals.|$|E
25|$|It may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> modern formal {{discipline}} of sociology {{began with the}} analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 study of suicide rates amongst Catholic and Protestant populations. The works of Max Weber emphasised the relationship between religious belief and the economic foundations of society. Contemporary debates have centred {{on issues such as}} secularization, civil religion, and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of globalization and multiculturalism.|$|E

25|$|Full-scale {{parabolic}} trough systems consist of many such troughs {{laid out in}} parallel over a large area of land. Since 1985 a solar thermal system using this principle has been in full operation in California in the United States. It is called the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) system. Other CSP designs lack this kind of long experience and therefore it can currently <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{parabolic trough}} design is the most thoroughly proven CSP technology.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} what happens, {{consider the following}} analogy. Someone throws one ball every second at a man. Assume that balls travel with constant velocity. If the thrower is stationary, the man will receive one ball every second. However, if the thrower is moving towards the man, he will receive balls more frequently because the balls will be less spaced out. The inverse is true if the thrower is {{moving away from the}} man. So it is actually the wavelength which is affected; as a consequence, the received frequency is also affected. It may also <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> velocity of the wave remains constant whereas wavelength changes; hence frequency also changes.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the advent}} of bookplate {{collectors}} and their frenzy for exchange, the devising of bookplates was almost invariably left to the routine skill of the heraldic-stationery salesman. Near {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the composition of personal book tokens became recognized as a minor branch of a higher art, and there has come into fashion an entirely new class of designs which, for all their wonderful variety, bear as unmistakable a character as that of the most definite styles of bygone days. Broadly speaking, it may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purely heraldic element tends to become subsidiary and the allegorical or symbolic to assert itself more strongly.|$|E

25|$|The {{works of}} Asín Palacios are widely admired, {{notwithstanding}} criticism that his view point {{was of a}} Christian priest while involved in the neutral academic field of Islamic studies. In his own country, the labors of the Spanish Arabists, to which he contributed greatly, has over the generations worked to favorably alter the view shared by many Spaniards concerning the Muslim period of their history. His spiritual insights into Islamic mysticism illuminated formerly obscure figures and hidden connections. Perhaps, too, along with Louis Massignon and others, it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Professor Rev. Miguel Asín Palacios {{was instrumental in the}} open recognition by the Catholic Church of Islam as a legacy of Abraham, articulated in the Nostra aetate document of Vatican II (1962–1965).|$|E
25|$|Of his cathedral restorations, {{inspired}} as {{they were}} by the mistaken idea that a medieval church ought to be homogeneous in style and unencumbered by screens, monuments, and other obtrusive relics of the past, it can only <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Chapters who employed him were no more enlightened than their architect, and that at Westminster Abbey at least he accomplished an urgent work of repair in an unexceptionable manner. His activities at Salisbury, Durham, Hereford, and Lichfield were bitterly criticized by John Carter in his Pursuits of Architectural Innovation, and it was due in large measure to Carter's persistent denunciation that, in 1796, Wyatt failed to secure election as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. In the following year, however, he was permitted to add F.S.A. to his name {{by a majority of}} one hundred and twenty-three votes.|$|E
25|$|The year 1870 in {{the history}} of the Cape Colony marks the dawn of a new era in South Africa, and it can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of modern South Africa began on that date. Despite political complications that arose from time to time, progress in Cape Colony continued at a steady pace until the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer Wars in 1899. The discovery of diamonds in the Orange River in 1867 was immediately followed by similar finds in the Vaal River. This led to the rapid occupation and development of huge tracts of the country, which had hitherto been sparsely inhabited. Dutoitspan and Bultfontein diamond mines were discovered in 1870, and in 1871 the even richer mines of Kimberley and De Beers were discovered. These four great deposits of mineral wealth were incredibly productive, and constituted the greatest industrial asset that the Colony possessed.|$|E
