5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting that Cross had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
25|$|A leaflet called Settling Down on Civvy Street {{was issued}} to POWs {{after they had}} <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Britain {{for a week or}} two. This timing was {{intended}} to catch their attention when the initial excitement of repatriation had subsided and POWs might begin to experience some frustration or have questions.|$|E

500|$|Bolesław {{sent his}} German and Hungarian mercenaries home after Sviatopolk was re-established on the Kievan throne, [...] "the populace" [...] having [...] "flocked to him" [...] and having [...] "appeared loyal". It {{is not known}} how long Bolesław {{remained}} in and around Kiev. The 10 months given by the unreliable account of Gallus is fanciful. Bolesław in fact departed {{within a few months}} and, as Thietmar died on December 1, 1018, Bolesław must have <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Poland a good time before December.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had only}} <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Australia {{for a week}} when he faced Wally Hammond's visiting English team in the touring side's match against Victoria. His fielding and batting were rusty after the long layoff, and the media {{constantly}} probed him about the contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League a few months earlier, to start in 1947. Miller said nothing in the press, but the Victorian Cricket Association made public appeals for an employer to give Miller a job {{so that he would}} not leave the state and become a professional sportsman in England. In the match against Hammond's men, Miller struggled while scoring 32 in the first innings before being dismissed by leg spinner Doug Wright. In the Victorian second innings he was bowled by James Langridge for eight. [...] Victorian captain Lindsay Hassett was not willing to ask Miller to bowl, given his lack of thorough preparation for the season; the tourists won the match by 244 runs.|$|E
2500|$|The then Premier of Victoria, Denis Napthine, commented in June 2013: [...] "There is {{no doubt}} the system failed Jill Meagher. Under the changes we've already introduced, the {{offender}} would have <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> jail, not on the streets. Our actions are the minimum {{we can do to}} try and make sure this never ever happens again." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Democrats {{took control}} of the Senate in 1986, giving them control of both Houses of Congress, {{allegations}} were made to Attorney General Edwin Meese that Whittlesey had granted diplomatic favors for private contributions to her State Department-administered representational fund and that she had also obstructed justice. [...] Meese [...] "found no 'reasonable grounds' to pursue allegations that" [...] Whittlesey [...] "mishandled entertainment funds at the embassy or improperly aided contributors to the funds" [...] in contravention of the independent counsel statute. Hearings into the subject were held by a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, but the hearings failed to produce substantiation of the charges and went nowhere. [...] The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial entitled [...] "True Grit," [...] echoing a popular movie of the time, dismissed the investigation. [...] "The ambassador had <b>been</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Washington for the past few months, where she successfully defended herself against charges that she'd misspent money that had been donated to the U.S. State Department and then tried to obstruct the investigation into her spending. The U.S. Justice Department has now filed a notification in Federal Circuit Court in Washington clearing the ambassador of any wrongdoing and vindicating the view that there was a whole lot less to the whole affair than had met either the eye or ear....It is impressive to come out of such an investigation clean and clear." ...|$|E

60|$|My {{return to}} the office sticks out in my memory with an extreme vividness, because of the wild eagle of pride that screamed within me.

60|$|It {{was a long}} letter, {{too long}} to be read until she was at leisure, and written in a straggling hand that made reading difficult.
