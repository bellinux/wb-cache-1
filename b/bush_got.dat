25|$|Bush {{volunteered for}} his father's campaigns in 1980 and 1988. During the 1980 campaign, Bush {{worked as an}} unpaid volunteer, and {{expressed}} great admiration for his father. In the mid-1980s, <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> his start in Florida politics as the Chairman of the Dade County Republican Party. Dade County {{played an important role}} in the 1986 election of Bob Martinez to the Governor's office. In return, Martinez appointed Bush as Florida's Secretary of Commerce. He served in that role in 1987 and 1988, before resigning to work on his father's presidential campaign.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1915 season, J. C. Kofoed in Baseball Magazine rated Bush as {{the best}} shortstop in the American League. Kofoed wrote that Bush had only five fewer chances than Rabbit Maranville and seven fewer errors, noted that Bush made [...] "spectacular plays" [...] in the field [...] "day after day". [...] Kofoed also {{dismissed}} those who relegated Bush to the [...] "poor hitting class", noting that <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> on base and scored more often than any of his Detroit teammates. [...] The Sporting Life that same year noted that Bush [...] "is just about the most methodical and consistent person connected with our national game." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The patent <b>bush</b> has <b>got</b> {{loose in}} the hub," [...] he resumed. [...] "I took the pin out and then saw I might have trouble if the wheel came off. It has been {{threatening}} to play this trick for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'd changed: the <b>bush</b> had <b>got</b> hold of me. The {{ways and}} views of the people over yonder didn't seem to be those I remembered. They couldn't look at things from my standpoint; I wouldn't adopt theirs. You and I have had to face--realities." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In the {{meantime}} Colonel <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> to a police-station above the barracks, and got muskets {{and a few}} cartridges from a discharged African soldier {{who was in the}} police establishment. Being joined by the policemen, Corporal Craven {175} and Ensign Pogson, they concealed themselves on an eminence above, and as the mutineers (about 100 in number) approached, the fire of muskets opened on them from the little ambush. The little party fired separately, loading as fast as they discharged their pieces; they succeeded in making the mutineers change their route.|$|E
60|$|On {{our return}} I was {{introduced}} to the 'Uncle Tom' of the neighbourhood, who had come down to spend Sunday at the Squire's house. He was a middle-sized Negro, in cast of features not above the average, and Isaac by name. He told me how he had been born in Baltimore, a slave to a Quaker master; how he and his wife Mary, during the second American war, ran away, and after hiding three days in the <b>bush,</b> <b>got</b> on board a British ship of war, and so became free. He then enlisted into one of the East Indian regiments, and served some years; as a reward for which he had given him his five acres of land in Trinidad, like others of his corps. These Negro yeomen-veterans, let it be said in passing, are among the ablest and steadiest of the coloured population. Military service has given them just enough of those habits of obedience of which slavery gives too much--if the obedience of a mere slave, depending not on the independent will, but on brute fear, is to be called obedience at all.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the third}} episode of season two, every episode {{ends with a}} police radio excerpt {{referencing}} the intersection of SE 132nd St. and SE Bush St. in the Powellhurst-Gilbert neighborhood of Portland, Oregon. A female officer says [...] "132 and <b>Bush,</b> I've <b>got</b> him at gunpoint", and a female dispatcher replies, [...] "132 and Bush. Cover's Code 3." [...] Another woman says [...] "Units 25, 14 can transmit on Tac 2" [...] and the dispatcher says [...] "Okay, we'll still send it Code 3." [...] Then an instrumental version of [...] "Bad Boys" [...] plays over the credits. On the first season of Cops, instead of [...] "132 and <b>Bush,</b> I've <b>got</b> him at gunpoint", it was a police radio excerpt from the Broward County, Florida Sheriff's Office. In the first two episodes of the second season, a different police radio excerpt from the Portland Bureau of Police was used.|$|R

Michael Craig {{had an affair with}} Belinda Lee's stand in and almost drowned crossing a river.|$|R
2500|$|Mercer made {{international}} {{headlines in}} 2000 {{when he pulled}} a Talking to Americans stunt on then-presidential candidate George W. <b>Bush.</b> He successfully <b>got</b> <b>Bush</b> {{to answer questions about}} non-existent Canadian Prime Minister [...] "Jean Poutine". Bush was not amused at the time, and thereafter refused to accept interviews from the CBC. However, he did make a joking reference to this incident during his visit to Canada in 2004. In the same US election campaign, Mercer asked Democratic candidate Al Gore to promise to visit the [...] "Canadian capital city" [...] of Toronto after his election. Gore did not question Mercer's incorrect identification of the capital of Canada.|$|R

5000|$|Citibank {{is one of}} {{the lead}} lenders to the {{developers}} of the Dakota Access Pipeline project in North Dakota, a 1,172-mile long (1,886 kilometers) oil pipeline project. The pipeline has been controversial regarding its potentially devastating environmental impacts and because the Sioux say it threatens their sacred lands and water supply. According to a statement by Hugh MacMillan, a senior researcher on water, energy and climate issues, Citibank has been [...] "running the books on this project, and that's the bank that beat the <b>bushes</b> and <b>got</b> other banks to join in." ...|$|R
60|$|As we went, {{two things}} happened. The {{first of these}} was that a very large, black rhinoceros, which was {{sleeping}} in some <b>bushes,</b> suddenly <b>got</b> our wind and, after the fashion of these beasts, charged down on us from about fifty yards away. Now I was carrying a heavy, single-barrelled rifle, for as yet we and our weapons were not parted. On came the rhinoceros, and Komba, small blame to him for he only had a spear, started to run. I cocked the rifle and waited my chance.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1992 US presidential {{election}} campaign, both George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton were photographed reading WWN issues that depicted them meeting with P'lod. <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> a hearty laugh from the article and Clinton held his copy up at a campaign stop and joked that it proved his campaign had [...] "universal" [...] appeal.

50|$|Fifty {{years from}} now in a civics class, {{students}} will learn about the Lincoln Memorial, that other presidents are on Mount Rushmore - and George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> a sewage plant. It will prompt people to ask why, and they can discuss the Iraq war, and everything that led to it. People want to forget bad moments of history, and this is our way {{of making sure that}} doesn't happen.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Nickelodeon {{promoted}} the event with interstitials throughout its regular programming, features in Nickelodeon Magazine, online activities, and a book. [...] Both John Kerry and George W. Bush declined to appear, stating {{they were too}} busy. [...] The results were announced by Linda Ellerbee on U-Pick Live. [...] Kerry received 57 percent of the vote; President <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> 43 percent. This {{would be the first}} vote where its results went against those of the general election.|$|E
60|$|So saying Roy crept on {{his hands}} and knees to the edge of the lake, being {{concealed}} by <b>bushes,</b> until he <b>got</b> into the water. Here a few steps took him into the reeds which clustered so thickly at that spot, and grew so tall that he was soon hidden from sight altogether.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he became}} aware of a low hissing sound. The mouth closed, and the eyes opened so abruptly, that there seemed some {{necessary}} connection between the two acts. Moving quietly round the <b>bush</b> until he <b>got</b> into its shadow, his dark form melted from the scene without any one observing his disappearance.|$|R
6000|$|The way {{also was}} here very wearisome through dirt and slabbiness. Nor {{was there on}} all this ground so much as one inn or victualling-house, therein to refresh the feebler sort. Here, therefore, was grunting, and puffing and sighing. While one tumbleth over a brush, another sticks fast in the dirt; and the children, some of them, lost their shoes in the mire. While one cries out, [...] "I am down!" [...] and another, [...] "Ho! where are you?" [...] and a third, [...] "The <b>bushes</b> have <b>got</b> such fast hold on me, I think I cannot get away from them." ...|$|R
50|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their MNF home {{loss to the}} Vikings, the Saints stayed at home for a Week 6 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. In the first quarter, New Orleans trailed early as Raiders Sebastian Janikowski got a 24-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints took the lead as RB Reggie <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> a 3-yard TD run, along with kicker Taylor Mehlhaff (recently signed due to Martín Gramática out for the year) getting a 44-yard field goal.|$|E
50|$|The District of Columbia voted by an {{extremely}} large margin {{in favor of}} the Democratic candidate Al Gore with 85% of the vote. <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> 9% with 18,000 votes compared to Nader who got 5% with 10,000 votes. A total of 44% of the population came out to vote. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that D.C. only encompasses an urban core area (and those are generally very liberal in nature). The District of Columbia has never voted for a Republican. One elector abstained.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{full-length}} Iron & Wine album, entitled The Shepherd's Dog, {{was released}} September 25, 2007. This album was voted {{one of the}} ten best of 2007 by Paste magazine. Contributors included Joey Burns and Paul Niehaus of Calexico, as well as jazz musicians Matt Lux and Rob Burger. When asked to describe the album to The Independent, Beam remarked that [...] "it's not a political propaganda record, but it's definitely inspired by political confusion, because I was really taken aback when <b>Bush</b> <b>got</b> reelected." ...|$|E

In a 2006 interview, Blair had stated: [...] "We turned the corner, and there is the car ... It was a very defining moment. I think I spent the next half an hour pretending to be a <b>bush.</b> They <b>got</b> {{out of the car and}} started firing at us.

More than 100 newspapers published an identical letter to the editor from the site with different signatures on it. Similar campaigns were used by GeorgeWBush.com, and by MoveOn.org to promote Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget's [...] "Fix the Debt" [...] campaign advocated to reduce government debt without disclosing that its members were lobbyists or high-ranking employees at corporations that aim to reduce federal spending.

Then one day, just by accident, he put one hand against the trunk of a young pine-tree, and when he started to take it away, he found it stuck fast. He had to pull to get it free. Like a flash an idea popped into his head. He rubbed a little of the pitch, for that was what had made his hand stick, on both hands, and then he started to climb a tree. As long as the pitch lasted, he could climb.|$|R
