40|$|Abstract. ProVerif over-approximates the attacker’s {{power to}} enable {{verification}} of processes under replication. Unfortunately, {{this results in}} ProVerif finding false attacks. This problem is particularly common in protocols whereby a participant commits to a particular value and later reveals their value. We introduce a method to reduce false attacks when analysing secrecy. First, we show how inserting phases into non-replicated processes enables a more accurate translation to Horn clauses which avoids some false attacks. Secondly, we generalise our methodology to processes under replication. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our technique by analysing <b>BlueTooth</b> Simple <b>Pairing.</b> Moreover, we propose a simplification of this protocol that achieves the same security goal. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from Bell Laboratories {{discovered}} {{flaws in}} the <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme. In 2003, Ben and Adam Laurie from A.L. Digital Ltd. discovered that serious flaws in some poor implementations of Bluetooth security may lead to disclosure of personal data. In a subsequent experiment, Martin Herfurt from the trifinite.group {{was able to do}} a field-trial at the CeBIT fairgrounds, showing the importance of the problem to the world. A new attack called BlueBug was used for this experiment. In 2004 the first purported virus using Bluetooth to spread itself among mobile phones appeared on the Symbian OS.The virus was first described by Kaspersky Lab and requires users to confirm the installation of unknown software before it can propagate. The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as [...] "29A" [...] and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or Symbian OS since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also Bluetooth sniping) showed that the range of Class 2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to 1.78 km with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.This poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on, although these can be deduced within a few minutes if the device is in use.|$|E
40|$|As {{the use of}} the Bluetooth {{technology}} in wireless technologies such as computers, cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), printers, digital cameras, PC peripherals, and headphones, among others, has enormously increased during this decade, it has also increased the need of employing a more secure and robust pairing protocol that protects the transfer of information between Bluetooth devices. ^ The existing <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> protocol starts when a Bluetooth device is set to be in discoverable mode and it is found by another device. After this step is completed, it initiates the pairing procedure by sharing some important device information, then by connecting to the other device and exchanging several link keys, and finally, by authenticating the connecting device in order to make sure is a trusted peer. However, through this document it is shown that this existing <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> protocol has still some security flaws that have caused impersonation attacks. ^ The impersonation attack is a big concern in Bluetooth security due that, in most of the cases, it directly allows the access to relevant information, such as private, confidential or even classified, and this attack is reached just by creating a connection which is fully formed from a <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> with a false device credentials. ^ Due to the concern for this type of attack, this document focuses on the implementation of an additional step on the existing <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> and authentication process, which enhances the Bluetooth security and also avoids the impersonation attack. This additional step was added just after the final authentication stage that a Bluetooth device commonly performs, and {{it is based on the}} use of Digital Certificates and a Certificate Authority in order to ensure that the identity of the connecting device can be trusted. Moreover, this additional authentication method is also based on three security levels, which are divided by the type of device to be connected, the application of this Bluetooth device, and the capabilities to connect to internet in order to verify the Digital Certificate that is going to be used for authentication. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Despite {{many good}} (secure) key {{agreement}} protocols based on publickey cryptography exist, secure associations between two wireless devices are often established using symmetric-key cryptography for cost reasons. The consequence is that common daily used security protocols such as <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> are insecure {{in the sense}} that an adversary can easily extract the main private key from the protocol communications. Nevertheless, we show that a feature in the Bluetooth standard provides a pragmatic and costless protocol that can eventually repair privateless associations, thanks to mobility. This proves (in the random oracle model) the pragmatic security of the <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> protocol when repairing is used. 1 Setting up Secure Communications Digital communications are often secured by means of symmetric encryption and message authentication codes.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{usability}} issues surrounding an {{implementation of the}} Personal Area Network (PAN) Gateway, a new concept in mobile communications. The PAN Gateway device consists of a GSM/GPRS modem and a Bluetooth modem. The Bluetooth modem is used to link mobile devices to form a PAN and the GSM/GPRS modem is used to link the PAN to external networks. The possible Man Machine Interfaces for the PAN Gateway are discussed together with the usability of existing Bluetooth devices. A weakness was discovered in the usability and security of <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>Pairing</b> in existing mobile devices and {{this led to the}} development of the "Touch and Find" system and the Pairing Link Protocol. The "Touch and Find" system interacts with the Bluetooth stack and allows simple, intuitive pairing of Bluetooth devices via a serial link. A full duplex serial link was implemented using simple electrical contacts to provide the link. Inductive coupling and infrared solutions were also developed. The Pairing Link Protocol specifies the signal flow for the "Touch and Find" process. The "Touch and Find" system that was implemented using simple electrical contacts shows how simple <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> can be. Pairing is simply carried out by briefly touching together the devices to be paired. The "Touch and Find" system was implemented in C on Borland C++ and used in conjunction with TTPCom's Bluetooth development system, which consists of a "Mad Cow" evaluation board and Genie - a Bluetooth development tool. The research carried out demonstrates the feasibility of the "Touch and Find" system over a variety of physical mediums.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} phone and mobile media sharing {{relationships}} {{of a group of}} young mobile phone users in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Intensive sharing took place within peer and intimate relationships, while resource sharing characterized relationships with a more extensive circle, including members of the older generation. Phones were kept open to others to avoid inferences of stinginess, disrespect, or secretiveness and the use of privacy features (such as passwords) was complicated by conflicts between an ethos of mutual support and the protection of individual property and privacy. Collocated phone use trumped online sharing but media on phones constituted public personae similar to social media ‘profiles’.

40|$|The Bluetooth {{protocol}} for close-range wireless communication {{has been a}} huge success. It is a widely adopted standard and is used {{for a wide range of}} devices, from cellphones to PDAs to laptops and more. Due to its ubiquity and importance, its security has become a critical issue. In the new version 2. 1 released in July 2007, a complete overhaul of the pairing procedure was carried out with the express aim of making it more secure. In this paper we show that the <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>pairing</b> protocol in passkey entry mode completely leaks the password. In addition, we show that it is possible to pair with a device that uses a fixed (but unknown) password, even when the password is random and reasonably long. Our attacks demonstrate that passkey entry mode can only be used with a different random password each time. Unfortunately this is not possible for devices that use a fixed password (like many hands-free car kits). In addition, due to human behavior, this is unlikely to be the case when the user enters the password into two devices in order to pair them. Thus, devices who leave it to the user to enter a password (instead of randomly generating it on one of the devices) will be vulnerable to attack. ...|$|E
