50|$|Dynamic ropes {{used for}} rock {{climbing}} {{come in a}} variety of lengths and diameters, with the most common lengths being 50, 60, and 70 meters (approximately 165, 200, and 230 feet, respectively). Lengths will vary depending on rope maintenance and age, and there are even ropes as long as 80 meters for specialized ascents on routes that would normally require a multi-pitch climbing attempt due to being only slightly longer than a standard rope length. Rope diameters are generally between 8.3mm and 11.5mm, with the different diameters used for slightly different purposes. Sport and multi-pitch trad climbers often value thinner ropes because they are lighter, and have less rope drag. Thinner ropes also run more smoothly through belay devices, especially assisted <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> or 'tube-style' devices operated in 'guide mode', which can be tedious to pull thicker or stiffer rope through. Lighter, thinner ropes, however, have less strength than a thicker rope and will sustain fewer hard falls. Note that some belay devices are better suited for different rope diameters. This is particularly relevant with assisted <b>braking</b> <b>devices,</b> such as the Petzl Grigri (which, for example, works best with a 9.4-10.3 mm thick line) or the Faders SUM.

40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed combined <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed combined <b>brake</b> <b>device</b> at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language.

The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s.

In this case the acceptable number of brake applications for friction linings (compared with mechanical braking) will increase by 1. 6 – 2. 8 times.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the most}} {{widespread}} methods to increase the power of internal-combustion engines (ICEs) is turbocharging. But turbochargers used for 70 % of engines {{have a number of}} essential disadvantages: their low service reliability as up to 30 % of engine failures are caused by turbochargers; their high price; their cost-demanding reconditioning caused by high labour inputs and considerable downtime periods of machine-tractor units; losses due to long downtime periods of machine-tractor units. ICE life reducing usual for those equipped with turbochargers is due to frequent high-temperature overloads abnormal for turbochargers. To reduce the thermal factor of turbocharger elements and the running-out durability can be possible when using a hydraulic accumulator and a <b>braking</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, a test bench is manufactured for examining the turbocharger with the proposed elements. As a result, we manage to avoid semidry and dry friction to extend the turbocharger life, with the rotor slowing time being reduced on average up to 30 – 35 % as compared with the normal (load-free) rotor slowing time. Thus, a hydraulic accumulator combined with a <b>braking</b> <b>device</b> can reduce turbocharger failures up to 10 – 15 %...|$|R

40|$|Powered {{models of}} three {{different}} flying boats were landed in oncoming wave of various heights and lengths. The resulting motions and acceleration were recorded to survey the effects of varying the trim at landing, the deceleration after landing, {{and the size of}} the waves. One of the models had an unusually long afterbody. The data for landing with normal rates of deceleration indicated that the most severe motions and accelerations were likely to occur at some period of the landing run subsequent to the initial impact. Landings made at abnormally low trims led to unusually severe bounces during the runout. The least severe landing occurred after a small lending when the model was rapidly decelerated at about 0. 4 g in a simulation of the proposed use of <b>braking</b> <b>devices.</b> The severity of the landings increased with wave height and was at a maximum when the wave length was of the order of from one and one-half to twice the over-all length of the model. The models with afterbodies of moderate length frequently bounced clear of the water into a stalled attitude at speeds below flying speed. The model with the long afterbody had less tendency to bounce from the waves and consequently showed less severe accelerations during the landing run than the models with moderate lengths of afterbody...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{this work}} {{the problem of}} Plasma Brake has been characterised from an orbital flight {{mechanics}} point of view. Plasma Brake thrusters are essentially <b>braking</b> <b>devices</b> which provide active and controllable spacecraft acceleration by means of electrostatically charged tethers interacting with the environmental plasma. A simplified and approximated Plasma Brake model has been created {{in order to reduce}} computational times and keep acceptable errors for preliminary mission design analyses. The model has been specifically adapted to circular, Low Earth Orbits (LEOs) and implemented into an orbital simulator written in Matlab® code. The main task of the orbital simulator is the determination of the de-orbiting time of a spacecraft, given initial calendar date, its initial orbital parameters (or equivalently position and velocity vectors), and the tethers system characteristics. The simulator has been validated by comparison with a reference ISS de-orbiting profile and the approximated Plasma Brake model errors have been estimated. The local optimal control laws have been also identified for the minimum de-orbiting time between two reference altitudes and for a reference spacecraft. A sensitivity study has been conducted with respect to the reference configuration and some peculiarities of the physics involved in the Plasma Brake problem have been identified, including analogies with the atmospheric drag. The complete Plasma Brake model has then been implemented into the orbital simulator, extending the analysis to non-circular orbits and in particular to interplanetary re-entry trajectories. In this scenario, a very basic feasibility study of a “plasma-capture” mission has been performed, considering an interplanetary mission re-entering from the planet Mars (with the hypotheses of circular and coplanar planetary orbits, Hohmann transfer, and hyperbolic re-entry). Finally, Plasma Brake performances were evaluated and compared with different propulsive technologies, outlining advantages in using Plasma Brake thrusters instead of the conventional and already space-qualified ones...|$|E
