5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes {{were found to have}} major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E

5000|$|Cabinet faces. Solid wood {{remains a}} popular choice for cabinet parts, {{including}} bases, frames, doors, and sides. However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs. Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R

5|$|In 1988, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its electron configuration that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's electron configuration. The s2p configuration was expected to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> volatile than the s2d configuration, and <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration.|$|E
