Immunohistochemistry {{is useful}} in the diagnosis and may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> differentiate a cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis of other gastrointestinal tumors. Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> confirm the identify of the mushroom: {{a drop of}} dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn the tubes pale red whereas nitric acid (HNO3) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|E

5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide {{placed on the}} cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution turns the cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate {{fruits and vegetables}} are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are {{divided into two groups}} based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} usually {{diagnosed}} {{based on the}} person's medical history, history from relatives, and behavioural observations. The presence of characteristic neurological and neuropsychological features {{and the absence of}} alternative conditions is supportive. Advanced medical imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> exclude other cerebral pathology or subtypes of dementia.

5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> protect the environment. Crop varieties that {{are resistant to}} pests and diseases can {{reduce the need for}} application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel. This provides redundancy in case one component should fail, and also allows automatic error detection and error correction if the results differ. These methods can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> prevent single event upsets caused by transient errors. Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns the cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray {{color on the}} cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters that may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> distinguish S.dudleyi {{from some other}} Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the hymenium) are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E

Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts they are not), the ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat.

Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with the symptoms.

5|$|Two main {{clinical}} {{staging systems}} {{are used to}} classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection.
