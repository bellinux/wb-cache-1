5|$|Programs {{to prevent}} the {{vertical}} transmission of HIV (from mothers to children) can reduce rates of transmission by 92–99%. This primarily {{involves the use of}} a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> rather than breastfeeding. If replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable, and safe, mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case. If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out, the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission. In 2015, Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother-to-child transmission of HIV.|$|E

25|$|A {{mother can}} express (produce) her milk for storage and later use. Expression occurs with massage or a breast pump. It {{can be stored}} in freezer storage bags, {{containers}} made specifically for breastmilk, a supplemental nursing system, or a bottle ready for use.

25|$|Breastfeeding is the {{recommended}} {{method of feeding}} by all major infant health organizations. If breastfeeding is not possible or desired, <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> is done with expressed breast-milk or with infant formula. Infants are born with a sucking reflex allowing them to extract the milk from the nipples of the breasts or the nipple of the baby bottle, {{as well as an}} instinctive behavior known as rooting with which they seek out the nipple. Sometimes a wet nurse is hired to feed the infant, although this is rare, especially in developed countries.|$|E

These feelings occur in both bottle- and breast- feeding mothers, although for different reasons. <b>Bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> mothers may feel {{that they should be}} breastfeeding. Conversely, breastfeeding mothers may feel forced to feed in uncomfortable circumstances. Some may see breastfeeding as, “indecent, disgusting, animalistic, sexual, and even possibly a perverse act."

2500|$|In addition, proponents {{believed}} that holding induced age regression, enabling {{a child to}} make up for physical affection missed earlier in life. Regression is key to the holding therapy approach. In attachment therapy, breaking down the child's resistance by confrontational techniques is thought to reduce the child to an infantile state, thus making the child receptive to forming attachment by the application of early parenting behaviors such as <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding,</b> cradling, rocking and eye contact. Some, but by no means all, attachment therapists have used rebirthing techniques to aid regression. The roots of the form of rebirthing used within attachment therapy lie in primal therapy (sometimes known as primal scream therapy), another therapy based on beliefs in very early trauma and the transformational nature of age regression. Bowlby explicitly rejected the notion of regression stating [...] "present knowledge of infant and child development requires that a theory of developmental pathways should replace theories that invoke specific phases of development in which it is held a person may become fixated and/or to which he may regress." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{breastfeeding}} {{promotion and}} support of adolescent mothers {{must take into account}} the context of the individual and their cultural norms. [...] Few teenagers can withstand the cultural pressure which categorizes <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> as a norm. Therefore, new teenage mothers need more concerted prenatal anticipatory guidance, specialized lactation education and an increase of face-to-face postpartum support. [...] To succeed with the task at hand, inpatient nursing care will have to be tailor to the unique needs of this population. [...] Positive perception of inpatient postpartum nursing care {{have been found to be}} an incredible influence in a young mother's success with breastfeeding. [...] In a study conducted in the United States, young mothers reported positive postpartum experiences, especially in respect to breastfeeding initiation and mother-infant bonding, when their nursing care was targeted for adolescent mothers. The mothers reported that they felt better cared for and more motivated to initiate and sustain breastfeeding when nurses where friendly, patient, respectful and understanding of their individual needs. [...] Maternal self-confidence is a contributing factor that influences positive breastfeeding outcomes especially among adolescent mothers. Empowerment, compassion, understanding and patience are key when caring for young moms.|$|E
2500|$|Attachment {{therapy is}} a {{treatment}} used primarily with fostered or adopted {{children who have}} behavioral difficulties, sometimes severe, but including disobedience and perceived lack of gratitude or affection for their caregivers. The children's problems are ascribed to an inability to attach to their new parents, because of suppressed rage due to past maltreatment and abandonment. The common form of attachment therapy is holding therapy, in which a child is firmly held (or lain upon) by therapists or parents. Through this process of restraint and confrontation, therapists seek to produce in the child a range of responses such as rage and despair {{with the goal of}} achieving catharsis. In theory, when the child's resistance is overcome and the rage is released, the child is reduced to an infantile state in which he or she can be [...] "re-parented" [...] by methods such as cradling, rocking, <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> and enforced eye contact. The aim is to promote attachment with the new caregivers. Control over the children is usually considered essential, and the therapy is often accompanied by parenting techniques which emphasize obedience. These accompanying parenting techniques are {{based on the belief that}} a properly attached child should comply with parental demands [...] "fast, snappy and right the first time" [...] and should be [...] "fun to be around". These techniques have been implicated in several child deaths and other harmful effects.|$|E

It recommends that health practitioners who decide that individual women and/or their infants may benefit from breast feeding, should engage in a dialogue with the women. Such a dialogue should focus, not so much on information, but on the woman's views about her dietary and other health practices. If the woman is given compelling health reasons she may see herself as capable of changing some practices long enough to breast feed. infant feeding breast milk parturient women survey cultural values demographic factors dietary practices...|$|R

40|$|Social {{support has}} been {{identified}} as an important element for encouragement and success of lactation. The sources, types and amounts of perceived social support were determined for women during their third trimester of pregnancy and at four weeks of postpartum breastfeeding. Differences in social support were reported for women who stated an intention to breastfeed and those who planned to <b>bottle</b> <b>feed.</b> The tangible, emotional and informational functions of social support were measured as aggregate values across support sources.

The baby's father was a more important source of tangible support for intended breastfeeders. Intended breastfeeders also indicated they received more emotional and information support from the baby's father and prenatal classes. Tangible, emotional and informational support did not change pre- and postnatally for women who breastfed. However, certain sources did provide more support postnatally.
