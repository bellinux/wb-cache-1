40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to undertake an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy, by assessing the cost effectiveness <b>of</b> a new <b>Domiciliary</b> Physiotherapy Service (DPS) and by analysing the process <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy practice. The main element of the work was a randomised controlled trial of the DPS, in which an experimental group receiving domiciliary physiotherapy assessment and intervention was compared with a control group receiving conventional care. Hypotheses that domiciliary physiotherapy would improve clients' independence in activities of daily living (ADL) and health status, and reduce clients' use of other services, were tested. The null hypotheses related to ADL and health status could not be rejected, possibly because of a smaller than intended sample size, and/or the masking of real effects by sample attrition, or lack of sensitivity of the outcome measures. There was evidence to suggest that the DPS may have significantly increased, rather than decreased, the proportion of clients with at least one contact with another health or social service. The analysis of the process <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy developed as the RCT progressed. An interpretive account <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy practice, framed within the author's own experiential knowledge, was constructed using quantitative and qualitative data from DPS treatment records, GP referral forms, and interviews with clients, carers and experienced community-based therapists. The interpretive analysis has underpinned a new `reciprocal learning' model <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy, which may assist practitioners working in the field. The way forward for domiciliary physiotherapy practice may be to acknowledge that measurable clinical outcomes cannot easily be determined, and that criteria for assessing the value <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> physiotherapy should be based on client and carer perspectives...|$|R

The revenue cost <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> care was equal to or greater than the average associated with residential or hospital custodial care in such patients.

It is suggested that the supposed economic advantage <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> care will depend increasingly on restricting such services, thus increasing the degree of neglect to some patients...|$|R

40|$|The {{domiciliary}} consultation scheme {{introduced at}} the start of the NHS enables joint consultation between a consultant and general practitioner in a patient's home when the patient cannot attend hospital on medical grounds. Consultants claim a fee from the NHS, general practitioners do not. Data from the Department of Health and Social Security on domiciliary consultations in England and Wales during 1981 - 6 were analysed. The number <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultations fell during 1981 - 6 from 429, 759 in 1981 to 387, 394 in 1986, a fall of 10 %, whereas the numbers of consultants and general practitioners increased by 1404 (12 %) and 2400 (10 %), respectively. The yearly rate <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultation per consultant fell by 19 % from 36 in 1981 to 29 in 1986 and that per general practitioner by 18 % from 18 to 15. In 1986 geriatric medicine had the highest rate <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultation per consultant (187) followed by psychiatry (89), general medicine (52), dermatology (49), rheumatology (42), general surgery (36), gastroenterology (35), thoracic medicine (34), and orthopaedics (30).

40|$|In {{the early}} days of the British National Health Service, {{domiciliary}} visits were a continuation of the tradition whereby general practitioners (GPs) met consultants in the patient's home. The nature <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> visits, which still attract a special fee, has since changed. We analysed the effectiveness <b>of</b> all <b>domiciliary</b> visits undertaken in a NHS trust providing primary care, mental health and elderly care services to a population of 470, 000. Data were obtained from domiciliary visit claim forms and from questionnaires completed by the consultant, the referring GP and consultant peer reviewers. The largest number of visits (total 234) was in geriatric medicine 48. 9 %, followed by old-age psychiatry 44. 9 %. Geriatric medicine was more likely than psychiatry to admit patients to hospital (19 %) after a visit. All domiciliary visits in old-age psychiatry were done during the day (9 am to 5 pm). Only 2 % of GPs stated that they attended any <b>of</b> the <b>domiciliary</b> visits; almost all thought that the outcome <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> visits was <b>of</b> value. Old-age-psychiatry peer reviewers believed that all visits in that specialty were appropriate; in geriatric medicine this figure was 77 % and in other psychiatric specialties 65 %. The findings indicate that domiciliary visits were not being used routinely as a pathway to hospital admission, though they were often used to expedite admission or gain a quick consultant opinion; the visits were valued by GPs. The practice <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> visits differs greatly from the definition in NHS terms and conditions of service. One or other should be altered...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{review the}} use <b>of</b> the <b>domiciliary</b> {{consultation}} service in modern clinical {{practice in the}} Northern region. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study <b>of</b> data on <b>domiciliary</b> consultations from claim forms for payment submitted to the regional health authority by consultants during 1984 - 5 and prospective study during 1985 - 9. Peer review of patterns of practice by consultants. SETTING [...] 15 Of the 16 health districts in the Northern region, comprising a mixed urban and rural population of about 2. 8 million. PARTICIPANTS [...] 760 Consultants in 28 specialties and 1666 general practitioners who were eligible to perform or request domiciliary consultations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Numbers <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultations, general practitioners' requests for consultations, and consultants performing consultations and expenditure on the service by the region. RESULTS [...] Use <b>of</b> the <b>domiciliary</b> consultation service in the Northern region declined by 53 % between 1984 - 5 and 1988 - 9, considerably {{in excess of the}} national rate of decline of 27 %, and expenditure on the service was reduced, after allowing for inflation, by 604, 000 pounds, or 38 %, in real terms. Most consultants and general practitioners used the service sparingly whereas a small proportion used it heavily; a few specific consultants and general practitioners were responsible for a relatively high rate <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultations. Contrary to the original definition <b>of</b> <b>domiciliary</b> consultation, the general practitioner accompanied the consultant on only one occasion in 17 and, in one specialty examined (paediatrics) patients who received domiciliary consultations seemed to have minor medical problems. CONCLUSIONS [...] Peer review examination of the pattern of practice in the domiciliary consultation service proved effective in rationalising use of the service, although a substantial minority of consultants and general practitioners continued to use the service heavily. The place of the service in modern clinical practice would benefit from a national review...|$|R
