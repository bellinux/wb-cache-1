5|$|Dominant <b>bulls</b> follow {{groups of}} cows during the rut, from August into early winter. A bull will defend his harem of 20 cows or more from {{competing}} <b>bulls</b> and predators. Only mature <b>bulls</b> have large harems and breeding success peaks at {{about eight years}} of age. <b>Bulls</b> between two and four years and over 11 years of age rarely have harems, and {{spend most of the}} rut on the periphery of larger harems. Young and old <b>bulls</b> that do acquire a harem hold it later in the breeding season than do <b>bulls</b> in their prime. A bull with a harem rarely feeds and he may lose up to 20 percent of his body weight. <b>Bulls</b> that enter the rut in poor condition are less likely to make it through to the peak conception period or have the strength to survive the rigors of the oncoming winter.|$|E
5|$|Holtz {{earned his}} first win {{as head coach}} of the <b>Bulls</b> on September 1, 2010 in USF's season opener against Stony Brook 59–14. Later that season, Holtz would lead his <b>Bulls</b> to the program's first victory over the Miami Hurricanes. At {{the end of the season}} Holtz lead the USF <b>Bulls</b> to a mostly {{dominant}} 31–26 victory over the Clemson Tigers at the Meineke Car Care Bowl. This would mark the first Bowl victory for USF over a BCS team. The <b>Bulls</b> finished with an 8–5 record, but 3–4 in Big East play.|$|E
5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature <b>bulls</b> compete for the attentions of the cow elk and will try to defend females in their harem. Rival <b>bulls</b> {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and <b>bulls</b> sometimes sustain serious injuries. <b>Bulls</b> also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

5|$|After Jordan retired {{following}} the 1992–93 NBA season, Chicago <b>Bulls</b> owner Jerry Reinsdorf sought a sculptor to honor Jordan and requested that Chicago <b>Bulls</b> Vice President Steve Schanwald seek proposals from artists. Twelve artists made proposals. In January 1994, Schanwald hired Omri and Julie Rotblatt-Amrany of Highland Park, Illinois, who erected a statue at the Bulls' new {{home for the}} 1994–95 NBA season, the United Center.

5|$|After {{his short}} stint in baseball, Jordan {{returned}} to basketball {{late in the}} 1994–95 season. Although he did not lead the <b>Bulls</b> to the Finals, he returned to pre-retirement form the next year while the team acquired perennial rebounding champion Dennis Rodman. The 1995–96 <b>Bulls</b> finished the regular season 72–10, attaining, at the time, the best regular season record in NBA history (Later surpassed by the Golden State Warriors in the 2015-16 season {{with a record of}} 73-9). They dominated in the playoffs, with series records of 3–0, 4–1 and 4–0, before facing the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals. After the <b>Bulls</b> took a 3–0 series lead, Seattle won the next two games after coach George Karl switched point guard Gary Payton onto Jordan, leading to a sixth game. However, Jordan altered his game to accommodate the advances of Payton, and the <b>Bulls</b> won Game 6 to win their fourth title.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Bulls</b> {{won their}} sixth championship, Phil Jackson {{decided to leave}} the team and spend some time away from basketball. Michael Jordan then {{announced}} his second retirement, which prompted general manager Jerry Krause to begin rebuilding the roster with younger athletes. Six players from the 1997–98 <b>Bulls</b> (Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Steve Kerr, Luc Longley, Jud Buechler, and Scott Burrell) joined other teams through free agency or sign-and-trade deals, and with few established players left on the roster, the <b>Bulls</b> missed the 1999 playoffs. This began a six-year playoff drought, the longest such drought in team history.|$|E

In both series, Chicago won by hitting winning {{shots in the}} sixth and deciding game — the first by Steve Kerr in 1997 in Chicago, and the second by Jordan in Utah in 1998. This saw Chicago winning their sixth NBA championship, and managing their second three-peat. However, prior to the 1999 season, Jackson decided to retire, which set off a chain reaction that resulted {{in most of the}} team, including Jordan and Pippen, requesting to leave the <b>Bulls.</b> With no foundation of youth to build upon, the <b>Bulls</b> became a lottery-bound team for the next six seasons.|$|E
