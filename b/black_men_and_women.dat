5|$|Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans {{from the}} Civil War to World War II {{is a book}} by American writer Douglas A. Blackmon, {{published}} by Anchor Books in 2008. It explores the forced labor of imprisoned <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> through the convict lease system used by states, local governments, white farmers, and corporations after the American Civil War until World War II in the southern United States. Blackmon argues that slavery in the United States did not end with the Civil War, but instead persisted well into the 20th century. It depicts the subjugation of Convict Leasing, Sharecropping and Peonage and tells {{the fate of the}} former but not of the latter two.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> could not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E

25|$|Arnold Rampersad, {{the primary}} biographer of Hughes, {{determined}} that Hughes exhibited {{a preference for}} African-American men in his work and life. But, in his biography Rampersad denies Hughes's homosexuality, and concludes that Hughes was probably asexual and passive in his sexual relationships. Hughes did, however, show a respect and love for his fellow <b>black</b> <b>man</b> (<b>and</b> <b>woman).</b> Other scholars argue for his homosexuality: his love of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> is evidenced {{in a number of}} reported unpublished poems to an alleged black male lover.|$|R
5|$|The Southeastern Federation of Colored Women’s Clubs (eventually renamed as the Southeastern Association of Colored Women’s Clubs) elected Bethune as {{president}} after its first conference in 1920 at the Tuskegee Institute. They intended {{to reach out}} to Southern Women (specifically white women) for support and unity in gaining rights for black women. The women met in Memphis, Tennessee to discuss interracial problems. In many respects, all of the women agreed about what needed to be changed, until they came to the topic of suffrage. The white women at the conference tried to strike down a resolution on black suffrage. The SACWC responded by issuing a pamphlet entitled Southern Negro Women and Race Co-Operation; it delineated their demands regarding conditions in domestic service, child welfare, conditions of travel, education, lynching, the public press, and voting rights. The group went on to help register black women to vote after they were granted suffrage a few months later after passage of the constitutional amendment. Within the state, however, and in other southern states, <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were largely disenfranchised by discriminatory application of literacy and comprehension tests, as well as requirements to pay poll taxes, lengthy residency requirements, and the need to keep and display records.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that, in the United States, several {{minority}} groups, including <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women,</b> Hispanic men and women, and white women, suffer from decreased wage earning for the same job with the same performance levels and responsibilities as white males.

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war, African-American St. Louisans gained greater acceptance in industry than they had previously. By the end of 1942, nearly 8,000 <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> were hired in St. Louis industries, but employment discrimination remained a significant problem for the community. Most jobs in war factories were unskilled, although some factories, notably Scullin Steel, hired significant numbers of skilled black workers. The April 1943 municipal elections were significant for the civil rights movement, as the first African-American {{was elected to the}} St. Louis Board of Aldermen, Rev. Jasper C. Caston.

40|$|In 1960, 94 {{percent of}} doctors were white men, as were 96 percent {{of lawyers and}} 86 percent of managers. By 2008, these numbers had fallen to 63, 61, and 57 percent, respectively. Given that innate talent for these professions is {{unlikely}} to differ between <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> or between <b>blacks</b> and whites, the allocation of talent in 1960 suggests that a substantial pool of innately talented <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> <b>and</b> white <b>women</b> were not pursuing their comparative advantage. This paper estimates the contribution to U. S. economic growth from the changing occupational allocation of white <b>women,</b> <b>black</b> <b>men,</b> <b>and</b> <b>black</b> <b>women</b> between 1960 <b>and</b> 2008. We find that the contribution is significant: 17 to 20 percent of growth over this period might be explained simply by the improved allocation of talent within the United States...|$|R

2500|$|In 1908, United States Army veteran Lt. Colonel Allen Allensworth and Professor William Payne, Rev. William Peck and John W. Palmer, and Harry A. Mitchell {{sought to}} build a town where African Americans could own property, learn, and live the American Dream. They chose an [...] Tulare County site for a new town near the present {{location}} of Earlimart, California, and about [...] north of Bakersfield. The site was chosen for fertile soil, adequate water, and its location along a railroad corridor. <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> — craftsmen, artisans, businessmen, farmers, ranchers, retired military — moved their families to the newly purchased land. In 1914, the California Eagle newspaper stated that Allensworth deeded land was worth more than $112,000. The affairs of the town were administered by a council form of government known as the Allensworth Progressive Association, which directed the community through its formative and critical early years. Men and women held responsible positions in the community.|$|E
2500|$|In 1866, the National Woman's Rights Convention, {{meeting for}} the first time since before the Civil War, voted itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA) to work for {{universal}} suffrage – the vote for both blacks and women. Blackwell served as secretary of this organization during its three-year existence. In the winter of 1866-67, Blackwell and Stone lectured together on universal suffrage and formed local Equal Rights Leagues in New York and New Jersey. They also traveled to Washington, D.C., to lobby Charles Sumner against inclusion of the word [...] "male" [...] in the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, which would penalize states for denying black suffrage but not woman suffrage. Unsuccessful in persuading Northern politicians to use this opportunity to extend the franchise to women, Blackwell published an open letter to Southern legislators titled [...] "What the South Can Do," [...] again arguing that woman suffrage was politically expedient no matter a party's (or in this case, a region's) goals or fears. Using estimated figures of a white male and female electorate and a black male and female electorate, he argued that the vote of white Southern women would counterbalance the combined vote of <b>black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The album {{continues}} a nuanced {{dialogue about}} weighty topics {{that affect the}} African-American community.

2500|$|Feminist {{legal theory}} {{stems from the}} {{inadequacy}} of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics. DeGraffenreid v General Motors {{is an example of}} such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not [...] "a special class to be protected from discrimination". The ruling in DeGraffenreid against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality's role in discrimination. Moore v Hughes Helicopters, Inc. is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of Moore, the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men. Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females. The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to DeGraffenreid. Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could [...] "adequately represent white female employees". Payne v Travenol serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in Payne, two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both <b>Black</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> on the grounds the pharmaceutical plant practiced racial discrimination. The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males, however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees. Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company. Moore contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, Payne suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and DeGraffenreid argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. While the cases of DeGraffenreid (1976), Moore (1983), and Payne (1976) are not recent accounts; they provide proof of the courts inconsistency in procedures and rulings on the basis of sex and race, which serves to reinforce the need for Feminist legal theory to not only be further developed, but also applied.|$|E

Under conditions of organizational success, the three groups were evaluated comparably to each other, but each group was evaluated less favorably than White men. Further, leader typicality, the extent to which individuals possess characteristics usually associated with a leader role, mediated the indirect effect of leader race, leader gender, and organizational performance on leader effectiveness. Taken together, these results suggest that Black women leaders may carry a burden of being disproportionately sanctioned for making mistakes on the job...|$|R
