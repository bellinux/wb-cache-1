The hour-long show consisted primarily of material from Graveyard Mountain Home, which was accompanied by projections of the corresponding scenes from Age 13. [...] "I {{thought that it would}} be good for the first show to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of small and comfortable... so I thought we [...] just have a hundred people," [...] Moore said. [...] "Everybody can see, everybody can be comfortable and sort of enjoy themselves. And if something goes horribly wrong, it only happens in front of a hundred people." [...] Moore hoped the show would form the basis of more elaborate, longer shows. He planned on playing more shows in Turkey, before touring Europe and the rest of the world.|$|E

So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we got there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of scared...then we could go as fast as we liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E

500|$|Caesar's niece, Atia, {{was portrayed}} by actress Polly Walker. According to Heller, while most auditioning actresses {{assumed that the}} {{character}} was the series' villainess, Walker made [...] " [...] bigger than life but completely real...She could read the phone book {{with that kind of}} brio and joy." [...] Rather than a villain, Heller wrote her to be [...] "a real life force. Everything she's doing is for the good of her family, her children. No matter how evil it gets, it's always for good reason." [...] Walker was pleased with her [...] "very complex character. I found it exciting to play such massive emotions and deal with such interesting, to say the least, situations. I saw it as a huge challenge, and I have huge admiration for this character. A lot of people might consider her to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of evil or bad, but I think she's wonderful. She's just a survivor, doing what she's got to do." ...|$|E
500|$|To help {{differentiate}} the Bennet sisters, Durran viewed Elizabeth as the [...] "tomboy", clothing her in earthy colours {{because of her}} love of the countryside. For the other sisters, Durran remarked, [...] "Jane was the most refined and yet it's still all a bit slapdash and homemade, because the Bennets have no money. One of the main things Joe wanted was for the whole thing to have a provincial feel. Mary is the bluestocking: serious and practical. And then Lydia and Kitty are a bit Tweedledum and Tweedledee {{in a kind of}} teenage way. I tried to make it so that they'd <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of mirror images. If one's wearing a green dress, the other will wear a green jacket; so you always have a visual asymmetry between the two." [...] In contrast to the 1940 film, the 2005 production displayed the Bennet sisters in worn-down but comfortable dresses that allowed the actors better moveability.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and Flakey Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{directed}} by Paul R. Brown was filmed in Burbank, California between March 9 and March 10, 2007. The music video leaked onto the Internet on April 4, 2007, after briefly being available for digital download on iTunes Store. It initially premiered on Yahoo! Music on April 5. The video was {{compared with the}} psychological thriller film directed by Tarsem Singh, The Cell (2000). Lee said that the main inspiration is [...] "like we're in the walls of our minds, sort of". During an interview with MTV News, she further revealed {{the concept of the}} video, [...] "It's mostly live performance. It's not so much fluff and flying and tricks and wolves and stuff. It's more really just about the song, and that is unique for us. We usually do crazy stuff. It's gonna <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of like a video within the video. Since the song is our heaviest single, we really wanted to focus on mostly performance but still have something about it that's really unique. And I think [...] really {{hit the nail on the}} head." [...] The video starts with Lee laying on a couch and as the song progresses, she starts singing the lyrics [...] "It's true, we're all a little insane, but it's so clear now that I am unchained" [...] while getting up from it. She wears a red dress and [...] red make-up on her face. Later another scenes, show her singing in a room similar to The Cell, while the band is performing in another room.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding {{since she was}} just a little girl. But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In what has come to <b>be</b> <b>sort</b> of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl quote ("I love you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|E

According to Katz, {{they did not want}} to explain how Howard arrived on Earth initially, but later rewrote the screenplay so that the film would begin on Howard's home world. Huyck and Katz wanted to incorporate both lighter, humorous elements and darker, suspenseful elements. Katz states that some readers were confused by the sexual elements of the screenplay, as they were unsure as to whether the film was intended for adults or children. Huyck and Katz wrote the ending leaving the story open for a sequel, which was never produced.|$|E
