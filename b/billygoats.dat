50|$|In 1987 {{work began}} on a {{sub-contract}} to animate Strawberry Fields (the first CGI-assisted animated feature-film production). Although {{the film was}} never completed, it began GSA's preparation for the digital future. Also that year, Sefel Pictures hired GSA to coordinate creative affairs in Hungary and Poland on several European feature films it had in development in Soviet-bloc countries. In 1988, GSA began work on the Storybook <b>Billygoats</b> and the first special, A Klondike Christmas. The program was picked up for development by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and a script was produced. It was sold to Charles Allard and his television station (ITV) in Edmonton in 1989, and A Klondike Christmas went into production. Later that year the show won a Golden Apple Award in the US {{and went on to}} become a Canadian Christmas staple, airing on ITV, the Family Channel, CBC and Teletoon. In 1991, distributor Paragon International offered an advance for more episodes based on the characters; the program was also supported by ITV/WIC for broadcast, and production began on The Ice Princess, Peeny The Clown and Billygoat Bluegrass.GSA added clients and serviced more programs, such as Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (Disney), The Simpsons (Fox), Taz-Mania (Warner Bros.) and Bunch of Munsch (Cinar). Katie and Orbie was the first series for which GSA provided digital production services (in 1994).|$|E

5000|$|The exact {{origins of}} Rosemary's <b>Billygoat</b> are vague and largely undocumented {{by both the}} band and the music press; website Sonic Eclectic once remarked [...] "as far as {{incomplete}} biographies go, Rosemary’s <b>Billygoat</b> may have the most incomplete-est". According to several unverified accounts, the genesis of Rosemary's <b>Billygoat</b> began when singer Mike Odd met drummer Denis Fleps while working at a head shop together in Hermosa Beach. The two would regularly attend shows for such theatrical comedy bands as Haunted Garage, Celebrity Skin and the Imperial Butt Wizards, the latter of which Mike Odd became a performer for, and after recruiting bassist Lance Underpantz and former Nip Drivers guitarist Neal Gargantua, formed Rosemary's <b>Billygoat</b> in 1991. In 1993, the band made their recorded debut on the 7" [...] split Songs for Gentlemen with the Imperial Butt Wizards, where Subterranean Records described their early sound as [...] "militant witchcraft punk with a Motown edge".|$|R

5000|$|Rosemary's <b>Billygoat</b> {{underwent}} {{a shift in}} their visual style in 2002, when the band recruited special effects artist Craig Macintyre to help design new props and outfits for the group including goat-exoskeleton structures and monster-type prop art, effectively creating their current over-the-top horror-themed imagery and stage show. This {{was followed by the}} release of Rosemary's <b>Billygoat's</b> third album Evilution, again produced by Steve Kravac. Though the band continued to be a popular live attraction, critical response towards the album was mixed: Allmusic, rating the album with three stars out of five, summarized that Rosemary's <b>Billygoat</b> were [...] "sure to appeal to horror movie fans", drawing favorable comparisons to Gwar, Megadeth and Corrosion of Conformity and praising Neal Gargantua's [...] "inviting riffs and wicked soloing", but criticizing Mike Odd's [...] "grating" [...] vocals and their [...] "laughable" [...] cover of Pat Benatars [...] "Hell Is for Children".|$|R

The idea of patching Cap'n Bill to a goat was vastly amusing to him, and the more he thought of it the more he roared with laughter.
