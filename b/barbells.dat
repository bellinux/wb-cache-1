Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with <b>barbells</b> and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually wear off, much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly loose and flabby. Stewie jumps out of his bedroom window to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E

Several variations on this basic design exist, including <b>barbells</b> with curves or angles in the bar of the earring.|$|E

50|$|Bong Revilla {{played the}} title {{character}} in the 2003 comeback film Captain <b>Barbell</b> produced by Viva Films directed by Mac Alejandre, making him the first actor to have played both <b>Barbell</b> and Panday. In the movie, the alter-ego of Capt. <b>Barbell</b> is named Enteng (played by Ogie Alcasid). This version of the character adds some layers to his origin {{and was able to}} elaborate on the source of the superhero's powers and strength. Basically, Enteng finds the magic <b>barbell</b> in the most appropriate of places; in a gym, where he works as a janitor. No explanation is given as to how it got there in the first place. In the film, Captain <b>Barbell's</b> psychic projection tells his host, Enteng, that the <b>barbell's</b> metal is forged from a fragment of a magic rock that fell to the earth from space. During times of great crisis, the <b>barbell</b> is expelled to the surface to seek out one who would use its powers for good. Though not actually stated, the way the <b>barbell's</b> origin is explained seems to imply that this has all happened before, and that Enteng is only the latest person to become Captain <b>Barbell</b> (It gives it a sense of continuity with past versions). Indeed, prior to Enteng finding the <b>barbell,</b> CB is already established in the film as a well-known comic book character.|$|R

50|$|Captain <b>Barbell,</b> {{directed}} by Mike Tuviera and Dominic Zapata, is GMA Network's 2006 project after Darna's huge success. Richard Gutierrez portrayed a different, modern version of Captain <b>Barbell</b> (whose human identity is Teng), in the 2006 TV series Captain <b>Barbell</b> which aired {{for eight months}} (broadcast 5 days a week from May 29, 2006 to January 12, 2007). It is the first series in which both the alter-ego and the superhero are portrayed by the same actor (just like Darna), making Richard the second actor to do so after comedy king Dolphy. In the Captain <b>Barbell</b> movies prior to the TV series, different actors play Captain <b>Barbell</b> and his skinny human alter-ego: in the 1986 movie, Edu Manzano plays Captain <b>Barbell</b> while Herbert Bautista plays his human alter-ego Tengteng; in the 2003 movie, Bong Revilla Jr. plays Captain <b>Barbell</b> while Ogie Alcasid plays his alterego Enteng, while Richard Gutierrez's uncle Jun Soler had comedy king Dolphy to play his alter ego Teng-teng.|$|R
30|$|The {{conventional}} {{pumping units}} were {{selected as the}} basic model to redesign the lower <b>barbell</b> pumping units with keeping the original structure, and a rigid lower <b>barbell</b> device was added at the tail of beam. The “lower” means the center of <b>barbell</b> {{was not at the}} same straight line with the beam. The “barbell” refers to the offset balance weight device like a <b>barbell.</b> Due to the reasonable configuration for the position and the quality of lower <b>barbell,</b> the beam balance torque can balance the polished torque better than the conventional pumping units. Therefore, the torque of gearbox decreased and was smooth more than before (Zhu et al. 2009).|$|R

50|$|The {{start of}} the story was filled with comedy (with Dolphy’s unequalled {{portrayal}} of Tenteng in the movie). The original Captain <b>Barbell</b> (portrayed by Bob Soler) had an eye mask and a real <b>barbell</b> made of “magical” solid gold. Captain <b>Barbell</b> and his alter-ego Tenteng each has a separate identity and portrayal. Tenteng is funny and a weakling while Captain <b>Barbell</b> is a serious character, and superstrong and invulnerable to any man-made weapons. He doesn’t, however, have superspeed as being portrayed on the television series. In fact, GMA 7’s adulterated version of Captain <b>Barbell</b> is almost entirely different from the original character, in storyline, costume and characterization.|$|R
