5|$|In a 16 December statement, three Stabæk Fotball {{officials}} said that they suspected that Ulrichen's plan all along was to convert the venue to a pure convention center, and that the use as a football venue was a decoy to get a free lot worth up to NOK200 million plus grants worth NOK50 million. The <b>book</b> <b>value</b> of the venue was NOK303 million {{at the end of}} 2010, although a statement from the district court stated that the value of the venue was significantly lower than that.

5|$|The stadium had a <b>book</b> <b>value</b> of NOK230 million, {{way over}} the real value, causing Start Toppfotball to have to write down the investment. To finance this, Sparebanken Sør, the main creditor, bought Start Stadion from Start Toppfotball for NOK2,600 on 23 December 2008. At the same time, the club signed a 40-year {{agreement}} to lease the stadium from Sparebanken Sør for NOK12 million per year. On 7 March 2009, the bank also bought the remaining shares of Start Toppfotball, becoming the sole owner of both the club and the stadium. Sparebanken Sør offered to sell Sparebanken Sør Arena to the municipality for NOK100 million, but the municipality rejected this on 29 May. The bank subsequently sold Start Stadion and Start Toppfotball to Ravnaas on 25 June for NOK1 each. Start Stadion {{had at the time}} a debt of NOK34 million to Start Toppfotball, NOK60 million to Sparebanken Sør and NOK40 million to Kristiansand Municipality. Sparebanken Sør lost NOK80 million in their transactions with Start and Sparebanken Sør Arena.|$|E
40|$|Many of the less-developed {{countries}} have required foreign companies to settle nationalization claims on {{a basis of}} <b>book</b> <b>values.</b> These <b>book</b> <b>values</b> are based on generally accepted accounting principles that tend to make <b>book</b> <b>values</b> lower than current far values.

50|$|Revaluation {{does not}} mean only an upward {{revision}} in the <b>book</b> <b>values</b> of the asset. It can also mean a downward revision (also called impairment) in the <b>book</b> <b>values</b> of the assets. However, any downward revision in the <b>book</b> <b>values</b> of the assets is immediately written off to the Profit & Loss account. Under IFRS, an asset {{is considered to be}} impaired (and is thus written down) if its carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the greater of the asset's value in use (present value of future values) or net realizable value.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the changes in}} value relevance of earnings and <b>book</b> <b>values</b> over the last 50 years in the USA. Value relevance refers {{to the ability of}} accounting data to explain stock market values or returns. The common claim of the prior research is that the value relevance of earnings has decreased over time, while the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>book</b> <b>values</b> has increased. Researchers have presented several reasons for these changes. The reasons include, firstly, the balance sheet approach pursued by the FASB, and secondly the increasing intangible intensity. Other reasons include the increasing frequency of special items, the growing incidence of negative earnings, the decreasing average firm size as well as the decline in matching over time. The empirical part of the study was conducted using cross-sectional regressions of market value on earnings and <b>book</b> <b>values.</b> The sample consists of U. S. firms listed on NYSE, AMEX and NASDAQ over the sample period of 1964 - 2013. The results show that the value relevance of earnings, the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>book</b> <b>values,</b> and the combined value relevance of earnings and <b>book</b> <b>values</b> has decreased over time...|$|R

25|$|Value {{investing}} is {{an investment}} paradigm which generally involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis, though it has taken many forms since its inception. It derives from the ideas on investment that Benjamin Graham and David Dodd began teaching at Columbia Business School in 1928 and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis. As examples, such securities may be stock in public companies that trade at discounts to <b>book</b> <b>value</b> or tangible <b>book</b> <b>value,</b> have high dividend yields, have low price-to-earning multiples or have low price-to-book ratios.|$|E

25|$|FIFO {{treats the}} first unit that arrived in {{inventory}} {{as the first}} one sold. LIFO considers the last unit arriving in inventory as the first one sold. Which method an accountant selects can {{have a significant effect}} on net income and <b>book</b> <b>value</b> and, in turn, on taxation. Using LIFO accounting for inventory, a company generally reports lower net income and lower <b>book</b> <b>value,</b> due to the effects of inflation. This generally results in lower taxation. Due to LIFO's potential to skew inventory value, UK GAAP and IAS have effectively banned LIFO inventory accounting. LIFO accounting is permitted in the United States subject to section 472 of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|E

This paper aims to determine the value relevance of financial statement information in Turkish stock markets {{during the period of}} 1997 - 2011 by Ohlson Model (1995) and separate regressions. Starting from 2003, new regulations about financial reporting standards became effective. Consolidation and inflation accounting were put into action in 2003 annual financial statements. Afterwards in 2005, the revised translation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) was applied. And finally in 2008, one by one translation of IFRS named as Turkish Financial Reporting Standards (TFRS) became effective. So, we also aim to test whether the acceptance of new financial reporting standards made improvements on value relevance of accounting information or not in Turkish stock markets. Our results reveal that earnings and <b>book</b> <b>values</b> both together and separately are significantly value relevant. The explanatory power of <b>book</b> <b>values</b> are higher than the explanatory power of earnings. After new reporting standards, there is an increase in the value relevance of earnings and <b>book</b> <b>values</b> together and this increase is mainly due to the increase in the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>book</b> <b>values.</b> </p...|$|R

25|$|Benjamin Graham is {{regarded}} {{by many to}} be the father of value investing. Along with David Dodd, he wrote Security Analysis, first published in 1934. The most lasting contribution of this book to the field of security analysis was to emphasize the quantifiable aspects of security analysis (such as the evaluations of earnings and <b>book</b> <b>value)</b> while minimizing the importance of more qualitative factors such as the quality of a company's management. Graham later wrote The Intelligent Investor, a book that brought value investing to individual investors. Aside from Buffett, many of Graham's other students, such as William J.

40|$|How to {{incorporate}} hard-to-measure assets into the wealth tax? We analyze {{the effect of}} an optimal wealth tax on risk-taking behavior and welfare when investors do not only have the standard portfolio choice with a well-diversified market portfolio, but can alternatively choose to invest all their wealth into a non-diversifiable, indivisible project. The latter is interpreted as entrepreneurial investment into a small, non-listed firm for which the actual value is hard to measure and non-verifiable. For such firms, real-world wealth tax systems base the wealth tax on deterministic <b>book</b> <b>values.</b> We show that this tax treatment does not distort the choice of projects if the tax is set optimally with an imputed interest rate on <b>book</b> <b>values,</b> actually larger than the risk-free market rate of return. The market equilibrium and a proportional tax on the market portfolio will ensure an efficient risk allocation between private and public consumption and across projects. Failing to apply an imputed inflation of <b>book</b> <b>values,</b> instead, gives rise to an implicit subsidy on entrepreneurial activity and distorts investment. Our findings also have implications for taxation of hard-to-measure assets under capital-gains and inheritance taxation...|$|R
