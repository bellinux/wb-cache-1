Intervalley scattering {{is an additional}} scattering mechanism at large electric fields, and it {{is due to a}} shift of carriers from the lowest valley of the conduction band to the upper valleys, where the lower <b>band</b> <b>curvature</b> raises the effective mass of the electrons and lowers electron mobility.

5000|$|Traditionally {{effective}} masses {{were measured}} using cyclotron resonance, a method in which microwave absorption of a semiconductor {{immersed in a}} magnetic field goes through a sharp peak when the microwave frequency equals the cyclotron frequency [...] In recent years effective masses have more commonly been determined through measurement of band structures using techniques such as angle-resolved photo emission (ARPES) or, most directly, the de Haas-van Alphen effect. Effective masses can also be estimated using the coefficient γ of the linear term in the low-temperature electronic specific heat at constant volume [...] The specific heat depends on the effective mass through the density of states at the Fermi level and as such {{is a measure of}} degeneracy as well as <b>band</b> <b>curvature.</b> Very large estimates of carrier mass from specific heat measurements have given rise to the concept of heavy fermion materials. Since carrier mobility depends on the ratio of carrier collision lifetime [...] to effective mass, masses can in principle be determined from transport measurements, but this method is not practical since carrier collision probabilities are typically not known a priori. The optical Hall effect is an emerging technique for measuring the free charge carrier density, effective mass and mobility parameters in semiconductors. The optical Hall effect measures the analogue of the quasi-static electric-field-induced electrical Hall effect at optical frequencies in conductive and complex layered materials. The optical Hall effect also permits characterization of the anisotropy (tensor character) of the effective mass and mobility parameters.|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of effective masses {{is a key}} ingredient to analyze numerous properties of semiconductors, like carrier mobilities, (magneto-) transport properties, or band extrema characteristics yielding carrier densities and density of states. Currently, these masses are usually calculated using finite-difference estimation of density functional theory (DFT) electronic <b>band</b> <b>curvatures.</b> However, finite differences require an additional convergence study and are prone to numerical noise. Moreover, the concept of effective mass breaks down at degenerate band extrema. We assess the former limitation by developing a method that allows to obtain the Hessian of DFT bands directly, using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Then, we solve the latter issue by adapting the concept of `transport equivalent effective mass' to the k⃗·p̂⃗̂ framework. The numerical noise inherent to finite-difference methods is thus eliminated, along with the associated convergence study. The resulting method is therefore more general, more robust and simpler to use, which makes it especially appropriate for high-throughput computing. After validating the developed techniques, we apply them {{to the study of}} silicon, graphane, and arsenic. The formalism is implemented into the ABINIT software and supports the norm-conserving pseudopotential approach, the projector augmented-wave method, and the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling. The derived expressions also apply to the ultrasoft pseudopotential method. Comment: 22 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We combine Bethe Ansatz {{and field}} theory methods {{to study the}} {{longitudinal}} dynamical structure factor S^zz(q,omega) for the anisotropic spin- 1 / 2 chain in the gapless regime. Using bosonization, we derive a low energy effective model, including the leading irrelevant operators (<b>band</b> <b>curvature</b> terms) which account for boson decay processes. The coupling constants of the effective model for finite anisotropy and finite magnetic field are determined exactly by comparison with corrections to thermodynamic quantities calculated by Bethe Ansatz. We show that a good approximation for {{the shape of the}} on-shell peak of S^zz(q,omega) in the interacting case is obtained by rescaling the result for free fermions by certain coefficients extracted from the effective Hamiltonian. In particular, the width of the on-shell peak is argued to scale like delta omega_q q^ 2 and this prediction is shown to agree with the width of the two-particle continuum at finite fields calculated from the Bethe Ansatz equations. An exception to the q^ 2 scaling is found at finite field and large anisotropy parameter (near the isotropic point). We also present the calculation of the high-frequency tail of S^zz(q,ω) in the region delta omega_q<< omega-vq << J using finite-order perturbation theory in the <b>band</b> <b>curvature</b> terms. Both the width of the on-shell peak and the high-frequency tail are compared with S^zz(q,omega) calculated by Bethe Ansatz for finite chains using determinant expressions for the form factors and excellent agreement is obtained.

We find that the low-energy eigenstates are mostly localized in each Bernal section, and, thus, the whole spectrum is well approximated by a collection of the spectra of independent sections. The energy spectrum is categorized into linear, quadratic and cubic bands corresponding to specific eigenstates of Bernal sections. The ensemble-averaged spectrum exhibits a number of characteristic discrete structures originating from finite Bernal sections or their combinations likely to appear in a random configuration. In the low-energy region, in particular, the spectrum is dominated by frequently-appearing linear bands and quadratic bands with special <b>band</b> velocities or <b>curvatures.</b> In the higher energy region, band edges frequently appear at some particular energies, giving optical absorption edges at corresponding characteristic photon frequencies.
