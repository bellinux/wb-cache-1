5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{started his}} career as an {{offender}} profiler for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), where his unusual gift for empathising with the killers he was investigating aided in their capture. However, Black retires when he finds that his family—wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady)—are <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> by an unknown stalker, who is mailing polaroid photographs of the family to Black. After retiring from the FBI, Black moves to Seattle, Washington, and begins to consult for the Millennium Group, a private investigative organisation that aid law enforcement in violent criminal cases.|$|E

He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explored}} {{the relations between}} work and family conflicts, stress appraisal, self-efficacy and emotional exhaustion. More specifically, based on Lazarus and Folkman's (1984) stress-appraisal theory, appraisal of work and family conflicts were proposed to mediate the relationship between perceived work and family conflicts and emotional exhaustion. Additionally, general self-efficacy was examined as a potential moderator {{of the relationship between}} work and family conflicts and stress appraisal. Data were collected from a sample of faculty and staff at a large Canadian university (N = 110). Participants received an email inviting them to participate in a two-part survey, which was made available to them online. The results revealed that threat-appraisal mediates the relationship between work and family conflicts and emotional exhaustion. Specifically, work-family conflicts (WFC) are viewed as <b>being</b> <b>threatening</b> to an individual's loved ones' well-being and to his or her self-esteem. In turn, this sense of threat leads an individual to feel emotionally exhausted. Family-work conflicts (FWC) are also seen as <b>being</b> <b>threatening</b> to one's self-esteem, which leads to emotional exhaustion. Self-efficacy did not moderate the relationship between work and family conflicts and stress-appraisal in the proposed ways. Results from the moderation analysis revealed that work-family conflicts are viewed as <b>being</b> <b>threatening</b> to individuals both high and low in self-efficacy. Furthermore, at high levels of family-work conflict, those high in self-efficacy perceived greater threat to their self-esteem than those who were less self-efficacious. In addition to increasing our knowledge of why work and family conflicts lead to emotional exhaustion, this study raises the idea that individuals view work and family issues differently, and underscores the salience of occupational stress in today's society...|$|R
5|$|Tirpitzs {{career was}} less dramatic; {{she was sent}} to Norwegian waters in 1942, where she acted as a fleet in <b>being,</b> <b>threatening</b> the convoys from Britain to the Soviet Union. She was {{repeatedly}} attacked by the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. In 1944, Lancaster bombers hit the ship with three Tallboy bombs, which caused extensive internal damage and capsized the battleship. Tirpitz was broken up for scrap between 1948 and 1957.|$|R

5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> with death, {{but there are others}} who have been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E
5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of this high figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Calvert, {{a former}} high {{official}} {{in the government of}} King James I, asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony, to be called Carolina, on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was <b>being</b> <b>threatened.</b> He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.|$|E

On 29 January, the two carriers flew off 47 Zeros to Rabaul and Kahili Airfield, contributing {{some of their own}} aircraft and pilots. Zuihō was then used to cover the evacuation, while Zuikaku remained at Truk, together with the two Yamato-class battleships, acting as a fleet in <b>being</b> <b>threatening</b> to sortie at any time.|$|R

In early 1942, Tirpitz was sent to northern Norway, where she would remain for most of World War II.

5|$|He {{started his}} {{professional}} career between 1803 and 1804, {{in the office}} of Augustine Gascón, officiating as labour counselor for Indians. As a result, he confronted powerful people like the mayors of Cochabamba and Chayanta. He left the city after <b>being</b> <b>threatened,</b> and returned to Buenos Aires in 1805 with his wife Maria Guadalupe Cuenca and their newborn son. Once in the city, he became a reporter of the hearings of the Royal Audiencia, a local appeal court. The Buenos Aires Cabildo, the local council, hired him as an advisor as well. He defended Melchor Fernández, aggrieved by Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, in one of his first cases. In another of his early disputes he backed the Cabildo in denying the appointment as an ensign of the young Bernardino Rivadavia.|$|E
5|$|Mary Ochsenhirt Amdur (February 18, 1921 – February 16, 1998) was an American {{toxicologist}} {{and public}} health researcher who worked primarily on pollution. She was charged with studying {{the effects of the}} 1948 Donora smog, so she specifically looked into the effects of inhaling Sulfuric acid by experimenting on guinea pigs. Her findings on the respiratory effects related to sulfuric acid led to her <b>being</b> <b>threatened,</b> to her funding being pulled, and to her losing her job at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1953. Undeterred by the setback, she carried on her research in a different role at Harvard, and subsequently at MIT and New York University. Despite the early controversy related to her work, it was used in the creation of standards in air pollution, and towards {{the end of her life}} she received numerous awards and accolades.|$|E
5|$|The player {{character}} has {{three levels of}} strength. The strength level is indicated by the cursor which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is <b>being</b> <b>threatened,</b> the cursor will blink red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and recovery is suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level of strength.|$|E

50|$|Discrimination between ingroups and outgroups is {{a matter}} of favoritism towards an ingroup and the absence of {{equivalent}} favoritism towards an outgroup. Outgroup derogation is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as <b>being</b> <b>threatening</b> to the members of an ingroup. This phenomenon often accompanies ingroup favoritism, as it requires one to have an affinity towards their ingroup. Some research suggests that outgroup derogation occurs when an outgroup is perceived as blocking or hindering the goals of an ingroup. It has also been argued that outgroup derogation is a natural consequence of the categorization process.|$|R
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, she was treated with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E
5|$|For Somerset, Burns passed 1,000 {{first-class}} runs in {{a season}} twice, and {{was part of the}} team which won the 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. He provided Somerset with a batting all-rounder, particularly in one-day cricket in which he averaged 27 with the bat and 30 with the ball for the county. He took over as Somerset captain in 2003, primarily {{due to the lack of}} other suitable candidates. He continued in the role in the following year, though he was criticised throughout due to poor results, which at one stage resulted in a number of Somerset's players <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> with being sacked. He was replaced as captain in 2005 by Graeme Smith, and retired from first-class cricket at the end of that year. He subsequently trained as an umpire, and was promoted to the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) reserve list in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his <b>being</b> <b>threatened</b> with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
