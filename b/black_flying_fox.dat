5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} (Pteropus poliocephalus) is a megabat native to Australia. The species shares {{mainland}} Australia {{with three other}} members of the genus Pteropus: the little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), the spectacled flying fox (P. conspicillatus), and the <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (P. alecto).|$|E
5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E

50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> eat pollen and nectar {{from native}} eucalyptus, lilypillies, paperbark, and {{turpentine}} trees. When native foods are scarce, particularly during drought, the bats may take introduced or commercial fruits, such as mangos and apples.

40|$|Extract] The recent fatal case of Australian bat {{lyssavirus}} (ABLV) in an 8 -year-old boy in February 2013 [1] {{as well as}} {{infections in}} horses in May 2013 [2] has prompted us to write about an earlier non-fatal exposure. In August 1996, soon after the discovery of ABLV,[3] a serological survey of 14 bat carers in Townsville, North Queensland, detected antibodies (rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) 0. 48 international units (IU) /mL) in a 40 -year-old male. As a volunteer bat carer for 10 years, mainly of <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus alecto) and little red <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus scapulatus), he had received multiple bites and scratches. He had never received rabies vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin. He did not care for other Australian wildlife and had not visited rabies endemic countries...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} case {{findings}} of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in two <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus alecto) and one little red <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus scapulatus) from north Queensland between January 1995 and August 1996. Although the P. alecto case in January 1995 {{is the first}} recognised case of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in Australia, this was a retrospective diagnosis made after identification of the index case at Ballina in May 1996. Eight persons had exposure to the three bats. Serum antibodies to classical rabies virus were measured in six of these persons; the only one seropositive was a veterinarian who had previously been vaccinated against rabies. Six persons received rabies vaccine following exposure. None of the in-contact humans developed signs of lyssavirus infection. For people exposed to Australian bat lyssavirus-positive bats {{who have not been}} scratched or bitten or had mucosal contamination by these bats, we suggest a post-exposure regime of five inoculations of the human diploid cell inactivated rabies vaccine...|$|R
50|$|A second public garden, the Kershaw Gardens, {{was officially}} opened in 1988 {{on the site}} of the former Rockhampton rubbish dump. Located on the Bruce Highway in North Rockhampton, these gardens specialise in Australian native plants, {{especially}} those of Central Queensland. The most striking feature of the gardens is the imitation waterfall constructed on the northern boundary of the site (adjacent to the highway), which aims to recreate a scene from the Blackdown Tableland.The Dreamtime Cultural Centre is Australia's largest Cultural Centre and is set on more than 12 hectares of land, with native plants, trees and waterfalls. The major points of interest at the Dreamtime Cultural Centre include the Torres Strait Islander village, didgeridoo playing, Djarn Djarn dancers, and throwing the returning boomerang. <b>Black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and occasionally Grey-headed <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> can be seen and heard at night and are important native pollinators and seed dispersers of over 100 species of trees.|$|R
50|$|A mixed <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{and little}} red flying fox colony of around 50,000 megabats lives all year in {{mangroves}} next to Broome township's small Streeter's Jetty.

50|$|The {{timing of}} {{incidents}} indicates a seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Initially this {{was thought to}} possibly related to the breeding cycle of the little red flying foxes. These species typically give birth between April and May. Subsequently however, the Spectacled flying fox and the <b>Black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{have been identified as}} the species more likely to be involved in infection spillovers.|$|E
50|$|The Sulawesi {{flying fox}} is a frugivore, feeding {{preferentially}} on coconuts and breadfruits. The species roosts in trees, often in mangrove forests, and is somewhat sensitive to human disturbance. Roosting sites may {{be shared with}} the <b>Black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox,</b> which occupies the lower branches, while the Sulawesi flying fox keeps to the higher ones. Pups are born between February to March.|$|E
40|$|The spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus conspicillatus) is a {{difficult}} species to manage due to its dual status as an agricultural pest and a native species under threat. Like other <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> species, the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> is very mobile, roosts in colonies during the day in largely inaccessible places, and is active at night. These factors make the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> {{a difficult}} species to study and are in part responsible {{for the lack of}} knowledge on the biology and ecology of this species. The population structure of the spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> was examined using two genetic markers (highly polymorphic microsatellites, and a portion of the mtDNA D-loop) and cementum layers around the root of canine teeth to determine age structure. Incorporating both genetic and demographic factors, as well as examining population structure across several temporal and spatial scales, provided a more comprehensive understanding of this species. A new hypothesis for the origin and evolution of <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> in Australia is presented: that <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> are an old lineage in Australia and that they colonised PNG from Australia {{rather than the other way}} around. The spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> has experienced a tumultuous history, including population expansion and contraction as a result of climatic and geographic events. These events have aided in shaping the contemporary structure of highly connected colonies within a single panmictic population in the Wet Tropics region, along with an isolated population at Iron Range and populations of unknown status in Papua New Guinea. High allelic and haplotypic diversity suggest an old lineage within Australia, and the patterns of diversity suggest colonisation from Australia to PNG. Introgression between <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> and spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> suggests a close association of these two species. The possibility of incomplete lineage sorting also suggests that Pteropus alecto and Pteropus conspicillatus might still be in the process of diverging. Pteropus poliocephalus might also belong to such a species complex, although no relevant data are yet available. Although high levels of gene flow occur among colonies within the Wet Tropics region, some sub-structuring in the form of kin groups within colonies is indicated, with several cohorts of young remaining with their mothers before the young reach sexual maturity. High rates of mortality and low reproductive output may be putting this species at risk of decline, especially as their average longevity is considerably less than expected. This study highlights the need for spectacled <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> to be managed on a regional scale. In addition, mortality rates need to be investigated throughout the Wet Tropics to determine the applicability of mortality rates estimated in this study, across the range of the species...|$|R
40|$|Pteropid lyssaviral infection, lead poisoning, and the {{difficulties}} in diagnosing pteropid lyssaviral infection using histopathological examination of tissues are described in wild <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus alecto) from northern Queensland (Australia). An adult female P. alecto showed aggression before death in January 1995. Lead poisoning was diagnosed due {{to the presence of}} intranuclear lead inclusion bodies in renal proximal convoluted tubular epithelium and high concentrations of lead in renal and hepatic tissues, 370. 03 ± 7. 35 ppm and 16. 76 ± 0. 53 ppm, respectively. Renal inclusion bodies were composed of lead, calcium, phosphorus, and possibly sulphur; some inclusions had their granules arranged in concentric bands. This bat also had a moderate concentration (8. 09 ± 0. 18 ppm) of cadmium in renal tissue. An adult male P. alecto presented with ascending paralysis before it died in May 1996. Pteropid lyssaviral infection was diagnosed subsequently in both bats in September 1996 by immunofluorescent and immunoperoxidase antibody tests for rabies on brains and viral culture from brains. Neither bat had gross or microscopic lesions of the brain that suggested a lyssaviral infection, apart from occasional, subtle, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in the neurones of the brain stem of the female. These cases illustrate the need for a specific test to detect pteropid lyssavirus such as an immunofluorescent antibody test for lyssavirus rather than histopathological examination of tissues...|$|R
40|$|Background: Bats are the {{suspected}} natural reservoir hosts {{for a number}} of new and emerging zoonotic viruses including Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus. Since the discovery of SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese horseshoe bats, attempts to isolate a SL-CoV from bats have failed and attempts to isolate other bat-borne viruses in various mammalian cell lines have been similarly unsuccessful. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help with these investigations and as tools to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. Methodology/Findings: <b>Black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes</b> (Pteropus alecto) were captured from the wild and transported live to the laboratory for primary cell culture preparation using a variety of different methods and culture media. Primary cells were successfully cultured from 20 different organs. Cell immortalisation can occur spontaneously, however we used a retroviral system to immortalise cells via the transfer and stable production of the Simian virus 40 Large T antigen and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase protein. Initial infection experiments with both cloned and uncloned cell lines using Hendra and Nipah viruses demonstrated varying degrees of infection efficiency between the different cell lines, although it was possible to infect cells in all tissue types. Conclusions/Significance: The approaches developed and optimised in this study should be applicable to bats of othe...|$|R
50|$|Australian bat {{lyssavirus}} (ABLV) (initially named pteropid lyssavirus PLV) is a zoonotic virus {{closely related}} to rabies virus. It was first identified in a 5-month-old juvenile <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>fox</b> (Pteropus alecto) collected near Ballina in northern New South Wales, Australia in January 1995 during a national surveillance program for the recently identified Hendra virus.

50|$|These {{events have}} all been {{on the east coast}} of Australia, with the most {{northern}} event at Cairns, Queensland and the event furthest south at Kempsey, NSW.

They are also known to hunt Sakishima rice frogs, yellow-spotted crickets and crabs. As their hunting grounds tend to be in swamps or on shores, they sometimes swim and dive to catch water birds, fish, and freshwater prawns.|$|R
40|$|There {{is now an}} {{overwhelming}} body of evidence that implicates bats in the dissemination of {{a long list of}} emerging and re-emerging viral agents, often causing illnesses or death in both animals and humans. Despite this, there is a paucity of information regarding the immunological mechanisms by which bats coexist with highly pathogenic viruses. Immunoglobulins are major components of the adaptive immune system. Early studies found bats may have quantitatively lower antibody responses to model antigens compared to conventional laboratory animals. To further understand the antibody response of bats, the present study purified and characterised the major immunoglobulin classes from healthy <b>black</b> <b>flying</b> <b>foxes,</b> Pteropus alecto. We employed a novel strategy, where IgG was initially purified and used to generate anti-Fab specific antibodies. Immobilised anti-Fab specific antibodies were then used to capture other immunoglobulins from IgG depleted serum. While high quantities of IgM were successfully isolated from serum, IgA was not. Only trace quantities of IgA were detected in the serum by mass spectrometry. Immobilised ligands specific to IgA (Jacalin, Peptide M and staphylococcal superantigen-like protein) also failed to capture P. alecto IgA from serum. IgM was the second most abundant serum antibody after IgG. A survey of mucosal secretions found IgG was the dominant antibody class rather than IgA. Our study demonstrates healthy P. alecto bats have markedly less serum IgA than expected. Higher quantities of IgG in mucosal secretions may be compensation for this low abundance or lack of IgA.
