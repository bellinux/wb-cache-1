5|$|The film follows {{rock band}} Thirty Seconds to Mars as they first learn of and then begin {{to fight a}} $30 million lawsuit brought by record label EMI. At the time, they had been writing songs in {{preparation}} for the follow-up to their 2005 album A Beautiful Lie. For the bulk of the film, the band, consisting of Jared Leto, his brother Shannon Leto, and Tomo Miličević, is shown working with producers Flood and Steve Lillywhite to create what would eventually <b>become</b> <b>This</b> Is War. Between recording sessions, they meet with lawyers to negotiate for the band's survival.|$|E

25|$|What was to {{eventually}} <b>become</b> <b>this</b> new game had originated as a prototype, which {{was developed and}} directed by Kensuke Tanabe and implemented by Nintendo's frequent programming partner, SRD. This gameplay model emphasized vertically scrolling levels with two players cooperatively tossing each other, and ascending by way of throwing and stacking blocks. However, the prototypical implementation of this scrolling and multi-player action was deemed to exceed the physical capability of Nintendo's consumer hardware at the time, and the gameplay was ultimately deemed to be lacking.|$|E

25|$|In 1936 he was {{dismissed}} from {{the staff of}} King Edward VIII, as the Prince of Wales had now <b>become.</b> <b>This</b> was probably due to his opposition to Wallis Simpson becoming queen. In 1937, however, he was appointed an extra equerry to the new King George VI and {{took part in the}} coronation procession as acting Keeper of the Jewel House. He died in 1949 at the age of 77 and is buried in the churchyard of St Leonard's church in Old Warden in Bedfordshire.|$|E
25|$|Finishing their Back to the Street tour in December 1986, Petra {{entered the}} studio {{the next month}} to begin writing and {{recording}} the band's follow-up. In the three weeks between, Hartman wrote seven songs – the foundation of what would <b>become</b> <b>This</b> Means War!, an album that musically saw the band continue to transition away from the keyboard-influenced, highly polished rock sound it had perfected earlier in the decade and toward an arena-rock sound heavy on guitars and emphasizing Schlitt's soaring vocals.|$|E
25|$|A.resiliens resembles {{several of}} its congeners; in particular, it belongs to a group {{comprising}} varicolored spleenwort (A.heterochroum), A.nesioticum, and A.palmeri, as well as A.resiliens. The {{members of this group}} all share dark, lustrous stipes and lack prominent hydathodes {{on the surface of the}} blade, the latter characteristic distinguishing them from single-sorus spleenwort (A.monanthes) and others. Among the group, A.resiliens has a slightly more leathery leaf texture than the rest, lacks distinct teeth on the pinna margins, and tends to have once-forked, rather than simple, fertile veins. Stolze noted that specimens with leaf texture so thick as to obscure the veins may be identified as A.resiliens, as A.heterochroum and A.palmeri very rarely <b>become</b> <b>this</b> leathery.|$|E

25|$|Article Seven {{describes}} {{the process for}} establishing the proposed new frame of government. Anticipating that the influence of many state politicians would be Antifederalist, delegates to the Philadelphia Convention provided for ratification of the Constitution by popularly elected ratifying conventions in each state. The convention method also made it possible that judges, ministers and others ineligible to serve in state legislatures, could be elected to a convention. Suspecting that Rhode Island, at least, might not ratify, delegates decided that the Constitution would go into effect as soon as nine states (two-thirds rounded up) ratified. Once ratified by this minimum number of states, it was anticipated that the proposed Constitution would <b>become</b> <b>this</b> Constitution between the nine or more that signed. It would not cover the four or fewer states {{that might not have}} signed.|$|E

500|$|Since Elsa is {{introduced}} {{as a young}} child {{at the beginning of the}} film, animators wanted the first glimpse of her powers to reflect her innocent and fanciful state of mind at the time. This included giving her first snowflakes a simple design. Her snow and ice patterns later become more intricate and complex when she is an adult. Co-effects supervisor Marlon West elaborated, [...] "When Elsa finally lets go and really starts owning her cryokinetic abilities, we wanted the ice and snow that she make to get across the idea that Elsa has now grown up and <b>become</b> <b>this</b> beautiful, elegant, confident and powerful young woman." ...|$|E

500|$|Existence {{resists the}} {{indifference}} {{of life and}} death, it lives beyond mechanical [...] "life," [...] it is always its own mourning, and its own joy. It becomes figure, image. It does not become alienated in images, but it is presented there: the images are the evidence of its existence, the objectivity of its assertion. This thought—which, for me, is {{the very thought of}} this film —is a difficult thought, perhaps the most difficult. It's a slow thought, always under way, fraying a path so that the path itself becomes thought. It is that which frays images so that images <b>become</b> <b>this</b> thought, so that they become the evidence of this thought—and not in order to [...] "represent" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real.

[...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind.

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first time that the {{characters}} of Nina Sharp and David Robert Jones had common scenes within the show, but both Blair Brown and Jared Harris had previously acted together as mother and son in an off-Broadway production of the play Humble Boy. During the scene in which Nina was tortured to taunt Olivia into using her powers, Brown actually injured herself on the rusty bedsprings used as the prop for the show. Brown referred to the alternative version of her character as [...] "Meana" [...] due to her seemingly [...] "mean" [...] personality, and speculated that Nina may have <b>become</b> <b>this</b> way because without William Bell, [...] "she wasn’t at the party with all of the boys, the science boys" [...] and thus developed an [...] "outsider" [...] perspective.

500|$|Saprang {{also refused}} to authorize urgent repairs on the airport tarmac, despite {{warnings}} from engineers. [...] Karun Chandrarangsu, president of the Engineering Institute of Thailand noted, [...] "Suvarnabhumi is like a patient in a coma who continues to suffer from severe bleeding. Stopping the blood flow now is more urgent and important than debating what caused the injury." [...] The Engineering Institute of Thailand sent a formal warning to AoT in November 2006 about the urgent need to drain water from beneath the tarmac, and noted that immediate action should be taken. [...] "The AOT did nothing about the problem", Suebsak Promboon of the EIT noted. [...] "The situation might not have <b>become</b> <b>this</b> bad if the water had been drained then." [...] Suebsak Promboon, a senior foundation engineer {{and a member of}} the Tortrakul Yomnak-led airport tarmac inspection panel, accused the AOT of refusing to take any actions to solve the problems at the airport.|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in the local Persian court, Alcibiades won {{the trust of the}} {{powerful}} satrap and made several policy suggestions which were well received. According to Thucydides, Alcibiades immediately began to do all he could with Tissaphernes to injure the Peloponnesian cause. At his urging, the satrap reduced the payments he was making to the Peloponnesian fleet and began delivering them irregularly. Alcibiades next advised Tissaphernes to bribe the Generals of the cities to gain valuable intelligence on their activities. Lastly, and most importantly, he told the satrap to be in no hurry to bring the Persian fleet into the conflict, as the longer the war dragged out the more exhausted the combatants would <b>become.</b> <b>This</b> would allow the Persians to more easily conquer the region {{in the aftermath of the}} fighting. Alcibiades tried to convince the satrap that it was in Persia's interest to wear both Athens and Sparta out at first, [...] "and after docking the Athenian power as much as he could, forthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians". Although Alcibiades's advice benefited the Persians, it was merely a means to an end; Thucydides tells us that his real motive was to use his alleged influence with the Persians to effect his restoration to Athens.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} {{a lot of}} character development {{that many of the}} actors had been waiting for. Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going to the prom begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day <b>become.</b> <b>This</b> is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
