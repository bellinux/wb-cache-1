5|$|Along {{with the}} World Cup, the IRB enlisted some of rugby’s biggest names {{to assist in}} the bid. In March 2009, Jonah Lomu and Lawrence Dallaglio were {{announced}} as ambassadors for the bid and in April 2009 Waisale Serevi was unveiled as an ambassador to coincide with the Oceania National Olympic Committees' general assembly. May 2009 saw the IRB announce that they would drop the Rugby World Cup Sevens in order to improve the chances of the sport being included. The benefit of this move would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Olympics the premier event in international rugby sevens.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a vaccine that uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the vocals would cut through and were right in the pocket. Beginning with working on the vocals {{was the only way to}} achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

25|$|One way is {{by using}} {{something}} other than a rectangular (cubic, etc.) grid. For example, if a plane is tiled with regular hexagons, those hexagons could be used as cells. In many cases the resulting cellular automata are equivalent to those with rectangular grids with specially designed neighborhoods and rules. Another variation would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the grid itself irregular, such as with Penrose tiles.|$|E

30|$|The {{fourth step}} is {{requirements}} validation. The first {{task of the}} validation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the formed requirements define the right system.

The second task of the validation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an assessment whether the requirements are feasible. Traditional techniques for validation include reviews of requirements documents and building early system models and prototypes.|$|R

25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should <b>be,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a better sound.|$|E
25|$|In this {{interview}} he also expressed {{his belief that}} currently, the global market is the largest force shaping {{the lives of people}} throughout the world. For this reason, he believes that {{the most effective way to}} solve social problems in individual countries is to address them at a global level by changing the policies dictating the global market. He explained that since most people are not given the power to directly change these policies, the most effective way to bring about change would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a statement to those running the economy by becoming self-sufficient through boycotting corporations, growing one's own vegetables, and making one's own clothes.|$|E

25|$|The {{first part}} of the surgery should <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an {{incision}} along the posterior border of the deltoid. The muscle is exposed to its insertion on the humerus. Next the part of the muscles that originates from the spina scapulae, the posterior one third to one half, is isolated from the anterior portion of the muscle. The insertion of the posterior deltoid is then elevated of the muscle and the distance between the mobilized deltoid tendon to the olecranon is measured to determine the length of the interposition graft needed. The interposition graft must now be harvested from its donor site. It should be 5 to 10cm longer than the gap.|$|E
25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the basic product of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air.

The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should <b>be,</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.|$|E
500|$|During that {{championship}} season, Speaker {{is credited}} with introducing the platoon system, which attempted to match right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and vice versa. Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, [...] "The specialist in baseball is no good and won't go very far... The whole effect of the system will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player's chance of greatness... It destroys young ball players by destroying their most precious quality – {{confidence in their ability}} to hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting to be born." [...] Baseball Magazine was supportive, pointing out that Speaker had results that backed up his system.|$|E

500|$|An {{enhanced}} remake titled Mega Man Maverick Hunter X, or [...] in Japan, {{was released}} worldwide for the PSP between 2005 and 2008. With {{the launch of}} the PSP, Keiji Inafune and his team debated on whether or not to create a Mega Man X9. [...] "So, we decided that instead of going the X9 route, let's go back to the series' roots and rediscover what makes the X series so classic," [...] Inafune concluded. [...] "We felt {{that the best way to}} do that would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an X remake." [...] Although the remake stays true to the original game in both gameplay and basic storyline, Maverick Hunter X features a total graphical overhaul with 3D character models and backgrounds, a remixed soundtrack, voice acting, and anime cutscenes. According to Yoshikawa, the character illustrations were updated to resemble both toys and the designs of Mega Man X8.|$|E
500|$|... "Freedom of {{religion}} means freedom {{to hold an}} opinion or belief, but not to take action in violation of social duties or subversive to good order." [...] In Reynolds v. United States (1878), the Supreme Court found that while laws cannot interfere with religious belief and opinions, laws {{can be made to}} regulate some religious practices (e.g., human sacrifices, and the Hindu practice of suttee). The Court stated that to rule otherwise, [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to the law of the land, and in effect permit every citizen to become a law unto himself. Government would exist only in name under such circumstances." [...] In Cantwell v. Connecticut (1940), the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied the Free Exercise Clause to the states. While the right to have religious beliefs is absolute, the freedom to act on such beliefs is not absolute.|$|E
500|$|Super Mario World was {{the first}} title in the series to be {{developed}} for the upcoming Super Nintendo Entertainment System (known as the Super Famicom in Japan). As such, the team anticipated some difficulty in working with new and more advanced hardware. Tezuka recalled that the software tools were not yet fully developed and thus the team had to [...] "go along with starting something new". Miyamoto expressed optimism as he acknowledged that the team no longer had restrictions on certain mechanics such as scrolling {{and the number of}} colours which they could implement. As a hardware experiment, the team ported Super Mario 3 to the Super Famicom and discovered that it felt like the same game despite the improved colours and sprites. From that point on Miyamoto realised the team's ultimate goal would <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the most out of the new hardware in order to create something [...] "totally new".|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} a group of {{children}} singing the chorus, [...] "All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us". In between the chorus lines, one child chants, [...] "Don't worry what people say, we got it true" [...] after which another child says, [...] "Enough is enough of this garbage!" [...] According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] is played in the key of D minor and the track's time signature is common time. The song, which is cited as being a pop song, has a moderately slow tempo of 90 beats per minute. Instruments used include a piano and guitar. Jon Pareles stated that Jackson was calling himself [...] "a victim of police brutality" [...] and a [...] "victim of hate". He continued, [...] "A listener might wonder just who 'Us' is supposed to <b>be...</b> <b>To</b> <b>make</b> the songs lodge in the ear, Jackson uses elementary singsong melodies – a 'nyah, nyah' two-note motif in 'They Don't Care About Us'... and he comes up with all kinds of surprises in the arrangements".|$|E
500|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Permanent Secretary Schuster {{had decided that}} his aim should <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the entire court system was {{under the control of}} his office, rather than partially under his control and partially under the control of HM Treasury as it had been when he started. The 1931 Royal Commission on the Civil Service recommended that all Civil Service departments take a more business-like approach to their work, and spurred Schuster into making a further attempt to reorganise and reform the Lord Chancellor's Office. As such he persuaded Sankey to set up a Departmental Committee on the Business of the Courts, with Lord Hanworth (one of Schuster's friends) chairing the committee and Schuster himself sitting as a member. As he had under Lord Birkenhead Schuster attempted to reform the County Courts. Hee partially succeeded in doing when his recommendations were included in the Administration of Justice [...] Act 1934 which sent appeals from the county courts straight to the Court of Appeal rather than the Divisional Courts. He also attempted to have the number of jury trials in civil cases reduced, something which Hanworth supported but which was blocked by the King's Bench Division.|$|E
500|$|IndieWire's Ben Travers praised Legion as [...] "the most intricate, {{intimate}} superhero {{story to}} date", highlighting {{its focus on}} [...] "an emotional journey for our leading lad", the central love story that turns the show [...] "from a 12 Monkeys mind-fuck to a Romeo & Juliet romance {{at the drop of}} a hat", and its cast. At Variety, Maureen Ryan stated that Stevens' performance [...] "is the glue that keeps Legion from flying apart", and the relationship between Haller and Barrett provides [...] "moments of solace in a viewing experience that can otherwise be exceptionally intense." [...] After the first three episodes, Ryan said that [...] "the challenge of Legion will <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> David’s quest for wholeness more than the sum of its flashy and often captivating parts. But the humane core of the drama offers a reason to hope for the best." [...] Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "It might seem weird to have a Marvel show on FX, or to have it star that upper-crust Brit from Downton Abbey, filtered through the creator of Fargo, but somehow it all works." [...] He praised Stevens performance, and Hawley's [...] "optical hijinks" [...] even after the first episode, where the story starts to become more clear.|$|E
