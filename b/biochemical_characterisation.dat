We present here the molecular and <b>biochemical</b> <b>characterisations</b> of two rice fructokinases, namely OsFK 1 and OsFK 2. The results show that, at both a transcriptional and a transductional level, OsFK 1 is preferentially expressed under aerobic conditions, whereas OsFK 2 is induced under anoxia. Substrate inhibition was demonstrated for OsFK 1, while OsFK 2 appears to be largely unaffected by fructose concentrations up to 10 mM. Sugar-modulation of anoxia-induced proteins has been proposed, but our results on rice calli treated with or without glucose (10, 30 or 90 mM) for different time indicate that neither OsFK 1 nor OsFK 2 are sugar regulated.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{biological}} systems {{through a combination}} of in vitro characterisations, quantitative in vivo experiments, and mathematical modelling, is receiving an increasingly growing interest through the field system biology. Systems biology uses methods from many different research fields, but the existing methods need to be extended and adapted to fit the new situations. This dissertation presents new methods for various modelling situations, and the developments have been driven by examples related to glucose homeostasis. The modelling methods are contained in a new modelling framework denoted core-box modelling. Core-box modelling attempts to combine the strengths of mechanistic grey-box models (e. g., to describe detailed processes) with the strengths of minimal models (e. g., identifiability and hypothesis testing). The main new steps in the modelling process are: identifiability analysis, model reduction, system identification and a translation between different versions of the same model. In all these sub-disciplines, a review is given and new methods are developed; these contributions are of course valid in any framework. Methods are given for detection and handling of both structural and practical unidentifiability in individual rate expressions. This also yields in vivo expressions for the reactions. Special methods are derived for systems with oscillations. First, two methods for identification of the interactions generating the oscillations in a model are given. Then, two methods are! presented for parameter estimation of a system close to a Hopf bifurcation. The first method reduces the dimension of the parameters appearing in the differential equations, and the second method eliminates the parameters describing the initial state at time zero. Finally, it is shown how the results can be back-translated to a core-box model; a model with all the details of the original grey-box model, but with quality tags from the core model to its possible predictions. The new methodologies are applied to the development of three models. The first is a core-box model for insulin signalling in fat cells. The core model is obtained using hypothesis testing, which shows that the internalisation is necessary to generate the observed dynamics, and that the internalisation is of the same time-scale as an observed overshoot in the data. These predictions are validated experimentally, and the advantages of the core-box model with respect to the both the core and grey-box model are illustrated. The second model describes oscillations in yeast glycolysis. Many of the developed methods are applied, and their performances are demonstrated. This leads, e. g., to a refined prediction of the biochemical mechanisms generating the oscillations. The third model describes muscle metabolism under anaerobic exercise. The developed model is used to resolve a 25 year old contradiction between data and current biochemical understandings regarding the control of g! lycolysis following anaerobic contraction. Finally, an existing model of neutrophil metabolism is analysed. The main conclusion is that the model's apparent lack of robustness lies on the structural level and not on the parametric level. All these contributions show, in various ways, how the combined usage of models, <b>biochemical</b> <b>characterisations,</b> and quantitative in vivo data can work together in a fruitful way; a way which surpasses the abilities of either of these research fields working in isolation...|$|R

40|$|ER alpha-glucosidases I and II are {{glycosyl}} hydrolases {{that play}} a key role in eukaryotic glycoprotein folding quality control. Removal of two glucose residues from the N -glycan attached to a protein allows association with calnexin or calreticulin which enable folding through associated accessory proteins. Many enveloped viruses utilise the calnexin cycle for the correct folding of their surface glycoproteins. Inhibition of the ER alpha-glucosidases causes misfolding of these viral glycoproteins and reduction of virion secretion and/or infectivity. Thus, inhibition of these glucosidases is a potential broad-spectrum antiviral strategy with clinical relevance. Inhibition by certain iminosugars, a class of glycomimetics, has given rise to a clinical candidate against dengue virus. To date there are no high-resolution structures available for either of the mammalian ER alpha-glucosidases. Presented in this thesis is the work toward the structural and <b>biochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> of both alpha-glucosidases. Large-scale production of both murine glucosidases is described along with <b>biochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> against a number of substrates. Glucosidase I is a challenging target for biochemical and structural studies. Described is the purification and confirmation of enzymatic activity. Biophysical techniques show that it is well folded and able to bind to iminosugars. Preliminary attempts at crystallisation have resulted in poorly diffracting crystals to 5 Å. This work enables future optimisation toward an atomic resolution structure of glucosidase I. Glucosidase II plays a complex role in the kinetics of glycoprotein processing in the calnexin cycle. Production of the heterodimeric enzyme has enabled a detailed <b>biochemical</b> <b>characterisation</b> with a range of substrates and inhibitors. Structural characterisation of a large fragment of glucosidase II has enabled new insights into the details of heterodimerisation, substrate specificity, and the basis of iminosugar inhibition.

40|$|In {{physical}} experimentation, {{the resources}} available to discover new knowledge are typically extremely small {{in comparison to the}} size and dimensionality of the parameter spaces that can be searched. Additionally, {{due to the nature of}} physical experimentation, experimental errors will occur, particularly in biochemical experimentation where the reactants may undetectably denature, or reactant contamination could occur or equipment failure. These errors mean that not all experimental measurements and observations will be accurate or representative of the system being investigated. As the validity of observations is not guaranteed, resources must be split between exploration to discover new knowledge and exploitation to test the validity of the new knowledge. Currently we are investigating the automation of discovery in physical experimentation, with the aim of producing a fully autonomous closed-loop robotic machine capable of autonomous experimentation. This machine will build and evaluate hypotheses, determine experiments to perform and then perform them on an automated lab-on-chip experimentation platform for <b>biochemical</b> response <b>characterisation.</b> In the present work we examine how the trade-off between exploration and exploitation can occur in a situation where the number of experiments that can be performed is extremely small and where the observations returned are sometimes erroneous or unrepresentative of the behaviour being examined.
