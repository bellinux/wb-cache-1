2500|$|Mr. Vice President, in June 2000 {{when you}} were still CEO of Halliburton, you said that U.S. {{businesses}} {{should be allowed to}} do business with Iran because, quote, [...] "Unilateral sanctions almost never work."

2500|$|We do not, however, {{hold the}} Bible—or any other account of human experience—to be either an infallible guide or the {{exclusive}} source of truth. Much biblical material is mythical or legendary. Not {{that it should}} be discarded for that reason! Rather, it should be treasured for what it is. We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> read the Bible as we read other books—with imagination and a critical eye. We also respect the sacred literature of other religions. Contemporary works of science, art, and social commentary are valued as well. We hold, in the words of an old liberal formulation, that [...] "revelation is not sealed." [...] Unitarian Universalists aspire to truth as wide as the world—we look to find truth anywhere, universally.|$|E

[...] Hume supported the liberty of the press, and was sympathetic to democracy, when suitably constrained.

Had it not been for those forts, I verily <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have destroyed the Spanish fleet.

This will require us to modify our theories, but not abandon them. For example, at the start of the 20th century physics was largely deterministic. But when scientists began studying the quantum mechanics they realized that indeterminism and chance play a role in our universe. Both classical physics and quantum mechanics are correct and work well within their own bailiwick, and continue to be taught to students. Similarly, Townes believes growth of religious understanding will modify, but not make us abandon, our classic religious beliefs.|$|R

To become self-sufficient, Ribble wanted to expand the usage of both renewable and fossil fuels, so that the U.S. will not rely too much on any single source or foreign region. In June 2012, he voted for the Domestic Energy and Jobs Act, which would increase oil and gas drilling in the U.S., and decrease environmental restrictions. In addition, Ribble also supported the Offshore Leasing Act in May 2011, and required “the Secretary of the Interior to conduct offshore oil and gas lease sales.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh! what cold was that. The frost was fearful, {{and at this}} height a {{wind blew}} whose icy breath passed through all our wrappings, and seemed to burn our flesh beneath as though with hot irons. It was {{fortunate}} that we had brought the yak, for without the warmth from its shaggy body I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have perished, even in our tent. For some hours we watched, as indeed we must, since to sleep might mean to die, yet saw nothing save the lonely stars, and heard nothing in that awful silence, for here even the wind made no noise as it slid across the snows.

Moreover, he succeeded where any other swimmer of less strength must have failed. Still, I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have drowned, since here the water ran like a mill-race, had not the man upon the shore, seeing our plight and urged thereto by the woman, run with surprising swiftness in one so aged, {{to a point of}} rock that jutted some yards into the stream, past which we were being swept, and seating himself, stretched out his long stick towards us.|$|E

If he hadn't, I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have horsewhipped him through the town. Three months afterwards his estate was put up for sale, and he has never been down {{in this part of the}} country since; not that he was ever here much before. London suited him better.

This doubtless confirmed his opinion of Holkar's invincibility; and he determined, as the only way of saving himself, to declare for him." ...|$|R
60|$|Only somehow I don't {{think that}} any of us really <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> die, though whether this was because we had all, except poor Quick, survived so much, or from a sneaking faith in Maqueda's optimistic dreams, I cannot say. At any rate we ate our food with appetite, took {{exercise}} in an inner yard of the prison, and strove to grow as strong as <b>we</b> could, feeling <b>that</b> soon <b>we</b> might need all our powers. Oliver was the most miserable among us, not for his own sake, but because, poor fellow, he was haunted with fears as to Maqueda and her fate, although of these he said little or nothing to us. On the other hand, my son Roderick was by far the most cheerful. He had lived for so many years upon the brink of death that this familiar gulf seemed to have no terrors for him.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most liberals, Cohen-Almagor {{confines}} his {{scholarship to}} the democratic world. He says explicitly that he is concerned with all countries around the world, because he thinks that {{what he says is}} appropriate, simply because he is realistic. Cohen-Almagor <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> there are some basic universal needs that all people wish to secure such as food, raiment, and shelter. Sexual drives are universal and people need to have some sleep to be able continue functioning. He also <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> strive to universalise moral principles. But sociologically speaking we cannot ignore the fact that universal values do not underlie all societies. Some societies reject the moral notions of liberty, tolerance, autonomy, equality, and justice that liberal democracies promote. If a country is not founded on these notions, then it would be futile for us to speak about these values. Thus, his practical recommendations on freedom of expression, end-of-life and multiculturalism are restricted to the democratic world.|$|R
