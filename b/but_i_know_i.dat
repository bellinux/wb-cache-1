Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and {{neither of them had}} starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. I love doing comedy, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix exalted the episode and the [...] "more formally experimental" [...] season, admitting, [...] "I'm still not sure I understood 100% of it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> liked it. A lot." [...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober. Matt Weiner, co-writer Semi Chellas, director Scott Hornbacher, and the actors combined to give us some of the most memorable moments the show has ever done." [...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A grade, compared it to previous [...] "structurally daring" [...] episodes like [...] "Seven Twenty Three" [...] and [...] "The Jet Set", and praised the director for the [...] "beautifully shot" [...] episode and the [...] "gorgeous image of [...] and Jane lying, heads touching, on the floor, admitting their marriage just isn’t working", while noting that the enemy of the season is [...] "the passage of time itself".|$|E
500|$|Inspired by {{this early}} success, Kubrick {{quit his job}} at Look and visited {{professional}} filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about {{the technical aspects of}} film-making. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker {{because of the number of}} bad films he had seen, remarking, [...] "I don't know a goddamn thing about movies, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can make a better film than that". He began making Flying Padre (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called [...] "Sky Pilot", a pun on the slang term for a priest. [...] During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in Flying Padre are later echoed in [...] (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin (1925) and Ivan the Terrible (1944/1958).|$|E

500|$|Director Radha Mohan {{expressed}} a desire to remake the film but decided against it: [...] "If there is one film I want to remake, [...] will be the one, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> will not, because I believe classics should be left alone." [...] Director and choreographer Prabhu Deva ranked Server Sundaram among his favourite films. A restaurant named [...] "Hotel Server Sundaram" [...] is located in the Thuraipakkam area of Chennai. In December 2014, G. Babu Jayakumar of The New Indian Express included the film in his list of Balachander's noted films. Clips from Server Sundaram were screened along with clips from other films such as Iru Kodugal (1969), Arangetram (1973), Aval Oru Thodar Kathai (1974), Avargal (1977) and Azhagan (1991) at a function held in Balachander's honour at Tiruchirappalli in January 2015, a month after his death. Server Sundaram is also used as the title of an 2017 film starring Santhanam and Nagesh's grandson Bijesh, with its producer Selva having bought the title rights from AVM Productions. On why that title was chosen, Selva said, [...] "Santhanam plays a chef in the film and we felt that Server Sundaram, in which Nagesh played the role of a server, would be apt for this film, too. It is amazing how well the title suited the concept of our film, which is why we went right ahead with our decision." [...] S. Jegathiswaran, writing for Daily News Sri Lanka, noted, [...] "In [...] Sundaram, [...] showed that after having gained the social status one shouldn't forget one's past." [...] Actor Vikram, who became popularly known by the moniker [...] "Chiyaan" [...] after the release of Sethu in 1999, stated in August 2016, [...] "After Nagesh sir [...] becomes something else, he still holds his server uniform close to his heart as a memento. Chiyaan is something like that to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 6, 2011, Common {{released}} his first single, titled [...] "Ghetto Dreams", from his next album. A second single,"", {{was released on}} October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common {{released his}} ninth solo album titled The Dreamer, The Believer. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label's first compilation album, 2012's Cruel Summer. Common released a song entitled [...] "Sweet", from The Dreamer/The Believer, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing [...] "Stay Schemin'", a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake's diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying [...] "It's over.

2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can." ...|$|E
