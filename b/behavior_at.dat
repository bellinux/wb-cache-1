This is essentially different from results of potassium intercalation in graphite or C60 fullerene, and shows that sp3 bonding promotes magnetic ordering in carbon.

Consistent with previous factor analytic research, 2 factors {{were found at}} each age: 1 comprising repetitive sensory and motor behaviors (RSM), and the other comprising insistence on sameness behaviors including rigidity, routines, and restricted interests (IS). Regression analyses indicated that RSM and IS subtypes develop independently. RSM at 77 months was predicted only by RSM <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> 26 months and not by IS <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> either 15 or 26 months nor by RSM <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> 15 months. IS at 77 months was predicted by IS <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> both 15 and 26 months, but not by RSM <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> either 15 or 26 months. Our findings provide evidence that there is stability of 2 independent subtypes of RRBs, RSM and IS, across early childhood and that these subtypes develop independently of each other...|$|R

40|$|We compare four {{different}} risk-taking propensity measures {{on their ability}} to describe and to predict actual risky behavior in the domain of health. The risk-taking propensity measures we compare are: (1) a general measure of risk-taking propensity derived from a one-item survey question (Dohmen et al., 2011), (2) a risk aversion index calculated from a set of incentivized monetary gambles (Holt and Laury, 2002), (3) a measure of risk taking derived from an incentive compatible behavioral task [...] -the Balloon Analog Risk Task (Lejuez et al., 2002), and (4) a composite score of risk-taking likelihood in the health domain from the Domain-Specific Risk Taking (DOSPERT) scale (Weber et al., 2002). Study participants are 351 clients of health centers around Witbank, South Africa. Our findings suggest that the one-item general measure is the best predictor of risky health behavior in our population, predicting two out of four <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> the 5 % level and the remaining two <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> the 10 % level. The DOSPERT score in the health domain performs well, predicting one out of four <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> the 1 % significance level and two out of four <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> the 10 % level, but only if the DOSPERT instrument contains a hypothetical risk-taking item that is similar to the actual risky behavior being predicted. Incentivized monetary gambles and the behavioral task were unrelated to actual health behaviors; they were unable to predict any of the risky health <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> the 10 % level. We provide evidence that this is not because the participants had trouble understanding the monetary trade-off questions or performed poorly in the behavioral task. We conclude by urging researchers to further test the usefulness of the one-item general measure, both in explaining health related risk-taking behavior and in other contexts...|$|R
5|$|Smaller {{numbers of}} {{children}} show less positive development at age 12 months. Their less desirable attachment styles may be predictors of poor later social development. Although these children's <b>behavior</b> <b>at</b> 12 months is not a serious problem, {{they appear to be}} on developmental trajectories that will end in poor social skills and relationships. Because attachment styles may serve as predictors of later development, it may be appropriate to think of certain attachment styles as part of the range of attachment disorders.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} trajectories of self-harm and suicidal {{behaviors}} among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong and {{to investigate the}} related predictors, including gender, family nonintactness, economic disadvantage, positive youth development, and family functioning. DESIGN: We used quantitative data from a large sample of adolescent participants. Participants initially joined this study {{when they were in}} grade 7 (wave 1), and they were followed from grade 8 (wave 2) to grade 12 (wave 6). SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: The participants consisted of 2023 grade 12 students from 28 secondary schools in Hong Kong. A multistage cluster random sampling method was adopted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-harm and suicidal behaviors. RESULTS: The trajectories of self-harm and suicidal behaviors in general declined from grade 7 to grade 12. Regarding the effect of gender, whereas adolescent girls showed a higher prevalence for self-harm and suicidal <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> baseline and other waves, adolescent boys showed a pronounced decline in self-harm rates. Adolescents from nonintact families were more likely to self-harm or engage in suicidal <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> wave 6. Economic disadvantage at wave 4 predicted higher suicidal behavior among adolescents but not self-harm at wave 6. Regarding positive youth development, several protective factors that include cognitive-behavioral competencies, prosocial attributes, general positive youth development qualities, and positive identity could help reduce self-harm and suicidal <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> different time points. Regarding the role of family functioning, more family conflicts predicted higher suicidality in adolescence (self-harm and suicidal behaviors), and family communication affected self-harming <b>behaviors</b> <b>at</b> wave 6. CONCLUSION: The trajectories of self-harm and suicidal behaviors decline from early to late adolescence among Chinese adolescents. Positive youth development and constructive family functioning are critical to help reduce suicidal behaviors. Regarding increased risk, more attention should be paid to adolescent girls and adolescents from nonintact and economic disadvantaged families. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
