40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to test whether the {{combination}} of a <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug</b> plus an aminoglycoside has advantage over monotherapy for severe gram-negative infections. Of 2, 124 patients with gram-negative bacteremia surveyed prospectively, 670 were given inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment and the mortality rate in this group was 34 %, whereas the mortality rate was 18 % for 1, 454 patients given appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (P = 0. 0001). The mortality rates for patients given appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment were 17 % for 789 patients given a single <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug,</b> 19 % for 327 patients given combination treatment, 24 % for 249 patients given a single aminoglycoside, and 29 % for 89 patients given other antibiotics (P = 0. 0001). When patients were stratified according to risk factors for mortality other than antibiotic treatment, combination therapy showed no advantage over treatment with a single <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug</b> except for neutropenic patients (odds ratio [OR] for mortality, 0. 5; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 0. 2 to 1. 3) and patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia (OR, 0. 7; 95 % CI, 0. 3 to 1. 8). On multivariable logistic regression analysis including all risk factors for mortality, combination therapy had no advantage over therapy with a single <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug.</b> The mortality rate for patients treated with a single appropriate aminoglycoside was higher than that for patients given a <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug</b> in all strata except for patients with urinary tract infections.

40|$|A {{test panel}} of 35 {{different}} beta-lactamases {{expressed in a}} common Escherichia coli host was created to compare the effect that each beta-lactamase had on susceptibility to various beta-lactam antibiotics.

In addition, several strains of the panel were subjected to selection with porin-specific bacteriophages to obtain mutants lacking either the OmpC or OmpF porin protein. A mutation in either OmpC or OmpF did change the susceptibilities of certain strains expressing beta-lactamase to certain beta-lactam antibiotics. However, {{the loss of a}} single porin did not predictably alter susceptibility to any given <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug.</b> This panel of strains producing various beta-lactamases was found to be a useful tool for comparing the effects of different beta-lactamases and outer membrane permeability upon susceptibility to <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Aminopenicillins are {{the most}} used {{beta-lactam}} antibiotics. Morbilliform or maculopapular rashes are rather frequent during therapy with aminopenicillins. The pathogenesis of these reactions is often due to a cell-mediated allergy. The aim of this work is to characterize patients with cell-mediated allergy to aminopenicillins and to identify alternative <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs</b> that can be safely administered to these patients. We studied 27 subjects affected by cell-mediated allergy to aminopenicillins. The diagnosis was {{made on the basis}} of positivity of patch tests with aminopenicillins. These patients then underwent an allergological evaluation (skin and patch tests, oral and/or intramuscular challenge tests) with a wide spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics. Our work highlights the following main characteristics of cell-mediated allergy to aminopenicillins: time elapsing between drug administration and onset of symptoms of about 2 days; the maculopapular rash and delayed appearance of urticaria/angioedema were the most typical symptoms (82. 8 percent of cases); a cross-reactivity with aminocephalosporins is usually absent, or it is limited to cephalexin (in our study, in fact, just 3 out of 20 patients challenged with cephalexin showed a positive oral challenge test); all the beta-lactams, other than aminopenicillins, are well tolerated. Patch tests represent a specific diagnostic tool with a good predictive value of identifying alternative drugs that can be safely administered to patients with beta-lactam allergy. Our patients could tolerate other <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs</b> after a complete allergological evaluation.

40|$|Imipenem is {{a highly}} active drug against the Bacteroides fragilis group of organisms. On {{the basis of a}} {{nationwide}} survey of over 500 isolates, {{it was found that the}} frequency of imipenem resistance was less than 0. 1 %. We have a highly resistant Bacteroides distasonis isolate, TAL 7860, for which the following MICs (micrograms per milliliter) were determined by agar dilution: cefoxitin, greater than 128; moxalactam, greater than 128; piperacillin, greater than 128; imipenem, 16; and SCH 34343, 16. Resistance was shown to involve both a beta-lactamase and an outer membrane permeability barrier. beta-Lactamase kinetics studies with several beta-lactams, including imipenem, revealed similar hydrolytic efficiency in comparison with those found for the B. fragilis strains. An imipenem outer membrane permeability barrier was detected for TAL 7860, which was approximately sixfold more effective for B. fragilis TAL 3636 and TAL 2480. Significant inhibition of nitrocefin destruction was also shown with sulbactam and clavulanic acid at 10 mumol and dithiothreitol at 10 mM. No inhibition was seen with 10 mM EDTA. Differences in physicochemical properties and inhibition studies suggest that this beta-lactamase is different from the imipenem-inactivating metallo-beta-lactamase previously described in B. fragilis. We demonstrated a significant permeability barrier to clavulanic acid and sulbactam, which resulted in loss of synergism between these clinically employed beta-lactamase inhibitors and <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs.</b> The novel beta-lactamase activity in conjunction with a limited permeability in TAL 7860 resulted in resistance to all commonly employed beta-lactams, including the newest and most potent <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM- 1) is {{an enzyme}} that makes {{bacteria}} resistant {{to a broad}} range of <b>beta-lactam</b> antibiotic <b>drugs.</b> This is because it can inactivate most <b>beta-lactam</b> antibiotic <b>drugs</b> by hydrolyzing them. For in-depth understanding of the hydrolysis mechanism, the three-dimensional structure of NDM- 1 was developed. With such a structural frame, two enzyme-ligand complexes were derived by respectively docking Imipenem and Meropenem (two typical betalactam antibiotic drugs) to the NDM- 1 receptor. It was revealed from the NDM- 1 /Imipenem complex that the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed while sitting in a binding pocket of NDM- 1 formed by nine residues. And for the case of NDM- 1 /Meropenem complex, the antibiotic drug was hydrolyzed in a binding pocket formed by twelve residues.

40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the extent and}} mechanisms of antagonism of beta-lactam antibiotics by cefoxitin. In tests with 41 gram-negative isolates, cefoxitin antagonized cephalothin, cefamandole, cefsulodin, cefotaxime, moxalactam, ampicillin, carbenicillin, piperacillin, mezlocillin, and azlocillin, but not cephalexin, mecillinam, or N-formimidoyl thienamycin. The extent of antagonism varied with the beta-lactam and genus studied. However, antagonism occurred most often with strains possessing inducible cephalosporinases. Antagonism of cephalothin and cefamandole correlated closely with the induction of beta-lactamases capable of inactivating these drugs. Although antagonism of the remaining drugs occurred more often with strains possessing inducible beta-lactamases, these enzymes did not inactivate the drugs. Morphological studies revealed that cefoxitin inhibited filamentation and lysis produced by various <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs.</b> Results of this investigation suggest that cefoxitin antagonizes beta-lactams via (i) induction of drug-inactivating beta-lactamases, and (ii) the induction of beta-lactamases that cannot inactivate the drug but serve as barriers against access to target proteins.

Clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae exhibiting resistance to Beta-lactam antibiotics are being isolated with increased frequency in many countries. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to <b>Beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs</b> have modified forms of penicillin-binding proteins that exhibit reduced affinity for binding to chemotherapeutic Beta-lactams. Penicillin binding proteins are membrane-bound enzymes that catalyze the terminal step in cell wall synthesis, and are targets for <b>Beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs.</b> Seventeen clinical isolates and six vaccine strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were characterized using conventional phenotypic methods, susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, capsular serotyping, and by different biochemical and genotyping methods. One strain, Sp D 2, was resistant to penicillin and other Beta-lactams used in the study, to erythromycin, and to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole. Sp D 2 exhibited a unique protein profile in 1 D SDS-PAGE gels of whole-cell proteins. Cells of Sp D 2 were fractionated, and the cytoplasmic membrane fraction was obtained by ultracentrifugation and analyzed using a 1 D SDS-PAGE gel. A protein band with a mass of ~ 50 kDa was excised and subjected to Trypsin In-Gel Digestion, followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and database searching. The resulting MALDI-TOF-MS data (peptide mass fingerprints) did not produce any significant matches with proteins in any of the published S. pneumoniae genome databases. The 50 kDa protein was further subjected to N-terminal and internal sequence analysis and database searching, and the protein could not be identified by significant matches. Sp D 2 did not react with any anti-pneumococcal polysaccharide capsular antibodies, and is designated as a non-typeable strain. Sp D 2 exhibited a positive reaction in the Bile Solubility Test, the Optochin Test, and also positive reactions in PCR assays for the presence of the pneumococcal surface protein gene (PsaA), the autolysin gene (LytA), and the pneumolysin gene (Ply); which confirms that Sp D 2 is a strain of S. pneumoniae.

Additionally, identification of a Staphylococcus schleiferi subspecies coagulans isolate was confirmed by molecular methods. All isolates of staphylococci were susceptible to beta-lactam drugs: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefovecin, cefoxitin, cefpodoxime, and cephalothin. They were also susceptible to chloramphenicol and enrofloxacin. Resistance was highest to tetracycline. Methicillin resistance was not detected in any isolate of S. pseudintermedius or in S. schleiferi. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the most common species was Klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus. The only drug to which all Gram-negative isolates were susceptible was enrofloxacin. This report {{is the first to}} confirm the presence of S. pseudintermedius and S. schleiferi subspecies coagulans, in dogs with pyoderma in Grenada, and the susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates to the majority of <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drugs</b> used in veterinary practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance rates and the trend in resistance of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae isolated from pigs in Italy from 1994 to 2009. A total of 992 A. pleuropneumoniae isolates were tested for their susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents in a disk diffusion method. Resistance to 7 <b>drugs</b> (<b>amoxicillin,</b> amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefquinome, cotrimoxazole, penicillin G and tilmicosin) showed a significant increasing trend over the time, while for 2 drugs (gentamycin and marbofloxacin) a significant decrease was observed. Resistance to the remaining 14 antimicrobial agents tested did not change significantly over the study period. Most of the isolates retained high susceptibility to antimicrobials usually effective against A. pleuropneumoniae such as amphenicols, fluoroquinolones and ceftiofur. However, high rates of resistance were observed for potentiated sulfa drugs, tetracyclines and penicillins which are currently recommended antimicrobials for pig pleuropneumonia therapy. Our results suggest the importance of continued monitoring of A. pleuropneumoniae clinical isolates in order to choose the most appropriate treatment of infections and to control the increase of resistance to currently used antimicrobials...|$|R
40|$|A {{nationwide}} susceptibility {{survey of}} the Bacteroides fragilis group was continued at New England Medical Center in 1983. A total of 555 strains were obtained from eight centers in the United States. In addition to the nine antimicrobial agents studied in the two previous years, three other agents {{were added to the}} evaluation: cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefonicid. The results for the strains tested with the original nine drugs in 1983 were compared with those for 1, 292 isolates tested in 1981 and 1982. The most active <b>beta-lactam</b> <b>drug</b> was piperacillin, which had an 8 % resistance rate. Cefoxitin resistance increased from 10 % in 1982 to 16 % in 1983. High rates of resistance to cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, cefonicid, and cefuroxime were encountered. No metronidazole- or chloramphenicol-resistant isolates were found during the 3 years of the study. Susceptibility patterns varied at the eight hospitals: the outbreak of cefoxitin resistance reported in 1982 at New England Medical Center remitted, while a high clindamycin resistance rate was documented at one hospital in 1983. These data indicate the need for determining the susceptibility patterns for the B. fragilis group of organisms at each hospital...|$|R

Materiais biohÃ­bridos a base de argilominerais (montmorillonita, sepiolita) e sÃ³lidos inorgÃ¢nicos (hidrÃ³xidos duplos lamelares) sÃ£o uma boa opÃ§Ã£o para diversas aplicaÃ§Ãµes (tais como biomÃ©dicas) devido ao seu baixo custo, biodegradabilidade e biocompatibilidade. Devido a capacidade de troca iÃ´nica, Ã¡rea especÃ­fica elevada e a capacidade de adsorÃ§Ã£o que esses materiais possuem, Ã© possÃ­vel combinar uma grande variedade de espÃ©cies orgÃ¢nicas, tais como drogas, na qualidade de transportadoras. Neste contexto, este trabalho apresenta a preparaÃ§Ã£o de novos bionanocompÃ³sitos com base na combinaÃ§Ã£o dos biopolÃ­meros carboximetilcelulose e zeÃ­na como revestimento do hÃ­brido, argilomineral - antibiÃ³tico e hidrÃ³xidos duplos lamelares-antibiÃ³tico. Para a sÃ­ntese dos materiais biohÃ­bridos foi utilizado o antibiÃ³tico neomicina de uso tÃ³pico e amoxicilina de uso oral como fÃ¡rmacos modelos, o qual, foram incorporados nos argilominerais e hidrÃ³xidos duplos lamelares por processo de intercalaÃ§Ã£o por troca iÃ´nica e por adsorÃ§Ã£o. Bionanocomposites systems clay base (montmorillonite and sepiolite), layered double hidroxides and biopolymers (carboxymethylcellulose and zein) were {{evaluated}} as topical delivery systems with antibacterial activity and as oral delivery systems. For this study, neomycin, a topical antibiotic, indicated mainly for open wound infections. The <b>drug</b> <b>amoxicillin,</b> an antibiotic indicated mainly for throat infections, {{were also used}} in this study. Both antibiotics were used as model drugs. Initially, drugs were incorporated directly into the biopolymer matrix, comprising the combination of carboxymethylcellulos and zein, being conformed as movies and balls and evaluated for their antibacterial activity and controlled release simulating gastrointestinal fluids. Moreover, hybrids materials have been prepared where the neomycin drug was incorporated into the lamellar inorganic solids, such as montmorillonite by ion exchange reaction, and the fibrous type, such as sepiolite by adsorption in aqueous solution. But the <b>drug</b> <b>amoxicillin</b> was incorporated into layered double hydroxides by anion exchange and montmorillonite by cation exchange. The resulting hybrids were in turn combined with the biopolymer matrix yielding bionanocomposites shaped materials such as films were tested for their antibacterial activity, and the shaped materials beads were tested for their release in the gastrointestinal fluids. Through the analysis of various physico-chemical techniques, we observed the interactions between the studied materials, the formation of hybrids materials, obtaining the bionanocomposites materials and material efficiency when applied in controlled release of drugs both topical and use oral mainly influenced {{by the presence of}} zein, are promising as topical delivery systems and oral drugs...|$|R
