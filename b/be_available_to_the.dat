5|$|Before Maria's arrival, {{tropical}} storm watches were issued {{for most of}} the Lesser Antilles on September8; the watches were upgraded to {{tropical storm}} warnings at 2230UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500UTC on September10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, the woman was {{able to get out of}} her car and pulled to safety. Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island due to Maria.|$|E

5|$|On February 17, 1944, Zoldak {{was traded}} along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran {{to add to}} their roster, while the Browns wanted the two {{prospects}} as they were classified as 4-F, and would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team {{for the duration of}} the war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning an ERA of 3.72. The Browns made it to the 1944 World Series, but Zoldak did not see any action. He played in 26 games during the 1945 season, earning a 3-2 record with an ERA of 3.36. In his final appearance of the season on September 29 against the Cleveland Indians, he was given the opportunity to start a game opposite Bob Feller. In a six-inning game shortened by rain, Zoldak and the Browns won, 21.|$|E

25|$|Limnoithona tetraspina {{has become}} the numerically {{dominant}} cyclopoid copepod since its introduction in 1993. It feeds primarily upon ciliates and microflagellates, but unlike P. forbesi, it is relatively impervious to predation by clams or fish, hence its abundance. Energetically, L. tetraspina may be a dead end for the food web; these copepods are either advected {{out of the system}} by tides and currents, or die and fall down to the benthos, where they may <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> microbial loop, or to detritivores.|$|E

25|$|As Van Slyck (1991) showed, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that free libraries should <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American public. But the design of the idealized free library was the subject of prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, the library profession called for designs that supported efficiency in administration and operation; on the other, wealthy philanthropists favored buildings that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. Between 1886 and 1917, Carnegie reformed both library philanthropy and library design, encouraging a closer correspondence between the two.|$|E

Richard's photographs, along with images taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott in 1973, will <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public through Windows on Earth, adding a personal element to studies of Earth and how Earth has changed over time.|$|E
25|$|As VanSlyck (1989) shows, {{the last}} years of the 19th century saw {{acceptance}} of the idea that libraries should <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> American public free of charge. However the design of the idealized free library {{was at the center of}} a prolonged and heated debate. On one hand, wealthy philanthropists favored grandiose monuments that reinforced the paternalistic metaphor and enhanced civic pride. They wanted a grandiose showcase that created a grand vista through a double-height, alcoved bookhall with domestically-scaled reading rooms, perhaps dominated by the donor's portrait over the fireplace. Typical examples were the New York Public Library and the Chicago Public Library. Librarians considered that grand design inefficient, and too expensive to maintain.|$|E

25|$|Generals Kouprasith Abhay, Oudone Sananikone, and Ouane Rattikone {{plotted against}} {{the air force}} head. On 3 July 1965, a land mine blew up a jeep in Thao Ma's entourage in an {{attempted}} assassination. There was widespread agreement that his rivals were responsible. Later in the year, controversy flared over usage of the RLAF's transports. When three C-47s were delivered to air force headquarters in Savannakhet, Kouprasith and Ouane demanded their transfer to Wattay, where they would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> generals. Thao Ma refused the transfer {{on the grounds that}} the transports would be used for smuggling gold and opium instead of military use. To retaliate, promotions within the RLAF were limited.|$|E
25|$|In late 1859, Trollope {{learned of}} {{preparations}} {{for the release of}} the Cornhill Magazine, to be published by George Murray Smith and edited by William Makepeace Thackeray. He wrote to the latter, offering to provide short stories for the new magazine. Thackeray and Smith both responded: the former urging Trollope to contribute, the latter offering £1000 for a novel, provided that a substantial part of it could <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> printer within six weeks. Trollope offered Smith Castle Richmond, which he was then writing; but Smith declined to accept an Irish story, and suggested a novel dealing with English clerical life as had Barchester Towers. Trollope then devised the plot of Framley Parsonage, setting it near Barchester so that he could make use of characters from the Barsetshire novels.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the plan}} put before the first session of the First Congress in 1790, Hamilton {{proposed}} establishing the initial funding for the First Bank of the United States through the sale of $10 million in stock of which the United States government would purchase the first $2 million in shares. Hamilton, foreseeing the objection that this could not be done since the U.S. government did not have $2 million, proposed that the government make the stock purchase using money lent to it by the bank; the loan to be paid back in ten equal annual installments. The remaining $8 million of stock would <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public, both in the United States and overseas. The chief requirement of these non-government purchases was that one-quarter {{of the purchase price}} had to be paid in gold or silver; the remaining balance could be paid in bonds, acceptable scrip, etc.|$|E
