5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, {{and that the only}} outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to <b>be</b> <b>printed,</b> and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of Euboea, Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E

5|$|The {{printing}} equipment was also delivered in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from Hahnemühle; it was {{large enough for}} four notes to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> on each sheet. Production of counterfeit notes started in January 1943; it took a year for production {{to return to the}} levels achieved in Operation Andreas.|$|E

With this technical improvement, the prints almost resembled Bauer's original paintings.|$|E

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|Howard and {{her husband}} were part of a circle of artists, writers and {{designers}} who were interested in visual images, in language and in the book arts. One close associate was the graphic designer Allan Fleming, whose Martlet Press published Twenty-Eight Drawings by Barbara Howard in 1970, a period when she was drawing the figure. The Canadian wood engraver Rosemary Kilbourn, a close friend since art college, taught Howard to carve images that could <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> in conjunction with text.|$|E
5|$|In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries {{published}} a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named 'Thambiraan Vanakkam,' thus making Tamil the first Indian language to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> and published.

According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.|$|E

5|$|Motte was a London {{publisher}} {{who took}} over Benjamin Tooke's publishing business, which printed many of Swift's earlier works. In 1726, Swift sent Motte a copy of Gulliver's Travels to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> anonymously. Motte took great care to protect {{the identity of the}} author, and employed five publishing houses to speed production of the book and avoid unlicensed copying. In 1727, Motte formed his first direct contract with Swift in order to publish Swift's Miscellanies. As part of the contract, Motte paid Tooke for the original copyright to the work.|$|E
5|$|On 11 February, one {{day after}} the {{conclusion}} of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E
5|$|The Treasury {{announced}} {{the new design}} on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As {{it would take the}} Mint several days to produce working dies, the first strike of the new coins was scheduled for December 29.|$|E
50|$|During {{the decade}} 1791-1800, more than 8,000 hymn tunes <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> in Great Britain and between 7,000 and 8,000 <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> in the United States; {{during the decade}} 1801-1810, about 11,000 hymn tunes <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> in Great Britain, while more than 15,000 <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> in the United States.

5|$|The post-war years saw the Echo drop Shipping Gazette {{from its}} main title-piece, {{following}} a redesign in 1959. Instead, the paper {{became known as}} Echo Sunderland for several years, although the name Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette continued to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> in much smaller type above the new title. A further title-piece redesign in 1972, however, dispensed with the words Shipping Gazette and introduced an illustration of Wearmouth Bridge alongside the title Echo Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|Gott ist mein König is a {{significant}} early work of Bach. It differs from the other extant cantatas from Bach's time in Mühlhausen by its elaborate instrumentation. It was so positively received {{that it was the}} first of Bach's works to <b>be</b> <b>printed</b> (paid for by the city council); it is the only cantata to have been printed in his lifetime, at least in a version which has survived to this day. The printing is all the more remarkable as Gott ist mein König appears to have been intended for not more than one repeat performance, and a new piece was commissioned the following year. Bach was commissioned to compose another cantata for the following year's council inauguration; there is evidence that the piece was composed and even printed, but no copies are known to survive.|$|E
50|$|The paper <b>was</b> <b>printed</b> by Verlag Wilhelm Niessner in Brünn, from 1917 it <b>was</b> <b>printed</b> by Verlag Josef Herrman in Moravian Ostrava.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the maps}} <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> in England or well behind the lines as the <b>printing</b> presses <b>were</b> {{not easy to}} move at short notice should an attack by the Germans be successful. Some small sheets were made nearer the front by other {{techniques}} but the regular series trench maps <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> using lithography on large presses by very skilled printers. Some of these maps <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> from zinc plates but many <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> from lithographic limestone plates.|$|R
