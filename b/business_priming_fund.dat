Most of the original <b>prime</b> <b>funds</b> were continuously offered funds with quarterly tender periods. Managers then rolled true closed-end, exchange-traded funds in the early 1990s. It {{was not until the}} early 2000s that fund complexes introduced open-ended funds that were redeemable each day. While quarterly redemption funds and closed-end funds remained the standard because the secondary loan market does not offer the rich liquidity that is supportive of open-end funds, the open-end funds had sufficiently raised their profile that by mid-2008 they accounted for 15-20% of the loan assets held by mutual funds.|$|R

40|$|This paper studies daily {{investor}} {{flows to}} and from each {{money market mutual fund}} during the period prior to and including the money fund crisis of September and October 2008. We focus on the determinants of flows in the <b>prime</b> money <b>fund</b> category to shed light on the covariates of money fund runs, since this category was, by far, the most heavily impacted by the money fund crisis. We find that institutional investors moved their money simultaneously (or with a one-day delay) into or out of <b>prime</b> money <b>funds,</b> especially within the same fund complex. Specifically, during September and October 2008, flows in a given <b>prime</b> institutional <b>fund</b> are strongly correlated with same-day flows in all other same-complex <b>prime</b> institutional <b>funds,</b> indicating that the money fund crisis was especially focused on certain types of fund complexes. To illustrate, a daily outflow of 1 % of total assets from other same-complex <b>prime</b> institutional money <b>funds</b> predicts, on average, a 0. 92 % outflow in a given prime institutional money fun...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{structure}} of loan syndicates and analyzes the participation by investment banks and other non-bank lenders in such financings. We find that investment banks {{are more likely to}} lead syndicated loans to riskier borrowers than commercial banks. Investment banks also tend to participate more often in the riskier tranches of multi-facility loans. Though non-bank entities like finance companies, insurance companies, investment companies, CLOs, CDOs, mutual <b>funds,</b> and <b>prime</b> <b>funds</b> rarely play lead roles in syndications, they also participate more frequently in riskier, multi-facility syndicated credits. Maskara (2010) argues that multi-facility syndicated loans derive economic value from the participation of lender groups with varying levels of risk aversion. We provide empirical support for his theoretical arguments...|$|R
