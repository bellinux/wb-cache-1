In particular, an effort is made here to study {{the characteristics of a}} die cast automotive front seat <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> and develop a method for predicting the optimized material and support rib distribution which provides a lightweight seat which satisfies both strength and deflection requirements in a design space which includes the action of multiple load cases. An existing commercially available die cast <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> serves as the reference design space. Both 3 D surface and solid models are created for representation as shell and solid finite element models for analysis. The objective function for topology optimization of the 3 D solid model is to minimize mass of the component subject to stress and deflection constraints and is used as a guide in determining optimal geometric distribution of stiffening ribs. When the shell model of the reference seat is subjected to free-size optimization with this same constraint and objective given, an optimized material distribution measured by shell element thicknesses is obtained. For the topology optimization, manufacturing constraints of preferred draw direction and symmetry are applied in order to obtain an optimized material distribution which can be manufactured in the die-cast process. The procedure followed in this work generated an optimal material distribution and stiffening ribs in a lightweight die cast automotive seat <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> when subjected to multiple load cases. An overall reduction in weight of 13 % is achieved over a reference commercially available die cast <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> component...|$|E
40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of seat backrest of car. Computer aided design and finite element analysis are essential in order to predict accurately for the safety performance of automotive seat in an event of crash. In this work, finite element analysis is {{used to evaluate the}} strength, deflection and maximum stress characteristics of a reference automotive seat in an event of vehicle rear impact. The safety function is measured based on a backrest moment test in accordance with (ECE R- 17) regulations and FMVSS 2 O 7 regulations which is particularly for rear impact. In first stage, the bending moment test of the reference seat <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> is done by using a complete model formed on CATIA V 5 R 17 by integrating the major structural components including the connector, vertical side flange, top cross member and supporting plates and the maximum pressure to be apply on top cross member of the seat back frame of seat as per regulation of bending moment test. In order to confirm the strength requirements, bending moment deflection characteristics of the seat are studied in accordance with ECE R- 17. In second stage, as per the regulation of FMVSS 207 for rear impact condition, the maximum pressure to be apply on the all part of the seat back frame including seat backrest and to evaluate the various stresses and deflection on various part of the seat backrest of seat. Further finite element analysis of seat backrest, on the basis of result obtained in stage second, the free- optimization is done to reduce the stresses and deformation on backrest...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of the {{transmission}} of vibration from the floor beneath a seat to interfaces between the seat and the human body are used to characterise the dynamic performance of the seat. Most studies of seat transmissibility concern {{the transmission}} of vertical vibration through seat pan cushions, but fore-and-aft vibration at a seat pan and backrest can also cause discomfort. This study investigated {{the transmission of}} fore-and-aft vibration through a car seat to surfaces on the seat pan cushion, the backrest cushion and the headrest, and also to the seat frame at these three locations. The study sought to understand the influences of the seat frame and the cushion foam and to provide data for dynamic modelling of the seat. The fore-and-aft transmissibility of the seat was measured with 12 human subjects and an SAE J 826 manikin, using 120 -s periods of fore-and-aft random vibration (0. 25 - 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4 m/s 2 r. m. s., 0. 8 m/s 2 r. m. s. and 1. 2 m/s 2 r. m. s.). With the manikin, there were three resonances (at 3. 5 Hz, 12 Hz and 20 Hz) in the transmissibilities from the seat base to the seat pan frame and the seat pan cushion, and to the <b>backrest</b> <b>frame</b> and the backrest cushion. With the human subjects, the transmissibilities from the seat base to all six locations on the seat showed a principal resonance around 4 Hz. With increasing magnitude of the vibration, the principal resonance frequency in all the seat transmissibilities decreased. It is concluded that fore-and-aft resonances in the seat transmissibilities, especially to the backrest, are likely to affect vibration discomfort. There are large differences between the fore-and-aft transmissibility of a seat with a manikin and those with human subjects, consistent with the human body having dynamics very {{different from those of}} a rigid mass. Non-linearities in the seat transmissibilities with the manikin and with the human subjects may be explained by non-linearity in the biodynamics of the body and the responses of the seat and the manikin. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmissibility}} of a seat {{depends on}} the dynamics of both the seat and the human body. Previous {{studies show that the}} apparent mass of the body, to which much attention has been paid, has a large influence on the vibration transmissibility of a seat. The influence of the seat dynamics on the seat transmissibility has received less systematic attention. The principal objective {{of this study was to}} develop a systematic methodology using finite element methods to model the dynamic interaction between a seat and the human body so as to predict the seat transmissibility. The purpose was to understand how the foam material, the seat structure, and the seat occupant influence the vibration transmitted through seats. The effect of the foam thickness at the seat cushion and the backrest on the transmissibility was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects during exposure to 60 -s periods of fore-and-aft and vertical vibration, respectively, in the frequency range 0. 5 to 20 Hz at 0. 8 ms- 2 r. m. s [...] Increasing the thickness of the foam at the seat cushion decreased the resonance frequency of both the vertical vibration transmitted to the seat cushion and the fore-and-aft vibration transmitted to the backrest, while there was little effect of the foam thickness at the backrest. It appears that the foam at the seat cushion had a predominant effect on the transmission of the vibration. Load-deflection curves were measured at various points across the lateral and fore-and-aft centrelines of a car seat with three different loading rates: 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 mm/s. The dynamic stiffness of the seat cushion and backrest was measured with 120 -s broadband random vibration (1. 5 to 15 Hz) with three static preloads and with three vibration magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s.). With the same deformation, the reaction force was greater during loading than during unloading, showing evidence of hysteresis. The stiffness increased with increasing preload force and tended to decrease with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating the seat components were nonlinear. The dynamic stiffness was also found to be greater when the seat cushion was constrained with a leather cover than without a leather cover. The transmission of vibration from the seat base to six different positions on a car seat was investigated experimentally in the laboratory with a SAE J 826 manikin and with 12 subjects exposed to 120 -s periods of random vibration (0. 5 to 40 Hz) at three magnitudes (0. 4, 0. 8, and 1. 2 ms- 2 r. m. s.) in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The transmissibility from the seat base to the seat cushion surface and <b>frame,</b> to the <b>backrest</b> surface and <b>frame,</b> and to the headrest surface and frame exhibited a peak around 4 - 5 Hz in the fore-and-aft and vertical directions, respectively. The principal resonance frequency in the transmissibilities to all locations decreased with increasing magnitude of vibration, indicating nonlinearity in the seat-occupant system. There was little effect of the seat track position on the measured seat transmissibilities. The transmissibilities with subjects and with the manikin were different. Based on the experimental studies, models of the seat cushion and the backrest assemblies were built up and calibrated separately using the measured load-deflection curves and dynamic stiffnesses. They were joined to form a complete seat model and integrated with the model of a manikin for further calibration with measured seat transmissibility. The calibrated seat model was combined with a re-calibrated existing human body model to predict the transmissibility of the seat. It was found that by combining a calibrated seat model with a calibrated human body model, and defining appropriate contacts between the two models, the vertical vibration transmissibility of a seat with an occupant can be predicted. The developed seat-occupant model could be further improved to predict fore-and-aft seat transmissibility to the backrest and the dynamic pressure distributions at the interfaces between the human body and the seat...|$|R
