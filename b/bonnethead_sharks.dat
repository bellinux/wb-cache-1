50|$|<b>Bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> are {{the only}} sharks known to exhibit sexual {{dimorphism}} in the morphology of the head. Adult female <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> have a broadly rounded head, whereas males possess a distinct bulge along the anterior margin of the cephalofoil. This bulge is formed by the elongation of the rostral cartilages of the males {{at the onset of}} sexual maturity and corresponds temporally with the elongation of the clasper cartilages.|$|E

40|$|Various motor {{patterns}} {{and the associated}} social activities have been described for the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark,</b> Sphryna tiburo (Myrberg and Gruber 1974) and the gray reef shark, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos (Johnson and Nelson 1973). The sterotyped nature of these body movements and postures, {{as well as their}} departure from normal swimming behavior, were similar to those the authors observed in two captive bull sharks, Carcharhinus leucas. This report describes the behavior of these two bull sharks when the proper releasing situation occurs...|$|R
50|$|This species occurs off the American coast, {{in regions}} {{where the water}} is usually warmer than 70 F. It ranges from New England, where it is rare, to the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil, and from {{southern}} California to Ecuador. During the summer it is common in the inshore waters of the Carolinas and Georgia; in spring, summer, and fall, it is found off Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico. In the winter, the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> is found closer to the equator, where the water is warmer.|$|R
50|$|Using {{data from}} mtDNA analysis, {{scientist}} {{have found that}} evolution of hammerhead sharks has probably begun with a taxon that had a highly pronounced cephalofoil (most likely that similar to the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii), and has later been modified through selective pressures. Thus, judging by their smaller cephalofoils, <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> are the more recent developments of a 25-million-year evolutionary process.|$|E
5000|$|The {{bonnethead}} shark is {{an active}} tropical shark that swims in small groups of five to 15 individuals, although schools of hundreds or even thousands have been reported. <b>Bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> move constantly following changes in water temperature and to maintain respiration. The bonnethead shark sinks {{if it does not}} keep moving, since hammerhead sharks are among the most negatively buoyant of marine vertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Azteca {{opened in}} 2011, it {{features}} a 10-meter Ocean Tunnel, which has sea creatures including: <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks,</b> lion fish, starry pufferfish, surgeon fish, angle fish, catshark and epaulette shark. The tunnel existed before the 2011 addition, but was redeveloped {{for the arrival of}} new fish. Aside from the Ocean Tunnel, Azteca also has jellyfish, seahorse and northern wolffish. The placement of the area, has resulted in the division of the Our Shoreline area, which is now separated into two areas.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to examine the}} visual system of the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna tiburo). The eyes of this shark are located at the extreme lateral ends of a broad, {{elongated}} cephalofoil. Better understanding of their visual system may aid in determining the adaptive benefits of their usual head shape. The proposed project examined one specific aspect of their visual system: the organization of retinal ganglion cells and identification of areas of increased resolution. Two experiments were conducted to realize these aims: (1) staining of retinal ganglion cells, to examine their distributional pattern, and (2) retrograde staining of retinal ganglion cells to determine morphology...|$|R
40|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} via parthenogenesis {{is relatively}} rare among chordates {{and has never}} been recorded in the class Chondrichthyes. In December 2001, a female <b>Bonnethead</b> <b>Shark,</b> Sphyrna tiburo, gave birth in captivity to a single female pup, despite having been separated from any male S. tiburo for a period of at least three years. Widespread media attention quickly led to this case being billed as 2 ̆ 2 the shark-virgin birth 2 ̆ 2 (i. e., asexual reproduction), however other explanations (sexual reproduction coupled with long-term sperm storage, inter-specific hybridization with a male leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata, tank-mate) could not be ruled out. We present the results of a genetic investigation aimed at ruling out these alternatives and determining whether this birth is the first known case of asexual reproduction in this ancient lineage...|$|R

50|$|Located in {{the central}} open atrium of the main building, the {{principal}} feature of the Aquarium is the Giant Ocean Tank, a cylindrical 200000 gal L tank simulating a Caribbean coral reef. This tank houses <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks,</b> sea turtles, stingrays, moray eels, barracuda, and many smaller reef-living fish. Open at the top, the concrete tank {{is surrounded by a}} walkway that spirals down, allowing visitors access to 52 windows that offer views of the reef from every angle and level.|$|E
5000|$|The Secret Reef, {{the largest}} tank in Ocean Journey (and the Tennessee Aquarium), {{containing}} 618000 gal. It depicts {{the environment of}} the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the Gulf of Mexico and can be viewed from three levels including the Undersea Cavern, an underwater walk-through feature. The species exhibited in the Secret Reef include Sand tiger sharks, <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> and green sea turtles, one of which, [...] "Oscar," [...] is a rescue animal missing much of its rear flippers due to injuries from a boat and a predator.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pectoral}} fins on most fish control pitching (up-and-down {{motion of}} the body), yawing (the side-to-side motion), and rolling. Most hammerhead sharks do not yaw or roll and achieve pitch using their cephalofoils. The smaller cephalofoil of a bonnethead shark is not as successful, {{so they have to}} rely on the combination of cephalofoils and their large pectoral fins for most of their motility. Compared to other hammerheads, <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks</b> have larger and more developed pectoral fins and are the only species of hammerhead to actively use pectoral fins for swimming.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to further}} examine the visual system and its importance to the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna tiburo). This species of hammerhead shark possesses {{the least amount of}} lateral cephalofoil expansion. Better understanding of their visual system and potential visually-mediated behaviors may increase understanding regarding adaptive benefits of their unique head shape. The dissertation revealed four factors regarding this species visual system: 1) the extent of their optical visual fields span between 68 - 72 degrees laterally and cover their visual horizon, 2) they possess a fairly large (approximately 112 degree) blind spot directly in front of their cephalofoil, 3) they possess an average of 35 degrees of lateral head movement during sinusoidal swimming which likely increase the lateral extents of their optical visual fields, and 4) they can detect and show interest in small visual stimuli resembling their preferred prey species, the blue crab...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{management of}} shark populations requires juvenile recruitment success. Thus, conservation initiatives now strive {{to include the}} protection of areas used by pre-adult sharks {{in order to promote}} juvenile survivorship. Many shark species use inshore areas for early life stages; however, species often seg-regate within sites to reduce competition. Using a fisheries-independent gillnet survey from the Northern Gulf of Mexico (2000 – 2010) we describe distribution patterns and preferred habitat features of the juveniles of six shark species. Our results suggest that multiple shark species concurrently use the area for early life stages and although they overlap, they exhibit distinct habitat preferences characterized by physical variables. Habitat suitability models suggest that tem-perature, depth, and salinity are the important factors driving juvenile shark occurrence. Within each site, across the sampled range of physical characteris-tics, blacktip shark (Carcharhinus limbatus) preferred higher temperature (> 30 °C) and mid-depth (~ 5. 5 m); <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> (Sphyrna tiburo) pre...|$|R
5000|$|It feeds {{primarily}} on crustaceans, consisting mostly of blue crabs, but also shrimp, mollusks, and small fish. Its feeding behavior involves swimming across the seafloor, moving its head in arc patterns like a metal detector, looking for minute electromagnetic disturbances produced by crabs and other creatures {{hiding in the}} sediment. Upon discovery, it sharply turns around and bites into the sediment where the disturbance was detected. If a crab is caught, the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> uses its teeth to grind its carapace and then uses suction to swallow. Bonnetheads have also been found to ingest large amounts of seagrass, which may make up around 50% of their stomach contents. This {{may be related to}} incidental ingestion and learning how to hunt, as the phenomenon is mostly observed in pups and juveniles. However, the species may potentially be omnivorous, as they appear to be able to digest about 56% of the matter in seagrass. This would constitute the only known case of plant feeding in sharks.|$|R
50|$|The Caribbean Reef exhibit {{was built}} in 1971, {{on the site of}} the aquarium's very first exhibit, the Tropical Pool. A feature of this exhibit is a diver that interacts with the animals while talking with the people. A part of the exhibit is a 90000 usgal L {{circular}} tank that allows for maximum walk-around viewing. It was one of the first habitats to display schooling fish. It is also home to the rescued green sea turtle, Nickel, as well as <b>bonnethead</b> <b>sharks,</b> stingrays, and many more. The tank is near the center of the first floor. It is adjacent to Amazon Rising and Waters of the World, and above Wild Reef.|$|E
5000|$|Sea Base — Main {{viewing area}} of the {{aquarium}}. A smaller aquarium features a pair of rescued West Indian manatees. Other small tanks feature a variety of species from moray eels to seahorses, and other species that cannot interact with divers or other fish in the main exhibit. A large, cylindrical tank in which guests can view from the center exhibits a pod of four Common bottlenose dolphins in one corner. The other {{three quarters of the}} exhibit hold a wide array of species, including Sand tiger sharks, Naso tang, Threadfin butterflyfish, Cowtail stingray, Orange-lined triggerfish, Sandbar sharks, Bowmouth guitarfish, <b>Bonnethead</b> <b>sharks,</b> Atlantic tarpon, Shovelnose guitarfish, a Green sea turtle, a Blacknose shark, and a Zebra shark.|$|E
50|$|Shark Encounter is a {{multiple}} pool exhibit featuring {{a variety of}} sharks as well other large fish. The first pool features medium sized sharks, including Black and White Tip Reef sharks, Nurse sharks, Bamboo sharks and Zebra sharks. The second pool, which is the largest, features larger sharks, including Sand tiger sharks, Zebra Sharks, Nurse sharks, Black and White Tip Reef sharks, a Lemon shark, a Goliath grouper, {{as well as a}} variety of fish. The third pool features a variety of animals, including <b>Bonnethead</b> <b>sharks,</b> Leopard sharks, Zebra sharks, Tarpon, and a variety of fish. Directly across from the third pool is a touch pool style pool containing baby bamboo sharks, however guests are not allowed to put their hands in the water. As guests continue on, {{they will be able to}} walk through a tunnel at the bottom of the second pool.|$|E
50|$|Parthenogenesis in sharks {{has been}} {{confirmed}} in the <b>bonnethead</b> and zebra <b>shark.</b> Other, usually sexual species, may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically, and the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of facultative parthenogenetic vertebrates.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the biochemical effects of capture and restraint on sharks, 17 serum constituents were measured in three species (<b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark</b> Sphyrna tiburo, blacktip shark Carcharhinus limbatus, and bull shark C. leucas) after gill-net capture. The relative degree of capture effects on each animal was judged using {{an index of}} behavioral response devised for use in tag−recapture studies. Serum from each shark was assayed for glucose, creatinine, uric acid, sodium, chloride, potassium, inorganic phosphate, total and ionized calcium, total protein, albumin, globulin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total iron. In addition, hematocrit was measured from whole blood for each shark. When correlated with the relative degree of capture effects, there were significant intraspecific changes in the concentration of potassium, lactate, inorganic phosphate, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, total and ionized calcium, and glucose. Significant interspecific differences in the concentration of sodium, chloride, potassium, total protein, albumin, globulin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, ionized calcium, alkaline phosphatase, and glucose in minimally stressed animals also were observed. The study suggests that the deleterious effects of gill-net capture and restraint probably involve respiratory and metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia as well as cellular damage. Species-specific and individual differences in the mortality of sharks caught in gill nets are likely related to an animal 2 ̆ 7 s respiratory physiology and degree of struggling upon capture {{as well as to}} the extent of net entanglement around the gill area...|$|R
40|$|Few {{investigations}} have studied digestive enzyme {{activities in the}} alimentary tracts of sharks to gain insight into how these organisms digest their meals. In this study, we examined the activity levels of proteases, carbohydrases, and lipase in the pancreas, and along the anterior intestine, spiral intestine, and colon of the <b>bonnethead</b> <b>shark,</b> Sphyrna tiburo. We then interpreted our data {{in the context of}} a rate-yield continuum to discern this shark's digestive strategy. Our data show anticipated decreasing patterns in the activities of pancreatic enzymes moving posteriorly along the gut, but also show mid spiral intestine peaks in aminopeptidase and lipase activities, which support the spiral intestine as the main site of absorption in bonnetheads. Interestingly, we observed spikes in the activity levels of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and β-glucosidase in the bonnethead colon, and these chitin- and cellulose-degrading enzymes, respectively, are likely of microbial origin in this distal gut region. Taken in the context of intake and relatively long transit times of food through the gut, the colonic spikes in N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase and β-glucosidase activities suggest that bonnetheads take a yield-maximizing strategy to the digestive process, with some reliance on microbial digestion in their hindguts. This is one of the first studies to examine digestive enzyme activities along the gut of any shark, and importantly, the data match with previous observations that sharks take an extended time to digest their meals (consistent with a yield-maximizing digestive strategy) and that the spiral intestine is the primary site of absorption in sharks.
