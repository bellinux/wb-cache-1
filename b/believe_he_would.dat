5|$|Though Swift quickly {{established}} himself as a fixture in the Manchester City first team line-up, his performances were not all positive. In one of his early matches, against West Bromwich Albion, Swift conceded seven goals. This led Swift to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be picked again, but with Langford unavailable due to a knee injury, Swift kept his place.|$|E

Billings approached Tom Shaw from Avalon Hill—the company produced many war games that Billings played as a child—and {{one of the founders}} of Automated Simulations to share market data, but aroused no interest. The lukewarm responses made Billings <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to publish SSI's games.

25|$|His {{appointment}} on 3 September 1939 as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) came {{as something}} of a surprise to Ironside; he had been led to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), and indeed had already despatched his Assistant to Aldershot to begin preparing his headquarters. The reorganisation was politically driven; Hore-Belisha had fallen out heavily with Viscount Gort during 1939, and the outbreak of war provided an excellent pretext for Gort to leave Whitehall. This left the post of CIGS vacant, and after heavy lobbying by Churchill, Ironside was chosen over Sir John Dill, then the General Officer Commanding, Aldershot Command.|$|E

Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for £10,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common Brazilian surname, he instead adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna. Senna {{went on to win the}} 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships. For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.|$|E

500|$|Moffat wrote six episodes for the series. The {{rest were}} penned by guest writers, as Moffat {{believed}} that Doctor Who benefited from different voices.

Moffat knew all of the guest writers [...] "to some degree" [...] and called meeting with them [...] "quite joyous". However, Matthew Graham, co-creator of Life on Mars and writer of the second series episode [...] "Fear Her", was not able to write an episode as he was slated to because he did not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have enough time.

The competition was styled after manga competitions, was advertised in computer and manga magazines, and had a million prize for the winners. The winners were , Koichi Nakamura, and manga magazine Shōnen Jump editor Yuji Horii, who was the top winner. Horii designed a tennis game, Love Match Tennis, which became Enix's first release. While he did not <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> win, he was motivated by his editor, who enjoyed the games and published Horii's articles on them. Later, when Enix began creating games for the NES, Fukushima held another contest.

He said that his team had observed lap times from the previous race and {{knew that he would}} be strong in the second event.

500|$|During the {{off-season}} of 2012, Brodeur hired agent Pat Brisson, leading many analysts to <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> test free-agency or retire. However, on July 2, 2012, Brodeur {{agreed to a}} two-year, $9million deal to remain with the Devils, alongside backup goalie Johan Hedberg. On March 21, 2013, {{in his first game}} back from a month-long absence due to a pinched nerve injury in his upper back, Brodeur was credited with a power play goal against the Carolina Hurricanes, making him the only NHL goalie to record three career goals, and the first goalie to score on the power play since Evgeni Nabokov in 2002. Brodeur had a 13–9–7 record in his 29 appearance in 2012–13, with a 2.22 GAA. The following season, he shared the Devils' starting goalie position with Cory Schneider, whose 45 games played were six more than Brodeur's total. Brodeur's statistical performance declined, as his GAA increased to 2.51, more than half a goal higher than Schneider. In 39 games played, Brodeur had a [...]901 save percentage, lower than the league average. Among his 19 wins in 2013–14 was a victory in the season finale against Boston, his 688th for New Jersey. On June 6, 2014, Brodeur told ESPN he would test the free agency market for the 2014–15 season, and his 21-year tenure with the Devils ended.|$|E
500|$|Carte's first {{production}} at the Royal English Opera House was of Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe, which opened in January 1891. It played for an initial run of 155 performances, a record for an opera, but no other operas shared the new opera house with it. Instead, Ivanhoe was presented every night with alternating casts. When Ivanhoe finally closed in July, Carte had no new work ready {{to play at the}} opera house, and so it had to close. The opera house re-opened in November 1891 with André Messager's La Basoche at first alternating in repertory with Ivanhoe, and then La Basoche played alone, closing in January 1892. Carte again had no new opera to present at the house, and the venture soon failed. Sir Henry Wood, who had been répétiteur for the production, recalled in his autobiography, [...] "If D'Oyly Carte had had a repertory of six operas instead of only one, I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have established English opera in London for all time. Towards the end of the run of Ivanhoe I was already preparing The Flying Dutchman with Eugène Oudin in the name part. He would have been superb. However, plans were altered and the Dutchman was shelved." [...] Carte leased the theatre to Sarah Bernhardt for a season and finally abandoned the project. He sold the opera house at a loss to producer Augustus Harris. It was then converted into a music hall, the Palace Theatre of Varieties, and later became the Palace Theatre.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won. And if the race had been just a little bit longer, I <b>believe</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have." ...|$|E
