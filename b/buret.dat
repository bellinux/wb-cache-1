Early products included microscopes, <b>burets,</b> pipettes, litmus, balances, colorimeters, dissecting kits, and anatomical models. The first catalog, the 400 page Scientific Materials Co. Catalog of Laboratory Apparatus & Supplies, was published in 1904. Fisher established an R&D lab at his company in 1915.

The company manufactured an electric-combustion furnace and combustion train for analyzing carbon levels in steel, and an electrically heated and thermostatically controlled bacteriological incubator.

40|$|The World Health Organization {{has called}} for an effort to {{eliminate}} Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) around the world. In regions where the disease is endemic, local production and distribution of medicated salt dosed with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) has been an effective method for eradicating LF. A partner of the Notre Dame Haiti program, Group SPES in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, produces a medicated salt called Bon Sel. Coarse salt is pre-washed and sprayed with a solution of DEC citrate and potassium iodate. Iodine levels are routinely monitored on site by a titrimetric method. However, the factory had no method for monitoring DEC. Critical analytical issues include 1) determining whether the amount of DEC in each lot of Bon Sel is within safe and therapeutically useful limits, 2) monitoring variability within and between production runs, and 3) determining {{the effect of a}} common local practice (washing salt before use) on the availability of DEC. This paper describes a novel titrimetric method for analysis of DEC citrate in medicated salt. The analysis needs no electrical power and requires only a balance, volumetric glassware, and <b>burets</b> that most salt production programs have on hand for monitoring iodine levels. The staff of the factory used this analysis method on site to detect underloading of DEC on the salt by their sprayer and to test a process change that fixed the problem...|$|R
40|$|Glassware {{and other}} {{containers}} All glass apparatus and containers used in analytical work {{must be carefully}} selected {{to meet the requirements}} of their particular use. Although several types of special-purpose glasses are available, borosilicate thermal-resistant types, such as Pyrex or Kimax, are generally satisfactory for all ordinary labor-atory purposes in water analysis. Borosilicate glass is especially suitable for storage of neutral or acid solutions, for volumetric glassware, and for conducting reactions. Because borosilicate glass is not entirely resistant to attack by strongly alkaline solutions, bottles of polyethyl-ene or Teflon need to be used for storage of standard solutions of silica, boron, and alkali-metals hydroxides. All volumetric glassware, such as <b>burets,</b> pipets, and volumetric flasks, must be of boro- 3 silicate glass and must contain or deliver vol-umes within the tolerances of the method. In addition if such glassware is frequently used to measure strongly alkaline solutions, it needs to be recalibrated at frequent intervals. Directions for such calibration and testing of volumetric glassware are given by the National Bureau of Standards (1959) and in standard texts of quan-titative analysis. Evaporations may be carried out in glass, por-celain, zirconium, or platinum dishes. Platinum is preferred if the weight of the residue needs to be determined accurately, because the weight of platinum vessels is relatively constant. Although platinum {{is one of the most}} resist-ant metals, it is not completely inert and is subject to embrittlement. The following precau-tions are recommended: Never put solutions containing tin, mercury, or lead in a reducing environment in platinum; if the free metal should be formed it will alloy with the platinum, especially if heated. Do not heat mixtures of hydrochloric acid with oxidizing substances, such as nitrate or manganese dioxide; ferric chloride in hydrochloric acid attacks platinum appreciably. Place hot platinum vessels on...|$|R
40|$|CLINICAL CHEMISTRY, {{the science}} in whieh {{chemical}} and biologic analy-sis of body fluids and tissues {{is used in}} the diagnosis and treatment of disease, is undergoing rapid change. Engineers and physicists have entered the field and have designed automated and mechanized equip-ment which, some people postulate, eventually may replace not only the technician, but also the clinical chemist. I feel, however, that there is more to clinical chemistry than the mere performance of laboratory tests. The clinical chemist must be, as the playwright wrote, a man for all seasons. He must be a capable administrator of his laboratory, able to solve the many personnel and instrumentation problems that face him daily. He must understand the fundamentals of biochemistry and immunochemistry, and keep abreast of all of the rapid changes in these burgeoning fields. He must be able not only to initiate new organic and inorganic analyses of biologic material, but also to recognize and appreciate the development of physical science and engineering, and perhaps most importantly, to discriminate between industrial science fiction and reality. Finally, during his training, and perhaps also as a result of strenuous personal effort, he must have obtained at least a smattering of ignorance in the art of clinical medicine so that he can provide the clinicians with the proper counseling for their myriad of pathologic-biochemical problems. Therefore, I hope that the modern clinical chemist will not pass into the liml) o of medical and chemical history, dragging his pipets, <b>burets,</b> and AutoAnalyzers behind him. I hope he will not go quietly into the dark night, but instead, rage, rage against the monsters of mechanization and computer conformity. A review of the early history of clinical chemistry may help him arm against these modern horrors and help him gain an appreciation of the background of this hybrid science and of the many interesting individ-uals-scientists, physicians, priests, wizards, and charlatans-who have contributed {{to the development of the}} field...|$|R
