40|$|Artificial, amfiphilic, and {{biomimetic}} receptors soluble {{in water}} were synthesized via attaching polar amino acids to hydrophobic <b>back-bones</b> possessing a surface suitable for hydrophobic interactions. The hydrophobic <b>back-bones</b> chosen in this thesis were anthracene and dibenzobarrelene structures. A route to an efficient synthesis of a dibenzobarrelene backbone with two sets of orthogonal reactivities was developed. Several different types of receptors were synthesized; • based on 9, 10 -bis-aminomethyl-anthracene where polar amino acids were coupled in C->N and N->C direction • based on 9, 10 -bis-aminomethyl-dibenzobarrelene with the amino acids in the C->N direction. Within the project, a new method of cleaving the thio-protecting group 2 -(trimethylsilyl) ethyl sulfide with an acyl chloride and silver tetrafluoroborate was developed and evaluated. Binding studies of the receptors were performed with p-nitrophenyl glycosides and uronides in water and the show a moderate binding. However, calculated dissociation constants, Kd 10 - 30 mM, {{were in the same}} range as other published receptors for carbohydrates in water and for natural proteins binding monosaccharides.

They appear as semantic <b>back-bones</b> for engineering frameworks including dynamic fault trees, Gener-alised Stochastic Petri Nets, and AADL.

40|$|Abstract. Backbones of propositional {{theories}} are literals that are true in every model. Backbones {{have been used}} for characterizing the hardness of decision and optimization problems. Moreover, <b>back-bones</b> find other applications. For example, backbones are often iden-tified during product configuration. Backbones can also improve the efficiency of solving computational problems related with proposi-tional theories. These include model enumeration, minimal model computation and prime implicant computation. This paper investi-gates algorithms for computing backbones of propositional theories, emphasizing the integration of these algorithms with modern SAT solvers. Experimental results, obtained on representative problem in-stances, indicate that the proposed algorithms are effective in practice and can be used for computing the backbones of large propositional theories. In addition, the experimental results indicate that proposi-tional theories can have large backbones, often representing a signif-icant percentage {{of the total number of}} variables. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract New {{approaches}} to antibiotic design are des-perately needed. The design of simple oligomers that capture {{the shape and}} biological function of natural antimicrobial peptides {{could prove to be}} versatile and highly successful. We discuss the use of aromatic <b>back-bones</b> to design facially amphiphilic (FA) b-sheet like structures which are potently antimicrobial. These olig-omers capture the physiochemical properties of peptides like the Magainins and Defensins, which fold into spe-cific conformations that are amphiphilic resulting in antimicrobial activity. However, natural peptides are expensive to prepare and difficult to produce on large scale. The design of polymers and oligomers that mimic the complex structures and remarkable biological properties of proteins is an important endeavor and provides attractive alternatives to the difficult synthesis of natural peptides. We therefore have designed a series of FA oligomers that are easy to prepare from inex-pensive monomers. They adopt structures very remi-niscent of amphiphilic b-sheets and have significant activity with minimal inhibitory concentrations at 6 h in the low microgram per ml range (lM to nM). They are active against a broad spectrum of bacteria including gram-positive and gram-negative as well as antibiotic resistant strains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{piecewise}} linear (“multilinear”) approximation of realistic force-deformation capacity curves is investigated for structural systems incorporating generalized plastic, hard-ening, and negative stiffness behaviors. This fitting process factually links capacity and de-mand and {{lies at the}} core of nonlinear static assessment procedures. Despite codification, the various fitting rules used can produce highly heterogeneous results for the same capacity curve, especially for the highly-curved backbones resulting from the gradual plasticization or the progressive failures of structural elements. To achieve an improved fit, the error intro-duced by the approximation is quantified by studying it at the single-degree-of-freedom level, thus avoiding any issues related to multi- versus single-degree-of-freedom realizations. In-cremental Dynamic Analysis is employed to enable a direct comparison of the actual <b>back-bones</b> versus their candidate {{piecewise linear}} approximations in terms of the spectral acceleration capacity for a continuum of limit-states. In all cases, current code-based proce-dures are found to be highly biased wherever widespread significant stiffness changes occur, generally leading to very conservative estimates of performance. The practical rules deter-mined allow, instead, the definition of standardized low-bias bilinear, trilinear, or quadrilin-ear approximations, regardless of the details of the capacity curve shape. ...|$|R

40|$|The direct {{induction}} of cell death, or apoptosis, in target {{cells is}} one of the effector mecha-nisms for the anti CD 20 antibody Rituximab. Here we provide evidence that Rituximab’s apoptotic ability is linked to the antibody IgG isotype. Reformatting Rituximab from the stan-dard human IgG 1 heavy chain into IgG 2 or IgG 4 boosted in vitro apoptosis induction in the Burkitt’s lymphoma B cell line Ramos five and four-fold respectively. The determinants for this behavior are located in the hinge region and CH 1 domain of the heavy chain. By trans-planting individual IgG 2 or IgG 4 specific amino acid residues onto otherwise IgG 1 like <b>back-bones,</b> thereby creating hybrid antibodies, the same enhancement of apoptosis induction could be achieved. The cysteines at position 131 of the CH 1 domain and 219 in the hinge region, involved in IgG 2 and IgG 4 disulfide formation, were found to be of particular struc-tural importance.

40|$|Separation {{selectivity}} in electrokinetic chromatography (EKC) {{is directly}} affected by the chemistry and solvent characteristics of the pseudostationary phase (PSP). The chemical selectivity of micellar PSPs has been previously demonstrated to vary significantly between anionic and cationic surfactants {{as well as between}} hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants. Polymeric PSPs have also been demonstrated to provide unique selectivity. In the current study, four cationic polymeric pseudo-stationary phases, two of which have perfluorinated pendant groups, are introduced and characterized as PSPs in EKC. Their performance and selectivity is compared to conventional micellar PSPs with similar structure. The solvation characteristics and selectivity of the four polymers most closely resemble those observed for cationic micelles. The polymers are all more cohesive and more polar than their hydrocarbon micellar counterparts. The fluorocarbon PSPs did show preferential interaction with fluorocarbon solutes, were somewhat more cohesive, and were stronger hydrogen bond donors. However, the presence of fluorocarbon moieties did not have as dramatic an effect on selectivity as was observed and published previously for fluorocarbon micelles. This may result from the selectivity being dominated by the presence of the cationic head groups or from the fluorocarbon character of the pendant groups being moderated by the presence of hydrocarbon functionality on the polymer <b>back-bones.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier B.

The hydrophobic polymer <b>back-bones</b> which may be perfluorinated as in case of Nafion-type molecules or aromatic as in case of multi-block copolymers provide mechanical stabilization. Consequently, the membrane properties at or close to the surface may differ from the bulk of the membrane and its structure and conductivity are crucial as interface between membrane and electrode/catalyst.
