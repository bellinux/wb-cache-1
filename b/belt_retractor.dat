40|$|Pre-crash systems (PCSs) use {{environment}} and vehicle dynamics sensors {{to improve the}} effectiveness of passive safety devices by activating them before a collision occurs. The autonomous character of these intelligent vehicle systems, required to anticipate dangerous traffic situations, {{as well as the}} combination of new hardware and software technologies make the design extremely complex. This paper presents an evaluation of a PCS using the VEhicle Hardware-In-the-Loop (VEHIL) test facility. The prototype system utilizes a longrange forward-looking, installed for adaptive cruise control systems, for activation of a reversible <b>belt</b> <b>retractor.</b> The VEHIL laboratory enables testing of intelligent vehicle systems in a hardware-in-theloop environment, where only the relative motion between host and target vehicle is reproduced. The accuracy of VEHIL test setup made sensor validation and control system testing much easier and more flexible. It appeared to be useful for finetuning sensor post-processing algorithms, path prediction algorithms, and activation times. In addition, the radar system is modeled with the PRESCAN simulation tool, which enables simulation of environment sensors in a virtual environment. The simulated sensor output can be used for development of sensor post-processing, sensor fusion and control algorithms.

40|$|Objective: Run-off-road events occur {{frequently}} and {{can result in}} severe consequences. Several potential injury-causing mechanisms {{can be observed in}} the diverse types of run-off-road events. Real-world data show that different types of environments, such as rough terrain, ditch types, and whether multiple events occur, may be important contributing factors to occupant injury. Though countermeasures addressing front seat occupants have been presented, studies on rear seat occupant retention in situations such as run-off-road events are lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the seat belt pre-pretensioner effect on rear-seated child-sized anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) during 2 different types of run-off-road events. Methods: The study was carried out using 2 test setups: a rig test with a vehicle rear seat mounted on a multi-axial robot simulating a road departure event into a side ditch and an in-vehicle test setup with a Volvo XC 60 entering a side ditch with a grass slope, driving inside the ditch, and returning back to the road from the ditch. Potential subsequent rollovers or impacts were not included in the test setups. Three different ATDs were used. The Q 6 and Q 10 were seated on an integrated booster cushion and the Hybrid III (HIII) 5 th percentile female was positioned directly on the seat. The seat <b>belt</b> <b>retractor</b> was equipped with a pre-pretensioner (electrical reversible retractor) with 3 force level settings. In addition, reference tests with the pre-pretensioner inactivated were run. Kinematics and the shoulder belt position were analyzed. Results: In rig tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to rapid inboard lateral loads relative to the vehicle. The displacement for each ATD was reduced when the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests when it was inactivated. Maximum inboard displacement occurred earlier in the event for all ATDs when the pre-pretensioner was activated. Shoulder belt slip-off occurred for the Q 6 and Q 10 in tests where the pre-pretensioner was inactivated. During in-vehicle tests, the left-seated ATD was exposed to an inboard movement when entering the road again after driving in the ditch. The maximum inboard head displacement was reduced in tests where the pre-pretensioner was activated compared to tests in which it was inactivated. Conclusions: During both test setups, the activation of the pre-pretensioner resulted in reduced lateral excursion of the Q 6, Q 10, and HIII 5 th percentile female due to the shoulder belt remaining on the shoulder and supporting the side of the lower torso. The results provide new insights into the potential benefits of using a pre-pretensioner to reduce kinematic responses during complex run-off-road events through supporting the seat belt to remain on the shoulder. This study addresses potential countermeasures to improve real-world protection of rear-seated children, and it provides a broader perspective including the influence of precrash kinematics...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify kinematic behavior and muscle activation in simulated steering tests in several realistic conditions. In total 108 tests were performed with 10 volunteers undergoing purely lateral maneuvers at 5 m/s 2 deceleration or simulated lane change maneuvers at 5 m/s 2 peak acceleration and peak yaw velocity of 25 °/s. Test subjects were seated on a rigid seat and restrained by a 4 -point <b>belt</b> with <b>retractor.</b> Driver subjects were instructed to be relaxed or braced and to hold the steering wheel while passenger subjects were instructed to put their hands on their thighs. Subjects were instrumented with photo markers that were tracked with 3 D high-speed stereo cameras and with electromyography (EMG) electrodes on 8 muscles. Corridors of head displacement, pitch and roll and displacement of T 1, shoulder, elbow, hand and knee were created representing mean response and standard deviation of all subjects. In lane change tests for the passenger configuration significant differences were observed in mean peak of head left lateral displacement between the relaxed and the braced volunteers, i. e. 171 mm (σ= 58, n= 21) versus 121 mm (σ= 46, n= 17), respectively. Sitting in a relaxed position led to significantly lower muscle activity of the neck muscles.

40|$|This {{research}} extends {{topology optimization}} techniques to consider multibody dynamics systems {{with a much}} more open design space, which can include passive, active, and reactive components, with a special application focus on a gunner restraint system (GRS) design problem. General representative models for the multi-functional components are established in a multibody dynamics system. The topology optimization process has been advanced for the optimization of geometrically nonlinear, time-dependent, and timing-dependent multibody dynamics systems undergoing large nonlinear displacements with nonlinear dynamics responses as design objectives. Three efficient sensitivity analysis methods have been proposed, which include the constant dynamic loading method, the time integration incorporated method based on the Generalized-Alpha algorithm and the iterative method. These new methods {{have made it possible}} to calculate the sensitivities in complicated multibody dynamic systems and provide users with choices to significantly reduce the computational costs, especially, in the topology optimization process, and to obtain desired accuracy in the sensitivity analysis. In addition to the sensitivity analysis methods, an efficient and reliable Kriging variable screening method based on the REML criterion has been developed to identify significant variables in the systems to determine the worst cases for various system uncertainty studies. A specific application of the multi-functional components system optimization technology is the GRS design problem, in which both the vehicle and the gunner can undergo large relative and absolute motions under various driving or threat conditions. In meanwhile, the restraint components may need to allow amplitude-dependent, time-dependent, timing-dependent nonlinear response behaviors, such as those seeing in restraint <b>belts,</b> airbags, and <b>retractors.</b> The restraint system layout design needs to keep a wide open design space, thus to find the truly optimal design. The developed methodologies have been employed in the GRS design problems to demonstrate usage of the new methodologies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{restrained}} occupants over the age of 50 in frontal crashes have a higher risk of injury in the rear seat than in the front, and have hypothesized that the incorporation of technology such as belt pre-tensioning and force limiting preferentially in the front seat is at least partially responsible for this trend. This study investigates the potential benefits and trade-offs of seat belt pretensioners and force-limiters in the rear seat using a series of frontal impact sled tests at two speeds (48 km/h and 29 km/h ΔV) with a buck representing the interior of the reat seat occupant compartment of a contemporary mid-sized sedan. Four different dummies were tested: the Hybrid III six year old (in a booster seat, H 3 6 YO), the Hybrid III 5 th percentile female (H 3 AF 05), the Hybrid III 50 th percentile male (H 3 AM 50), and the THOR-NT. The restraints consisted of either a standard three point belt, or a 3 -point <b>belt</b> with a <b>retractor</b> pretensioner and a progressive force-limiter (FL+PT). Each test condition was repeated in triplicate. The FL+PT restraints (compared to the standard restraints) resulted in a significant (p≤ 0. 05) decrease in peak internal chest deflection for each of the Hybrid III dummies at both test speeds (48 km/h: 29 % decrease for H 3 6 YO, 38 % decrease for H 3 AF 05, 30 % decrease for H 3 AM 50), and for the THOR-NT at a ΔV of 29 km/h. At 48 km/h, the FL+PT restraint qualitatively decreased the average peak internal chest deflection of the THOR-NT, however this decrease was not statistically significant (p= 0. 06). Furthermore, the FL+PT system allowed little or no increase in forward head excursion, and improved whole-body kinematics for all dummies by restricting pelvic excursion and slightly increasing torso pitch. The results suggest that the FL+PT system studied here may provide injury-reducing benefit to rear seat occupants in moderate to high severity frontal crashes, although more study is needed to evaluate these restraints in other crash scenarios...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to validate a mathematical simulation model of the Q 3 ATD in an integrated forward-facing booster-type restraint in the rear seat and to evaluate restraint parameters to further develop design guidelines for this type of restraint system for forward facing children corresponding {{to the size of the}} Q 3. Only frontal impact was considered. Methods: The software MADYMO was used to create and run the model of the restraint system and model of the child. The restraint system consisted of a seat and a safety belt. The child dummy model was the Q 3. The complete model was validated to sled tests on 12 response signals: displacements of the dummy model, safety belt forces, and dummy model accelerations. The method used in the evaluation of the restraint parameters was a factorial design of experiments (DOE). The study included a total of 9 parameters: 6 related to the safety belt, such as pretensioner, load limiter, and belt anchor positions; two parameters related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters were evaluated based on their effect on a number of dummy model responses. Results: The validation study showed that the mathematical model predicted the ATD's kinematics and measurements. Furthermore, the parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy model responses were the lap belt angle, the D-ring x and y positions (upper <b>belt</b> anchor), the <b>retractor</b> pretensioner, and the retractor load limiter. The lap belt angle had the greatest effects of all parameters. The resulting head x displacement was 7. 8 cm shorter with a lap belt angle of 24 degrees to the horizontal, compared to a 73 degrees to the horizontal lap belt angle; it also resulted in a reduction of the head resultant acceleration by 9. 8 g. Conclusions: In order to decrease the Q 3 ATD head, chest and pelvis accelerations and to limit the Q 3 ATD head displacement, the following practices are recommended: first, position the D-ring rearward of the ATD so that the belt encloses the ATD's shoulder; second, position the lap belt anchors to make the lap belt angle 24 degrees to the horizontal, but make sure submarining is not induced; and finally, use a safety belt with pretensioner and load limiter functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes, and any specific settings have to be evaluated further before introduction into vehicles. </p...|$|R
40|$|Traffic related {{trauma is}} {{the main cause of}} child {{fatality}} and injury in Europe and North America, with the large majority of fatalities and injuries occurring to children in cars. Specifically, head injury is a common outcome in injury causing car accidents. Furthermore, injury statistics show that the injury rate increases at the graduation from one type of restraint system to another. In Sweden, the graduation from a rear facing restraint to the forward facing booster child restraint has been identified as the first critical graduation. It occurs as the children reach the approximate weight of 18 kg. This size is similar to the anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) that correspond to 3 -year-old children, and the two with most measurement capabilities are the HIII 3 YO and the Q 3. These ATDs are used in order to improve restraint systems for children, and they need to emulate real child crash behaviour adequately in order to properly inform proposals for improvements. The Q 3 is the newest and it is under consideration to be included in European requirements. Thus, both further improvements of the restraint systems for 3 -year-old children and additional evaluation of the Q 3 are needed. Therefore, this thesis presents two studies: one that investigates which restraint system characteristics are beneficial for forward facing 3 -year-olds in frontal crashes; the other study evaluates the head kinematics of the Q 3 math model and a modified version of it, by comparing the math models’ responses to the assumed kinematics of 3 -year-old children in real accidents. The restraint system study was done through mathematical simulations with the MADYMO model of the Q 3 ATD. Nine parameters were studied: six related to the seat belt (such as pretensioner, load limiter and belt anchor positions); two parameters were related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy responses were: <b>belt</b> anchor positions, <b>retractor</b> pretensioner and retractor load limiter. The conclusions were that: the upper belt anchor should be positioned rearward of the dummy so that the belt encloses the dummy’s shoulder; the lap belt anchors should be positioned to make the lap belt angle as horizontal as possible without inducing submarining; and the seat belt should have pretensioner and load limiter functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes and ages before implementation into any vehicle. In the second study, the Q 3 math model and the modified Q 3 math model head kinematics were evaluated through mathematical reconstructions of real accidents. Head x, y and z displacements were compared with the assumed displacements {{of the children in the}} accidents, and differences were identified. The modifications to the Q 3 math model consisted of an increase in the bend and twist flexibility of the thorax, and an update of some anthropometric measures to new data of weights and lengths of body parts. The simulation results showed that in straight frontal crashes, the Q 3 math model predicted the head displacement adequately. In oblique frontal crashes, the rigid torso of the Q 3 math model appeared to obstruct the expected head displacements. The modified version correlated better to the assumed head kinematics of the children in the oblique frontal crashes. Its performance in straight frontal crashes was adequate. Future updates of the Q 3 ATD and math model should include consideration of these findings. Finally, despite the identified lacks of the Q 3 math model, the findings of the second study do not alter the conclusions of the first study; the results are valid also for the modified Q 3 math model. The two studies are thus important contributions to the continuous work of mitigating traffic accident induced injury and fatality to children...|$|R
