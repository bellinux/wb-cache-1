25|$|A year {{afterwards}} his situation, {{which had}} {{for some time}} been decidedly flourishing, showed signs of changing {{very much for the}} worse. The duchess of Orléans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling it to pay debts. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power and of high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs thenceforward; and could devote himself to his two different lines of poetry, as well as to that of theatrical composition.|$|E
500|$|After Wiggins died, several {{well-known}} baseball figures {{commented on}} his death. Longtime Oriole Frank Robinson said, [...] "He {{was a very}} bright individual, and you could like the guy. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> something there to back you off." [...] Former Padres player Garry Templeton said {{that he might have}} been Wiggins' closest friend, but he said {{that he did not know}} that Wiggins had been ill.|$|E
500|$|The England {{team had}} a {{different}} look, with four changes to the team. 36-year-old Essex off-spinner John Childs made his debut, the oldest England debutant for 40 years. Childs joined the recalled Gatting and DeFreitas, and newcomer David Capel. Small and Paul Jarvis were both left out due to injury, and Derek Pringle was dropped, but the most media attention focused on Chris Broad, who was also dropped, [...] "ostensibly for his consistent failure to make runs in home Tests, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a suspicion {{that he was being}} disciplined for the incident at Lord's when he was spotted by a television camera mouthing his disappointment at an lbw decision".|$|E

500|$|The Suns showbiz editor Dominic Mohan {{recalled}} of the period: [...] "We {{had quite}} a few Oasis contacts on the payroll. I don't know whether any were drug dealers, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a few dodgy characters about." [...] Oasis's official photographer Jill Furmanovsky felt the media's focus, and was preyed upon by tabloid journalists living in the flat upstairs from her: [...] "They thought I had the band hiding in my flat." [...] In paranoia, Oasis cut themselves off from their wider circle. According to Johnny Hopkins, the publicist of Oasis's label Creation Records, [...] "People were being edged out of the circle around Oasis. People who knew them before they were famous rather than because they were famous." [...] Hopkins likened the situation to a medieval court, complete with kings, courtiers and jesters. As he explained, [...] "nce you're in that situation you lose sight of reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neil Diamond's {{liner notes}} ("...tin pan alley died hard, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> {{the music to}} keep you going...") {{indicate}} that the album Beautiful Noise (1976) {{was intended as a}} tribute to his days there.|$|E
2500|$|At each crisis, {{with every}} {{incident}} of the slightest importance, the mob would go wild, {{setting fire to}} Jewish shops. This even happened during the Yom Kippur War. Tunisia's President, Habib Bourguiba, has in all probability never been hostile to the Jews, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> that notorious [...] "delay", which meant that the police {{arrived on the scene}} only after the shops had been pillaged and burnt. Is it any wonder that the exodus to France and Israel continued and even increased? ...|$|E

2500|$|Stuart Goddard {{was born}} {{an only child}} in Marylebone, London to Leslie Goddard and Betty Kathleen Smith. [...] Home was two rooms in De Walden buildings, St John's Wood. He recalls: [...] "There was no luxury, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> food on the table." [...] His father {{had served in the}} Royal Air Force and worked as a chauffeur, and his mother was an {{embroiderer}} for Norman Hartnell. He is of partial Romani descent; his maternal grandfather, Walter Albany Smith, was Romanichal. This heritage would become a basis for a theme in his later work: a concern for oppressed minorities.|$|E
2500|$|Johny Loftus of {{the website}} Allmusic graded the album with {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He said that the album [...] "reasserts Amy Lee's {{position}} at Evanescence's center. Throughout the band's rise, there was the drama... <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> the singular force of Lee, whose powerful vocals, strident public persona, and striking fashion sense broke down the doors of the alternative metal boys club." [...] He finished his review by saying, [...] "Appropriately, Lee is the star of Anywhere but Home. Her voice has an impressively raw quality live, and her banter with the fawning Parisian crowd is always engaging." [...] Geoff Barton of the magazine Classic Rock graded Anywhere but Home with four out of five stars.|$|E
2500|$|After the Russian civil war, {{thousands}} of Russians fled to Manchuria {{to join the}} Russian community already there. The Russians living in Manchuria were stateless and as whites had an ambiguous status in Manchukuo, which {{was meant to be}} a Pan-Asian state, whose official [...] "five races" [...] were the Chinese, Mongols, Manchus, Koreans and Japanese. At various times, the Japanese suggested that the Russians might be a [...] "sixth race" [...] of Manchukuo, but this was never officially declared. In 1936, the Manchukuo Almanac reported that were 33, 592 Russians living in the city of Harbin-the [...] "Moscow of the Orient"-and of whom only 5, 580 had been granted Manchukuo citizenship. Japanese imperialism was to a certain extent based on racism with the Japanese as the [...] "great Yamato race", <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> a certain dichotomy in Japanese thinking between an ideology based on racial differences based on bloodlines vs. the idea of Pan-Asianism with Japan as the natural leader of all the Asian peoples. Regardless, the Russians tended not to fit very well into Japan's project in Manchukuo.|$|E

6000|$|... "Surely it {{is obvious}} enough," [...] he answered. [...] "The man Parkins, whom you told me was dead, is alive and in Leeds.

60|$|The face of Father Brown was commonplace, but curiously contented; {{it could}} shine with ignorance {{as well as}} with knowledge. <b>But</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> one flash when the foolish mask fell, and the wise mask fitted itself in its place; and Flambeau, who knew his friend, knew that his friend had {{suddenly}} understood.
