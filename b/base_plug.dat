40|$|In {{this case}} report a {{surgical}} technique for vertical ridge augmentation is presented. The procedure, {{performed in a}} 30 -year-old woman with an atrophied alveolar ridge in the anterior portion of the mandible, {{is based on the}} biologic concept of osteogenesis distraction previously introduced in orthopedic and maxillofacial surgery After elevation of a full-thickness flap a horizontal osteotomy was performed 7 to 8 mm {{from the top of the}} ridge. Two vertical osteotomies were prepared with drills of increasing diameter (2, 2. 8, and 3. 25 mm), tapping was performed for the first 5 to 6 mm, and two distractor <b>base</b> <b>plugs</b> were placed at the base of the osteotomies with a repositioning tool. An intraosseous distraction implant was then inserted and 2 inward vertical cuts were made in the bone to allow proper distraction to fake place. Correct functioning of the device was checked by distracting the bone fragment 7 mm using the axial distraction screw A latency distraction healing screw was inserted in each of the distraction implants and the area was left to heal for 5 days. Once primary healing had occurred, the distraction of the newly formed bone callus was activated each day for 10 days (1 mm per day). At the end of the distraction period a final distraction screw was left in place and a final healing screw was inserted. During this time there were no complications and the patient on no occasion complained of discomfort. The distractor device was removed 30 days later leaving the <b>base</b> <b>plugs</b> in place. One month later a vertical augmentation of 7 mm had been achieved; the <b>base</b> <b>plugs</b> were removed, 3 intraosseous implants were inserted, and a biopsy of the newly formed tissue was obtained. Histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimen showed woven bone formation approximately 75 days after the initial procedure...|$|R

The greenhouse medium had higher germination rates than the lightweight aggregate medium. The control, fertilizer, and double fertilizer, which were not applied until a month into the study, provided similar germination results. The seedlings obtained from the germination study were grown into 3. 81 cm x 7. 62 cm plugs, with plant height, leaf count/width, and dry weight taken three months later. The greenhouse medium treatments control, fertilizer, and double fertilizer had the most leaves, and provided the tallest and widest leaves {{as well as the}} greatest biomass. The lightweight aggregate medium control displayed the lowest growth in this study. The fertility treatment that showed the most potential was the green roof mix.

5000|$|The M30 is the {{practice}} {{version of the}} M26 grenade. It had a cast-iron two-piece oval body with a plastic <b>base</b> <b>plug.</b> The body was embossed with the symbols [...] "RFX55"; it was originally the basis for an experimental hand grenade that was never put into production. It had a filler of 21 grains of black powder and used the M10A3/M10A4 or M204A1/M204A2 series of fuzes. Its body is painted light blue with a brown band across the middle. When the grenade detonated, the overpressure made the plug pop out and released a plume of black smoke caused by the burnt filler.|$|E
50|$|The Mills bomb {{underwent}} numerous modifications. The No. 23 was {{a variant}} of the No. 5 with a rodded <b>base</b> <b>plug</b> which allowed it to be fired from a rifle. This concept evolved further with the No. 36, a variant with a detachable base plate to allow use with a rifle discharger cup. The final variation of the Mills bomb, the No. 36M, was specially designed and waterproofed with shellac for use initially in the hot climate of Mesopotamia in 1917, and remained in production for many years. By 1918, the No. 5 and No. 23 were declared obsolete and the No. 36 (but not the 36M) followed in 1932.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} {{elements of}} tubes {{have always been}} connected to external circuitry via pins at their <b>base</b> which <b>plug</b> into a socket. Subminiature tubes were produced using wire leads rather than sockets, however these were restricted to rather specialized applications.

5000|$|The mine is {{triggered}} by the tilting of the prongs situated {{on top of the}} mine. This is caused by either direct pressure on the prongs or by tension on a tripwire attached to them. Tilting the prongs allows three striker retaining balls to escape. This releases the spring-loaded striker, which is flipped downwards into the percussion cap and fires the three gram propellant charge. The explosion of the propellant charge forces the upper half of the mine body out of the ground and up into the air, shearing off several brass screws and leaving the <b>base</b> <b>plug</b> of the mine behind in the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{purposes}} of the sample assembly (Fig. 2) are to transmit hydrostatic pressure to the sample from the compressing piston, to provide controlled heating of the sample and to provide, via the capsule, a suitable volatile and oxygen fugacity environment for the experiment. Therefore, it includes a component {{for each of these}} purposes.The outer cylinder is a pressure transmitting, electrically insulating cylinder made from NaCl, talc, BaCO3, KBr, CaF2, or even borosilicate glass. The next components are, in order, an electrically insulating borosilicate glass cylinder and a graphite cylinder, which acts as the “furnace”. To locate the sample exactly in the centre of the furnace and to grip the thermocouple, a support rod usually made of crushable ceramics is used. The final component is a conductive steel <b>base</b> <b>plug,</b> located {{at the top of the}} sample assembly.The final part of the assembly is the thermocouple itself, whose wires are insulated from one another and from the material of the assembly by a tube made of mullite.|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{inspired}} by the project funded by Bureau of Safety and Environment Enforcement (BSEE) to study the use of epoxy (or any cement alternative) to plug offshore wells damaged by hurricanes. The project focuses on non-cement materials to plug wells that are either destroyed or damaged to an extent where vertical intervention from the original wellhead is no longer possible. The proposed solution to this problem was to drill an offset well and intersect the original borehole at the very top and spot epoxy (or any suitable non-cement plugging material) in the original well. The spotted epoxy then would fall by gravitational force {{all the way down to}} the packer and then settle on top of the packer to plug the annulus of the damaged well permanently. This thesis mainly concentrates on the factors affecting the fall rates and how to correlate them in order to derive an applicable test that can be conducted on the field or lab to calculate the terminal velocity of the known epoxy composition. Determining the settling velocity of the epoxy is crucial due to the fact that epoxy should not set prematurely for a better seal and isolation. The terminal velocity and the recovery for epoxy <b>based</b> <b>plugging</b> fluids were tested by using an experimental setup that was developed for this purpose. The results were also validated by using an alternative experiment setup designed for this purpose. Factors affecting the terminal velocity and recovery of epoxy were studied in this research since the settling velocity of the epoxy is crucial because epoxy should not set prematurely for a better seal and isolation. The study was conducted by using an experiment setup that was specially developed for terminal velocity and recovery calculations for plugging fluids. Results obtained from the experiment setup were successfully correlated to epoxy's composition for estimating the terminal velocity of the mixture...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{activate}} the M14, the <b>base</b> <b>plug</b> is removed and discarded and an M46 stab detonator is screwed into {{the base of the}} mine.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is to investigate the slipstream effects on the flow properties and thrust performances of a full-length and truncated annular plug nozzle of a small rocket launcher during a suborbital flight. The nozzle flow properties are investigated for three characteristics flow conditions (M∞ = 1. 3, 2. 59 and 9. 7), using CFD simulations. When the rocket launcher flies through the atmosphere, the body geometry produces a slipstream with conditions in the nozzle area that {{are different from the}} undisturbed environment. The in-flight behavior of the truncated plug nozzles is complicated and affected also by recirculation regions that take place behind the shroud and <b>plug</b> <b>base.</b> In this paper special emphasis is given to investigate the slipstream effects between the hot exhaust plume from the rocket engine and the external coaxial supersonic/hypersonic air flow and their influence on the slope and position of different shocks generated in the separated flow region (realignment shocks, recompression shocks, <b>plug</b> <b>base</b> lip shock and trailing shocks). Also analyzed is the pressure distribution on the shroud base, spike supersonic ramp and spike base for closed-wake operations to determine the overall engine performance.

40|$|Abstract—A {{concept for}} a generic voice <b>based</b> Universal <b>Plug</b> and Play (UPnP) control point (client) is {{presented}} in this paper which can be used to operate services on remote devices. Generic control points are a powerful alternative to special control points which are tailored to their special purposes. By using such a generic control point it is possible to control each UPnP device via voice without the need of manual adaptations. Starting from the analysis of the UPnP Device Architecture (UDA) and examination of the possibilities of voice supporting technologies we will show the feasibility of a generic voice based UPnP control point realization. The generic user interface is based on the standardized UPnP device and service description. Two different architectures will be introduced (coupled and decoupled solution) and their advantages, disadvantages and application will be discussed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that voice based configuration increases the user friendliness of operating a control point.
