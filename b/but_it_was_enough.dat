Chicago could only gain 14yards on their ensuing possession, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Robbie Gould to make a 44-yard field goal, cutting the score to 22–17.|$|E
5|$|Keith Miller {{was called}} to South Africa as {{emergency}} cover, but luckily for the Australias, there were almost two months of warm-up matches before the Tests started. Johnston recovered {{in time for the}} final tour match before the Tests, a match against a South African XI, effectively a full-strength Test team. Johnston took 2/81 in his only innings <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for captain Lindsay Hassett to put him in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|After graduating a Bachelor of Arts, Tarr was {{articled}} to the solicitors firm of Owston, Dickinson, Simpson, and Bigg in Leicester, {{and also}} joined the Leicester Tigers, {{then as now}} {{considered one of the}} strongest clubs in the country. He scored 72 points in 94 appearances. In 1913, having been dropped by England four years earlier, he was surprised to be called up again to play Scotland on 15 March at Twickenham. Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E

5|$|The first innings set {{the pattern}} of the series as the England top-order {{struggled}} against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Miller to bowl Hutton. During the interval, heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption. Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall. At 15/2, Compton came in, and together with Edrich, they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring, leaving England at 46/4. Two runs later, Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board. Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again. Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74, England only had two wickets left. Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Both fell within two runs, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63. Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch.|$|E

25|$|Eager {{not to miss}} Football League fixtures, and {{not to have a}} {{difficult}} trip again, the club chartered a British European Airways plane from Manchester to Belgrade for the away leg against Red Star.

25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, McNair led the Titans on a 70-yard scoring drive, {{completing}} five consecutive passes for 59 yards and capping it off with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Mason. The rest {{of the third quarter}} was scoreless, but midway through the fourth quarter, Troy Brown's 10-yard punt return gave the Patriots great field position at the Titans 40-yard line. The Patriots gained only 13 yards on their ensuing possession (including a critical 4-yard completion from Brady to Brown on fourth down and 3), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Vinatieri to make a 46-yard field goal, giving New England a 17–14 lead with 4:02 left in regulation.|$|E

On the Oilers first play, Moon handed the ball off to Lorenzo White, who was quickly leveled by Woodson and defensive end Tim Johnson, causing a fumble that Woodson recovered and returned four yards to the Oilers 46. From there, Pittsburgh could gain just 13 yards with a few Hoge carries before facing a fourth down. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Anderson to kick a 50-yard field goal, his longest attempt of the season, which he sent perfectly through the uprights to give the Steelers the win.|$|E

She then took a wicket in each of the next two matches before {{claiming}} 2/30 and scoring 13 as New South Wales took a hard-fought two-wicket win over Queensland. She ended the eight-match season with eight wickets at 23.87 and an economy rate of 3.35 and scored 50 runs at 8.33. After winning their first seven matches, New South Wales lost the last match against Western Australia, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for them to qualify first to host the final. The decider against South Australia was abandoned due to rain and New South Wales were awarded the title for qualifying first.

25|$|The Army of the Rhine {{was formed}} on 5 July 1799 by Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, {{who was the}} Minister of War. The army was {{responsible}} for an area along the Rhine River from Neuf-Brisach on the south to Düsseldorf on the north, including the fortresses of Breisach, Kehl, Strasbourg, Landau, Mannheim, Mainz, Ehrenbreitstein and Luxembourg. The French reported {{the strength of the}} army as 40,000 to 60,000 men, but this was a ruse to trick the Austrians. In fact, much of the army's strength was tied up in garrisons and {{it is unlikely that the}} number of troops available for field operations exceeded 18,000. The purpose of the Army of the Rhine was to lure the Austrian army away from Masséna. This could be achieved by menacing Archduke Charles' supply line, which ran northeast from Switzerland to Ulm on the Danube River. The army was too weak to fight the Austrians in a pitched battle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> of a threat that it could not be ignored.|$|E
25|$|The team limped home on August 2 to open {{a four-game}} home stand against the Padres. In the opener, Hiroki Kuroda {{struggled}} as the Dodgers losing streak hit six with a 10–5 loss. Matt Kemp had four hits in four at-bats in the game. The Dodgers finally snapped the losing streak the next night as Ted Lilly made an impressive Dodgers debut. Lilly retired 20 straight after allowing a 1st-inning home run to Miguel Tejada. A two-run double by Russell Martin in the 2nd inning was all the offense the Dodgers could muster <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> {{to pick up a}} 2–1 victory. The victory did not come without a cost however, as Martin suffered a season-ending injury when he tore the labrum in his right knee during a collision at home plate. With backup catcher Brad Ausmus in the lineup, the Dodgers picked up a 9–0 victory on August 4. Vicente Padilla took a no-hitter into the seventh inning and pitched a complete game, two-hit shutout. The following day, the offense once more went into hibernation as the Dodgers dropped the series finale, 5–0. In the opener of a three-game series against the Washington Nationals, Kershaw struck out nine but allowed two three-run homers to Adam Dunn and the Dodgers lost 6–3. The Dodgers won the following day, on a walk-off single by James Loney in the 10th for a 3–2 victory. The Dodgers concluded the home stand with an 8–3 Sunday afternoon win over the Nationals, handing Ted Lilly his second victory since joining the Dodgers.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers next {{traveled}} to Philadelphia for a road {{series against the}} two-time defending National League champion Phillies. In the opener, the Dodgers offense finally came alive, scoring a season-high 15 runs in a 15–9 victory. The game featured the first home run since 2007 by outfielder Jay Gibbons, who was just called up from AAA a few days before. In the second game of the series, the bats were silenced by Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt, who shut the Dodgers down 2–0. In the finale, the Dodgers jumped to a 9–2 lead thanks to 6 quality innings by Clayton Kershaw and a four RBI effort from Matt Kemp. However a poor outing from Ronald Belisario in the eighth cut the lead to 9–6 and then Jonathan Broxton was unable to retire a batter in the ninth as the Phillies stormed back for a 10–9 walk-off victory. Next the Dodgers {{traveled to}} Atlanta for a four-game series against the Braves. In the opener, the Dodgers were shut out for the 14th time in the season, this time by Tim Hudson. Hiroki Kuroda allowed just one run in seven innings (a solo home run by Brooks Conrad), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> as the team lost 1–0. Ted Lilly picked up his third straight win for the Dodgers, as they won the next game 2–1. The Dodgers string of impressive performances from their starting pitchers was ended on August 15, when Vicente Padilla was pounded for eight runs in 4 inning and the Dodgers lost a blow-out 13–1. In the series finale, the Dodgers wasted another gem from Chad Billingsley as the bullpen blew another lead, allowing three runs {{in the ninth inning}} to fall 4–3 as Melky Cabrera hit a two-run bases-loaded walk-off single off Octavio Dotel.|$|E
500|$|The first {{innings of}} the First Test set {{the pattern of}} the series as the England top-order {{struggled}} against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break on the first day due to inclement weather, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> for Miller to bowl Hutton with a faster ball. During the interval, heavy rain fell, making the ball skid through upon resumption. Washbrook was out after the luncheon interval, caught on the run by Brown at fine leg after attempting to hook Lindwall. At 15/2, Compton came to the crease, and together with Edrich, they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter. Two balls later, Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring, caught by Miller in slips, an effort described by Wisden as [...] "dazzling". Two runs later, Compton was bowled attempting a leg sweep from the bowling of Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board. Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again in the match. Johnston bowled Barnett for eight and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74, England was facing the prospect of setting a new record for the lowest Test innings score at Trent Bridge, the current record being 112. Laker and Bedser, both from Surrey, scored more than half of England's total, adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes. Laker's innings was highlighted by hooking, while Bedser defended stoutly and drove in front of the wicket. Bedser was removed by Johnston and Miller had Laker caught behind two runs later, ending England's innings at 165. Laker top-scored with 63 in 101 minutes, with six boundaries. Johnston ended with 5/36, a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing. Miller took 3/38 and a catch.|$|E
