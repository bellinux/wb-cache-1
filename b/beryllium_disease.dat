40|$|International audiencePneumoconioses are {{induced by}} the {{inhalation}} of mineral or metallic dust. The incidence has decreased in the industrialized countries, but these diseases still exist. Diseases diagnosed nowadays may result from exposures that date back several decades. Besides, industry continuously creates new types of exposure and produces novel materials and alloys. Unusual exposures, sometimes in small workshops or in independent workers, may still cause severe diseases. In case of exposure to some metals, like <b>beryllium,</b> <b>diseases</b> may occur in susceptible subjects even at low levels of exposure. Medical and social consequences of misdiagnosis may be important. The diagnostic contribution of high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan is very important, as this technique is sensitive and specific. Pathological, mineralogical, and immunological techniques are useful in the differential diagnosis. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a granulomatous interstitial disease of the lungs due to immune reactions following chronic inhalation of antigens, to which the subject has been previously sensitised. Diagnosis is based on associated clinical and paraclinical signs which are not specific. Clinical approach is essential. It allows to suspect the diagnosis in view of respiratory symptoms, inspiratory crackles and the identification of a hazardous environment. Serological tests, bronchoalveolar lavage and HRCT scan are required to confirm diagnosis. Early removal of exposure prevents the occurrence of chronic respiratory failure.

40|$|Chronic <b>Beryllium</b> (Be) <b>Disease</b> (CBD) is a granulomatous {{disorder}} that predominantly affects the lung. The CBD {{is caused by}} Be exposure of individuals carrying the HLA-DP 2 protein of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). While the involvement of Be {{in the development of}} CBD is obvious and the binding site and the sequence of Be and peptide binding were recently experimentally revealed [1], the interplay between induced conformational changes and the changes of the peptide binding affinity in presence of Be were not investigated. Here we carry out in silico modeling and predict the Be binding to be within the acidic pocket (Glu 26, Glu 68 and Glu 69) present on the HLA-DP 2 protein in accordance with the experimental work [1]. In addition, the modeling indicates that the Be ion binds to the HLA-DP 2 before the corresponding peptide is able to bind to it. Further analysis of the MD generated trajectories reveals that {{in the presence of the}} Be ion in the binding pocket of HLA-DP 2, all the different types of peptides induce very similar conformational changes, but their binding affinities are quite different. Since these conformational changes are distinctly different from the changes caused by peptides normally found in the cell in the absence of Be, it can be speculated that CBD can be caused by any peptide in presence of Be ion. However, the affinities of peptides for Be loaded HLA-DP 2 were found to depend of their amino acid composition and the peptides carrying acidic group at positions 4 and 7 are among the strongest binders. Thus, it is proposed that CBD is caused by the exposure of Be of an individual carrying the HLA-DP 2 * 0201 allele and that the bindin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{describe}} {{the present state of}} knowledge regarding host susceptibility factors that may determine the occurrence, development and severity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) caused by exogenous agents. First, host susceptibility may pertain to differences in the delivery and/or persistence of the noxious agent in the lung. The deposition and clearance of inhaled particles or fibres may vary depending on innate anatomical or physiological characteristics, and on acquired changes, such as nasal disease or smoking-induced alterations. Genetically- or environmentally-induced interindividual differences in the expression of pulmonary biotransformation enzymes may form the basis for, or contribute to the risk of, drug-induced interstitial lung disease. Secondly, there are genetic and acquired variations in various enzymatic and nonenzymatic defence systems that protect cells and tissues against oxidative stress, which is often involved in the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease caused by particles, fibres, metals, organic agents and drugs. Thirdly, the occurrence of immunological sensitization is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors. This has been demonstrated in chronic <b>beryllium</b> lung <b>disease</b> and in hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Fourthly, the propensity of individuals to develop particular types of inflammation, such as granulomas, is probably under genetic control. The regulation and resolution of inflammation and fibrogenesis caused by dust particles are also partly determined by genetic factors, involving cytokine networks and growth factors. In conclusion, although the issue of genetics pervades the entire discussion of host susceptibility, genes are not the only determinants of health and disease. Environmental factors may be equally important in shaping host susceptibility. Therefore, research must be focused on both the genetic bases and the environmental determinants of interstitial lung disease, in order to provide mechanism-based prevention strategies, early detection of, and improved therapy for these condition...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nuclear and {{conventional}} weapons industry workers {{are at risk}} for exposures to beryllium, asbestos, high explosives and barium, all of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis. Beryllium has also been shown to cause sensitization (BeS) carrying a risk of progression to Chronic <b>Beryllium</b> Lung <b>Disease</b> (CBD). Data are lacking on the epidemiology of beryllium related health effects in conventional munitions workers and limited studies have been published on the prevalence of BeS in workers with minimal exposure. Data on the prevalence of pneumoconiosis in nuclear weapons workers is also lacking. The main objectives of this study were to determine prevalence and risk factors for beryllium sensitization in former nuclear {{and conventional}} munitions workers and rates of and risk factors for pneumoconiosis in former nuclear weapons workers, both cohorts from the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAAP) in Burlington, IA. Methods: Former nuclear weapons workers were offered chest x-ray (CXR) and blood screening for sensitization with beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) as part of the Department of Energy (DoE) Former Worker Medical Screening Program. Conventional munitions workers were offered BeLPT and clinical follow-up if sensitized, as part of a Department of Defense (DOD) funded study. Chest x-rays were reviewed by three readers according to the International Labour Organization 2 ̆ 7 s Classification system for Radiographs for Pneumoconioses (ILO system). Exposures under study were characterized qualitatively by the industrial hygiene team and based on former worker interviews and historical industrial hygiene records. Results: The prevalence of beryllium sensitization in nuclear and conventional munitions workers was found to be slightly higher than in other workforces and weapons worker populations at low risk for exposure. The prevalence of parenchymal disease was higher in these nuclear weapons workers than in other DoE studies, while the prevalence of coincident parenchymal and pleural and isolated pleural disease was lower than in other nuclear weapons populations. Workers who occasionally dressed the copper-beryllium alloy tools were found to have an increased risk of beryllium sensitization, compared to those in administrative or other jobs with insignificant potential for exposure on site. Exposure to beryllium, asbestos, high explosives or barium was not associated with lung disease in this population. Conclusions: The findings from this study have potential policy implications for DOE and DOD to extend or implement beryllium surveillance and lung disease screening for their workforces and better control use of the copper-beryllium alloy tools in their production processes...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of {{beryllium}} {{is associated}} with the development of sensitization; however, dermal exposure may also be important. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} elucidate relationships among exposure pathways in four different manufacturing and finishing facilities. Secondary aims were to identify jobs with increased levels of beryllium in air, on skin, and on surfaces; identify potential discrepancies in exposure pathways, and determine if these are related to jobs with previously identified risk. Beryllium was measured in air, on cotton gloves, and on work surfaces. Summary statistics were calculated and correlations among all three measurement types were examined at the facility and job level. Exposure ranking strategies were used to identify jobs with higher exposures. The highest air, glove, and surface measurements were observed in beryllium metal production and beryllium oxide ceramics manufacturing jobs that involved hot processes and handling powders. Two finishing and distribution facilities that handle solid alloy products had lower exposures than the primary production facilities, and there were differences observed among jobs. For all facilities combined, strong correlations were found between air-surface (rp 22 ̆ 0305 0. 77), glove-surface (rp 22 ̆ 0305 0. 76), and air-glove measurements (rp 22 ̆ 0305 0. 69). In jobs where higher risk of <b>beryllium</b> sensitization or <b>disease</b> has been reported, exposure levels for all three measurement types were higher than in jobs with lower risk, though they were not the highest. Some jobs with low air concentrations had higher levels of beryllium on glove and surface wipe samples, suggesting a need to further evaluate the causes of the discrepant levels. Although such correlations provide insight on where beryllium is located throughout the workplace, they cannot identify the direction of the pathways between air, surface, or skin. Ranking strategies helped to identify jobs with the highest combined air, glove, and/or surface exposures. All previously identified high-risk jobs had high air concentrations, dermal mass loading, or both, and none had low dermal and air. We have found that both pathways are relevant.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} relative hazards in {{sectors of}} the beryllium industry, risk factors of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> and sensitisation related to work process were sought in a beryllium manufacturing plant producing pure metal, oxide, alloys, and ceramics. METHODS: All 646 active employees were interviewed; beryllium sensitisation was ascertained with the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation blood test on 627 employees; clinical evaluation and bronchoscopy were offered to people with abnormal test results; and industrial hygiene measurements related to work processes taken in 1984 - 93 were reviewed. RESULTS: 59 employees (9. 4 %) had abnormal blood tests, 47 of whom underwent bronchoscopy. 24 new cases of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> were identified, resulting in a <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> prevalence of 4. 6 %, including five known cases (29 / 632). Employees who had worked in ceramics had the highest prevalence of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> (9. 0 %). Employees in the pebble plant (producing beryllium metal) who had been employed after 1983 also had increased risk, with a prevalence of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> of 6. 4 %, compared with 1. 3 % of other workers hired in the same period, and a prevalence of abnormal blood tests of 19. 2 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} of features of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> to the estimated exposure to beryllium {{has been investigated}} over a 30 -year period at a factory manufacturing beryllium products. The factory opened in 1952. Of the 146 men who had worked there {{for more than six}} months up to 1963, 89 % were seen at that time and were followed up in 1973. The nine who continued to work in the factory and those who were engaged subsequently were examined in 1977. On each occasion a clinical interview, occupational history, chest radiograph, and assessment of lung function were carried out. The findings of the main survey were related to the beryllium content of the dust measured by mass spectrometry for 1952 - 60 when over 3000 determinations were made. In no part of the plant did the estimated average daily exposure exceed 2 μg m- 3, and only 9 % of individual determinations exceeded this level. Twenty determinations exceeded 25 μg m- 3. During the period under review, four men developed the clinical, radiographic, and physiological features of <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease.</b> Two men acquired abnormal chest radiographs consistent with <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> but without other features, and one developed probable <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> despite the diagnosis not being confirmed at necropsy.

In six the changes developed after exposure had ceased; trigger factors including patch testing may have contributed to their illness. Seventeen men recalled episodes of brief exposure to high concentrations of dust, two developed pneumonitis from which they recovered completely, and one developed chronic <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> after a further 23 years' exposure.

Forty-four (7. 6 %) individuals had definite or probable chronic <b>beryllium</b> <b>disease</b> (CBD), and another 40 (7. 0 %) were sensitized to beryllium. The prevalence of CBD and sensitization in our cohort was greater than the prevalence reported in studies of other beryllium-exposed cohorts. Various exposure measures evaluated included duration; first decade worked; last decade worked; cumulative, mean, and highest job; and highest task exposure to beryllium (to both soluble and nonsoluble forms). Soluble cumulative and mean exposure levels were lower in individuals with CBD. Sensitized individuals had shorter duration of exposure, began work later, last worked longer ago, and had lower cumulative and peak exposures and lower nonsoluble cumulative and mean exposures. A possible explanation for the exposure–response findings of our study may be an interaction betwee...|$|E
