40|$|Biofouling is a {{significant}} economic problem, particularly for marine and offshore oil industries. The acorn barnacle (Amphibalanus (Balanus) amphitrite) is the main <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> in marine environments. Environmental conditions, the physiology of the <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism,</b> the surrounding microbial community, and {{the properties of the}} substratum can all influence the attachment of biofouling organisms to substrates. My dissertation investigated the biological processes involved in B. amphitrite development and attachment in the unique environment of the Red Sea, where the average water surface temperature is 34 °C and the salinity reaches 41 ‰. I profiled the transcriptome and proteome of B. amphitrite at different life stages (nauplius II, nauplius VI, and cyprid) and identified 65, 784 expressed contigs and 1387 expressed proteins by quantitative proteomics. During the planktonic stage, genes related to osmotic stress, salt stress, the hyperosmotic response, and the Wnt signaling pathway were strongly up-regulated, hereas genes related to the MAPK pathway, lipid metabolism, and cuticle development were down-regulated. In the transition from the nauplius VI to cyprid stages, there was up-regulation of genes involved in blood coagulation, cuticle development, and eggshell formation, and down-regulation of genes in the nitric oxide pathway, which stimulates the swimming and feeding responses of marine invertebrates. This system-wide integrated approach elucidated the development and attachment pathways important in B. amphitrite. Enzymes and metabolites in these pathways are potential molecular targets for the development of new antifouling compounds...|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} {{of any of}} these three types of antifouling coatings frequently involves laboratory assays to quantify the effectiveness of the coatings towards reduction of surface colonization and/or adhesion strength of single species under well-defined conditions. Many of such biofouling laboratory assays focus on the sessile spore or larvae stage rather than the adult, macroscopically visible <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> [14, 48 – 50]. In general, the applied assays can be subdivided into biomass accumulation measurements (settlement assays), adhesion strength measurements, and tracking experiments to quantify exploration behavior. All three measurements reflect the responses or interactions of microorganisms and larvae with surfaces. Prior to permanent adhesion, motile and highly selective species are able to explore the surface and commitment to permanent adhesion only occurs if positive cues are sensed. Two remarkably selective species that have extensively been investigated with respect to their selection of surfaces are zoospores of the green algae Ulva linza and barnacle larvae.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS. The {{prolific}} reproductive {{capabilities of}} the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, have facilitated the rapid spread and high densities of this <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> since its accidental introduction into North America less than 10 years ago. Research on its reproductive mechanisms and capabilities may be valuable not only in predicting its further spread, but also in investigating basic mechanisms of reproduction and develop-ment and in developing new strategies to mitigate its impact. Since zebra mussels are dioecious and fertilization occurs externally, coordinated mat-uration, spawning, and other mechanisms have evolved to increase the probability of successful fertilization. The zebra mussel undergoes an an-nual cycle of gonadal growth and gamete maturation, culminating {{in one or more}} spawning events in late spring or early summer. Temperature, rates of temperature change, food availability, and effects of neighboring mussels seem to be critical variables that determine reproductive responses. Sero-tonin is a biogenic amine which is implicated in spawning behavior an...|$|E
30|$|The {{fascinating}} selectivity and build-in sensory {{mechanisms of}} microorganisms do not only cause sensitive responses to toxins but also enables <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> to select surfaces and guide colonization. In this article some recent progress about {{the interaction of}} marine organisms with surfaces is reviewed. After a short outline describing the motivation to study cell-surface interactions in marine antifouling research, the behavior of zoospores of Ulva linza and barnacle cyprids are discussed in greater detail. For both species we summarize to which extend behavior and initial interactions correlate with surface properties. While <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> are frequently viewed as nuisance, this article highlights their intriguing skill to selectively colonize surfaces due {{to their ability to}} sense their properties.|$|R
40|$|Rearing coral {{fragments}} in nurseries {{and subsequent}} transplantation onto a degraded reef {{is a common}} approach for coral reef restoration. However, if barnacles and other <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> are not removed prior to transplantation, fish will dislodge newly cemented corals when feeding on <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> This behavior can {{lead to an increase}} in diver time due to the need to reattach the corals. Thus, cleaning nurseries to remove <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> such as algae and invertebrates is necessary prior to transplantation, and this cleaning constitutes a significant time investment in a restoration project. We tested a novel biomimicry technique of animal-assisted cleaning on nursery corals prior to transplantation at a coral reef restoration site in Seychelles, Indian Ocean. To determine whether animal-assisted cleaning was possible, preliminary visual underwater surveys were performed to quantify the fish community at the study site. Then, cleaning stations consisting of nursery ropes carrying corals and <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms,</b> set at 0. 3 m, 2 m, 4 m, 6 m and 8 m from the seabed, were placed at both the transplantation (treatment) site and the nursery (control) site. Remote GoPro video cameras recorded fish feeding at the nursery ropes without human disturbance. A reef fish assemblage of 32 species from 4 trophic levels (18. 8 % herbivores, 18. 8 % omnivores, 59. 3 % secondary consumers and 3. 1 % carnivores) consumed 95 % of the barnacles on the coral nursery ropes placed 0. 3 m above the seabed. Using this cleaning station, we reduced coral dislodgement from 16 % to zero. This cleaning station technique could be included as a step prior to coral transplantation worldwide on the basis of location-specific fish assemblages and during the early nursery phase of sexually produced juvenile corals...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of vessel biofouling as a vector for the dispersal of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) is only {{just beginning to}} receive international attention. At the time of commencing this study, there was a considerable lack of knowledge surrounding which vessels, hull locations, levels and types of biofouling pose the greatest biosecurity risk. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the nature, extent and survivorship of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> on various vessel types at different hull locations and offers a pragmatic risk assessment approach for managing this threat. The results of this thesis found that the recruitment, persistence, distribution, abundance and species composition of biofouling on vessel hulls is influenced by many factors including: 1) the presence/absence, age and type of anti-fouling coating; 2) voyage duration and route; and 3) port residency period. Therefore, higher levels of biofouling (species richness, percentage cover, and biomass), including NIMS are more likely to accumulate and persist on vessels (and in hull locations) that: 1) lack and/or possess old, ineffective, damaged, inappropriate or unsuitable anti-fouling coatings; 2) spend prolonged periods stationary in ports; 3) travel at slow speeds (i. e. < 10 knots); 4) have short voyage durations; and 5) remain at similar latitudes. Prevention is clearly better than a cure, hence the correct application and maintenance of suitable anti-fouling coatings to the entire submerged hull surface of vessel hulls, including niche areas is the most cost-effective way of minimising the unwanted translocation of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and NIMS. However, the results of this thesis demonstrate that if <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> colonise and establish on a vessel's hull, voyage speed alone is not capable of providing a reliable secondary level of defence against the unwanted dispersal of NIMS. Clearly, the survivorship of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> was highest amongst vessels that travelled at slow and medium speeds (e. g. < 10 knots). Therefore, given that accumulation of biofouling follows a successional process and NIMS are more likely to be associated with higher levels of biofouling, vessels that travel at slow and medium speeds are more likely to pose the greatest risk of translocating NIMS on a vessel by vessel scale. However, despite the observation that faster vessels reduce the diversity, quantity and quality of sessile <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> in laminar flow areas of the hull, a wide range of sessile, sedentary and mobile organisms were still cable of survival in areas protected from harsh hydrodynamically forces commonly referred to as niche areas, particularly within sea-chests...|$|R
40|$|The acorn barnacle, Balanus amphitrite, is {{the main}} <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> in marine environments. In the present study we {{profiled}} the transcriptome and proteome of B. amphitrite at different life stages (nauplius II, nauplius VI and cyprid) from the Red Sea, where the average water surface temperature is 34 °C and the salinity reaches 41 ‰. We identified 65, 784 expressed contigs, {{and a total of}} 1, 387 expressed proteins measured by quantitative proteomics. We found that osmotic stress, salt stress, hyperosmotic response and the Wnt signaling pathway were strongly up-regulated during the planktonic stage, while the MAPK pathway, lipid metabolism, and cuticle development genes were down-regulated. In the transition stage between the nauplius VI and the cyprid, genes that are involved in blood coagulation, cuticle development and eggshell formation were highly up-regulated, while the nitric oxide pathway, which stimulates the swimming and feeding response in marine invertebrates, was down-regulated. We are able to report {{for the first time that}} sound sensory system proteins are highly abundant in the nauplius VI stage, implying that these proteins are good targets for the development of new antifouling compounds.

40|$|Zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is a <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> {{that lives}} {{generally}} in freshwater ecosystems. Zebra mussel infestation has occurred at various freshwater structures and systems including raw water intakes, industrial and domestic distribution pipelines, and hydropower facilities at its native regions {{as well as}} distant locations. A {{study was conducted to}} perform risk assessment and to develop preventive measures for zebra mussel infestation at a planned hydroelectric power plant (Alpaslan II HEPP) in southeast Turkey. Zebra mussel is native to Anatolia region and existing hydropower facilities have significantly been affected by mussel infestation. The risk assessment was conducted by considering effects of various factors on zebra mussel infestation. The factors included environmental conditions, factors related to materials used in construction of various components of a HEPP as well as the susceptibility of various components to infestation due to routine operation of a facility. Quantitative study of head loss due to major infestation for Alpaslan II HEPP indicates approximately 4 % reduction in power generation. A two-step process is proposed to prevent mussel infestation at hydroelectric power plants. The method makes use of the water hammer effect that occurs during rapid shutdown of the turbine combined with an automated system for providing chemicals to the power plant water to remove and kill zebra mussels associated with various components of a facility. The proposed system constitutes a proactive-reactive chemical treatment system...|$|E
30|$|Understanding {{the complex}} {{behavioral}} mechanisms {{involved in the}} recruitment of motile propagules to surfaces is fundamental to control the distribution, abundance and dynamics of organisms on hard substrata in the marine environment, and thus {{in the design of}} novel ‘antifouling’ coatings. The motile, quadriflagellated zoospore of Ulva linza with a spore body diameter of 4 – 5  µm has been extensively studied as a model <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism.</b> In order to complete the life cycle, zoospores must locate a surface and settle on it (i.e., permanently attach to it). Previous investigations by video microscopy (2) revealed that spores show complex swimming behaviors as they approach and make contact with surfaces. The attachment process appears to involve an initial, temporary, and reversible phase of varying duration, and is characterized by a rapid “top-like spinning”, although in certain circumstances spores may also settle without spinning. For example, video microscopy has recorded settlement i.e., permanent adhesion, of swimming spores against debris and previously adhered spores without any surface exploration or spinning (unpublished observations). Final commitment to irreversible and permanent adhesion involves the discharge of a preformed glycoprotein adhesive from cytoplasmic vesicles, as the cell contracts against the surface. The membrane of the sheaths surrounding the flagella are shed into the water, the axonemes are retracted into the settling spore [2, 3]. The attached spore secretes a cell wall and can then germinate to grow into the macroscopic, easily visible green seaweed.|$|E

40|$|Marine {{biofouling}} {{occurs on}} the bottom of boats, fishing gear, nets and the surface of underwater construction materials, {{as well as on the}} surface of living and nonliving marine organisms. It causes great damage to marine and fisheries industries. This paper discusses some of the biology of marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and the relationship between marine biofouling and fisheries. Special attention is given to the damage caused by marine biofouling to the fin-fish cage culture industries of Hong Kong. At present, approximately 5, 000 species of marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> occur in the world, of which 2, 000 species are recorded. In the coastal water of China, there are about 700 recorded species. About 250 <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> are found in Hong Kong. The dominant species are barnacles, bryozoans, polychaetes, sea squirts (ascidians) and bivalves. The main biofouling of fish cages in Hong Kong is caused by the polychaete Hydroides elegans, sea squirts Styela plicata and S. canopus, oyster Ostrea glomerata, barnacles Balanus reticulatus and B. trigonus. Depending on habitat and sea water temperatures, marine biofouling has obvious seasonal fluctuations in growth and occurrence. Marine fouling organisms occur on the fish cages in Hong Kong all the year round, but April to June is the predominant season of the occurrence of Hydroides elegans. During this period, small mesh nets will become completely obstructed by this animal. Oyster Ostrea spp., barnacles Balanus reticulatus and B. trigonus and the sea squirts Styela plicata and S. canopus occur in the months of June to November. From November to March the main fouling species is the bryozoan Bugula neritina. In Hong Kong because of marine fouling, fish cage nets need to be changed about every 1 - 3 months. The <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> (such as H. elegans) which attack nets, can be sprayed with sea water which will clean the net. But those with calcareous substances such as Ostrea and Balanus must be cleaned by sunlight and manpower. At present, antifouling paints are being tested on fish cage nets in China, Japan and Hong Kong. However, toxic substances such as TBTO and TBTF from these paints may accumulate in the fish with direct or indirect effects on human beings. So their use requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{organism}} {{are often}} kept, cultured, and experimented on in running seawater aquaria. However, surprisingly little attention {{is given to}} the nutrient composition of the water flowing through these systems, which is generally assumed to equal in situ conditions, but may change due to the presence of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> Significantly lower bacterial abundances and higher inorganic nitrogen species (nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium) were measured in aquarium water when <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> were present within a 7 -year old inlet pipe feeding a tropical reef running seawater aquaria system, compared with aquarium water fed by a new, biofouling-free inlet pipe. These water quality changes are indicative of the feeding activity and waste production of the suspension- and filter-feeding communities found in the old pipe, which included sponges, bivalves, barnacles, and ascidians. To illustrate the physiological consequences of these water quality changes on a model organism kept in the aquaria system, we investigated the influence of the presence and absence of the biofouling community on the functioning of the filter-feeding sponge Halisarca caerulea, by determining its choanocyte (filter cell) proliferation rates. We found a 34 % increase in choanocyte proliferation rates following the replacement of the inlet pipe (i. e., removal of the biofouling community). This indicates that the physiological functioning of the sponge was compromised due to suboptimal food conditions within the aquarium resulting from the presence of the <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> in the inlet pipe. This study has implications for the husbandry and performance of experiments with marine organisms in running seawater aquaria systems. Inlet pipes should be checked regularly, and replaced if necessary, in order to avoid excessive biofouling and to approach in situ water quality...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling pests, {{including}} non-indigenous species, {{can have}} significant impacts on anthropogenic activities. This {{is particularly true}} for aquaculture industries, where biofouling communities grow on crop species and infrastructure, potentially reducing revenue and increasing processing and production costs. It is of interest to marine farmers and scientists {{to gain a better}} understanding of the processes facilitating the regional proliferation and spread of biofouling pests. The structure of biofouling communities associated with marine farms in New Zealand’s main mussel growing region, Pelorus Sound, are characterised in this thesis. The patterns of connectivity and gene flow among biofouling populations are also investigated. Images and video footage of biofouling on mussel farms (Perna canaliculus) indicate strong spatial variation in the structure of biofouling communities, with a dominance of known problematic taxa and high wave energy tolerant species, such as the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida and the calcareous tubeworm Pomatoceros sp., near the entrance of Pelorus Sound. Genetic analyses and simple GIS-based modelling of a case study <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism,</b> Didemnum vexillum, revealed genetic differentiation among populations with extreme outcrossing and low levels of connectivity. Genetic analyses also suggest that anthropogenic-assisted dispersal may be vital for connecting certain D. vexillum populations compared to natural spread. The present study illustrates how multidisciplinary research approaches can be used to identify geographical areas that are less prone to biofouling and to inform the management of biofouling pests and invasive species in aquaculture environments...|$|E
40|$|Biofouling has a {{major impact}} on the global {{shipping}} industry. The fouling demands extensive efforts to clean the fouled vessels, increases the expenses for the shipping companies and worsens a number of environmental problems, such as carbon dioxide emissions due to increased drag, or the transport of organisms outside their habitat. In the past, toxic paints were found to be the solution for this problem. The ban of TBT (tributyltin), because of its negative impact on the environment, has led to the research of several other alternatives. Until now, however, no other equally effective product as TBT has been found. Nowadays, scome scientific evidence points towards hydroacoustic antifouling systems. According to its manufacturers, hydroacoustic antifouling systems are an eco-friendly solution to biofouling on merchant ships. The system consists of transducers at the inner side of a ship's outer hull which emit acoustic ultrasound waves. The alteration of positive and negative pressure created by these waves result in cavitation bubbles. These bubbles make the hull an unattractive environment for the barnacles and mussels to grow on. The second working principle is resonation, capable of destroying single cell organisms, which are the feeding ground for fouling organisms. Studies have shown that the use of these acoustic antifouling systems are working well on specific frequencies, exposure time and amplitude. An hydroacoustic antifouling system is capable of keeping the outer platting of vessels free of the fouling barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite. Therefore, a frequency of 23 kHz, an exposure time of 300 seconds and an amplitude of 20 kPa is the optimal configuration. (Shifeng, 2012). Before implementation of hydroacoustic antifouling systems, further research is still be done to investigate the impact of ultrasound on other marine life, as the frequencies used are within hearing range of sea mammals and pinnipeds.

The associated organisms on the mussel ccmmunity include, algae, sponges, sea anemones, planarians, polychaetes, sipunculids, amphipods, isopods, cirriped, crabs and gastropods. The percentage biomass of associated organisms range from 2 to 12. 29 in the mussel community in various months. Cirriped form the most dominant <b>biofouling</b> <b>organism</b> on mussel. The community starts establishing on the onset of SW monsoon. A clear or distinct succession of associated organisms on the mussel was not observed in various months or season, though the biomass was found to fluctuate without any aistinct trend, in various months. The population of mussel is multimodal in size. The length ranges from 2 mm to 54 mm in a population of nearly one year old. The {{rate of growth of}} mussel in the intertidal area is estimated to be 5 mm in the first few months and 4 mm per month {{in the latter part of}} the first year. The mortality rate is not estimated though assumed to be of high order judging from the presence of dead attached shells among the living ones. Some modes remain without registering any growth for a period. In the present study the estimated grovrth rate is only for one year since second year population could not be analysed due to total exploitation of the community from the site of collection by local people. It was observed that wherever, there is a profuse settlement of Cellana radiata, Balanus amphitrite or thick algal growth on the rocks the mussel was virtually absent or scarcely populated. However Balanus amphitrit coula establish on mussel very successfully.

Examining {{the dynamics}} of entrained species assemblages during transport can provide insights into the introduction risk associated with these vectors. Ship biofouling is a major transport vector of nonindigenous species in coastal ecosystems globally, yet its magnitude in the Arctic is poorly understood. To determine whether <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> on ships can survive passages in Arctic waters, we examined how biofouling assemblage structure changed before, during, and after eight round-trip military voyages from temperate to Arctic ports in Canada. Species richness first decreased (~ 70 % loss) and then recovered (~ 27 % loss compared to the original assemblages), as ships travelled {{to and from the}} Arctic, respectively, whereas total abundance typically declined over time (~ 55 % total loss). Biofouling community structure differed significantly before and during Arctic transits as well as between those sampled during and after voyages. Assemblage structure varied across different parts of the hull; however, temporal changes were independent of hull location, suggesting that niche areas did not provide protection for <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> against adverse conditions in the Arctic. Biofouling algae appear to be more tolerant of transport conditions during Arctic voyages than are mobile, sessile, and sedentary invertebrates. Our results suggest that biofouling assemblages on ships generally have poor survivorship during Arctic voyages. Nonetheless, some potential for transporting nonindigenous species to the Arctic via ship biofouling remains, as at least six taxa new to the Canadian Arctic, including a nonindigenous cirripede, appeared to have survived transits from temperate to Arctic ports. © 2016, The Author(s) ...|$|R

Biofouling is divided into microfouling — biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion — and macrofouling — attachment of larger organisms. Due to the distinct chemistry and biology that determine what prevents them from settling, organisms are also classified as hard- or soft-fouling types. Calcareous (hard) fouling organisms include barnacles, encrusting bryozoans, mollusks, polychaete and other tube worms, and zebra mussels.

The project objective was to test the use of an automated image analysis software (CoralNet) on images of marine biofouling from offshore platforms on the UK continental shelf, with the aim of (i) training the software to identify the main marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> on UK platforms; (ii) testing the software performance on 3 platforms under 3 different analysis criteria (methods A–C); (iii) calculating the percentage cover of marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and (iv) providing recommendations to industry. Following software training with 857 images, and testing of three platforms, results showed that diversity of the three platforms ranged from low (in the central North Sea) to moderate (in the northern North Sea). The two central North Sea platforms were dominated by the plumose anemone Metridium dianthus; and the northern North Sea platform showed less obvious species domination. Three different analysis criteria were created, where the method of selection of points, number of points assessed and confidence level thresholds (CT) varied: (method A) random selection of 20 points with CT 80 %, (method B) stratified random of 50 points with CT of 90 % and (method C) a grid approach of 100 points with CT of 90 %. Performed across the three platforms, the results showed that {{there were no significant differences}} across the majority of species and comparison pairs. No significant difference (across all species) was noted between confirmed annotations methods (A, B and C). It was considered that the software performed well for the classification of the main fouling species in the North Sea.

30|$|The third {{possibility}} consists not in preventing, but {{in removing}} all unwanted fouling {{by creating a}} “self-cleaning” surface. The removal of foulers from so-called fouling-release coatings is achieved by the hydrodynamic drag caused by {{the movement of the}} vessel (Fig.  1 c). Such coatings are usually based on silicone elastomers or fluoropolymers which do not inhibit settlement of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and thus biomass accumulates. However, the weak attachment strength to these polymeric materials allows fast-moving ships to self clean simply by the shear force present during their movement through the ocean [13, 41 – 44]. Modern fouling-release coatings have self-cleaning ability even below 15 knots (e.g. Intersleek 900 requires > 10 knots, Hempasil X 3 87500 > 8 knots) [45]. Especially the combination of fouling-release with mechanical cleaning techniques such as hull grooming seem to be promising hybrid approaches for the future [46, 47].|$|R
40|$|This {{study used}} a {{specially}} designed MAGPLATE system to quantify the en route survivorship and post-voyage recovery of biofouling assemblages subjected to short voyages (512 h) {{across a range of}} vessel speeds (slow, medium, fast; in the range 4. 0 – 21. 5 knots). The effect of hull location (bow, amidships and stern) was also examined. While no significant differences were evident in en route survivorship of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> amongst hull locations, biofouling cover and richness were markedly reduced on faster vessels relative to slower craft. Therefore, the potential inoculum size of non-indigenous marine species and richness is likely to be reduced for vessels that travel at faster speeds (414 knots), which is likely to also reduce the chances of successful introductions. Despite this, the magnitude of introductions from biofouling on fast vessels can be considered minor, especially for species richness where 90 % of source-port species were recorded at destinations...|$|R

Microfouling organisms attach to this conditioning layer, building up a biofilm on which further biofouling proceeds. In dolphins, biofouling reduces hydrodynamic efficiency and may negatively affect health if not managed. In this study we examined the skin surface of the pilot whale (Globicephala melas). Employing cryo-scanning electron microscopic techniques combined with various sample preparations, the skin surface displayed an average nanorough surface characterized by a pattern of nanoridge-enclosed pores. The average size (pore size appr. 0. 20 µm 2) of the pores was below the size of most marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms,</b> and the implications to self-cleaning abilities based on reduced available space for attachment, {{the lack of any}} particular microniche for biofoulers to hide, and their challenge to the turbulent water flow and liquid-air interfaces during surfacing and jumping of the dolphin are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} share {{a substantial}} and yet unmet need for prediction {{and control of}} interactions between surfaces and proteins or living cells. Examples are blood-contacting biomaterials, biosensors, and non-toxic anti-biofouling coatings for ship hulls. The main focus of this thesis work has been the synthesis, characterization and properties {{of a group of}} coatings, designed for such applications. Many types of substrates, particularly plastics, were coated directly with ultrathin, hydrophilic polymer coatings, using a newly developed polymerization method initiated by short-wavelength ultraviolet light. The thesis contains eight papers and an introduction aimed to provide a context for the research work. The common theme, discussed and analyzed throughout the work, has been the minimization of non-specific binding of proteins to surfaces, thereby limiting the risk of uncontrolled attachment of cells and higher organisms. This has mainly been accomplished through the incorporation of monomer units bearing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains in the coatings. Such PEG-containing “protein resistant” coatings have been used in this work as matrices for biosensor applications, as blood-contacting inert surfaces and as antibiofouling coatings for marine applications, with excellent results. The properties of the coatings, and their interactions with proteins and cells, have been thoroughly characterized using an array of techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, surface plasmon resonance and neutron reflectometry. In addition, other routes to fabricate coatings with high protein resistance have also been utilized. For instance, the versatility of the fabrication method has enabled the design of gradients with varying electrostatic charge, affecting the protein adsorption and leading to protein resistance in areas where the charges are balanced. This thesis also describes a novel application of imaging surface plasmon resonance for the investigation of the surface exploration behavior of marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms,</b> in particular barnacle larvae. This technique allows for real-time assessment of the rate of surface exploration and the deposition of protein-based adhesives onto surfaces, a process which was previously very difficult to investigate experimentally. In this thesis, the method was applied to several model surface chemistries, including the hydrogels described above. The new method promises to provide insights into the interactions between <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> and a surface during the critical stages prior to permanent settlement, hopefully facilitating the development of antibiofouling coatings for marine applications...|$|R
40|$|Biofouling on {{scientific}} equipment deployed in marine and estuarine environments can {{have implications for}} equipment performance, and the type and amount of data collected. We {{examined the effects of}} biofouling on the performance of data logging acoustic receivers deployed in shallow coastal waters off Florida. Five treatment types of receivers were examined including old and new versions of VR 2 (Vemco Ltd) receivers with complete, partial, or no antifouling paint. Receivers were deployed for 2 mo, and acoustic signal detection rates examined. All receivers had some extent of biofouling {{during the course of the}} study, and performance was variable among treatment types. Old version receivers did not perform as well as new version receivers in all cases, and significant differences were apparent in detection rate and receiver performance metrics. Reductions in receiver performance over time occurred for most treatments and were likely due to settlement of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> including barnacles, annelids, tunicates, and ascidians. Biofouling appeared to affect receiver performance over time and should be taken into account in acoustic telemetry studies...|$|R
30|$|The future key {{application}} will be {{to track}} larvae of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> [30]. Barnacle cyprids are of primary interest as they are widely distributed and {{have been identified as}} the most common fouling marine invertebrates in the world [31, 32]. The first results obtained with our stereoscopic setup and cyprids of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides demonstrated successful tracking and showed that differences in the swimming trajectories in solution and close to surfaces could be detected. First indications were obtained which suggested that the surface properties affected the exploration behavior at the surface. Even though all results presented need to be statistically verified with more comprehensive data sets, they clearly show the applicability of the experimental approach. As the setup is very compact and highly modular, a future implementation and tests in situ in the ocean will allow investigating the colonization of surfaces by biofouling larvae in their natural habitat. The developed device can easily be applied for the 3 D analysis not only of organisms at sub-millimeter level but also for larger animals, and thus has numerous potential applications in biology, biochemistry, and biophysics.|$|R
40|$|Biofouling {{in marine}} {{aquaculture}} {{is a specific}} problem where both the target culture species and/or infrastructure are exposed to a diverse array of fouling organisms, with significant production impacts. In shellfish aquaculture the key impact is the direct fouling of stock causing physical damage, mechanical interference, biological competition and environmental modification, while infrastructure is also impacted. In contrast, the key impact in finfish aquaculture is the fouling of infrastructure which restricts water exchange, increases disease risk and causes deformation of cages and structures. Consequently, the economic costs associated with biofouling control are substantial. Conservative estimates are consistently between 5 – 10 % of production costs (equivalent to US$ 1. 5 to 3 billion yr− 1), illustrating the need for effective mitigation methods and technologies. The control of biofouling in aquaculture is achieved through the avoidance of natural recruitment, physical removal {{and the use of}} antifoulants. However, the continued rise and expansion of the aquaculture industry and the increasingly stringent legislation for biocides in food production necessitates the development of innovative antifouling strategies. These must meet environmental, societal, and economic benchmarks while effectively preventing the settlement and growth of resilient multi-species consortia of <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Summary. Enzyme {{activity}} in the stratum corneum of the pilot whale Globicephala melas was investigated employing colorimetric enzyme screening assays combined with NATIVE PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and histochemical staining procedures. Applying different substrates, several enzymes were detected. The histochemical demonstration of some selected hydrolytic enzymes enriched in the stratum corneum showed high extracellular accumulation. As demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography, high molar mass aggregates were built up from a glycoprotein-rich 20 - 30 kD fraction. Using NATIVE PAGE experiments under non reducing conditions, a selection of five degrading enzymes was recovered within the above-reported aggregates. Activity of extracellular aggregate-attached enzymes in the superficial layer of the stratum corneum exhibited no remarkable decrease potentially resulting from self-degradation. We thus conclude that due to their enclosure within the micro-environment of aggregates a zymogel is formed and autolysis of the stratum corneum is reduced. With respect to the skin surface, the zymogel with hydrolytic activities covering major parts of it enhances the self-cleaning abilities of {{the skin of the}} pilot whale based on physical prequesites by hydrolysing adhesive glycoconjugates of settling <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> considered as primary steps in fouling...|$|R
30|$|In {{this work}} we apply the {{microfluidic}} shear force assay {{to quantify the}} adhesion strength of the marine bacterium Cobetia marina on chemically different model surfaces. This bacterium {{is used as a}} model system for marine biofouling because it is frequently found in biofilms and influences secondary colonization by invertebrates and algae [3]. To demonstrate the applicability of the microfluidic assay, we used self-assembled monolayers as well-defined model surfaces. Self-assembled monolayers [25, 26] are highly useful tools to reproducibly prepare coatings and frequently applied to study response of marine <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms</b> [14, 16, 27 – 32]. One major advantage is that the mechanical properties are determined by the substrate while physicochemical properties, such as wetting and hydration are determined by the thin organic film. The accumulation of C. marina on chemically differently terminated self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) revealed that surface properties change the amount of accumulated biomass [14, 29]. In this article we describe the effect of undecanethiol SAMs with –CH 3, –NH 2, –OC 7 F 10 CF 3 termination and polyethylene glycol (PEG) terminated SAMs on the adhesion strength of the marine bacteria C. marina. We chose these surfaces as they cover a large range of wettabilities with different inert properties as numerous recent studies revealed [14, 27, 29, 31, 33 – 38].|$|R
40|$|This study {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} effect of different vessel voyage speeds (5, 10 and 18 knots = 2. 6, 5. 1 and 9. 3 ms- 1, respectively) and morphological characteristics including growth form (solitary or colonial), profile (erect or encrusting) and structure (soft, hard or flexible) on the survival {{of a range of}} common <b>biofouling</b> <b>organisms.</b> A custom built hydrodynamic keel attached to the bottom of a 6 m aluminium powerboat was used to subject pre-fouled settlement plates for this purpose. Vessel speeds of 5 and 10 knots had little effect on the species richness of biofouling assemblages tested, however richness decreased by 50 % following 18 knots treatments. Species percentage cover decreased with increasing speed across all speed treatments and this decrease was most pronounced at 10 and 18 knots, with cover reduced by 24 and 85 % respectively. Survival was greatest for organisms with colonial, encrusting, hard and/or flexible morphological characteristics, and this effect increased with increasing speed. This study suggests that there is predictive power in forecasting future introductions if we can understand the extent to which such traits explain the world-wide distributions of non-indigenous species. Future introductions are a certainty and can only provide an increasing source of new information on which to test the validity of these predications. Ashley D. M. Coutts, Chad L. Hewitt, Sean D.
