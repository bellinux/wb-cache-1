40|$|BACKGROUND: Dizziness is a {{frequent}} complaint of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and orthostatic hypotension (OH) is often {{thought to be the}} cause. We studied whether <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV) could also be an explanation. AIM: To assess the prevalence of <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> in patients with Parkinson's disease, with and without dizziness. METHODS: 305 consecutive outpatients with PD completed the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinsons' Disease Rating Scale-motor score, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, the Dix-Hallpike maneuver and a test for orthostatic hypotension. When positive for <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> a repositioning maneuver was performed. Patients were followed for three months to determine the clinical response. RESULTS: 305 patients responded (186 men (61 %), mean age 70. 5 years (Standard Deviation 9. 5 years)), of whom 151 (49 %) complained of dizziness. 57 (38 %) of the dizzy patients appeared to have orthostatic hypotension; 12 patients (8 %) had a classical but previously unrecognized <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> A further four patients (3 %) had a more atypical presentation of <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Three months after treatment, 11 (92 %) of patients with classical <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> were almost or completely without complaints. We found no 'hidden' <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> among patients without dizziness. The prevalence of <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> among all patients with PD was 5. 3 %.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the frequency of posterior semicircular canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> in each ear, and to assess the association between the ear affected by <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> and the head-lying side during sleep onset. Based on a previous study which used objective methods to prove the preference of the elderly for the right head-lying side during sleep, we hypothesised that a predominance of the same head-lying side in <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> patients may affect the pathophysiology of otoconia displacement. Study design: We conducted a prospective study of out-patients with posterior semicircular canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> confirmed by a positive Dix-Hallpike test. Methods: One hundred and forty-two patients with posterior semicircular canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> were interviewed about their past medical history, focusing on factors predisposing to <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> All patients included in the study were able to define a predominant, favourite head-lying side, right or left, during sleep onset. Results: The Dix-Hallpike test was found to be positive on the right side in 82 patients and positive on the left side in 54; six patients were found to be positive bilaterally. During sleep onset, 97 patients habitually laid their head on the right side and the remaining 45 laid their head on the left. The association between the affected ear and the head-lying side during sleep onset was statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Our study found a predominance of right-sided <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> a subjective preference amongst patients for a right head-lying position during sleep onset, and an association between the ear affected by <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> and the preferred head-lying side during sleep onset.

AIM: To describe the likely diagnosis of symptoms of vertigo. DESIGN OF STUDY: Prospective cohort study METHODS: Thirteen GPs were recruited and trained to clinically assess and follow up all patients presenting with symptoms of vertigo over a six-month period Age-sex data were simultaneously gathered on those who consulted with non-vertiginous dizziness. RESULTS: The main diagnoses assigned by the GPs in 70 patients were <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> acute vestibular neuronitis and Ménière's disease, which together accounted for 93 % (95 % confidence interval = 71 % to 100 %) of patients' symptoms.

40|$|In a {{double-blind}} randomised trial Epley’s manoeuvre {{is shown}} to resolve <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> of the posterior canal both effectively and rapidly. The analysis of medical management of patients with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> reveals that the recent progress in the diagnosis and therapy of this disorder {{has not yet been}} widely established in medical practice in Germany. Most patient receive ineffective therapy and only a minority is treated with a specific therapeutic manoeuvre. Otolith function is impaired in patients with idiopathic <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> possibly secondary to degeneration of the utricular macula. This finding may account for the transient mild imbalance and dizziness that some patients with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> experience even after resolution of <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> <b>Benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> predominantly affects the right vestibular organ. The reason for this predilection might be the habit – of most patients – to sleep on the right side.

Forty percent of patients had <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> and showed <b>positional</b> nystagmus.

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION: <b>Benign</b> {{paroxysmal}} <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV) is {{a clinical}} syndrome that is proposed {{to be caused}} by dislocated utricular debris into semicircular canals. Although the majority of patients are treated by one or two repositioning maneuvers, some of the patients need repeated maneuvers for relief. OBJECTIVE: The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the factors associated with patients with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> who required multiple repositioning procedures for treatment. METHODS: Data were obtained from the clinical records of 153 patients diagnosed with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Patients were treated by repositioning maneuvers. Demographic data and the factors including age, sex, canal type, duration of symptoms, comorbidities and number of repositioning maneuvers for relief were documented for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Age, sex, canal type and the duration of symptoms had no impact on the number of maneuvers. The most common comorbidity was spine problems. Hypertension was the only comorbidity that significantly associated with increased number of maneuvers. CONCLUSION: The presence of hypertension is a risk factor for repeated maneuvers in <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> treatment.

40|$|Background and Aim: Since utricle is {{the main}} damaged organ in <b>benign</b> {{paroxysmal}} <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (BPPV), ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potential (oVEMP) may be an appropriate method to evaluate the utricule dysfunction {{and the effect of}} disease recurrence rate on it. This study aimed to record myogenic potential in patients with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Methods: In a cross-sectional study, ocular myogenic potential was recorded in 25 healthy subjects and 20 patients with <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> using 500 Hz-tone bursts (95 dB nHL). Results: In the affected ear, mean amplitude was lower and mean threshold was higher than those in the unaffected ear and in the normal group (p< 0. 05).

MethodsA retrospective case analysis was conducted for 122 dizzy patients referred to two neuro-otology tertiary centres in London and Pisa. Patients were divided into ‘explained’ causes of dizziness (e. g. <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> vestibular neuritis, orthostatic hypotension, cerebellar ataxias) and ‘unexplained’ dizziness. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) in MRI (T 2 weighted and FLAIR sequences) were blindly rated according to the Fazekas scale. Results 122 patients; 58 (mean age= 72, SD= 7. 95 years) in the ‘unexplained’ group and 64 (mean age= 72. 01, SD= 8. 28 years) in the ‘explained’ group were recruited. The overall frequency of lesions (Fazekas 1 – 3) significantly differed between groups (p= 0. 011). The frequency of severe lesions (Fazekas 3) was significantly higher in the ‘unexplained’ group (22 %) than in the ‘explained’ group (5 %; p= 0. 003).

40|$|Objective: Dizziness is {{a common}} reason {{patients}} present to doctors, but effective diagnostic tests and treatments for dizziness are underused. The internet {{is a way to}} disseminate medical information and is emerging as an intervention platform. The objective {{of this study was to}} describe internet searches for dizziness terms to assess the possible consumer demand for internet-based dizziness diagnostic and treatment tools. Study Design/Methods: Google AdWords and Google Insights for Search were used for keyword search data on the following generic terms: vertigo, dizzy, dizziness, lightheaded, and lightheadedness. Data collected included keyword ideas (i. e., additional keywords identified by Google as being related search terms), global and U. S. -only monthly search frequencies, as well as trends in top searches related to dizziness terms from 2004 to 2012. Keywords suggestive of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or BPPV processes were identified. Results: Of the five generic dizziness terms, vertigo had the most global searches per month (1. 83 million) and lightheadedness had the least (90, 500). Four BPPV specific terms had more than 100, 000 global searches per month. Three BPPV terms (positional vertigo, benign vertigo, and <b>benign</b> <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo)</b> have been in the list of top searches related to vertigo every quarter since 2004.

These patients were commonly referred to various other departments, where they underwent a number of investigations, particularly medical imaging [head CT (Computed Tomography) / MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans, which were in many cases not necessary. Such delays in the process led to an extra or unnecessary burden on the limited health funds available to the hospital or to the patient. Another drawback was an elevated patient stress and anxiety as critical time was lost with the increased number of admissions, or in transferring the patient between various departments without any conclusive diagnosis and treatment. It was proposed to conduct a retrospective study on the accuracy of diagnosis of those patients admitted to Christchurch Public Hospital with complaints of acute vertigo, particularly for suspected peripheral vestibular disorders (mainly BPV and Ménière's disease) over the period of 2004 - 2005. Implementation of a more specific and detailed management approach {{at the level of the}} initial clinical examination or diagnostic investigations (specifically, by an early Otolaryngology/Audiology intervention) was planned for the year 2006. The two groups of patients (2004 - 2005 and 2006) were compared to verify the final achievements concerning the diagnostic accuracy and at various other levels with the newly implemented changes in 2006...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of a new physical maneuver in the treatment of the apogeotropic variant of horizontal canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Study Design: Case review. Setting: Outpatient clinic. Patients: The diagnosis of apogeotropic horizontal canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> was based on the history of recurrent sudden crisis of vertigo associated with bursts of horizontal apogeotropic paroxysmal nystagmus provoked by turning the head from the supine to either lateral position. The patients were three men and five women ranging in age from 31 to 73 years (average, 49. 2 yr). Interventions: All patients were treated with a repositioning maneuver based on the hypothesis that the syndrome is caused by the presence of free-floating dense particles inside the endolymph of the anterior arm of the horizontal canal. The maneuver favors their shifting into the posterior arm of the canal. Patients were reexamined immediately after the treatment and underwent Gufoni's liberatory maneuver for the geotropic variant of horizontal canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Main Outcome Measure: The treatment outcome was considered as responsive when, after one repositioning maneuver, nystagmus shifted from apogeotropic to geotropic. Results: The repositioning maneuver resulted in a transformation from the apogeotropic variant into a geotropic variant of horizontal canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> in all patients. Conclusion: This maneuver represents a simple and effective approach to the treatment of the apogeotropic variant of horizontal canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> It favors the shifting of the canaliths from the anterior into the posterior arm of the horizontal canal from where they can migrate into the utricle with Gufoni's maneuver...|$|R
40|$|Background and PurposezzIn {{contrast}} to the posterior- and horizontal-canal variants, data on the frequency and therapeutic management of anterior-canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> (AC-BPPV) are sparse. To synthesize the existing body of evidence into a systematic review regarding the incidence and treatment of AC-BPPV. MethodszzSystematic search of medical databases employing predefined criteria, using the term “anterior canal <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo.</b> ” ResultszzThe electronic search retrieved 178 unique citations, 31 of which were considered eligible for further analysis. Analysis of the collected data revealed an estimated occurrence of AC-BPPV among <b>benign</b> paroxysmal <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> patients of 3 % (range 1 – 17. 1 %). No controlled therapeutic trials could be identified, and so the analysis was focused on un-controlled case series. Treatment was categorized into three groups: Epley maneuver, Yacovi-no maneuver, and specific, nonstandard maneuvers described in individual articles. All three categories demonstrated success rates of over 75 %, and the overall sample-size-weighted mean was 85. 6 %. ConclusionszzThe present analysis demonstrated that AC-BPPV comprises about 3 % of all BPPV cases. It can be treated safely using the Epley, Yacovino, and other maneuvers with rates of symptom resolution lying {{in the range of}} that reported for the other, more frequent canal vari-ants. Multicenter controlled trials are needed in order to develop evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of AC-BPPV.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} for the diagnosis and treatment both of geo-tropic and apogeotropic Lateral Semicircular Canal <b>Benign</b> Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> is proposed. To this end, a {{new strategy}} of approach to Lateral Semicircular Canal <b>Benign</b> Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> is described in order to rapidly highlight both the side and the affected canal. Thus, in the first treatment session, using the so-called “strategy of the minimum stimulus”, {{a large percentage of}} cases are successfully treated, with the lowest number of vertigos for the patient. Following a review of the literature, 269 case studies, personally observed over a 4 -year period, are described. The diagnostic strategy is performed by a single manoeuvre to determine whether the posterior semicircular canal or the lateral canal is affected. In the latter case, it is possible to highlight the affected sides both of the geotropic and apogeotropic forms. The therapeutic strategy comprises several liberatory manoeuvres, barbecue rotation techniques (Vannucchi-Asprella, Lempert), and Gufoni manoeuvre by continuously monitoring the ampullofugal movement of the otoliths. Almost 98 % of cases are successfully treated at the first treatment diagnostic-therapeutic session. This approach to Lateral Semicircular Canal <b>Benign</b> Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo</b> allows a two-fold goal to be achieved, i. e., to effect both diagnosis and treatment at the first examination. Furthermore, thanks to the philosophy of the approach to <b>Benign</b> Paroxysmal <b>Positional</b> <b>Vertigo,</b> called the “Strategy of the minimum stimulus”, patient compliance is very good since {{a very small number of}} vertigos are produced, and few neuro-vegetative disorders...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Conventional {{vestibular}} {{tests are}} not efficient instruments {{to evaluate the}} level of commitment in the life quality of a patient with dizziness. The quality of life questionnaire specific for dizziness, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, was translated and validated into Portuguese intending to get over this difficulty in quantifying the vertiginous patient symptoms. Objective: This study aims at comparing the Brazilian Dizziness Handicap Inventory results before and after personalized vestibular rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with chronic <b>vertigo</b> from <b>benign</b> paroxist <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> and chronic vertigo from other causes. Method: Retrospective study of 30 medical records; {{all of which were}} submitted to the Brazilian Dizziness Handicap Inventory before and after the personalized vestibular rehabilitation treatment. Results: In the total scores average of vestibular pre-rehabilitation, the <b>benign</b> paroxist <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> had a score of 47. 93 ± 24. 46 and the chronic vertigo for other causes of 54. 40 ± 20. 97. At discharge, the <b>benign</b> paroxist <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo</b> scores average was of 6. 13 ± 7. 22 and in the chronic vertigo from other causes, the scores average was of 26. 13 ± 20. 51. Conclusion: The commitment of the life quality of individuals with dizziness, both for chronic vertigo from other causes and <b>benign</b> paroxist <b>positional</b> <b>vertigo,</b> was very similar, confirming an important commitment. The vestibular rehabilitation effect for both cases was also efficient and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory was an efficient instrument to evaluate the vertiginous case evolution...|$|R
