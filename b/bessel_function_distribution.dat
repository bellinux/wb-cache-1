50|$|The variance-gamma distribution, {{generalized}} Laplace distribution or <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> <b>distribution</b> is {{a continuous}} probability distribution that {{is defined as}} the normal variance-mean mixture where the mixing density is the gamma distribution. The tails of the distribution decrease more slowly than the normal distribution. It is therefore suitable to model phenomena where numerically large values are more probable than is the case for the normal distribution. Examples are returns from financial assets and turbulent wind speeds. The distribution was introduced in the financial literature by Madan and Seneta. The variance-gamma distributions form a subclass of the generalised hyperbolic distributions.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the aggregate claims in one year {{plays an important role}} in Actuarial Statistics for computing, for example, insurance premiums when both the number and size of the claims must be implemented into the model. When the number of claims follows a Poisson distribution the aggregated distribution is called the compound Poisson distribution. In this article we assume that the claim size follows an exponential distribution and later we make an extensive study of this model by assuming a bidimensional prior distribution for the parameters of the Poisson and exponential distribution with marginal gamma. This study carries us to obtain expressions for net premiums, marginal and posterior distributions in terms of some well-known special functions used in statistics. Later, a Bayesian robustness study of this model is made. Bayesian robustness on bidimensional models was deeply treated in the 1990 s, producing numerous results, but few applications dealing with this problem can be found in the literature.

40|$|Recent {{scenarios}} of the TeV-scale brane cosmology suggest {{a possibility of}} existence {{in the early universe}} of two-dimensional topological defects: relativistic membranes. Like cosmic strings, oscillating membranes could emit gravitational radiation contributing to a stochastic background of gravitational waves. We calculate dilaton and gravitational radiation from a closed toroidal membrane excited along one homology cycle. The spectral-angular distributions of dilaton and gravitational radiation are obtained in a closed form in terms of <b>Bessel’s</b> <b>functions.</b> The angular <b>distributions</b> are affected by oscillating factors due to an interference of radiation from different segments of the membrane. The dilaton radiation power is dominated by a few lower harmonics of the basic frequency, while the spectrum of the gravitational radiation contains also a substantial contribution from higher harmonics. The radiative lifetime of the membrane is determined by its tension and depends weakly on the ratio of two radii of the torus. Qualitatively it is equal to the ratio of the membrane area at the maximal extension to the gravitational radius of the membrane as a whole. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – In {{cylindrical}} coordinate, {{there are}} two types of <b>Bessel</b> <b>functions.</b> These <b>functions</b> are the <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> and the modified <b>Bessel</b> <b>function.</b> Both functions are expressed mathematically by infinite power series, and each one consists of different orders, beginning with the zero-order, and then the first order, the second order, and so on. The <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> is the solution of the Bessel differential equation, which is a linear, second-order ordinary differential equation. Similarly, the modified <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> is the solution of modified Bessel differential equation. The difference between these two differential equations is the signs of the non-differential t rms. The applications of <b>Bessel</b> <b>functions</b> are in the scientific areas of elasticity, electrical field theory, aerodynamic flutter analysis, fluid flow, and heat transfer by conduction. An executable computer program has been developed in this study for the numerical computation of the <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> and the modified <b>Bessel</b> <b>function.</b> This program i...|$|R
