The plot follows novelist Jackson Curtis as {{he attempts to}} <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> family to safety amid a worldwide geological disaster. The film refers to Mayanism and the 2012 phenomenon in its portrayal of cataclysmic events.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Britain Lock {{served on}} the Channel Front, flying {{offensive}} sweeps over France. Lock went on to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> overall total to 26 aerial victories, one shared destroyed and eight probable in 25 weeks of operational sorties over a one-year period—during which time he was hospitalised for six months. Included in his victory total were 20 German fighter aircraft, 18 of them Messerschmitt Bf 109s. In mid-1941 Lock was promoted {{to the rank of}} Flight Lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Brand's {{involvement}} in smuggling Jews into Hungary began in July 1941, when Hansi Brand's sister and brother-in-law were {{caught up in}} the Kamianets-Podilskyi deportations. The Hungarian government sent 18,000 Jews to German-occupied Ukraine because they were unable to prove they were Hungarian citizens; 14,000–16,000 of them were shot by the SS. Brand paid a Hungarian counter-espionage officer to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> wife's relatives back safely.|$|E

5|$|In Red Dead Redemption, players mainly control former outlaw John Marston as he {{sets out}} to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> former gang to justice. The team used motion capture to record the body {{movements}} of the characters and hired professional actors to provide voices. Red Dead Redemption features an original score composed over fifteen months by two music producers. Collaboratively, the duo composed over fourteen hours of music, which scores the game's missions.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, Jack (Matthew Fox) visits his mother, (Veronica Hamel) {{who tells}} him that Christian has left for Australia, and asks Jack to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> father back. Jack reluctantly agrees, and after {{arriving}} in Sydney searches the hotel at which his father was staying. The manager informs Jack that his father has not slept at the hotel for several days following an incident at a bar, and Jack finds bottles of alcohol, pills, and his father's wallet in Christian's room.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery became Commander Fleet Air, West Coast, {{with his}} {{headquarters}} at the Naval Air Station, San Diego, in January 1945. He tried to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> experiences in combat {{to bear in}} his new role, which involved supplying the combat units with men and equipment. For his services in this job, he was awarded a second Legion of Merit. In July 1945 he became commander of Pacific Fleet Air Forces, with the rank of vice admiral.|$|E

5|$|The VIII Corps {{fell under}} Patton's Third Army, and trained in England from March to late May 1944. Two {{weeks before the}} invasion, the corps was {{pulled out of the}} Third Army and placed in Omar Bradley's First Army. First Army was {{responsible}} for the D-Day landings in Normandy, and once the Allies were established on shore, Middleton was to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> VIII Corps across. Shortly before the invasion, Middleton took his corps to Southampton where they awaited their channel crossing time.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Spartans {{sent out}} a new commander, Anaxibius, to Abydos. For a time, he enjoyed a number of successes against Pharnabazus, and seized a number of Athenian {{merchant}} ships. Worried that Thrasybulus's accomplishments were being undermined, the Athenians sent Iphicrates to the region to confront Anaxibius. For a time, the two forces merely raided each other's territory, but eventually Iphicrates succeeded in guessing where Anaxibius would <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> troops on a return march from a campaign against Antandrus, and ambushed the Spartan force. When Anaxibius and his men, who were strung out {{in the line of}} march, had entered the rough, mountainous terrain in which Iphicrates and his men were waiting, the Athenians emerged and ambushed them, killing Anaxibius and many others.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 49 BC, the {{hardened}} legions of Caesar crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> army, and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, while Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Afterwards Caesar {{turned his attention to}} the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one, albeit with inferior quality troops. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel's {{unit was}} called up in March 1891 during the shearers' strike {{that had begun}} earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small {{detachment}} of Queensland Police, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of strikebreakers to a station north of Charleville. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted sheep shearers. When the inspector {{in charge of the}} police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in Clermont, and later the district around Longreach.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{destroyer}} attack, the High Seas Fleet disengaged, and Iron Duke and {{the rest}} of the Grand Fleet saw no further action in the battle. This was, in part, due to confusion aboard Iron Duke over the exact location and course of the German fleet; without this information, Jellicoe could not <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> fleet to action. At 21:30, the Grand Fleet began to reorganise into its nighttime cruising formation. Early on the morning of 1 June, the Grand Fleet combed the area, looking for damaged German ships, but after spending several hours searching, they found none. Iron Duke returned to Scapa Flow, arriving at 11:30. Over the course of the battle, Iron Duke had fired ninety rounds from her main battery, along with fifty rounds from her secondary guns.|$|E
5|$|For his {{selection}} of sailing master, Hall first turned to Sidney O. Budington, then to George Tyson, who both initially declined due to prior whaling commitments. When those commitments fell through, Hall named Budington as sailing master and Tyson assistant navigator. Budington and Tyson had decades of experience between them captaining whaling vessels. In effect, the Polaris now had three captains, a fact which would weigh {{heavily on the}} fate of the expedition. Further complicating matters, in 1863 Budington and Hall had quarrelled because Budington had denied permission for Hall to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> Inuit guides, Joseph Ebierbing and Tookoolito, with him on an expedition {{at a time when they}} were ill and in Budington's care.|$|E

5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had been left behind at Fort Henry, to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> men to Fort Donelson.|$|E
5|$|Imamura ordered Adachi {{to capture}} the Allied bases at Wau, Bena Bena and Mount Hagen. To support these operations, Imperial General Headquarters {{transferred}} the 7th Air Division to New Guinea. On 27 July 1943, Lieutenant General Kumaichi Teramoto's Fourth Air Army was assigned to Imamura's command to control the 6th and 7th Air Divisions, the 14th Air Brigade and some miscellaneous squadrons. By June, Adachi had three divisions in New Guinea; the 41st Division at Wewak and the 20th Division around Madang, both recently arrived from Palau, and the 51st Division in the Salamaua area, {{a total of about}} 80,000 men. Of these only the 51st Division was in contact with the enemy. Like Blamey, Adachi faced formidable difficulties of transportation and supply just to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> troops into battle.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 Thorkildsen {{finished}} fourth at European Championships in Helsinki only managing three throws {{with the best}} result of 81.55 metres after picking up an injury during warm-up. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London he threw 82.63 and finished sixth which became fifth several years later after disqualification of the original silver medalist Oleksandr Pyatnytsya for doping offence. Next year's World Championships at Moscow brought Thorkildsen a sixth place with a throw of 81.06 in {{what turned out to}} be his last appearance at a major championship competition. Injuries forced him to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> 2014 season to a premature end before the European Championships. He later decided to sit out the entire 2015 season but aimed at comeback in 2016. However, in May 2016 Thorkildsen announced his retirement from sports.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile from the place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} Calhoun's arrival in Washington, D.C., Tyler {{attempted}} to quickly finalize the treaty negotiations. Sam Houston, President of the Texas Republic, fearing Mexican retaliation, {{insisted on a}} tangible demonstration of U.S. commitments {{to the security of}} Texas. When key Texas diplomats failed to appear on schedule, the delay compelled Tyler to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> new Secretary of State directly into negotiations. Secretary Calhoun was directed to honor former Secretary Upshur's verbal assurances of protection now offered by Calhoun in writing, to provide for U.S. military intervention in the event that Mexico used force to hold Texas. Tyler deployed U.S. Navy vessels to the Gulf of Mexico and ordered army units mobilized, entirely paid for with $100,000 of executive branch contingency funds. The move side-stepped constitutional requirements that Congress authorize appropriations for war.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan joined No. 1 Squadron RAF as {{squadron}} leader and led night fighter operations in defence of Britain. In May 1942 {{he was awarded}} the Distinguished Service Order after claiming five more victories flying with Karel Kuttelwascher. Coupled with the two over Malta it qualified him as a night fighter ace. By July 1942 MacLachlan's tally stood at 13 enemy aircraft shot down including 7 at night. MacLachlan left the squadron for a position at the Air Fighting Development Unit (ADFU). In October 1942 MacLachlan departed to conduct lecturing tours to the United States. He returned to Britain with the ADFU in mid-1943. In June he joined No. 132 Squadron RAF on cross-Channel patrols over Europe. MacLachlan achieved his last 3 victories during these operations—all in one mission—to <b>bring</b> <b>his</b> final tally to 16.|$|E
