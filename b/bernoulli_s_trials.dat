40|$|The aim of {{the first}} {{experiment}} of this thesis {{was to determine whether}} the ingestion of a concentrated sodium chloride solution (100 mEq/ 1) during exercise would expand the plasma volume when fluid was ingested at approximately half the rate at which it was being lost as sweat. Six male cyclists exercised for 90 minutes in the heat (32 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 5 % RH) at 66 ± 1 % of VO₂ₘₐₓ while ingesting either no fluid CNF), water (W), or a saline CS) solution (100 mEq/ 1). In the Wand <b>S</b> <b>trials,</b> subjects drank 400 ml of the fluid immediately prior to commencing exercise, and 100 ml of fluid every 10 minutes during exercise until 80 minutes. In the <b>S</b> <b>trial</b> sodium chloride was ingested in capsules. One capsule containing 0. 585 g of sodium chloride was ingested with every 100 ml of water. At the end of the 90 minute exercise bout they rested in a sitting position for one hour in cool conditions (22 ± 1 °C and 70 ± 5 % RH). After the initial drop in plasma volume due to the onset of exercise. plasma volume decreased progressively during the NF trial and was significantly less than the 10 minute value at 80 and 90 minutes (p< 0. 0033). At 40, 60, 80 and 90 minutes of exercise, the plasma volume in the NF trial was significantly less than in the W and the <b>S</b> <b>trials</b> (p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the W and the <b>S</b> <b>trials</b> at any time. Further, after the initial drop in plasma volume due to the onset of exercise. plasma volume did not decrease any further in either the W or the <b>S</b> <b>trial.</b> Plasma sodium concentrations in the NF and the <b>S</b> <b>trial</b> were significantly elevated at 40, 60, 80 and 90 minutes (p< 0. 0033). Plasma sodium concentration in the NF and the <b>S</b> <b>trials</b> were also significantly higher than in the W trial at 80 and 90 minutes of exercise (p< 0. 05). Since the ingestion of a sodium chloride solution containing 100 mEq/ 1 did not have a beneficial effect on plasma volume and plasma sodium concentration, when fluid ingestion rates were approximately half of the rate of sweat loss, it is concluded the under these conditions, the ingestion of a concentrated sodium chloride beverage has no advantage over the ingestion of water. The {{aim of the}} second experiment of this thesis was to determine the effect of varying concentrations of sodium chloride ingestion on fluid balance, when the rate of fluid ingestion matched the sweat rate. Six male cyclists cycled for 4 hours at 55 % of VO₂ₘₐₓ in mild conditions (20 ± 1 °c and 70 ± 5 % RH), while ingesting either a low salt (LS) (4. 6 mEq/ 1), a medium salt (MS) (50 mEq/ 1) or a high salt (HS) (100 mEq/ 1) beverage. Each beverage also contained a glucose polymer in an 8 % concentration (8 g/ 100 ml). The subjects ingested 400 ml of beverage immediately prior to commencement of exercise, and 150 ml of fluid every 10 minutes during exercise until 220 minutes. Sodium chloride in the MS and HS trials was given to the subjects as supplemental gel capsules so that the drink was palatable. At the end of exercise, subjects recovered in a sitting position for 30 minutes. At the end of the 4 hours of exercise, fluid loss via the urine was significantly greater in the LS and the MS trials than in the HS trial (p< 0. 05). As a result, the fluid deficits in the LS and the MS trials were significantly greater than the fluid deficit in the HS trial. There was no significant difference between the MS and the LS trials for urinary fluid loss. During the 4 hour exercise bout, plasma sodium concentrations in the LS, the MS and the HS trials were not significantly different from one another, nor were they significantly different from resting values. There was no significant difference in the rectal temperature response to exercise in the three trials. It can therefore be concluded that in conditions where fluid ingestion matches sweat rate, attenuation of urinary fluid loss to optimise fluid replacement, relies on the ingestion of sodium chloride in quantities greater than that lost in the sweat. Therefore, for the ingestion of sodium chloride in excess of that which is currently available in sports drinks to beneficial, fluid must be ingested in volumes matching sweat loss...|$|R
40|$|In renal {{transplantation}} blood cyclosporine levels {{soon after}} surgery {{act as a}} major determinant of rejection: Insights from the MY. <b>S.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>Trial.</b> BackgroundTarget organs express antigens recognized directly by antigen-specific T cells, and their recognition is crucial to precipitate rejection. Then, the earliest T-cell activation is inhibited by cyclosporine A (CsA), the lowest would be the risk of rejection. Here, we aimed to assess this possibility in a large cohort of de novo kidney transplant recipients participating in an ongoing clinical trial, the Mycophenolate Steroid-Sparing (MY. <b>S.</b> <b>S.)</b> <b>Trial.</b> MethodsThree-hundred-thirty-four patients entered the prospective, multicenter MY. <b>S.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>trial.</b> The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the predictive value of serial evaluation of blood CsA trough concentration (C 0) and 2 -hour postdose drug (C 2) levels alone or in combination, and to identify which is the critical posttransplant measurement to target CsA therapy in order to minimize the risk of acute rejection. A very large number of CsA trough (N = 2236) and C 2 (N = 2128) measurements during the first 6 months postsurgery were available for analysis. Patients with delayed graft function were excluded. ResultsCsA trough levels measured at day 2 posttransplant were the strongest predictor of acute graft rejection over 6 -month follow-up. Levels within 300 to 440 ng/mL were associated with the lowest risk of rejection, while for levels lower than 300 ng/mL, the risk of acute rejection was more than doubled. Higher levels failed to provide any further protection from graft rejection. CsA trough values predicted allograft rejection with an accuracy of 74 %, while C 2 levels considered alone had no predictive values at all. ConclusionFindings that among serial daily measurements posttransplant those taken as early as at day 2 have by far the highest capacity to predict rejection episodes, underline the need of targeting CsA therapy very early posttransplant with the goal to modulate early enough T-cell activation at the interface between the recipient's blood and the graft where alloimmune response actually initiates...|$|R

Now lower molecular weight HES 130 / 0. 4 is the preferred colloid in Scandinavian intensive care units (ICUs) and 1 st choice fluid for patients with severe sepsis. However, HES 130 / 0. 4 is largely unstudied in patients with severe sepsis. Methods/Design The 6 <b>S</b> <b>trial</b> will randomise 800 patients with severe sepsis in 30 Scandinavian ICUs to masked fluid resuscitation using either 6 % HES 130 / 0. 4 in Ringer's acetate or Ringer's acetate alone. The composite endpoint of 90 -day mortality or end-stage kidney failure is the primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures are severe bleeding or allergic reactions, organ failure, acute kidney failure, days alive without renal replacement therapy or ventilator support and 28 -day and 1 / 2 - and one-year mortality. The sample size will allow the detection of a 10 % absolute {{difference between the two groups}} in the composite endpoint with a power of 80 %.
