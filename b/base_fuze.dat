50|$|<b>Base</b> <b>fuzes</b> are {{enclosed}} {{within the}} base of the shell and are hence not damaged by the initial impact with the target. Their delay timing may be adjustable before firing. They use graze action and have not been widely used by field artillery. <b>Base</b> <b>fuzed</b> shells were used by coast artillery (and warships) against armoured warships into the 1950s. They have also had some use against tanks, including with High Explosive Squash Head (HESH), also called High Explosive Plastic (HEP) used after World War 2 by 105mm artillery for self-defence against tanks and by tanks.|$|R

50|$|Dunnite {{typically}} did not detonate on striking heavy armor. Rather, {{the shell}} encasing it would penetrate the armor, {{after which the}} charge would be triggered by a <b>base</b> <b>fuze.</b>|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{artillery}} time fuzes are {{fitted to}} {{the nose of}} the shell. One exception was the 1950s design US 8-inch nuclear shell (M422) that had a triple-deck mechanical time <b>base</b> <b>fuze.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most {{artillery}} fuzes are nose <b>fuzes.</b> However, <b>base</b> <b>fuzes</b> {{have been}} used with armour piercing shells and for squash head (HESH or HEP) anti-tank shells. At least one nuclear shell and its non-nuclear spotting version also used a multi-deck mechanical time fuze fitted into its base.|$|R
50|$|Graze fuzes {{function}} {{when the}} shell is suddenly slowed down, e.g. by hitting {{the ground or}} going through a wall. This deceleration causes the firing pin to move forward, or the detonator to move backward, sharply and strike each other. Graze is the only percussion mechanism {{that can be used}} in <b>base</b> <b>fuzes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The SB-81 is an Italian plastic cased minimum metal {{anti-tank}} blast mine {{dating from}} the early 1980s. The mine uses an air pressure <b>based</b> <b>fuze,</b> which gives it protection against overpressure and blast. It can therefore {{be regarded as a}} blast resistant mine. The mine can be scattered by hand or by mine laying systems.|$|R

50|$|The British are {{reported}} to have initially used some Common pointed shells (semi-armour piercing, with fuze in the shell base) in the Boer War, {{in addition to the}} standard Common shell. However, the common pointed shell proved unsatisfactory, with the <b>base</b> <b>fuze</b> frequently working loose and falling out during flight. In 1914, the cast-iron common shell and tracer were the only available rounds.|$|E

50|$|The 1954 {{series of}} high-drag bombs {{was built in}} six sizes: 250 kg (550 lb), 500 kg (1,100 lb), 1500 kg (3,300 lb), 3,000 kg (6,600 lb), 5,000 kg (11,000 lb), and 9,000 kg (20,000 lb). The smaller (less than 3,000 kg) bombs had a single nose and a single tail fuze, while the larger weapons shared a single nose <b>fuze</b> and two <b>base</b> <b>fuzes.</b> The FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) weapon was roughly {{comparable}} to the wartime Grand Slam bomb. It was used by Russian aircraft designers {{as a substitute for}} early nuclear weapons when determining the size and clearances of bomb bays.|$|R
50|$|Armor-piercing shells as {{dedicated}} anti-tank projectiles {{are common}} in over 50mm caliber artillery but the tendency is to use semi-armor-piercing high-explosive (SAPHE) shells, which have less anti-armor capability, but far greater anti-materiel/personnel effects. The modern SAPHE projectiles still have a ballistic cap, hardened body and <b>base</b> <b>fuze,</b> but {{tend to have a}} far thinner body material and higher explosive content (4-15%). Common abbreviations for modern AP and SAP shells are: HEI(BF), SAPHE, SAPHEI, and SAPHEI-T.|$|E
5000|$|The high-explosive squash head (HESH) was {{developed}} by Charles Dennistoun Burney in the 1940s for the British war effort, originally as an anti-fortification [...] "wallbuster" [...] munition for use against concrete. HESH rounds were thin metal shells filled with plastic explosive and a delayed-action <b>base</b> <b>fuze.</b> The plastic explosive is [...] "squashed" [...] against {{the surface of the}} target on impact and spreads out to form a disc or [...] "pat" [...] of explosive. The <b>base</b> <b>fuze</b> detonates the explosive milliseconds later, creating a shock wave that, owing to its large surface area and direct contact with the target, is transmitted through the material. At the point where the compression and tension waves intersect a high-stress zone is created in the metal, causing pieces of steel to be projected off the interior wall at high velocity. This fragmentation by blast wave is known as spalling, with the fragments themselves known as spall. Unlike high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, which are shaped charge ammunition, HESH shells are not specifically designed to perforate the armour of main battle tanks. HESH shells rely instead on the transmission of the shock wave through the solid steel armour.|$|E

The <b>base</b> <b>fuze</b> detonates the explosive milliseconds later, creating a shock wave that, owing to its large surface area and direct contact with the target, is transmitted through the material. In the case of the metal armour of a tank, the compression shock wave is conducted through the armour {{to the point where it}} reaches the metal/air interface (the hollow crew compartment), where some of the energy is reflected as a tension wave. At the point where the compression and tension waves intersect, a high-stress zone is created in the metal, causing pieces of steel to be projected off the interior wall at high velocity. This fragmentation by blast wave is known as spalling, with the fragments themselves known as spall. The spall travels through the interior of the vehicle at high velocity, killing or injuring the crew, damaging equipment, and/or igniting ammunition and fuel. Unlike high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds, which are shaped charge ammunition, HESH shells are not specifically designed to perforate the armour of main battle tanks. HESH shells rely instead on the transmission of the shock wave through the solid steel armour.|$|E
50|$|A <b>base</b> impact <b>fuze</b> screwed {{into the}} rear of a {{projectile}} to protect the fuze during impact. It delays the shell's detonation about 25 ms after impact, allowing the projectile to penetrate the target prior to detonation.|$|R

25|$|Finland {{captured}} several 130mm/50 B13 guns {{during the}} Battle of Hanko. The captured guns were known in Finland as 130/50 N or 130 mm 50 kaliiperin merikanuuna mallia N (130 mm 50 caliber coastal gun model N). Soviet Union had four batteries of B-13 guns in Hanko, {{but they were}} damaged or blown up when the Russians evacuated Hanko. Valtion Tykkitehdas (State Artillery Factory) and Helsinki Naval Base ordance personnel succeeded in repairing five guns. Only a few hundred rounds of ammunition were captured, so Finns began manufacturing suitable ammunition domestically. Captured Russian ammunition included modern high explosive fragmentation shells with point and <b>base</b> <b>fuzes</b> and semi-armour piercing shells, while the Finnish produced ammunition were older style high explosive shells. Three captured guns were used for {{short periods of time}} in Pihlajasaari and Miessaari forts by Uusimaa Coastal Brigade. Two guns were used to arm the auxiliary gunboats Aunus and Viena.|$|R
50|$|The shell was a APCBC-HE-T design. It {{consisted}} of the shell body fitted with penetrating (AP) and ballistic caps (BC), an explosive filler (HE) and a tracer unit (T) that was incorporated into the <b>base</b> <b>fuze.</b> Phlegmatized PETN or RDX were commonplace as the explosive filling. Pzgr. 39 was only used in guns firing fixed ammunition. The same Pzgr. 39 shells of a certain caliber could be fitted to different cartridge cases. For example the 7.5 cm Pak 40 L/46 antitank gun and the 7.5 cm KwK 40 L/48 tank gun fired the same projectile, {{even though they had}} completely different cartridge cases.|$|E
50|$|Fuzes {{normally}} have two explosive components in their explosive train: {{a very small}} detonator (or primer) struck by a firing pin, and a booster charge at the <b>base</b> of the <b>fuze</b> (sometimes called the 'magazine'). This booster is powerful enough to detonate the main charge in a high-explosive shell or the ejecting charge in a carrier shell. The two charges are typically connected by a 'flash tube'.|$|R
50|$|The mine {{consists}} of a cylindrical steel main body containing a 60 millimeter mortar shell body (originally the M49A2), linked to a tall thin fuze stand. The fuze stand held either a pin <b>based</b> tripwire <b>fuze</b> or a combination pressure tripwire fuze with a pronged pressure cap. Later fuzes were sensitive to pressure or pull and could be used with a tripwire. When the mine is triggered a black powder charge launches the mortar shell out of {{the main body of}} the mine and into the air. A pyrotechnic delay fuse triggers the mine when it has risen to between two and three meters in height. The lethal radius of the mine is reported to be approximately ten meters.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{there are}} {{problems}} such as neglected loading and mistaken loading of cannonball fuze in practical manufacture. If the workers redetect them, they should knock down the cannonball one by one, but it is inefficiency and dangerous. In this paper it introduces a system that detects and judges automatically the loading of cannonball <b>fuze</b> <b>based</b> on computer aid technique, image processing technique. The productivity is improved. The software {{of the system is}} developed by Visual C++. ...|$|R
50|$|In Germany, {{more than}} 30 {{approaches}} to proximity fuze development were under way, but none saw service. These included acoustic fuzes triggered by engine sound, {{one based on}} electrostatic fields developed by Rheinmetall Borsig AG, and radio fuzes. A German neon lamp tube and a design of a prototype proximity <b>fuze</b> <b>based</b> on capacitive effects was received by British Intelligence in mid November 1939. By {{the end of the}} war, only one was actually in production, a complicated radio proximity fuze for rockets and bombs (but not designed to withstand the acceleration of artillery shells).|$|R
50|$|The {{systems were}} {{developed}} by the Bulgarian Institute of Metal Science, and are <b>based</b> around electronic <b>fuzes</b> with broadly similar functionality. The fuzes use two sensors. The first, an acoustic sensor, arms the mine as a helicopter approaches. The second sensor is a radar, which locates the target and triggers the mine at the appropriate point. The mines all use a number of large Misznay Schardin effect warheads to project large numbers of fragments to an effective range of around 200 meters. Jane's Mines and Mine Clearance speculates that IFF could {{be integrated into the}} fuze circuit to discriminate against friendly aircraft, lowering the chances of friendly fire.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 4 mine or Mine G.S. Mk IV was a British {{anti-tank}} mine used during World War II. Externally the mine has a cylindrical main body filled with explosive either TNT or Baratol. The mine {{is covered by}} a pressure plate, which {{is attached to the}} mine body by four pins which sit in vertical slots in clips that fold up {{from the bottom of the}} mine. The mine uses the Shear-pin <b>based</b> Contact Mine <b>Fuze</b> No.3 Mk I. The fuze consists simply of a spring-loaded striker pin restrained by a shear pin. Sufficient pressure on the pressure plate presses the plate down on the head of the fuze, breaking the shear wire and releasing the striker, which is driven into the detonator by the striker spring.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 19th century, most {{artillery}} fuzes are fitted to the nose of the projectile. The <b>base</b> of the <b>fuze</b> is screwed into a recess, and its nose is designed to conform to the shape of the shell’s ogive. The depth of recess can vary with the type of shell and fuze. Artillery fuzes were sometimes specific to particular types of gun or howitzer due to their characteristics, notable differences in muzzle velocity and hence the sensitivity of safety & arming mechanisms. However, by World War 2, while there were exceptions, most fuzes of one nation could be used with any required artillery shell of that nation, if it could be physically fitted to it, although different army and navy procurement arrangements often prevented this. The exceptions were mortar bomb fuzes, and this continues.|$|R
5000|$|Until September 1914, {{the only}} 18-pounder issued shell was shrapnel, {{fitted with a}} No. 80 [...] "Time & Percussion" [...] <b>fuze</b> (<b>based</b> on a Krupp design). The timer was set to open the shell and fire the bullets forward before it hit the ground. No 80 Fuze was an igniferous type of time fuze (as were most First World War time fuzes), meaning that it burnt {{gunpowder}} at a known rate to give a time from firing to fuze functioning. The shell did not burst, but projected spherical lead-antimony bullets forward in a cone, these bullets were effective up to 300 yards from the burst. 18-pounder carried 374 of the 41/pound size bullets. The fuze was designed to function as close as 50 yards from the muzzle if required, in order to {{eliminate the need for}} case shot. Observing shrapnel bursts was difficult and, after many experiments, gunpowder pellets were added to the tube between the fuze and the gunpowder ejecting charge in the base of the shell in order to emit a puff of smoke, this had the added advantage of widening the cone of the bullet spread.|$|R
