Within {{the frame of}} the rigorous thesis, a screening of alkaloids from some <b>botanical</b> <b>taxons</b> used or toxikologically significant in Europe (and also in traditional Chinese medicine) on inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was performed. Using a suitable extraction method the summary extracts from morfological parts of Laurus nobilis L. (leaf), Buxus sempervirens L. (sprigs and leaf), Lycopodium clavatum L. (aerial parts), Nelumbo nucifera Gaertn. (stamens and bulb), Fritillaria thunbergii L. (tuber), Fritillaria cirrhosa L. (tuber), Stemona spp. (root) a Stephania tetrandra S. Moore (root) have been obtained. Individual extracts were prepared by digestion and further analyzed by TLC on silica gel in neutral and basic system for alkaloid content (Dragendorff-reactant). Inhibitory activities of the extracts and of the standards (physostigmine, galanthamine) were subsequently determined by means of autobiographical method using TLC (silica gel, only neutral developing system).

40|$|Peach palm (Bactris gasipaes Kunth) has had {{a central}} place in the {{livelihoods}} {{of people in the}} Americas since pre-Columbian times, notably for its edible fruits and multi-purpose wood.

Drawing on a combination of molecular and phenotypic diversity data, modeling of past climate suitability and existing literature, we present an integrated hypothesis about peach palm's domestication. We support a single initial domestication event in south western Amazonia, giving rise to var. chichagui type 3, the putative incipient domesticate. We argue that subsequent dispersal by humans across western Amazonia, and possibly into Central America allowed for secondary domestication events through hybridization with resident wild populations, and differential human selection pressures, resulting in the diversity of present-day landraces. The high phenotypic diversity in the Ecuadorian and northern Peruvian Amazon suggest that human selection of different traits was particularly intense there. While acknowledging the need for further data collection, we believe that our results contribute new insights and tools to understand domestication and dispersal patterns of this important native staple, as well as to plan for its conservation.

40|$|The {{vegetation}} of the Sangha {{region in}} the North of the Congo Republic is composed of a mosaic of forest formations including semi-deciduous humid dense forests characterized by Ulmaceae and Sterculiaceae, evergreen forests with Gilbertiodendron dewevrei and woodland with Marantaceae. Palynological analyses proved that this region witnessed an arid phase 2500 years ago. This was associated with an important reduction of the forest cover and an equal extension of savannahs that could have facilitated the migrations of the Bantou people and the propagation of the shifting cultivation agriculture in the whole region which is, still at the moment, sparsely populated. In order to verify climatic and anthropological influences on the present composition of the forest vegetation, a pedological investigation {{has been set up}} in the region of Pokola (1. 5 ° N; 16. 5 °E) comprising 43 drillings and 12 pits along a gradient covering the different forest types. Charcoal has been found in 84 % of the cores in all the forest formations especially between 30 cm and 60 cm depth. Charred oil palm seeds (Elaeis guineensis), often a culture accompanying species, have been found in 60 % of the pits. C 14 analysis revealed dates between 600 and 2200 years BP. Pedological analyses showed the association between semi-deciduous humid dense forest and red ferralsols, between Marantaceae woodlands and ochre ferralsols (poorer than the former) and between Gilbertiodendron dewevrei stands and pseudogleys and gleysols. The identification of the <b>botanical</b> <b>taxon</b> of charcoal fragments from tropical regions deals with important limitations due to scarce reference collections that are far from being complete. Therefore it is crucial to combine a thorough knowledge of the different vegetation types and their character species with a wood anatomical study. Given the hypothesised strong influence of man induced perturbations and past climatic changes, these results emphasize the importance of edaphic factors in differentiating the forest stands in the North of the Congo Republic. They also permit a better understanding of a potential evolution of the forests in this region driven by the actual climatic changes...|$|E
40|$|In {{line with}} the focus on {{specialty}} coffee, we will concentrate on the breeding of Coffea arabica. Contrary to what many may believe, breeding for coffee quality {{is a relatively new}} initiative. The challenges and opportunities that breeders face when selecting varieties for high quality are discussed. In the coffee production sector, when talking about varieties, most people will mention Robusta and Arabica. This confusion between species, Coffea canephora and C. Arabica respectively, and varieties is typical of a pure commodity sector where only the largest and most obvious differences are recognized. According to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, a variety is "a plant grouping within a single <b>botanical</b> <b>taxon</b> of the lowest known rank, which grouping" can be: "i) defined by the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or combination of genotypes, ii) distinguished from any other plant grouping by the expression of {{at least one of the}} said characteristics and iii) considered as a unit with regard to its suitability for being propagated unchanged". One would argue that Bourbon or Tipica are Arabica coffee varieties and it is true that most coffee people would be able to roughly describe the phenotype of each. However, referring to the definition of a variety: exactly what are the characteristics expressed by Bourbon or Tipica? Are they distinguishable from other Arabica plants? Further adding to the complexity is the recognition by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) of three Arabica coffee categories: Colombian milds, other milds and Brazilian natural. Historically, the mainstream coffee market has been based largely on this classification and the reputation of quality coffee tends to be associated with geographic origin irrespective of the variety or botanical type. In this chapter, the concept of coffee variety and its relation to market demand are discussed. The current knowledge of coffee genetics and quality are also discussed, along with the gaps in knowledge that still remain. Breeding strategies are then proposed, stressing the need for new high throughput phenotyping of selection criteria linked to quality. Finally, some thoughts are offered about how producers might take advantage of new advances in genetics and selection methodologies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
