500|$|In a {{retrospective}} review for AllMusic, Erlewine—the website's senior editor—claimed that New York Dolls {{was a more}} quintessential proto-punk album {{than any of the}} Stooges' releases because of how it [...] "plunders history while celebrating it, creating a sleazy urban mythology along the way". David Fricke argued that it was a more definitive glam rock album than David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) or anything by Marc Bolan because of how the band [...] "captured both the glory and sorrow of glam, the high jinx and wasted youth, with electric photorealism". In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Joe Gross called it an [...] "absolutely essential" [...] record and [...] "epic sleaze, the sound of five young men shaping the big city in their own scuzzy image". Sylvain attributed its influence on punk rock to how Rundgren recorded his guitar through the left speaker and Thunders' guitar on the right side, an orientation which he said younger bands such as the Ramones and the Sex Pistols adopted. Rundgren was amused by how the record became considered a precursor to the punk movement: [...] "The irony is that I wound up producing the seminal punk album, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> really thought of as a punk producer, and I never got called by punk acts. They probably thought I was too expensive for what they were going for. But the Dolls didn't really consider themselves punk." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1967 Cooney took {{a leave of absence}} from WNDT and, funded by Carnegie Corporation, {{traveled}} the U.S. and Canada interviewing experts in child development, education, and television. [...] She reported her findings in a fifty-five-page document entitled [...] "The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education". [...] The report, which Gikow called [...] "a schematic for the show Sesame Street would become", described what the new show would look like and proposed the creation of a company that oversaw its production, which eventually became known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW). [...] Cooney later stated that her undergraduate training in Education helped her research and write the study, and that it, along with her Emmy, provided her with credibility in the eyes of both the experts she interviewed and the new show's funding sources. [...] Davis credited Cooney's motivation to be involved with the project with her journalism skills, learned early in her career, and her idealism, which drove her to want to, as she put it, [...] "make a difference". [...] She later told an interviewer, [...] "I could do a thousand documentaries on poverty and poor people that would be watched by a handful of the convinced, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> really going to have an influence on my times". [...] She later told Davis, [...] "Preschoolers were not necessarily my thing. [...] It was using television in a constructive way that turned me on".|$|E

[...] "I have lived in America for a really long time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> away from England. I was always there, I just didn't work there. I wasn't offered anything there really. So when the BBC called me last year, I was really thrilled. I mean, I {{wanted to do something}} England. The last thing I'd done was with Michael Palin. We did [...] in 1992, I think. We did a show about the class system in Britain and it was just wonderful fun. And from that HBO picked that up and I did [...] So it started from a British show." ...|$|E

2500|$|Parker {{was born}} in Fort Jackson, South Carolina. The {{youngest}} of four children, she {{is the daughter of}} Caroline Louise (née Morell) and John Morgan Parker, a judge who served in the U.S. Army. Her ancestry includes Swedish (from her maternal grandfather), English, Scottish, Scots-Irish, German, and Dutch. Because of her father's career, Parker spent parts of her childhood in Tennessee and Texas, as well as in Thailand, Germany, and France. She described her childhood as [...] "profoundly unhappy", further noting that, [...] "My parents did everything they could; I had books, clothes, a home and a warm bed, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> happy". She graduated from Marcos de Niza High School in Tempe, Arizona. Parker majored in drama at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and graduated in 1986.|$|E
2500|$|After Marvel Superheroes #388 (August 1982), {{the series}} {{moved into a}} new monthly comic, The Daredevils. When The Daredevils was {{canceled}} after eleven issues, Captain Britain was continued in The Mighty World of Marvel volume 2 #7 (December 1983). After the run of Alan Moore, who left because of a dispute over unpaid invoices, the serial continued for a few more issues with different writers (Steve Craddock, Alan Davis, and Mike Collins) before moving to the new Captain Britain Monthly. Jamie Delano took over writing duties with the first issue (cover-dated January 1985) on the recommendation of Moore and with the agreement of Davis. However, Davis later said [...] "Initially I gave plot ideas to Jamie [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> happy with the direction he wanted to take things so I took more and more control until I eventually took over as writer." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 21 September 2008, Olmert {{formally}} {{resigned in}} a letter submitted to president Shimon Peres, and the following day Peres formally asked Livni {{to form a new}} government. Livni faced tough negotiations with Kadima's coalition partners, particularly the Shas party, which had set conditions for joining a Livni government, including an increase in child allowances to Haredi communities, and a vow not to negotiate the status of Jerusalem during peace talks with the Palestinians. Livni was able to sign a coalition agreement with the Labor party, led by former prime minister Ehud Barak, but on October 26, informed the President that she was unable to form a government and suggested Israel go to elections. Livni cited her unwillingness to sell out her principles just to become prime minister, stating, [...] "I was willing to pay a price to form a government, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> willing to risk the political and economic future of Israel. If someone is willing to sell out his principles for the job, he is not worthy of it." [...] For its part, Likud, the main opposition party led by Benjamin Netanyahu, lobbied Shas and other parties essential to Livni's government to support early elections.|$|E

2500|$|Trudi is Jody's {{friend who}} does little but smoke {{out of a}} bong during the scene where Vincent has to put a needle in Mia. According to author Jason Bailey, [...] "Quentin {{thought it would be}} funny to have this casual {{observer}} who just happened to be there. All of this was born out of the experience of, when you go to someone's house to buy drugs, there are always people who are just there." [...] Gallagher recalled favorable experiences of working with Tarantino for the film: [...] "Pulp Fiction was just being {{in the right place at}} the right time. After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke. It was the only time I didn't feel like the odd one out over there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Black Cat" [...] was {{directed}} by Wayne Isham. It was filmed on April 5, 1990 using live concert footage from Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour at the Met Center in Bloomington, Minnesota. In addition to the audience for the sold-out show, the filming reportedly drew an additional 3,000 fans. The video premiered during the tour's first date at the Tacoma Dome, projected on three screens prior to Jackson appearing on stage. It was later debuted on MTV and other music channels in August. The video uses an [...] "in concert" [...] theme, in a similar concept to other hard rock and heavy metal music videos of the era, being a departure from her heavily choreographed videos with various settings. Spliced footage of a black panther is shown throughout the video. Jackson explained, [...] "Black panthers fascinate me. They've become an obsession. During filming, we used a black panther who actually attacked his trainer. Don't ask me why, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>never</b> fearful. I feel a strange rapport with panthers. They've become an inner symbol. Maybe it's their beauty, maybe their danger, maybe the poetry of their movement. It's as though their strength protects me." [...] It was later included on the Rhythm Nation Compilation and Design of a Decade video release.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his time}} as ranking Democrat in the Republican-controlled House, Williams was given the {{privilege}} of choosing the Democrats assigned to committees by the House Speaker Joseph Gurney Cannon (by {{the rules of the}} House, Cannon was entitled to make all appointments himself), giving him tremendous power within the minority party. In gratitude, Williams was known to omit Democrats whom Cannon found particularly objectionable from committee assignments. Recognizing his status vis-à-vis Cannon, Williams jokingly described his relative political impotence in the Cannon-dominated Committee on Rules, [...] "I am invited to the seances <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>never</b> consulted about the spiritualistic appearances." ...|$|R
