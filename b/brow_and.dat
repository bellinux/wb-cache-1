25|$|At {{approximately}} the mid-portion of the forehead, the surgeon deepens {{the plane of}} the dissection down to the submuscular plane. The dissection continues toward the <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> the glabella (the smooth prominence between the eyebrows) until the skin flap is sufficiently mobile to allow its relaxed transposition upon the nose.|$|E
25|$|Then further back, {{higher than}} the candelabrum, and much {{higher than the}} altar, rose the Moloch, all of iron, and with gaping {{apertures}} in his human breast. His outspread wings were stretched upon the wall, his tapering hands reached down to the ground; three black stones bordered by yellow circles represented three eyeballs on his <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> his bull's head was raised with a terrible effort as if in order to bellow.|$|E

25|$|From High Row {{the direct}} route leads up the {{north-east}} ridge, over Low How, High <b>Brow</b> <b>and</b> Randerside. Alternative routes begin {{by following the}} Old Coach Road, either to the path alongside Groove Beck and up Randerside, or into Mosedale from near the Mariel Bridge and up to Calfhow Pike. This unsurfaced road provides a fine walking route from Dockray around {{the northern end of}} the Helvellyn range to the Vale of St John. The close up view of Wolf Crags is particularly good.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is about}} a local blacksmith. Noted as being strong, he works by the sweat of his <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> does not owe anyone anything. Children coming home from school stop to stare {{at him as he}} works, {{impressed}} by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father {{after the death of his}} wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night. The narrator concludes by thanking the blacksmith for the lessons he can teach.|$|E
25|$|Margaret attacks York's castle at Wakefield, and the Yorkists {{lose the}} ensuing battle. During the conflict, Clifford murders York's twelve-year-old son, Rutland. Margaret and Clifford then capture and taunt York himself; {{forcing him to}} stand on a molehill, they give him a {{handkerchief}} covered with Rutland's blood to wipe his <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> place a paper crown on his head, before stabbing him to death. After the battle, as Edward and Richard lament York's death, Warwick brings news that his own army has been defeated by Margaret's at the Second Battle of St Albans, and the King has returned to London, where, under pressure from Margaret, he has revoked his agreement with York. However, George Plantagenet, Richard and Edward's brother, has vowed to join their cause, having been encouraged {{to do so by}} his sister, the Duchess of Burgundy. Additionally, Warwick has been joined in the conflict by his own younger brother, Montague.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Wheatstone {{translated}} French poetry, {{and wrote}} two songs, {{one of which was}} given to his uncle, who published it without knowing it as his nephew's composition. Some lines of his on the lyre became the motto of an engraving by Bartolozzi. Small for his age, but with a fine <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> intelligent blue eyes, he often visited an old book-stall in the vicinity of Pall Mall, which was then a dilapidated and unpaved thoroughfare. Most of his pocket-money was spent in purchasing the books which had taken his fancy, whether fairy tales, history, or science. One day, to the surprise of the bookseller, he coveted a volume on the discoveries of Volta in electricity, but not having the price, he saved his pennies and secured the volume. It was written in French, and so he was obliged to save again, until he could buy a dictionary. Then he began to read the volume, and, {{with the help of his}} elder brother, William, to repeat the experiments described in it, with a home-made battery, in the scullery behind his father's house. In constructing the battery, the boy philosophers ran short of money to procure the requisite copper-plates. They had only a few copper coins left. A happy thought occurred to Charles, who was the leading spirit in these researches, 'We must use the pennies themselves,' said he, and the battery was soon complete.|$|E
500|$|The {{shape of}} the Panthers logo was {{designed}} to mimic the outline of both North Carolina and South Carolina. The Panthers changed their logo and logotype in 2012, the first such change in team history. According to the team, the changes were designed to give their logo an [...] "aggressive, contemporary look" [...] as well {{to give it a}} more three-dimensional feel. The primary tweaks were made in the eye and mouth, where the features, particularly the muscular <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> fangs, are more pronounced, creating a more menacing look. The revised logo has a darker shade of blue over the black logo, compared to the old design, which had teal on top of black.|$|E
500|$|The first {{character}} Nomura {{designed for}} Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{was inspired by}} actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that [...] "obody understood it." [...] Squall is [...] tall, initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> {{the bridge of his}} nose impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall's first illustration was used as a set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him.|$|E

500|$|In 1795, François Alexandre Frédéric visited Spanish Hill while {{en route}} to Canada. He {{described}} the hill as [...] "a mountain {{in the shape of}} a sugar loaf, about 100 feet high, with level top, on which are remains of intrenchments. One perpendicular breastwork is still remaining, plainly indicating a parapet and ditch." [...] In 1833, another individual visiting the hill described [...] "the remains of a wall which runs around the whole exactly on the <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> within a deep ditch or intrenchment running round the whole summit." [...] In 1898, I.P. Shepard created a sketch of Spanish Hill, including the portions still visible at the time as well as those no longer extant. Shepard enlisted the assistance of a longtime local resident, Charles Henry Shepard, who claimed to remember [...] "fortifications as consisting of an embankment with a trench behind, giving a height of four or five feet on the inside." [...] In addition, an indent was discovered on the site which was pronounced to be a corn cache by Beauchamp.|$|E
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head3 is {{also known}} as San Lorenzo Monument3. The head {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep and weighs 9.4 tons. The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully. The monument was found [...] southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo, however, its original location is unknown; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture. Head3 has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. The headdress is complex, with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords, with diagonal folds above each eye. A small skullcap tops the headdress. A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head, completely covering the ears. The face has a typically frowning <b>brow</b> <b>and,</b> unusually, has clearly defined eyelids. The lips are thick and slightly parted; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely, and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions.|$|E
500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> the bridge of his nose. As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolver–sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E

2500|$|One {{measure of}} the proper length of the sword should be from the hilt in your hand and {{the tip of the}} blade at the <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> in some schools, the height of shoulder. Alternatively, the length of the sword should be {{from the middle of the}} throat along the length of the outstretched arm. There are also {{significantly}} larger versions of dao used for training in some Baguazhang and Taijiquan schools.|$|E
2500|$|The hennin {{was worn}} tilted {{backward}} at an angle. It {{was made of}} light material, often card or a wire mesh over which a light fabric was fixed, although little is known {{of the details of}} their construction. There was often a cloth lappet, or [...] "cornet" [...] in French, in front of the hennin covering part of the <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes falling onto the shoulders to either side. There is very often a [...] "frontlet" [...] or short loop seen on the forehead (right), to adjust the hennin forward, and perhaps even to hold it on in wind.|$|E
2500|$|The Byronic hero first {{appears in}} Byron's semi-autobiographical epic {{narrative}} poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (1812–1818). Historian and critic Lord Macaulay described the character as [...] "a man proud, moody, cynical, with defiance on his <b>brow,</b> <b>and</b> misery in his heart, a scorner of his kind, implacable in revenge, yet capable of deep and strong affection". The initial {{version of the}} type in Byron's work, Childe Harold, draws {{on a variety of}} earlier literary characters including Hamlet, Goethe's Werther (1774), and William Godwin's Mr. Faulkland in Caleb Williams (1794); he was also noticeably similar to René, the hero of Chateaubriand's novella of 1802, although Byron may not have read this.|$|E

2500|$|Everton's {{most widely}} {{recognised}} nickname [...] "The Toffees" [...] or [...] "The Toffeemen", which came about after Everton {{had moved to}} Goodison. There are several explanations for how this name came to be adopted with the best known being {{that there was a}} business in Everton village, between Everton <b>Brow</b> <b>and</b> Brow Side, named Mother Noblett's, which was a toffee shop that sold sweets including the Everton Mint. It was also located opposite the lock up which Everton's club crest is based on. The Toffee Lady tradition in which a girl walks {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch before the start of a game tossing free Everton Mints into the crowd symbolises the connection. Another possible reason is that there was a house named Ye Anciente Everton Toffee House in nearby Village Street, Everton, run by Ma Bushell. The toffee house was located near the Queen's Head hotel in which early club meetings took place.|$|E
2500|$|The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo began {{shooting}} in Sweden in September 2010. Mara {{did not consider}} the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. [...] "I plan on giving my interpretation of the character," [...] she stated to Variety. Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing {{so that it would}} not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E
2500|$|Breaking the {{symmetry}} of the helmet are subtle {{differences in the}} two eyebrows, and in the methods employed to fashion the cloisonné garnets. The dexter and sinister eyebrows, though at first glance identical, may have been [...] "manufactured in different ways while being intended to look essentially the same." [...] The dexter brow is approximately 5 millimeters shorter than the sinister, and contained 43 rather than 46 inlaid silver wires {{and one or two}} fewer garnets. Gilding on the dexter eyebrow was [...] "reddish in colour" [...] against the [...] "yellowish" [...] hue of the sinister, while the latter contains both trace amounts of mercury and a tin corrosion product which are absent from its counterpart. Moreover, while the individual bronze cells into which the garnets are set, both on the dexter <b>brow</b> <b>and</b> on three of the four remaining dragon eyes, are underlain by small pieces of [...] "hatched gold foil," [...] those on the sinister side, and the sinister eye of the upper dragon head, have no such backing. The gold backing served to reflect light back through the garnets, increasing their lustre and deepening their colour. Where this backing was missing on the sinister eyebrow and one dragon eye, the luminosity of the garnets would be [...] "substantially dimmed" [...] by direct placement against the bronze.|$|E
