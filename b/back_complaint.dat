40|$|BACKGROUND: Back pain is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} complaint seen in older people. It is important to get an insight {{in the course of}} <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and to identify factors associated with a chronic course. AIM: To describe the course of acute and subacute <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older people (≥ 45 years) and to identify prognostic factors for developing chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. METHODS: A database search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PEDro. Cohort studies or randomized controlled trials reporting on the course of acute or subacute <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older people were included. The percentage of patients that developed chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> was calculated, if possible. RESULTS: The search yielded 9293 potentially relevant articles. Of these, 5 studies met all inclusion criteria. At 3 months follow-up 37 - 40 % of the patients still had <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> At 12 months follow-up, the percentage ranged from 26 - 45 %. Older age was frequently reported as a prognostic factor for developing chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> of the whole study population. No prognostic factors could be retrieved for patients aged 45 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: At 3 and 12 month follow-up, about 40 % of the older people still reported <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> However, the heterogeneity of the studies made comparisons difficult. In order to get a clear insight in the course of <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in the older adult patients and to indentify prognostic factors for developing chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older people, high quality prospective cohort studies are needed. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: More than one-third of the older patients with back pain still experience complaints after 3 and 12 months...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> {{are common}} among older people, limited {{information}} {{is available in the}} literature about the clinical course of back pain in older people and the identification of older persons at risk for the transition from acute <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> to chronic <b>back</b> pain. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the course of <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and identify prognostic factors for the transition from acute <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> to chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older people who visit a primary health care physician. Methods/design. The design is a prospective cohort study with one-year follow-up. There will be no interference with usual care. Patients older than 55 years who consult a primary health care physician with a new episode of <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> will be included in this study. Data will be collected using a questionnaire, physical examination and X-ray at baseline, and follow-up questionnaires after 6 weeks and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. The study 'Back Complaints in the Elders' (BACE) will take place in different countries: starting in the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. The research groups collaborate in the BACE consortium. The design and basic objectives of the study will be the same across the studies. Discussion. This consortium is a collaboration between different research groups, aiming to provide insight into the course of <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older people and to identify prognostic factors for the transition from acute <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> to chronic <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in older persons. The BACE consortium allows to investigate differences between older people with <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and the health care systems in the different countries and to increase the statistical power by enabling meta-analyses using the individual patient data. Additional research groups worldwide are invited to join the BACE consortium...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the primary preventive effect {{of the use of}} ergonomic measures on low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> among construction workers. Methods An initial questionnaire was sent to a cohort of bricklayers, carpenters, and pavers in 2000. Workers who reported no musculoskeletal complaints were selected (n = 539) and divided into groups that either used or did not use ergonomic measures. The incidence of low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> among members of the two groups was re-assessed with a follow-up questionnaire administered in 2005. Results A total of 12. 4 % of the construction workers reported regular use of ergonomic measures at baseline and during follow-up. The 4. 5 -year incidence of regular or sustained low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> was 17. 3 %. Frequent use of ergonomic measures was associated with a 15 % (RR= 0. 85; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 46 - 1. 55) reduced risk of reporting regular or sustained low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> among construction workers after a 4. 5 -year period. Conclusions This study did not find a statistically significant primary preventive effect of the use of ergonomic measures on low <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> Sustained use of effective ergonomic measures among a large group of young construction workers is necessary to provide possible evidence fora significant and relevant primary preventive effect of the use of ergonomic measures on low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in the long term.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} effects of {{therapeutic}} exercise on bone density and <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> METHODS: A randomised controlled trial with parallel groups was conducted in an outpatient clinic, Medical School, University of Vienna. Ninety two sedentary post-menopausal women with back problems were randomly allocated to either exercise (groups 1 and 2) or control (group 3, no exercise, n = 31); the exercise group was retrospectively subdivided into compliant (group 1, n = 27) and not fully compliant patients (group 2, n = 34). Regular, initially supervised therapeutic exercise aimed at restoring biomechanical function was performed for four years. Bone density in the forearm was measured by single photon absorptiometry at entry and after four years; subjective <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> were documented. RESULTS: A significant decrease in bone density was observed in groups 2 and 3; no change was noted in group 1; <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> decreased in group 1 only. CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary postmenopausal women may benefit from regular long term therapeutic exercise in terms of subjective <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and slowed loss of bone mass...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between exposure to pushing/pulling at work and low <b>back</b> and shoulder <b>complaints.</b> Methods: A cross sectional questionnaire survey was carried out among 434 workers from several companies with mainly pushing/pulling tasks. From the same companies 188 workers without physically demanding tasks served as reference. The questionnaire {{was used to assess}} the exposure to pushing/pulling and other physical risk factors for low <b>back</b> and shoulder <b>complaints.</b> Mean scores at company level were used to classify groups into medium and high exposed to pushing/pulling and a reference group. Psychosocial factors at work were also assessed. Several pain related questionnaires were used to assess the 12 month prevalence of low <b>back</b> and shoulder <b>complaints</b> in three dimensions: trouble (ache, pain, discomfort), pain intensity, and disability. Prevalence rate ratios (PRs) were calculated using Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis. Results: The 12 month prevalence of low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> was almost equal for all three groups. The prevalence of shoulder complaints increased with an increase in exposure level. Adjusted PRs showed that the high exposed group had an increased risk for low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> compared to the reference group. For all dimensions of shoulder complaints a clear tendency towards a dose-response relation was observed. The high exposed group had significant PRs for shoulder complaints, ranging from 2. 09 to 6. 37. Generally, psychosocial factors had a confounding effect for pain intensity and disability, but not for trouble. Conclusions: For shoulder complaints a dose-response relation was observed for exposure to pushing/pulling. Low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> were less consistently associated with pushing/pulling. Stronger associations were observed for more severe cases of low <b>back</b> and shoulder <b>complaints.</b> It is hypothesised that work related psychosocial factors affect these associations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To (a) {{describe}} {{differences in}} the outcome of cross sectional and longitudinal analysis on musculoskeletal complaints relative to age and work demands, and (b) to assess the entrance and drop out selection on musculoskeletal complaints among groups of employees relative to age and work demands. METHODS: A study population was {{selected on the basis of}} questionnaire data from periodical occupational health surveys of almost 45, 000 employees collected between 1982 and 1993. From all companies within this data base that participated twice in company wide surveys four years apart, male employees were selected, and stratified for age and work demands. There were several populations: follow up (participation in both surveys); drop out (participation only in the first survey); entrance (participation only at the second survey); and two cross sectional populations (all participants at each survey). Prevalences of <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and turnover rates were analysed. RESULTS: Reported <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in the cross sectional analysis declined over the oldest age groups in heavy physical work versus a small increase in the longitudinal analysis. The age group 50 - 9 and <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> were identified as predictors at the first survey for not participating at the second survey. Neither age nor work demands at the first survey indicated drop out among those employees with <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> at the first survey. The effects of entrance selection on estimated prevalences were small. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that musculoskeletal disorders lead to selection out of work, affecting the validity of both cross sectional and longitudinal epidemiological studies. In future studies analyses of turnover figures on musculoskeletal complaints relative to work demands and age are recommended...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{gain more}} {{insight into the}} {{prevalence}} rates of musculoskeletal complaints of neck-shoulder and low back and to determine the relation between physical and psychosocial work-related risk factors and the complaints mentioned in non-specialized nurses, operation room nurses, Intensive Care (IC) nurses and X-ray technologists. Methods: The study population consists of 3, 169 employees affiliated to eight university hospitals in the Netherlands. The study was conducted using a cross-sectional survey design. The parameters under study were having or having had (severe) low <b>back</b> or neck-shoulder <b>complaints</b> during the past year. In logistic regression analyses odds ratio's and CI 95 % were estimated for all relevant risk factors {{for each of the}} four professional groups. Results: In all groups prevalence rates of musculoskeletal complaints were high: low back 76 %, neck-shoulder 60 %. Operation room nurses perceived more neck-shoulder complaints (12 months prevalence) than non-specialized nurses and IC nurses perceived less severe low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> than non-specialized nurses. Four physical risk factors and one psychosocial factor were associated with low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in all groups. Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that both low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and neck-shoulder complaints are major health problems in the four professional groups under study. The prevalence rate of neck-shoulder complaints in operation room nurses is higher than in non-specialized nurses and IC nurses, the latter groups having high prevalence rates already.

It is therefore, the aim of this study to investigate the association between psychosocial and ergonomics risk factors and neck, shoulder and <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> among office workers. A total number of 630 office workers participated in this study. The results showed that decision latitude was significantly correlated with shoulder [OR: 1. 07 (1. 00 – 1. 15) ] and back [OR: 1. 12 (1. 04 – 1. 20) ] complaints. The longer time spent sitting and keying were significantly correlated with neck [OR: 1. 21 (1. 05 – 1. 39) ] and back [OR: 1. 23 (1. 06 – 1. 42) ] [OR: 0. 88 (0. 78 – 1. 99) ] complaints.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{examined}} the contribution that specific diseases, as causes of both death and disability, make to educational disparities in disability-free life expectancy (DFLE). METHODS: We used disability {{data from the}} Belgian Health Interview Survey (1997) and mortality data from the National Mortality Follow-Up Study (1991 - 1996) to assess education-related disparities in DFLE and to partition these differences into additive contributions of specific diseases. RESULTS: The DFLE advantage of higher-educated compared with lower-educated persons was 8. 0 years for men and 5. 9 years for women. Arthritis (men, 1. 3 years; women, 2. 2 years), <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> (men, 2. 1 years), heart disease/stroke (men, 1. 5 years; women, 1. 6 years), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (men, 1. 2 years; women, 1. 5 years), and "other diseases" (men, 2. 4 years) contributed the most to this difference. CONCLUSIONS: Disabling diseases, such as arthritis, <b>back</b> <b>complaints,</b> and asthma/COPD, contribute substantially to differences in DFLE by education.

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} a combination of three ergonomic measures designed {{to reduce the risk of}} low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> among gypsum bricklayers. The measures focused on optimizing working height and reducing carrying distances. Methods: A within-subjects (N= 10) controlled field study was used to compare the effects of working with the ergonomic measures with those of working with conventional working methods at the worksite during the course of a full working day. Productivity, work demands, and workload were assessed. Results: No effects were found on productivity, total work time, duration of tasks, duration of carrying, or energetic or biomechanical workload. However, the duration and frequency of working between knee and hip height during a working day increased by 25 % and 15 %, respectively, due to the ergonomic measures. During the finishing task, the duration and frequency of working below knee level decreased significantly by 4 min and 71 times, respectively. Conclusion: The limited impact of the ergonomic measures argues for additional measures to reduce the risk of low <b>back</b> <b>complaints.</b> Am. J. Ind.

40|$|Introduction Back pain {{concerns}} 30 to 50 % {{of children}} and can appear as soon as primary school; mainly due to poor sitting position 1. In addition it seems posture {{have an effect on}} school achievement². Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the influence of school furniture and postural education on schoolchildren’s sitting position, <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and attention in classroom. Methods Nine children aged 6 - 7 years constitute the experimental group (EG) and took part in this 2 -school-year-follow-up study including 5 phases of evaluation (E 1 to E 5) consisting of assessing the children’s sitting position (SP) with a specific observation form. Nine other children (representative of the EG) constituted a control group (CG). In the first year, the children’s SP was assessed before (E 1) and after having provided new school furniture fitted to the children’s size (E 2) and after having provided a triangular cushion and postural education (E 3). In the second year, the long term effect was evaluated (E 4) and then, a tilted desk was installed and its influence was assessed after a second postural education period (E 5). An oral questionnaire about spinal pains and adapted attention tasks of the Nepsy³ were submitted to children at {{the beginning and the end}} of each school-year. Student t-tests were used to compare children of both classroom and Friedman’s and Wilcoxon signed-rang tests to compare each evaluation with others. Results Compared with the CG and except from E 3 to E 4, the children’s of the EG significantly improved their SP at each step of the study (p< 0. 02). Furthermore, interventions tend to decrease <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and to improve attention. Conclusions The children’s SP was improved using appropriate furniture and specific tools (triangular cushion and tilted desk) combined with a postural intervention. This approach also tends to reduce <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> and to improve attention.

40|$|Introduction Functional {{subjective}} evaluation through questionnaire is fundamental, but {{not often}} realized {{in patients with}} <b>back</b> <b>complaints,</b> lacking validated tools. The Spinal Function Sort (SFS) was only validated in English. We aimed to translate, adapt and validate the French (SFS-F) and German (SFS-G) versions of the SFS. Methods Three hundred and forty-four patients, experiencing various <b>back</b> <b>complaints,</b> were recruited in a French (n = 87) and a German-speaking (n = 257) center. Construct validity was estimated via correlations with SF- 36 physical and mental scales, pain intensity and hospital anxiety and depression scales (HADS). Scale homogeneities were assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Test-retest reliability was assessed on 65 additional patients using intraclass correlation (IC). Results For the French and German translations, respectively, alpha were 0. 98 and 0. 98; IC 0. 98 (95 % CI: [0. 97; 1. 00]) and 0. 94 (0. 90; 0. 98). Correlations with physical functioning were 0. 63 (0. 48; 0. 74) and 0. 67 (0. 59; 0. 73); with physical summary 0. 60 (0. 44; 0. 72) and 0. 52 (0. 43; 0. 61); with pain - 0. 33 (- 0. 51; - 0. 13) and - 0. 51 (- 0. 60; - 0. 42); with mental health - 0. 08 (- 0. 29; 0. 14) and 0. 25 (0. 13; 0. 36); with mental summary 0. 01 (- 0. 21; 0. 23) and 0. 28 (0. 16; 0. 39); with depression - 0. 26 (- 0. 45; - 0. 05) and - 0. 42 (- 0. 52; - 0. 32); with anxiety - 0. 17 (- 0. 37; - 0. 04) and - 0. 45 (- 0. 54; - 0. 35). Conclusions Reliability was excellent for both languages. Convergent validity was good with SF- 36 physical scales, moderate with VAS pain. Divergent validity was low with SF- 36 mental scales in both translated versions and with HADS for the SFS-F (moderate in SFS-G).

However, officials suggested that Gimelstob play at least one game, as it was almost certain someone would withdraw from the main draw before the tournament started, giving Gimelstob {{a good chance of}} getting a berth as a lucky loser (as well as giving him time for his back to recover). Gimelstob did indeed enter the main draw as a lucky loser after the withdrawal of Andre Agassi, reaching the third round, where he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.|$|E
30|$|Unfortunately, it is {{not always}} {{possible}} to pinpoint the exact structure or pathology responsible for LBP, because no physical examination findings are pathognomonic for the diagnosis of low back pain of facet origin. Controlled, comparative anesthetic blocks of the lumbar medial branches have been stated to be the most reliable method of diagnosing facet-mediated pain [5]. However, Van Kleef et al. [1] found that both medial branch and intra-articular blocks can be used equally for diagnosis and mentioned that there is no gold standard for diagnosing low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> originating from the facet joints.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{complaint}} among the general population with a subgroup developing chronic and disabling symptoms generating large societal costs. Recurrences and functional limitations can be minimized with appropriate conservative management, including medications, physical therapy modalities, exercise and patient education. Objectives: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of low <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> in industrial workers, to investigate whether individual risk factors involved in the occurrence of LBP, and to determine the most frequent used drug in LBP treatment.

40|$|Background: To obtain {{information}} about the prevalence of chronic conditions, data can be acquired both from medical records and from health of either method. Methods: The participating general practitioners recorded morbidity data, using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) in all consultations and during one year. DNSGP- 2 includes a health interview survey carried out in 2001 among a 4 % random sample of the practice population of the 195 participating general practitioners. Survey-data were obtained from 12. 699 respondents (response rate 65 %). Comparisons {{on the presence of}} chronic conditions were made on individual level of patients (25 and over). Explanatory variables in multivariate logistic regression analyses included different patient- and doctor characteristics. Results: About 65 % of the interviewed population reported at least one chronic condition. Most frequent self-reported chronic conditions were migraine/headache (18 %), rheumatic complaints (15 %), high blood pressure (14 %), neck/shoulder complaints (14 %) and severe <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> (14 %). The GP was consulted by 80 % of the practice population, and most frequently for hypertension (10 %), severe <b>back</b> <b>complaints</b> (9 %), neck/shoulder complaints (8 %), eczema (7 %). Conclusions: Results show that for some chronic conditions, prevalence of GPdiagnosed and of self-reported chronic conditions have considerable overlap, others therefore differ extremely. Preliminary analyses show that both patient- and doctor characteristics explain variances in agreement. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
