2500|$|Bullseye {{cancellation}} {{also called}} [...] "Socked on the nose" [...] or SOTN, is a stamp collector's {{term for a}} cancellation, typically of circular design, centered on the postage stamp. Such cancellations are popular with some stamp collectors because of their neatness {{and the fact that}} the time, date, and location where the stamp was used may be readily seen. The prevalence of <b>bulls-eye</b> cancellations varies considerably by country and time period.|$|E
2500|$|Bodine again {{drove the}} full Busch series {{schedule}} in 1987 and was voted the series most popular driver. [...] He accumulated 5 poles, 8 top fives, and 17 top tens, and finished 3rd in the championship. Bodine also replaced Terry Labonte on the pace lap in two Winston Cup events. [...] Despite {{starting from the}} rear he managed to finish 8th and 9th respectively, although Terry Labonte is technically credited with the finishes. [...] Bodine then ran 14 late season Cup races for Hoss Ellington in the No. 1 <b>Bulls-Eye</b> Barbecue Sauce Chevy. [...] He had 5 top 10 qualifying efforts but his best finish was an 11th at Daytona, one of 5 top twenty finishes.|$|E

[...] The couple are shown in an upstairs room with a chest and a bed in it during early summer {{as indicated by the}} fruit on the cherry tree outside the window. The room probably functioned as a reception room, as it was the fashion in France and Burgundy where beds in reception rooms were used as seating, except, for example, when a mother with a new baby received visitors. The window has six interior wooden shutters, but only the top opening has glass, with clear <b>bulls-eye</b> pieces set in blue, red and green stained glass.|$|E

5000|$|In 1963, the {{lighthouse}} was deactivated {{and replaced by}} a newer tower. The following year, the Coast Guard made plans to demolish the light. However, due to public outcry, the plans fell through, and the Coast Guard turned the station over to Tillamook County. The light remained vacant until 1968, when the site {{was turned over to}} the Oregon State Parks Department. During this time, vandalism became a major problem for the light. Eventually, the vandalism took its toll on the keeper's quarters and they were subsequently demolished. Among the damage, four of the <b>bulls-eyes</b> in the Fresnel lens were stolen. That same year, the light was opened up to the public and the light was restored, {{with the exception of the}} missing <b>bulls-eyes.</b> Since then, three of the four missing <b>bulls-eyes</b> have been recovered. The bull’s-eye of Cape Meares Light produced light visible for 21 miles. Four sides of the 8-sided lens were covered with red glass, which produced an alternating red and white beam as the light turned. [...] In 1980, the tower itself was opened to the public.|$|R
2500|$|Police {{arrested the}} red-head at a {{downtown}} shooting gallery; he had just shot his 23rd <b>bulls-eye</b> in a row with a [...]22 rifle. Baumann said, [...] "I'm my own suspect." [...] He {{claimed to have been}} in a coma for several weeks. He said that he woke up from the coma on May 3 with his rifle missing and heard about a suspect matching his description. He then hitch-hiked to Los Angeles feeling like he was running from murder. Baumann said that he was discharged from the AAF for being a psychoneurotic in 1945. The chief of police said, [...] "I feel that the man is certainly a mental case. The Texarkana killings could have been the work of a mental case and so far as we know this man could have done it. But we have absolutely no facts. They will have to be developed, if they exist." [...] Gonzaullas stated that several parts of the man's story had little basis in fact.|$|E

Realizing that his arms had suddenly become free, he quickly decided to run away and darted towards the sugarcane fields right behind the church (now the Holy Angel University campus). The startled executioners seemed paralyzed for a few seconds as Duman dashed away at full speed! The Spaniards were the first to react. They frantically loaded their rifles, aimed at their escaping prisoner who was just barely ten feet away and fired shot after shot! The bewildered Macabebe civil guards followed suit and started firing deadlier Caliber [...]43 bullets at their fellow Capampangan. Considering the tested accuracy of these then world-class rifles of hitting <b>bulls-eye</b> targets at a distance of 200 yards (roughly 600 feet!), it was incredible how these well-trained professional officers and soldiers could have missed their target, starting from a distance of only ten feet, and after initially firing a total of about twenty shots at their escaping prisoner! ...|$|E
2500|$|The base {{had been}} a target for {{frequent}} mortar and rocket barrages since being set up in 2003, but Burbridge dismissed suggestions the British had been forced out of Amara while acknowledging the attacks had been {{one reason for the}} decision to withdraw, the second being that a static base did not fit with the new operation. [...] "Abu Naji was a <b>bulls-eye</b> {{in the middle of a}} dartboard. The attacks were a nuisance and were a contributing factor in our planning", to quit the base, he said, adding [...] "By no longer presenting a static target, we reduce the ability of the militias to strike us..We understand the militias in Maysan province are using this as an example that we have been pushed out of Abu Naji, but that is not true. It was very rare for us to take casualties." [...] Burbridge stated that Iraqi security forces would now be responsible for day-to-day security in Maysan but stressed that the British had not yet handed over complete control to them.|$|E

40|$|The Authors 2016. We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} subduction processes and related seismicity for the Lesser Antilles Arc using the Gutenberg-Richter law. This power lawdescribes the earthquakemagnitude distribution, with the gradient of the cumulative magnitude distribution being {{commonly known as the}} b-value. The Lesser Antilles Arc was chosen because of its alongstrike variability in sediment subduction and the transition from subduction to strike-slip movement towards its northern and southern ends. The data are derived from the seismicity catalogues from the Seismic Research Centre of The University of the West Indies and the Observatoires Volcanologiques et Sismologiques of the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris and consist of subcrustal events primarily from the slab interface. The b-value is found using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for a maximum-likelihood straight line-fitting routine. We investigate spatial variations in b-values using a grid-search with circular cells as well as an along-arc projection. Tests with different algorithms and the two independent earthquake cataloges provide confidence in the robustness of our results. We observe a strong spatial variability of the b-value that cannot be explained by the uncertainties. Rather than obtaining a simple north-south b-value distribution suggestive of the dominant control on earthquake triggering being water released from the sedimentary cover on the incoming American Plates, or a b-value distribution that correlates with on the obliquity of subduction, we obtain a series of discrete, high b-value <b>bulls-eyes</b> along strike. These <b>bulls-eyes,</b> which indicate stress release through a higher fraction of small earthquakes, coincide with the locations of known incoming oceanic fracture zones on the American Plates. We interpret the results in terms of water being delivered to the Lesser Antilles subduction zone in the vicinity of fracture zones providing lubrication and thus changing the character of the related seismicity. Our results suggest serpentinization around mid-ocean ridge transform faults, which go on to become fracture zones on the incoming plate, plays {{a significant role in the}} delivery of water into the mantle at subduction zones...|$|R
5000|$|This {{hand-blown glass}} {{is created by}} blowing a bubble of air into a gather of molten glass and then {{spinning}} it, either by hand or on a table that revolves rapidly like a potter's wheel. The centrifugal force causes the molten bubble to open up and flatten. It can then be cut into small sheets. Glass formed this way can be either coloured and used for stained-glass windows, or uncoloured as seen in small paned windows in 16th- and 17th-century houses. Concentric, curving waves are characteristic of the process. The center of each piece of glass, known as the [...] "bull's-eye", is subject to less acceleration during spinning, so it remains thicker {{than the rest of}} the sheet. It also has the distinctive lump of glass left by the [...] "pontil" [...] rod, which holds the glass as it is spun out. This lumpy, refractive quality means the <b>bulls-eyes</b> are less transparent, but they have still been used for windows, both domestic and ecclesiastical. Crown glass is still made today, but not on a large scale.|$|R
