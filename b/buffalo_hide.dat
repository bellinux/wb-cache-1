5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The fur trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis fur trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New fur trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain Fur Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver fur lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> and other furs.|$|E
25|$|A buffalo robe is a cured <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide,</b> {{with the}} hair left on. Only hides taken in the winter hunts between November and March when the furs are in their prime were {{suitable}} for buffalo robes.|$|E
25|$|In North America, American Indians and frontiersmen made coracles, called bull boats, by {{covering}} a willow frame with <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide.</b> The buffalo hair was {{left on the}} hide because it inhibited the craft from spinning, and the tails were also left intact and used to tie bull boats together.|$|E

25|$|The European buff coat (the term {{deriving}} from the ox or <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> {{from which it}} was commonly made and its yellowish colour) was an item of leather clothing worn by cavalry and officers during the 17th century, it also saw limited use by some infantry. It was often worn under armour. It {{was derived from the}} simple leather jerkins worn by huntsmen and soldiers during the Tudor period, these in turn {{deriving from}} the arming doublet worn under full plate armour.|$|E
25|$|Pastoral and {{agricultural}} activity were stimulated with the issuing of leases for Crown Land. In 1911 brothers Frank and Fred Hardy, local buffalo hunters, established Mount Bundy Station on an 834sq mi pastoral lease {{near the town}} of Adelaide River. Using local Aboriginal stockmen to hunt and process the animals, they began exporting <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> to European markets. During the 1920s, Dutch-born agriculturalist Edwin Verburg (1869-1965) established a farm in the township irrigated by a weir he constructed across the river.|$|E
50|$|The tribe traded <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> for {{horses and}} other useful goods. They {{traditionally}} made clothing from rabbit pelts and deer hides. They embellished hides with dyes, paints, beads, and porcupine quills.|$|R
50|$|<b>Buffalo</b> <b>hides,</b> {{as well as}} deer, elk, {{and other}} animal hides, are painted. Clothing and robes are often brain-tanned to be soft and supple. Parfleches, shields, and {{moccasin}} soles are rawhide for toughness.|$|R
50|$|The tribe {{lived in}} beehive-shaped houses, with pole supports, {{typically}} covered with rushes, but sometimes <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> The houses stood 20 to 25 feet tall. Besides corn, Wacos also grew beans, melons, peach trees, and pumpkins.|$|R
25|$|Wayang kulit is {{a unique}} form of theatre {{employing}} light and shadow. The puppets are crafted from <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> and mounted on bamboo sticks. When held up behind a piece of white cloth, with an electric bulb or an oil lamp as the light source, shadows are cast on the screen. The plays are typically based on romantic tales and religious legends, especially adaptations of the classic Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Some of the plays are also based on local happening or other local secular stories.|$|E
25|$|A basic Sumbanese {{house has}} a square layout. This layout can be as small as 5 x 5 meter of as big as 15 x 15 meter. Four main posts {{supported}} the roof peak of a house, these posts are imbued with mystical symbolism. A Sumbanese house can accommodate a single family or several extended families. Two entrance accesses are positioned {{to the left and}} right of the house. There is no window in a Sumbanese house, cross ventilation is provided from small openings in the wall, which is made of plaited palm boughs, areca sheath, or – among the very rich – <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide.</b> Buffalo horns often decorate the walls, a reminder to past sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The more settled {{land-based}} West Coast Bajau are expert equestrians – {{which makes}} them remarkable in Malaysia, where horse riding has never been widespread anywhere else. The traditional costume of Sama-Bajau horsemen consists of a black or white long-sleeved shirt (badu sampit) with gold buttons (betawi) {{on the front and}} decorated with silver floral designs (intiras), black or white trousers (seluar sampit) with gold lace trimmings, and a headpiece (podong). They carry a spear (bujak), a riding crop (pasut), and a silver-hilted keris dagger. The horse is also caparisoned with a colourful outfit called kain kuda that also have brass bells (seriau) attached. The saddle (sila sila) is made from water <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide,</b> and padded with cloth (lapik) underneath.|$|E
50|$|These {{were all}} {{traditionally}} painted on animal <b>hides</b> - particularly <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> When <b>buffalo</b> became scarce after eradication programs {{encouraged by the}} US federal government, Plains artists began painting and drawing on paper, canvas, and muslin.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{trading post}} on the Wabash River was {{established}} by Sieur Juchereau, Lieutenant General of Montréal. With thirty-four Canadiens, he founded the company post on October 28, 1702 to trade for <b>Buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> with American Indians. The exact location of Juchereau's trading post is not known, but because the Buffalo Trace crosses the Wabash at Vincennes, many believe it was here. The post was a success; {{in the first two}} years, the traders collected over 13,000 <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> [...] When Juchereau died, the post was abandoned. The French-Canadian settlers left what they considered hostile territory for Mobile (in present-day Alabama), then the capital of Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days, the Chouteau {{interests}} supplied pelts for the beaver hat industry. When the industry began to collapse around 1850, they began a trade in <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> Chouteau also {{invested heavily in}} railroads, rolling mills, and mining.|$|R
25|$|Historical Acoma {{economic}} {{practices are}} described as socialistic or communal. Labor was shared and produce was distributed equally. Trading networks were extensive, spreading thousands of miles throughout the region. During fixed times {{in the summer and}} fall, trading fairs were held. The largest fair was held in Taos by the Comanche. Nomadic traders would exchange slaves, buckskins, <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide,</b> jerky, and horses. Pueblo people would trade for copper and shell ornaments, macaw feathers, and turquoise. The Acoma would trade via the Santa Fe Trail starting in 1821, and with the arrival of railroads in the 1880s, the Acoma became dependent on American-made goods. This dependency would cause traditional arts such as weaving and pottery making to decline.|$|E
25|$|In ritual fashion, the Indians scalped, stripped, and {{mutilated}} the soldiers' bodies before leaving. In {{his report}} to his superiors, Carrington listed what was discovered at the battlefield the next day: eyes torn out and laid on rocks, noses and ears cut off, teeth chopped out, brains taken out {{and placed on}} rocks, hands and feet cut off, private parts severed. The two civilians, Wheatley and Fisher, had had their faces smashed into bloody pulp, and Wheatley had been pierced {{by more than a}} hundred arrows. The last trooper to die in the battle may have been Adolph Metzger, a bugler who used his instrument as a weapon until it was battered shapeless. Metzger was the only soldier whose dead body was not mutilated. The Indians covered him with a <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide.</b> Some historians interpreted that as a tribute to his bravery in standing alone against several armed enemies.|$|E
25|$|The Crow wore {{clothing}} {{distinguished by}} gender. Women wore dresses made of deer and <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide,</b> decorated with elk teeth or shells. They covered their legs with leggings during winter and their feet with moccasins. Crow women wore their hair in two braids. Male clothing usually {{consisted of a}} shirt, trimmed leggings with a belt, a long breechcloth, and moccasins. Robes made from the furred hide of a bison were often worn in winter. Leggings were either made of animal hide which the Crow made for themselves or made of wool which were highly valued trade items made specifically for Indians in Europe. Their hair was worn long, in some cases reaching the ground. The Crow are famous for often wearing their hair in a pompadour which was often coloured white with paint. Crow men were notable for wearing two hair pipes made from beads {{on both sides of}} their hair. Men often wore their hair in two braids wrapped in the fur of beavers or otters. Bear grease was used to give shine to hair. Stuffed birds were often worn in the hair of warriors and medicine men. Like other plains Indians the Crow wore feathers from eagles, crows, owls, and other birds in their hair for symbolic reasons. The Crow wore a variety of headdresses including the famous eagle feather headdress, bison scalp headdress with horns and beaded rim, and split horn headdress. The split horn headdress is made from a single bison horn split in half and polished into two nearly identical horns which were attached to a leather cap and decorated with feathers and beadwork. Traditional clothing worn by the Crow is still worn today with varying degrees of regularity.|$|E
50|$|When {{the traders}} of Hudson's Bay Company first visited the Mandan Indians in 1790 {{they found that}} tribe possessed tublike boats with {{framework}} of willow poles, covered with raw <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> Later, frontiersmen who ascended the Missouri River noted this light, convenient craft. From 1810 to 1830, American fur traders on the tributaries of the Missouri regularly built boats eighteen to thirty feet long, using the methods of construction employed by the Indians in making their circular boats. These elongated bull boats were capable of transporting two tons of fur down the shallow waters of the Platte River. These larger boats required joining the <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> with waterproof seams, a technique not used by the American Indians.|$|R
50|$|The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the {{encroaching}} {{frontier of}} the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> and beaver pelts.|$|R

Some other historians place the post 50 miles further south.|$|R
500|$|Sitting Bull {{was born}} on land later {{included}} in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or [...] "Slow," [...] said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. [...] When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included {{his father and his}} uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Jumping Badger displayed bravery by riding forward and counting coup on one of the surprised Crow, which was witnessed by the other mounted Lakota. [...] Upon returning to camp his father gave a celebratory feast at which he conferred his own name upon his son. [...] The name, Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake, [...] which in the Lakota language means [...] "Buffalo Bull Who Sits Down", would later be abbreviated to [...] "Sitting Bull". [...] Thereafter, Sitting Bull's father was known as Jumping Bull. [...] At this ceremony before the entire band, Sitting Bull's father presented his son with an eagle feather to wear in his hair, a warrior's horse, and a hardened <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> shield to mark his son's passage into manhood as a Lakota warrior.|$|E
2500|$|Oil wrestling (...) , {{also called}} grease wrestling, is the Turkish {{national}} sport. It is so called because the wrestlers douse themselves with olive oil. It {{is related to}} Uzbek kurash, Tuvan khuresh and Tatar köräş. The wrestlers, known as pehalvan meaning [...] "champion" [...] wear a type of hand-stitched lederhosen called a kispet, which are traditionally made of water <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide,</b> and most recently have been made of calfskin.|$|E
2500|$|Buff coats {{were made}} in {{sleeveless}} and sleeved variants and were garments typically crafted from cowhide or <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide.</b> The very finest buff coats were made of elk-hide. Buff leather was produced by a method of [...] "oil tanning"; following treatment with lime the hide was scraped to remove the outer layer which gave the finished product a matt surface. The hide then had cod oil worked into it in a process called [...] "kicking" [...] and was finally air-dried. The oiling and drying steps could be repeated. The finished leather attained its characteristic buff colour and was supple, durable and weather resistant.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, winter counts were {{recorded}} on <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> When <b>buffalo</b> became scarce, keepers resorted to using muslin, linen, or paper.

50|$|In 1702 Bourgmont was {{reported}} to be with Charles Juchereau de St. Denys and the Troupes de la marine, who were setting up a tannery for <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> {{at the mouth of the}} Ouabache River (Wabash River) on the Ohio River. The tannery closed in 1703 and Bourgmont moved to Quebec.|$|R
50|$|Sabeata's {{activities}} included trading. With contacts {{both in the}} Indian and Spanish world, he and the Jumanos were intermediaries, bringing Spanish {{goods to}} Indians in eastern Texas, and exchanging them for Indian products, mostly <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides.</b> There were well-organized trade fairs all over Texas which no doubt pre-dated the Spanish.|$|R
2500|$|As governor, Gordon faced {{a variety}} of challenges. Besides working to end slavery, Gordon carried {{out a series of}} reforms such as abolishing torture and public floggings where those opposed to the Egyptian state were flogged with a whip known as the kourbash made of <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide.</b> Gordon was well known for being utterly obstinate, joking that: [...] "The Gordons and the camels are of the same race. Let them take an idea into their heads and nothing will take it out. I have a splendid camel-none like it; it flies along and quite astonishes the Arabs". The reforms that Gordon wanted would have changed the basic nature of Ottoman-Egyptian rule, by {{replacing}} a system based on exploitation of the people by the state with one where the state would work for the betterment of the people. These aims eluded him.|$|E
2500|$|...The three chiefs, {{who were}} at the head of all the bands of the Comanches roaming the frontiers of the {{settlements}} in Texas looked very dignified and grave. They differed much in appearance. [...] the political chief, was a small old man who in his dirty cotton jacket looked undistinguished and only his diplomatic crafty face marked him. The war chief, Santa Anna, presented an altogether different appearance. He was a powerfully built man with a benevolent and lively countenance. The third, Buffalo Hump, was the genuine, unadulterated picture of a North American Indian. Unlike the majority of his tribe, he scorned all European dress. The upper part of his body was naked. A <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> was wound around his hips. Yellow copper rings decorated his arms and a string of beads hung from his neck. With his long, straight black hair hanging down, he sat there with the earnest (to the European almost apathetic) expression of countenance of the North American savage. He drew special attention to himself because in previous years he had distinguished himself for daring and bravery in many engagements with the Texans." ...|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{distinctly}} different stories {{about what happened}} on Mule Creek on December 18, 1860, {{near the town of}} Margaret, Texas in Foard County, Texas. [...] The official version is that Sul Ross and his forces managed to catch the Quahadi Band of the Comanche by surprise, and wiped them out, including their leader, Peta Nocona. According to Quanah Parker, however, his father (Peta Nocona) was not present that day, and the Comanches killed were virtually all women and children in a <b>buffalo</b> <b>hide</b> drying and meat curing camp. [...] In any event, all parties agree that at sunrise on December 18, 1860, Rangers and Militia under Sul Ross found and surprised a group of Comanche camped on Mule Creek, a tributary of the Pease River. [...] Almost all (including a gallant warrior who wasn't Peta Nocona, but his loyal Nobah, who died trying to protect his chief's wife - Naduah - and daughter - Topsannah -) were killed except one woman, who, being recognized as a white woman, was allowed to live. She was later discovered to be Cynthia Ann Parker. [...] The only other known survivors were a 10-year-old boy saved by Sul Ross, and Cynthia Parker’s infant daughter, “Prairie Flower.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Tanggu (Drum) {{is known}} as [...] "Tonggu". During the Qing Dynasty, it was called [...] "Zhanggu".

50|$|After 1875, a town grew {{up around}} the ruins of Fort Phantom Hill. The {{location}} functioned first as a buying and shipping point for <b>buffalo</b> <b>hides</b> and eventually as a town of more than 500 residents.
