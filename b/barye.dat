5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the <b>barye</b> for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's sister Maria, {{two years}} his senior, died of {{peritonitis}} in a convent in 1862. Rodin was anguished and felt guilty {{because he had}} introduced Maria to an unfaithful suitor. Turning away from art, he briefly joined a Catholic order, the Congregation of the Blessed Sacrament. Saint Peter Julian Eymard, founder {{and head of the}} congregation, recognized Rodin's talent and, sensing his lack of suitability for the order, encouraged Rodin to continue with his sculpture. He returned to work as a decorator, while taking classes with animal sculptor Antoine-Louis <b>Barye.</b> The teacher's attention to detail– his finely rendered musculature of animals in motion– significantly influenced Rodin.|$|E
5|$|The collection's {{overview}} of French sculpture contains Romanesque {{works such as}} the 11th-century Daniel in the Lions' Den and the 12th-century Virgin of Auvergne. In the 16th century, Renaissance influence caused French sculpture to become more restrained, as seen in Jean Goujon's bas-reliefs, and Germain Pilon's Descent from the Cross and Resurrection of Christ. The 17th and 18th centuries are represented by Gian Lorenzo Bernini's 1640–1 Bust of Cardinal Richelieu, Étienne Maurice Falconet's Woman Bathing and Amour menaçant, and François Anguier's obelisks. Neoclassical works includes Antonio Canova's Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss (1787). The 18th and 19th centuries are represented by the French sculptor Alfred <b>Barye.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Fratin's pieces portray horses, {{especially}} portraits of famous horses such as Fermer, cheval anglais pur-sang, a wax {{of which he}} debuted at the Salon of 1831, the same exhibition in which <b>Barye's</b> Tigre dévorant un gavial was featured.|$|R
50|$|The Genius of the Arts (1877), a relief, {{is in the}} Tuileries, in {{substitution}} for Antoine-Louis <b>Barye's</b> Napoleon III. A {{similar work}} for the tomb of Jules Michelet (1879; designed with architect Jean-Louis Pascal) is in Père Lachaise Cemetery, {{and in the same}} year Mercié produced the statue of Arago with accompanying reliefs, now erected at Perpignan.|$|R
50|$|His {{work was}} first shown in London by Ernest Gambart in 1849. Mêne {{specialized}} in small bronze figures {{which explains why}} none of his works exist as public statuary. His work was a popular success with the bourgeois class and many editions of each sculpture were made, often to decorate {{an increasing number of}} private homes of the period. The quality of these works is high, comparable to <b>Barye's.</b> Mêne enjoyed a longer period of success and celebrity than his contemporaries. He is considered to have been the lost-wax casting expert of his time. The lost-wax casting method is sometimes referred to as the cire perdue method.|$|R
25|$|Bouré's {{interest}} in leonine subject matter places him in company with les animaliers, the 19th-century French sculptors led by Antoine-Louis <b>Barye</b> who made animals {{the focus of}} their work rather than relegating them to the background. Along with the sculptor Léon Mignon (1847–1898) and Jacques de Lalaing (1858–1917), Bouré helped establish a distinctively Belgian tradition of animal art, to which the flourishing Antwerp Zoo contributed inspiration.|$|E
25|$|Charles Freer {{introduced}} Whistler to {{his friend}} and fellow businessman, Richard Albert Canfield, in 1899 who became a personal friend and patron of Whistler's. Canfield owned a number of fashionable gambling houses in New York, Rhode Island, Saratoga Springs and Newport, and was also a man of culture with refined tastes in art. Canfield owned early American and Chippendale furniture, tapestries, Chinese porcelain and <b>Barye</b> bronzes. Canfield soon possessed the second largest and most important Whistler collection in the world prior to his death in 1914. A few months before his death, Canfield sold his collection of etchings, lithographs, drawings and paintings by Whistler to the American art dealer Roland F. Knoedler for $300,000. Three of Canfield's Whistler paintings hang in the Frick Museum in New York City. Canfield came to own numerous paintings by Whistler including La Mère Gérard (2) (YMSM 27), Symphony in Grey and Green: The Ocean (YMSM 72), Arrangement in Black: Portrait of F. R. Leyland (YMSM 97), Arrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder (YMSM 203), Nocturne in Blue and Silver: The Lagoon,Venice (YMSM 212), Arrangement in Black and Gold: Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac (YMSM 398), Rose et or: La Napolitaine (YMSM 505) and Grey and Gold: The Golden Bay, Ireland (YMSM 537). He also owned works in chalk, pastel and watercolour, including The Cemetery (M.738), Long Venice (M.748), Little Calle in San Barnaba; gold and brown (M.764), Little Canal, San Barnaba; flesh colour and grey (M.777), The Little Back Canal (M.779), Courtyard on Canal; grey and red (M.790), Nocturne - The Riva (M.799), Return of the fishing boats (M.1036), Blue and Silver - Afternoon, the Channel (M.1045), Grey and Pink (M.1209), r.: The Blue Girl; v.: Woman holding a fan (M.1223), Blue and Violet - Iris (M.1278), The Conversation (M.1289), Violet and Silver: The Afternoon Dream (M.1298), The Pink Cap (M.1308), Green and Blue: The Dancer (M.1376), The Captive (M.1524), The Bead Stringers (M.1530), Opal and Gold - Pourville Evening (M.1591), r.: Grey and Gold - Belle Isle; v.: Study for 'Grey and Gold - Belle Isle' (M.1595), Gray and Silver: The Golf Links, Dublin (M.1620), The Dancer (No.1) (M.1624), The Dancer (No.2) (M.1625), At Sea (M.1642), Shop, Algiers (M.1650), The Café - Algiers (M.1651), Street, Algiers (M.1652), Street, Corsica (M.1653), Street - Ajaccio (M.1654), r.: The Forge; v.: Smiths, Ajaccio (M.1679), r.: Blue and Silver: Morning - Ajaccio; v.: Building and trees (M.1694) and r.: The Gossips. Ajaccio; v.: group of people (M.1695). In May 1901 Canfield commissioned a portrait from Whistler. He started to pose for Portrait of Richard A. Canfield (YMSM 547) in March 1902. According to Alexander Gardiner, Canfield returned to Europe to sit for Whistler at the New Year in 1903, and sat every day until 16 May 1903. However, Whistler was ill and frail at this time and the work was his last completed portrait. The deceptive air of respectability that the portrait gave Canfield caused Whistler to call it 'His Reverence'. The two men were in correspondence from 1901 until Whistler's death.|$|E
500|$|The {{first issue}} of Fantastic was impressive, with a cover that sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley has described as [...] "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by <b>Barye</b> Phillips and Leo Summers, illustrated Kris Neville's [...] "The Opal Necklace". [...] The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, Raymond Chandler's [...] "Professor Bingo's Snuff" [...] would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in Park East magazine, but would have been new to most readers. [...] It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. [...] Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury also contributed stories, and the issue led with [...] "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by Walter M. Miller. [...] The rear cover reprinted Pierre Roy's painting [...] "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; {{it was an odd}} choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. [...] The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an [...] "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer Donald Tuck dissents, however, regarding the first few years as containing [...] "little of note", and James Blish wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were [...] "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".|$|E
5000|$|The term animalier {{was first}} used by the French press and salon jurors, often as a {{derogatory}} term. The Paris salon thought animal subjects too common for fine art, but {{with the opening of}} the new Paris Jardin des Plantes zoo and the Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes, interest in animal art increased. The Dukes of Orleans, Luynes, Montpensier, and Nemours were soon to become <b>Barye's</b> patrons. In 1882 Edouard Manet created a portrait in pastel on canvas of the animalier artist Julien de La Rochenoire, which has been owned by the Getty Museum since 2014. The art of George Stubbs became a favorite of collector Paul Mellon, who donated many of Stubbs' paintings to the Yale Center for British Art.|$|R
2500|$|Many of Matisse's {{paintings}} from 1898 to 1901 {{make use of}} a Divisionist technique he adopted after reading Paul Signac's essay, [...] "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme". His paintings of 1902–03, a period of material hardship for the artist, are comparatively somber and reveal a preoccupation with form. Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after Antoine-Louis <b>Barye,</b> in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing The Slave in 1903.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred <b>Barye</b> {{was born}} in Paris, France, on 21 January 1839, the son of Antoine-Louis <b>Barye.</b> He learned his craft of animalier {{sculptor}} {{under the watchful eye}} of his father who was one of the original pioneers of animal sculpture in the mid-to-late 19th century. The younger <b>Barye</b> didn't always get along with his father; there were times when the two of them were not on speaking terms because until instructed not to do so, <b>Barye</b> was signing some of his bronzes as [...] "A. Barye" [...] which the senior <b>Barye</b> objected to because it created confusion as to which <b>Barye,</b> father or son, created the sculpture.|$|E
5000|$|Alfred <b>Barye</b> [...] "Le Fils" [...] or Alf <b>Barye</b> (Paris, France, 21 January 1839 - Paris, France, 1882) was a French sculptor, of the Belle Époque, pupil of {{his father}} the artist Antoine-Louis <b>Barye.</b> In {{cooperation}} with Émile-Coriolan Guillemin, <b>Barye</b> did the artwork for [...] "The Arab Warrior Knight on Horseback". Included in Barye's oeuvre were animalier bronzes as well as Oriental subjects. At his father's request, he signed his work as [...] "fils" [...] to differentiate his work from his father's.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barye</b> had a son, Alfred <b>Barye,</b> {{who studied}} under him and also became an animalier sculptor. Alfred, {{although}} very competent {{in his own}} right as a sculptor, would struggle to gain notoriety working in the shadow of his more famous father. Antoine-Louis was not pleased when his son began signing work as [...] "A. Barye" [...] because he thought this created confusion between his work and that of his son. He forced his son to sign as [...] "A. <b>Barye,</b> fils" [...] or [...] "Alf Barye" [...] in order to distinguish their works. The senior <b>Barye</b> signed only one way throughout his entire career, simply marking his bronzes [...] "Barye".|$|E
5000|$|He {{expanded}} {{to the production}} of copies from other sculptors like Antoine-Louis <b>Barye,</b> Alfred <b>Barye,</b> Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, Camille Claudel, Christophe Fratin, Emmanuel Frémiet, Aristide Maillol, Pierre-Jules Mene and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He practically flooded the art market with his copies.|$|E
