5000|$|Wood siding in {{overlapping}} horizontal rows or [...] "courses" [...] {{is called}} clapboard, weatherboard (British English), or <b>bevel</b> <b>siding</b> {{which is made}} with beveled boards, thin at the top edge and thick at the butt.|$|R
50|$|The {{main part}} of the house has a gabled hip roof, while the wing has a plain gable. This design gives the house a balanced, {{symmetrical}} roof line from both the front and back. A spacious porch and upstairs verandah extend from the wing across the rest of the west facade. In the rear, there is a one story extension. The roof is new wood shingles which faithfully replicate the roofing in historic photographs. Except for fishscale shingles above the window level, <b>bevelled</b> <b>siding</b> is used throughout. Fenestration is generally two-over-two double-hung wood sash. Small triangular windows in the gable and gablet light the attic and echo the roof line.|$|R

50|$|The Hudson-Grace-Borreson House is a {{historic}} house at 719 West Barraque Street in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. With an evolutionary construction history dating to about 1830, it is a unique and distinctive blend of Greek Revival, Second Empire, and New Orleans French architectural styles. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, finished in <b>bevel</b> <b>siding,</b> with a dormered mansard roof that has an original iron railing at {{the boundary between the}} roof slopes. It has a porch extending across the front, featuring hexagonal posts and delicate turned woodwork. The house began as a two-room cabin about 1830, and was enlarged and altered in 1860. Its most prominent owner, William Grace, was a local lawyer, politician, and veteran of the American Civil War.|$|R
40|$|Rainwater is an important, {{though not}} {{generally}} recognized, cause of paint difficulties in wood-sided houses. It gains entry {{back of the}} siding chiefly by capillary action, working through the lap joint between courses of <b>bevel</b> <b>siding.</b> High winds are a minor cause. Laboratory tests have shown that entry of rainwater through house siding can be minimized or eliminated by dressing the back of standard-pattern siding so that a tight joint, which can {{be more or less}} sealed with paint, is formed between the courses; modi-fying the standard pattern by dressing the back side and adding a horizontal groove; treating conventional or modified siding with water-repellent pre-servative before it is nailed to the house; and applying a water-repellent preservative to the siding of a completed house before the house is repainted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{miniaturized}} internal wideband antenna {{suitable for}} integration with the {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) of a wireless universal serial bus (WUSB) dongle is presented in this paper. The proposed antenna mainly consists of a folded metal plate with two sides beveled. By introducing a short-circuited pin connected to the system ground and etching a pair of slots in the <b>bevel</b> <b>sides</b> of the folded metal plate, a large impedance bandwidth from 2. 4 GHz to more than 11 GHz is obtained, which easily covers the 2. 4 GHz WLAN, WiMAX, S-DMB and UWB frequency bands. The effects of the short-circuited pin and the narrow slots on the impedance matching of the proposed antenna are investigated. The proposed antenna is easy to be fabricated by bending a sample metal plate due to its miniaturized geometry of 5 × 12 × 12. 5 mm 3. Details of the antenna design are described, and experimental results of the constructed prototypes are presented and discussed. 1...|$|R

500|$|When {{the known}} {{specimens}} of K. langenbergensis were first {{described in a}} preliminary fashion by a 2006 paper from Hans-Volker Karl et al., they were referred to the genus Theriosuchus. This was {{on the basis of}} the short skull, divided nostrils, large eye sockets compared to the supratemporal fenestrae, and the <b>bevelled</b> <b>side</b> of the squamosal. Specifically, they recognized its similarity to T. pusillus on the basis of its osteoderms and teeth, although they noted that the orientation of the back of the skull was different and that leaf-shaped teeth were absent. These differences were attributed to K. langenbergensis probably representing a different life stage of T. pusillus compared to the type specimen. A 2016 analysis of the relationships of the Atoposauridae, from Jonathan Tennant et al., tentatively supported the affinity of these specimens with T. pusillus on account of the teeth being situated in a groove (a trait uniting T. pusillus and [...] "T." [...] guimarotae in their analysis), the presence of pseudocaniniform teeth, and the lance head-shaped teeth near the back of the jaw. However, they noted that the nasals essentially completely divide the nostrils to the exclusion of other bones, which is not seen in the genus of Theriosuchus.|$|R
50|$|Stone chisels {{are used}} to carve or cut stone, bricks or {{concrete}} slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. Sculptors use a spoon chisel, which is bent, with the <b>bevel</b> on both <b>sides.</b> To increase the force, stone chisels are often hit with club hammers, a heavier type of hammer.|$|R

60|$|All the beaver's cutting {{is done by}} chisel-edged front teeth. There are two {{of these}} in each jaw, {{extending}} a good {{inch and a half}} outside the gums, and meeting at a sharp <b>bevel.</b> The inner <b>sides</b> of the teeth are softer and wear away faster than the outer, so that the bevel remains the same; and the action of the upper and lower teeth over each other keeps them always sharp. They grow so rapidly that a beaver must be constantly wood cutting to keep them worn down to comfortable size.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic damping {{in certain}} {{conditions}} {{appears to have}} a negative value, which increases the dynamic response of a tall building. Six single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) aeroelastic models of tall buildings with typical cross sections (square, square with concave or bevel corners, and rectangular) are tested in a wind tunnel with a suburban terrain flow field condition. The along-wind and across-wind aerodynamic damping ratios of the tall buildings are identified by using the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) method in conjunction with the random decrement technique (RDT). The effects of wind speed, corner modifications (concave or <b>bevel</b> corner), <b>side</b> ratio, and wind direction on the aerodynamic damping are studied. The results indicate that in most cases the along-wind aerodynamic damping is positive and gradually increases with the increase of reduced wind speed (Ur). The across-wind aerodynamic damping is likewise a positive value at low Ur in most cases, but suddenly becomes negative when Ur becomes greater than 10. 5 for the square cross-section building...|$|R

40|$|From L-shaped planar monopoles to a novel folded antenna {{with wide}} {{bandwidth}} G. Ruvio and M. J. Ammann Abstract: A novel {{folded monopole antenna}} is investigated numerically and experimentally. The proposed antenna comprises a short folded monopole suitably shaped at the base with two vertical grounding probes.

40|$|International audienceSeveral 65 μm thick {{epitaxial}} diamond films prepared on (100) Ib substrates by {{high power}} pulsed microwave plasma assisted {{chemical vapour deposition}} (HP-MPCVD) are studied {{as a function of}} surface treatments by cathodoluminescence (CL) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. They are either asgrown, or polished, or etched by a microwave oxygen plasma, or after applying subsequently the two last processes. In CL spectra, bands due to defects occur at 2. 3 eV, 3. 07 eV, 3. 7 eV and 4. 7 eV, the last one being specific of polished surfaces, with nearly no contrast in the luminescence image. A fundamental result consists in demonstrating that the defects induced by polishing can be removed by oxygen plasma etching. Additionally, in order to assess how luminescence spectra originate from a peculiar depth or not, a bevelled sample is studied. PL spectra are acquired on the sample side while CL spectra are measured at several points on the <b>bevel</b> top <b>side</b> till to the Ib substrate. Comparison of the two sets of result show that the H 3 signal originates from the Ib substrate even if it is present in the CL spectra of the film. An analysis of the change in the intensity of the TO free exciton line, defect bands and H 3 signal, along decreasing photon energies, {{as a function of the}} thickness of the remaining HP-PMPCVD film, is performed with the help of a model taking the diffusion of the unrecombined excitonic pairs and the re-excited photoluminescence into account. CL images recorded at specific wavelengths, which do not show inverted contrast, are also assessed. From these data, the exciton diffusion length is evaluated to 11 μm in the major part of the epitaxial layer except for the first 20 μm close to the Ib substrate where it decreases down to 2 μm. This study sheds light on the interpretation of luminescence spectra excited by an electron beam in undoped diamond layers. Defects bands due to damages induced by polishing and etching processes are also documented...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict the bevel angle (response variable) during CNC plasma-arc cutting of St 37 mild steel plates. The four (4) input parameters (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, and torch standoff distance) of the ANN was selected following the results (relative importance) of the Analysis Of Variance (ANOVA) performed based on seven (7) factors (plate thickness, cutting speed, arc ampere, arc voltage, air pressure, pierce height, and torch standoff distance) in a previous study. A multi-parameter optimization was carried out using the robust design. An L 18 (21 × 37) Taguchi orthogonal array experiment was conducted and the right bevel angle was measured, aiming at the investigation of the influence of plasma-arc cut process parameters on right <b>side</b> <b>bevel</b> angle of St 37 mild steel cut surface. The selection of quality characteristics, material, plate thickness and other process parameter levels and experimental limits was based on the experience and current needs of the Greek machining industry. A feed-forward backpropagation (FFBP) neural network was fitted on the experimental data. The results show that accurate predictions of the bevel angle can be achieved inside the experimental region, through the trained FFBP-ANN. The developed ANN model could be further used for the optimization of the cutting parameters during CNC plasma-arc cutting. Copyright © 2010 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|This paper covers {{far-field}} {{acoustic measurements}} {{of a family}} of rectangular nozzles with aspect ratio 8, in the high subsonic flow regime. Several variations of nozzle geometry, commonly found in embedded exhaust systems, are explored, including bevels, slants, single broad chevrons and notches, and internal septae. Far-field acoustic results, presented previously for the simple rectangular nozzle, showed that increasing aspect ratio increases the high frequency noise, especially directed in the plane containing the minor axis of the nozzle. Detailed changes to the nozzle geometry generally made little difference in the noise, and the differences were greatest at low speed. Having an extended lip on one broad <b>side</b> (<b>bevel)</b> did produce up to 3 decibels more noise in all directions, while extending the lip on the narrow side (slant) produced up to 2 decibels more noise, primarily on the side with the extension. Adding a single, non-intrusive chevron, made no significant change to the noise, while inverting the chevron (notch) produced up to 2 decibels increase in the noise. Having internal walls (septae) within the nozzle, such as would be required for structural support or when multiple fan ducts are aggregated, reduced the noise of the rectangular jet, but could produce a highly directional shedding tone from the septae trailing edges. Finally, a nozzle with both septae and a beveled nozzle, representative of the exhaust system envisioned for a distributed electric propulsion aircraft with a common rectangular duct, produced almost as much noise as the beveled nozzle, with the septae not contributing much reduction in noise...|$|R
60|$|I {{was led to}} {{investigate}} this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who {{has shown that the}} form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At {{the other end of the}} series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six <b>sides</b> <b>bevelled</b> so as to fit on to a pyramid, formed of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the important point to notice, is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other, that they would have {226} intersected or broken into each other, if the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more perfectly flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three, or more other cells. When one cell comes into contact with three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal bases of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.|$|R
