5|$|Squidward gets a {{call from}} his former high school classmate, Squilliam Fancyson, who is very {{successful}} and has succeeded in everything in which Squidward has failed, such as music. Squilliam reveals to Squidward that he has become {{the leader of a}} band and that they are supposed to play at the Bubble Bowl; but he will <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> at that time and {{will not be able to}} attend so Squilliam asks Squidward to allow his band to substitute for his at the Bubble Bowl, believing that Squidward does not have one. However, Squidward insists that he has a band and accepts the offer. He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of railways in the United Kingdom, most lines were built as double-track because of the difficulty of co-ordinating operations before the invention of the telegraph. The lines also tended to <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> enough to be beyond the capacity of a single track. In the early days the Board of Trade did not consider any single-track railway line to be complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of the allied fleet was to prevent the link-up of Shimazu's fleet with the fleet of Konishi, then attack and defeat Shimazu's fleet. The {{objective of}} Shimazu's fleet was to cross Noryang Strait, link up with Konishi and retreat to Pusan. Shimazu knew that Konishi was trying to cause disunity within the Joseon-Ming alliance and hoped that they would <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> elsewhere or still blockading the Sunch'on wajō and thus vulnerable to an attack from their rear.|$|E

25|$|After Wetton's death, Downes {{stated that}} the duo {{had been working on}} another Asia album after his death, and stated that it might {{eventually}} be completed and released. It is unclear if Wetton had recorded any parts, or if the album had only been in the songwriting process.

July 1895 – 1978), Arthur Percival Foley (b. 27 September 1897) and a second daughter, Nesta Foley (1900–1973). Unlike most parents of the Victorian era, the parents of Rhys-Davids {{spent a great deal}} of their time with their children, although they employed a child minder named Minna, a German woman. The first words of Arthur and his sister were German and the children often used German phrases. Nevertheless, Rhys-Davids's parents continued to <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> academics. In 1905 his father became a professor at the University of Manchester. His mother became a prolific author.|$|E
25|$|Catfoss was {{originally}} {{used as a}} grass airfield in the 1930s. On 1 January 1932, No. 1 Armament Training Camp was formed there, {{with a wide variety}} of aircraft that used the nearby gunnery ranges to teach air-to-air and air-to-ground gunnery, and bombing. In 1935 a number of Handley Page Heyford heavy bombers were based at Catfoss with 97 Squadron. The armament camp continued to <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> into the late 1930s, being renamed No. 1 Armament Training Station. With the approach of war, it was decided that the east coast was too vulnerable to attack for training and the unit moved out during 1939.|$|E

500|$|The {{numbers of}} {{performers}} used, mainly dancers, is clearly staggering {{compared to the}} regular comedy or serious play, where the norm was something like 10–15 actors plus a few extras. Although actual numbers are generally vague in these mass scene stage directions, dance scenes {{like that of the}} cyclops, and all the cupids who will join them on the floor minutes later, rely on coordination, choreography, and generous collective effects. Of course the many highly paid dancers would <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> in many roles, returning as townspeople after the scene change of Act 3 with most of the gold paint hastily washed off, and entranced looking upwards to see [...] "Mars and Venus meet in the air in their chariots, his drawn by horses, and hers by doves".|$|E
500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would {{you think of a}} training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix is truly a hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E

5000|$|A fourth method, also {{available}} in English, is using zijn (to be) with the adverb and preposition bezig met (busy with) and the gerund, e.g., Ik ben bezig met lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with reading), meaning I <b>am</b> (<b>busy)</b> reading. If there is an object, there are two forms: 1. the gerund is preceded by the neuter article het and followed by the preposition van (of) and the object, e.g. Ik ben bezig met het lezen van deze brief (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with the reading of this letter), meaning I am reading this letter; 2. the object comes before the full infinitive (instead of the gerund), e.g. Ik ben bezig met deze brief te lezen (lit. I <b>am</b> <b>busy</b> with this letter to read), meaning I am reading this letter. This form of the continuous is mostly used for a real (physical) activity. Grammar-wise, {{it is possible to}} say zij is bezig te denken (lit. she <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to think, she is thinking) or hij is bezig te slapen (lit. he <b>is</b> <b>busy</b> to sleep, he is sleeping), but it sounds strange in Dutch. In these cases, other forms of the continuous are generally used, specifically the second method: Zij is aan het denken and hij is aan het slapen.|$|R

The band continued to tour but in December 2003, they {{announced their}} decision {{to go on a}} hiatus and were forced to forgo that year's Hometown Throwdown. One contributing factor was that several band members were reported to already <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> with other bands and side projects. Another factor was that the band had been touring, almost non-stop, since 1991, and some of the band members desired a break.|$|E

This {{was due to the}} simultaneous development of K-9 by Jetix Europe (with no BBC connections). In [...] "Invasion of the Bane", K-9 is shown to <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> sealing off an artificially-created black hole (explaining his absence from most of the subsequent series).

Emma shows Zelena the Apprentice's wand, as Zelena {{was the only person}} to wield it and lived, then offers Zelena freedom and protection in exchange for her assistance, but Zelena tells Emma that she is a bad influence as her darkness is already causing Henry to resent her, and a broken heart can't be forgiven.

2500|$|... "This {{is not to}} {{say that}} the {{probable}} cause determination in a particular case passes constitutional muster simply because it is provided within 48 hours. Such a hearing may nonetheless violate Gerstein if the arrested individual can prove that his or her probable cause determination was delayed unreasonably. Examples of unreasonable delay are delays for the purpose of gathering additional evidence to justify the arrest, a delay motivated by ill will against the arrested individual, or delay for delay's sake. In evaluating whether the delay in a particular case is unreasonable, however, courts must allow a substantial degree of flexibility. Courts cannot ignore the often unavoidable delays in transporting arrested persons from one facility to another, handling late-night bookings where no magistrate is readily available, obtaining the presence of an arresting officer who may <b>be</b> <b>busy</b> processing other suspects or securing the premises of an arrest, and other practical realities.|$|E
