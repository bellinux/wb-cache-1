Heyman stated that [...] "this [...] didn't happen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> and it didn't happen because of Vince McMahon.

He bursts in, wearing baseball clothes, carrying a bat and glove, and proudly tells them that during his softball game, [...] "I made an incredible {{play in the}} field! There was a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on a fly! We'll be {{in the championship game}} Wednesday <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> It was the single greatest moment in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Los Angeles Times critic Don Heckman, the {{resulting}} textures heard in Black Beautys music exhibited [...] "an almost pointillistic quality, with {{bits and pieces}} of sounds darting {{in and out of the}} overall texture, and Davis' trumpet skimming through the mix". In Spin, Erik Davis highlighted Grossman's [...] "squonking sax", Corea's [...] "nastily distorted" [...] keyboards, and Davis' [...] "milky, yearning, sometimes angry" [...] trumpet playing. Because they were playing around a preceding vamp or theme when Davis signaled the next, Tingen said the musical shifts heard on the record had the effect of post-production crossfades, similar to those used by producer Teo Macero on the studio recordings In a Silent Way (1969), Bitches Brew, and Jack Johnson. Macero claimed Davis conceived his onstage approach from him: [...] "It was <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> because we always overlapped sections in our edits." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time I see {{something}} I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E

I am of no interest to them." [...] In April 2000, in a documentary by Louis Theroux, When Louis Met...

2500|$|Hopper had a {{supporting}} role as the bet-taker, [...] "Babalugats", in Cool Hand Luke (1967). In 1968, Hopper teamed with Peter Fonda, Terry Southern and Jack Nicholson to make Easy Rider, which premiered in July 1969. With the release of True Grit a month earlier, Hopper had starring roles in two major box office films that summer. Hopper won wide acclaim as the director for his improvisational methods and innovative editing for Easy Rider. The production was plagued by creative differences and personal acrimony between Fonda and Hopper, the dissolution of Hopper's marriage to Hayward, his unwillingness to leave the editor's desk and his accelerating abuse of drugs and alcohol. Hopper said of Easy Rider: [...] "The cocaine problem in the United States is really <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> There was no cocaine before Easy Rider on the street. After Easy Rider, it was everywhere".|$|E

Therefore I {{prostrate}} and beg before You, to have mercy on me, and grant me grace, compassion, and mercy in Your eyes and in the eyes of all people. For behold, I forgive with a final and resolved forgiveness anyone who has wronged me, whether in person or property, even if they slandered me, or spread falsehoods against me.

2500|$|Lady Zhen bore Cao Pi {{a son and}} a daughter. Their son, Cao Rui, {{later became}} the second emperor of the state of Cao Wei in the Three Kingdoms period. Their daughter, whose {{personal}} name was not recorded in history, was referred to as [...] "Princess Dongxiang" [...] (東鄉公主; literally [...] "Princess of the East District") in historical records. Lady Zhen remained humble even though Cao Pi deeply fancied her. She provided encouragement to Cao Pi's other wives who were also adored by him, and comforted those whom he less favoured. She also often urged Cao Pi to take more concubines so that he would have more descendants, citing the example of the mythical Yellow Emperor. Cao Pi was very pleased. Once, Cao Pi wanted to send Lady Ren (任氏), one of his concubines who fell out favour with him, back to her family – which meant that he was divorcing her. When Lady Zhen heard about it, she told her husband, [...] "Lady Ren comes from a reputable clan. I can't match her in terms of moral character and looks. Why do you want to send her away?" [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "She is unruly, impulsive and disobedient. She has made me angry many times before. I'm sending her away." [...] Lady Zhen wept and pleaded with her husband, [...] "Everyone knows that you love and adore me, and they'll think that you're sending Lady Ren away <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I fear that I'll be ridiculed and accused of abusing your favour towards me. Please consider your decision again carefully." [...] Cao Pi ignored her and sent Lady Ren away.|$|E

500|$|Kesha re-recorded [...] "Dirty Picture" [...] for {{her debut}} studio album, Animal. The song was {{selective}} in its release only being sold as an album bonus track in United Kingdom and Ireland, and was dubbed [...] "Kesha edit" [...] or [...] "Dirty Picture, Pt. 2". The song {{is similar to}} the original recording of the song with the only noticeable change being that Kesha now sings the song's first verse. While being interviewed by Digital Spy Cruz explained how the cover initially came about and his view on the cover, [...] "she asked me if she could do a version of the song where she sang the first verse and I thought that was a really cool idea. I really like both versions, and it's good that there are these two different versions out there, <b>because</b> fans <b>of</b> <b>me</b> get more <b>of</b> <b>me</b> on mine and [...] fans get more of her on hers." ...|$|R
2500|$|Public {{perception}} is that Buss was instrumental in distancing the team from Jackson, including discounting his assistant Shaw from succeeding him as Lakers head coach. During his interview for the position, Shaw {{said he had to}} defend Jackson when Buss spoke negatively of their former coach. In a May 2011 interview, Jackson said [...] "there's really not a relationship" [...] with him and Buss. However, Buss in 2013 denied the perception of his relationship with Jackson. [...] "I have zero problem with Phil, and Phil has zero problem with me." [...] Buss said he would be fine if Jackson, who is engaged to Buss' sister Jeanie, was on the Lakers' payroll, but only as a consultant. According to Jeanie, Jackson served as an unofficial consultant: [...] "Phil {{is a part of the}} organization <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> ... Jim and Mitch know Phil is a phone call away." [...] Kupchak confirmed that he had interacted with Jackson on unspecified team issues. However, [...] Jackson did not envision a role on the team unless there was [...] "some seismic shift" [...] in the organization. Jeanie also said the Lakers were [...] "in good hands" [...] with Buss and Kupchak in their current roles. The Orange County Register, though, [...] wrote that [...] "many fans would love to imagine" [...] Jackson returning to the Lakers to replace Buss as the leader of basketball operations, and teaming with Jeanie to build a championship team. In 2014, public pressure mounted on the Buss family to hire Jackson, as he was discussing a front office position with the New York Knicks. However, the Lakers did not have a suitable front office role to offer him, and Jackson joined the Knicks as their president of basketball operations.|$|E
