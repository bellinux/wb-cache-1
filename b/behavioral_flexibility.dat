The functionally hyper-aggressive strains namely TA and NC 900 strains served as controls for the study.

40|$|The recent {{emerging}} {{of commercial}} high-level synthesis tools {{raises the question}} of specifying IPs at the algorithmic, or behavioral, level. High-level synthesis allows fast exploration of various architectural solutions from a single <b>behavioral</b> description.

Since reusing code at the behavioral level may be hazardous due to the high abstraction level of the specification, a methodology should be defined in order to provide a framework for ensuring synthesizability of a behavioral IP, performance predictability and toolindependence of the specification. Formalizing the syntax, behavioral semantics and architectural semantics of commercial HLS tools is the first step for defining such a methodology.

40|$|PROBLEM Humans {{exist within}} a {{socially}} mediated dynamical system. Frequent demands are experienced {{to respond to}} change in the environment to adapt and flourish. People with autism have impaired <b>behavioral</b> and thinking <b>flexibility</b> and experience high levels of anxiety, as change and adaptation do not come naturally. The disability inherent in autism is by definition the impaired social and occupational functioning that results from lack of adaptation. The point of the behavioral triad of restricted and repetitive interests, activities, and behaviors has received relatively little attention as compared to the other two points of the triad. METHODS A review of the literature related to restricted and repetitive interests and activities and behaviors and autism was conducted to inform this theoretical review. FINDINGS This paper considers the overly regulated thought and behavior inherent in autism spectrum disorders through the lens of dynamical systems, and an explanatory model is generated.

40|$|As {{witnessed}} by their recent rapid market growth, reconfigurable multi-functional data paths are an attractive alternative to both fully programmable and fully custom hardware platforms. We present a methodology for behavioral synthesis {{of an important}} and large class of reconfigurable data path designs, application specific programmable processors (ASPPs). ASPPs are data paths which provide efficient implementation for any of N functional specifications assuming that only one will be executed at any given time. The synthesis of ASPP designs imposes numerous new tasks on behavioral synthesis tools. We address bundling of applications, where n control-data flow graphs are bundled into at most m groups so that the area overhead is minimized, and all throughput constraints are satisfied. A variety of application specific constraints such as manufacturing cost minimization and risk reduction constraints are incorporated with application bundling. ^ Task preemption is a critical enabling mechanism {{in a variety of}} multi-task real-time application scenarios. On preemption, data in the register files must be preserved in order for the task to be resumed. This entails extra memory to preserve the context and additional clock cycles to save and restore the context. We propose techniques and algorithms to incorporate micro-preemption constraints during ASPP synthesis. Specifically, we develop a controller based scheme to preclude preemption related performance degradation, techniques to minimize the context switch overhead, and algorithms to insert and refine preemption points in scheduled task graphs subject to preemption latency constraints. This on-the-fly task preemption distinguishes ASPPs from other adaptive computing architectures. ^ Using the architectural <b>flexibility</b> provided by <b>behavioral</b> synthesis scheduling and resource allocation, we develop a novel approach for permanent fault-tolerance. This technique combines the <b>behavioral</b> synthesis-based <b>flexibility</b> provided by each of multiple functionalities with judicious application-to-faulty-unit assignment either to maximize the permanent fault-tolerance of such ASPPs (resource constrained fault-tolerant ASPP synthesis) or to guarantee that the ASPP remains operational in the presence of all possible k-unit faults (fault-tolerance constrained ASPP synthesis). ^ We demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall approach, the synthesis algorithms, and software implementations on a number of industrial-strength designs. ...|$|R

The Cebus apella present cerebral particularities and <b>behavioral</b> and cognitive <b>flexibility,</b> possessing abilities that demonstrate an overlap with those of big primates. Objectives: To provide evidence of correlations between anatomical particularities of the brain areas analyzed and some cognitive abilities previously described in these simians. Methods: The relative size of the cerebral hemispheres and prefrontal areas (PFA) were measured using a Universal caliper, in 24 hemispheres of C. apella fixed with 10 % formaldehyde and kept in 70 % alcoholic solution. Results: Data gathered allowed the calculation of the approximate volume (cm 3) of the areas under study: right antimere 35. 2 cm 3 (± 5. 3), left antimere 31. 3 cm 3 (± 5. 4) and of the left PFA 6. 0 cm 3 (± 1. 5) and right PFA 6. 9 cm 3 (± 1. 7). Conclusions: We concluded that the PFA represents about 20 % of the cerebral volume of this primate. No {{significant differences were found}} in the antimeres in terms of volume and area of the hemispheres and likewise for the PFA. These animals have a proportionally bigger brain than that of other neotropical primates in the literature. This allows us to infer that the frontal lobe of C. apella is also larger; possibly related to its maturity and developed cognitive functions indicative of the culture transfers characteristic of this species...|$|R
40|$|Decision making {{processes}} are the research problem, {{that has been}} increasingly undertaken. Alcohol addiction is a disease associated with unfavorable decision making, {{in spite of its}} negative consequences. Impulsivity {{plays an important role in}} alcoholics’ decision making. It can be understood in terms of <b>behavioral</b> and/or cognitive <b>flexibility</b> disorders, that manifest in cognitive function disorders, making it difficult or even impossible to quickly and adequately assess the situation and to adjust behavior according to its requirements. Neurobiological and genetic research indicate the existing relationship between impulsivity and certain genetic predisposition. In alcohol addicts, impulsivity can be understood also in terms of specific personality traits, e. g. novelty seeking according to the theory of Cloninger. Although the concept of impulsivity itself has been the main topic of many studies, not many of them concern also decision making processes. In studies concerning alcoholics’ decision making, the relationship between this processes and behavioral impulsivity defined in many different ways, has been noticed. Some of these works define unfavorable decision making processes itself as a feature of impulsivity. Based on the results of theoretical works and research studies, it seems that it would be worth to define more precisely the concept of impulsivity, in order to determine its effect on decision making. The assessment of whether - and to what extent - the two variables (impulsivity and decision making) can be considered as separate should also be taken into account...|$|R

Ecological data spanning centuries to millennia provide important contextual information for long-term management strategies, especially for species that now are living in relict populations. Here we {{use a variety of}} methods to reconstruct bald eagle diets and local abundance of their potential prey on the Channel Islands from the late Pleistocene to the time when the last breeding pairs disappeared from the islands in the mid- 20 th century. Faunal and isotopic analysis of bald eagles shows that seabirds were important prey for immature/adult eagles for millennia before the eagles’ local extirpation. In historic times (A. D. 1850 – 1950), however, isotopic and faunal data show that breeding bald eagles provisioned their chicks with introduced ungulates (e. g., sheep), which were locally present in high densities. Today, bald eagles are the focus of an extensive conservation program designed to restore a stable breeding population to the Channel Islands, but native and nonnative prey sources that were important for bald eagles in the past are either diminished (e. g., seabirds) or have been eradicated (e. g., introduced ungulates). In the absence of sufficient resources, a growing bald eagle population on the Channel Islands could expand its prey base to include carrion from local pinniped colonies, exert predation pressure on a recovering seabird population, and possibly prey on endangered island foxes...|$|R
