50|$|James Hutchinson Ware (October 27, 1941 - April 26, 2016) was a <b>biostatician</b> and the Frederick Mosteller Professor of Biostatistics and Associate Dean for Clinical and Translational Science at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He {{had been}} Academic Dean for 19 years (1990-2009) under Deans Harvey Fineberg and Barry Bloom {{and served as}} Acting Dean from 1997 to 1998, as Harvey Fineberg assumed the {{position}} of Provost of Harvard University. During Ware's 19-year tenure as academic dean (1990-2009), the student the School's student body doubled in size and its research budget grew {{at an annual rate}} of eight percent. Ware was a co-investigator in the landmark Six Cities Study of Air Pollution and Health, which has had a profound effect on Clean Air Act regulations in the U.S. and efforts to limit air pollution around the world.|$|E

He was offered a named professorship {{and the opportunity to}} set up a center within the college focused on teaching clinical research and supporting career development for doctors who wanted to pursue a career in clinical research. The center also brought <b>biostaticians,</b> {{who had been in the}} public health department, together with physicians from many branches of medicine, with the goal of spreading the appreciation for rigorous statistical design of clinical research. and making statistical expertise more widely available in the college. [...] Packer also won UT Soutwest an NIH Clinical and Translational Science Award award in 2007 to support these efforts.|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the “ADHD- 200 Global Competition” {{was held}} {{with the aim}} of {{identifying}} biomarkers of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (s-MRI) data collected on 973 individuals. Statisticians and computer scientists were potentially the most qualified for the machine learning aspect of the competition, but generally lacked the specialized skills to implement the necessary steps of data preparation for rs-fMRI. Realizing this barrier to entry, the Neuro Bureau prospectively collaborated with all competitors by preprocessing the data and sharing these results at the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) ([URL] This “ADHD- 200 Preprocessed” release included multiple analytical pipelines to cater to different philosophies of data analysis. The processed derivatives included denoised and registered 4 D fMRI volumes, regional time series extracted from brain parcellations, maps of 10 intrinsic connectivity networks, fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, and regional homogeneity, along with grey matter density maps. The data was used by several teams who competed in the ADHD- 200 Global Competition, including the winning entry by a group of <b>biostaticians.</b> To the best of our knowledge, the ADHD- 200 Preprocessed release was the first large public resource of preprocessed resting-state fMRI and structural MRI data, and remains to this day the only resource featuring a battery of alternative processing paths...|$|R
