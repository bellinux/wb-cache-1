Five different <b>borophosphate</b> <b>glass</b> formulations in the systems of 45 P 2 O 5 – 5 B 2 O 3 – 5 Na 2 O–(29 − x) CaO– 16 MgO–(x) Fe 2 O 3 and 45 P 2 O 5 – 5 B 2 O 3 – 5 Na 2 O– 24 CaO–(21 − x) MgO–(x) Fe 2 O 3 where x = 5, 8 and 11 mol% were produced via melt quenching. The compositions and amorphous {{nature of the}} glasses were confirmed by ICP-MS and XRD, respectively. FTIR results indicated depolymerisation of the phosphate chains with a decrease in Q 2 units with increasing Fe 2 O 3 content. DSC analyses showed an increase in Tg by ~ 5 °C with an increment of 3 mol% in Fe 2 O 3 content. The thermal properties were also used to calculate processing window (i. e. Tc,ons—Tg) and another parameter, Kgl, to determine the suitability for fibre drawing directly from melt, which equals (Tc,ons—Tg) /(Tl—Tc,ons). The degradation study conducted in PBS solution at 37 °C showed a decrease of 25 – 47 % in degradation rate with increasing Fe 2 O 3 content. This confirmed that the chemical durability of the glasses had increased, which was suggested {{to be due to}} Fe 2 O 3 addition. Furthermore, the density measured via Archimedes method revealed a linear increase with increasing Fe 2 O 3 content...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reported}} on the structural properties of Lithium-Barium <b>borophosphate</b> <b>glasses.</b> The glasses were prepared through melt quenching technique and studied in the compositional series which was 25 Li 2 O: 25 BaO:(x) B 2 O 3 :(50 -x) P 2 O 5 where 0 x 50 mol%. The aims of this work were to investigate the vibration mode about the local order around phosphorus tetrahedral structures and the boron coordination changed from trigonal to tetrahedral structures. Their basic properties were determined and their structure was studied by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Raman spectroscopy. Both spectroscopy analysis of the sample revealed vibration mode related to the characteristic phosphate bonds and borate bonds especially P-O-P, O-P-O,P-O-B, BO 3 and BO 4. Structural studies were devoted to the investigation of changes in boron coordination in the dependence on changes in B 2 O 3 or P 2 O 5 ratio in the <b>borophosphate</b> <b>glasses.</b> The decrease in {{the strength of the}} vibrations of the non-bridging PO 2 groups seems to indicate a progressive increase in the connectivity of the glass with increasing B 2 O 3 content. It was likely that this connectivity was due to the formation of P-O-B links at 890 cm- 1, which replaced the vibration mode P-O-P. The increasing of B 2 O 3 content and decreasing the P 2 O 5 content causes the boron coordination changes from trigonal to tetrahedral and the basic units change from BO 3 to BO 4. Overall, the high frequency bands corresponding to stretching vibration become broader, less distinct and overlap each other with an increasing B 2 O 3 content and decreasing P 2 O 5 content...|$|R
40|$|Yb/Bi co-doped <b>borophosphate</b> <b>glasses</b> and fibers were-prepared. The {{effect of}} Yb 3 + on the {{near-infrared}} (NIR) luminescent properties and {{the mechanism of}} luminescence of Bi-ions were investigated. Under 976 nm laser diode (LD) excitation, the NIR emission intensity of the glass with 8 mol% Yb 2 O 3 co-doped glass is similar to 37 times stronger than that of Bi singly-doped glass. The fluorescence lifetime increases by similar to 7 times with 5 mol% Yb 2 O 3 co-doped glass. The energy transfer efficiency is similar to 59. 1 %. It is also suggested that the broadband N 1 R luminescence pumped by 808 nm and 976 nm LDs derives from Bi+ and Bi 2 +, respectively. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
