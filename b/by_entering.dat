5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British garrison at Germantown in early October.

The marked male is interpreted as an invader by worker ants and is killed.|$|E

5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have given rise to the ancestor of plants <b>by</b> <b>entering</b> into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E

It served as a place where sins and taboos could be absolved just <b>by</b> <b>entering</b> it. Even Igbo living far from the center of power would send abnormal children to Nri for ritual cleansing rather than having them killed, as was sometimes the case for dwarfs or children who cut their top teeth before their lower teeth.|$|E

The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna.

5|$|The crisis showed Muhammad {{that many}} of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their {{defection}} and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves <b>by</b> <b>entering</b> into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.|$|E

5|$|When Altares {{encounters}} a star cluster, Anna tells Jane of Einstein's accomplishments {{in the areas}} of special relativity and unified field theory. Shortly after, the ship is hit by a meteor shower that damages various systems and causes the photon drive to re-activate, hurling Altares through space at such velocity that the travellers are knocked out. A fail-safe brings the vessel, now powerless, to a halt within the gravitational field of a red giant on the brink of supernova. Donning a heat suit, Captain Masters risks his life <b>by</b> <b>entering</b> the reactor core in a bid to repair the drive. He succeeds, and Anna and Jane pilot the ship outside the blast radius of the star before it explodes.|$|E
5|$|All three text-based games {{require the}} player {{to control a}} rocket {{attempting}} {{to land on the}} moon <b>by</b> <b>entering</b> instructions to the rocket in a turn-based system in response to the textual summary of its current position and velocity relative to the ground. In the original Lunar, players controlled only the amount of vertical thrust to apply, based on their current vertical velocity and remaining fuel, with each round representing one second of travel time. Rocket added a simple text-based graphical display of the distance from the ground in each round, while LEM added horizontal velocity and the ability to apply thrust at an angle. In 1970 and 1971, DEC employee and editor of the newsletter David H. Ahl converted two early mainframe games, Lunar and Hamurabi, from the FOCAL language to BASIC, partially as a demonstration of the language on the DEC PDP-8 minicomputer. Their popularity led him to start printing BASIC games in the DEC newsletter, both his own and reader submissions.|$|E
