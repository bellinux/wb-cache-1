Several selective agonists and antagonists are now available for the putative epsilon receptor; however, efforts to locate a gene for this receptor have been unsuccessful, and epsilon-mediated effects were absent in μ/δ/κ [...] "triple knockout" [...] mice, suggesting the epsilon receptor is likely to be either a splice variant derived from alternate post-translational modification, or a heteromer derived from hybridization of two or more of the known opioid receptors.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{restraint}} stress and opiates on prolactin secretion in male rats have been measured. Both induced a short-lived increase in prolactinaemia. Experimental {{evidence indicates that}} both opioids and restraint stress bring about their actions by the activation of opioid receptors. When restraint stress was followed by administration of the specific κ-agonist <b>bremazocine,</b> a second prolactin peak was observed. In contrast, morphine (predominantly a μ-agonist) lost its prolactin-stimulating capacity when given {{after a period of}} restraint stress. This indicates cross-tolerance between restraint stress and morphine. Tolerance was overcome when the dose of morphine was doubled, and an increase in prolactin secretion could again be obtained. The cross-tolerance phenomenon argues that a common opioid receptor is involved in morphine- and restraint stress-stimulated prolactin release. In another set of experiments, in which morphine administration replaced restraint stress as a means of inducing tolerance, a second rise in prolactinaemia was seen only with <b>bremazocine</b> and not with a further administration of morphine. This suggests a morphine (μ) receptor-specific development of tolerance. Two consecutive administrations of <b>bremazocine</b> also produced tolerance, in this case for the κ-receptor.

Systemic administration of nalfurafine (0. 1 – 1 µg/kg), <b>bremazocine</b> (0. 1 – 1 µg/kg), or GR 89696 (0. 01 – 0. 1 µg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated intrathecal morphine (0. 03 mg) -induced scratching responses without affecting morphine antinociception. The combination of intrathecal morphine with these KOR agonists did not cause sedation. In addition, pretreatment with effective antiscratching doses of nalfurafine, <b>bremazocine,</b> or GR 89696 did not antagonize systemic morphine-induced antinociception and respiratory depression. The dose-addition analysis revealed that there is no subadditivity for nalfurafine in combination with morphine in the antinociceptive effect. Furthermore, the KOR antagonist study revealed that antiscratching effects of both nalfurafine and a prototypical KOR- 1 agonist, U- 50488 H [trans-(±) - 3, 4 -dichloro-N-methyl-N-(2 -[1 -pyrrolidinyl]-cyclohexyl) -benzeneacetamide], could be blocked completely by a selective KOR antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (3 mg/kg). These findings suggest that the agonist action on KOR mainly contributes to the effectiveness of these atypical KOR agonists as antipruritics, and there is no evidence for KOR subtypes or µ-opioid antagonist action underlying the effects of these KOR agonists. This mechanism-based study further supports the clinical potential of KOR agonists as antipruritics under the context of spinal opioid analgesia...|$|E
40|$|Summary [...] Opioid {{agonists}} of the mu, kappa and delta types stimulated low-Km guanosine triphos-phatase (GTPase) in membranes, {{from the}} brain of the rat by up to 34 %, with potencies the rank order of which corresponded to the respective binding affinities to opioid receptor. In general, kappa ligands stimulated GTPase {{to a lesser degree}} than mu or delta opiates. The coupling of a given type of opioid receptor to GTPase was resolved by direct or protective alkylation of the other receptors. Treatment of the membranes with I-funaltrexamine abolished the stimulation of GTPase by sufentanil and levorphanol (mu), but not by <b>bremazocine</b> (kappa) or DSLET (delta). On the other hand, prior incubation with Superfit, an alkylating agent with selectivity for the delta opioid receptor, specifically eliminated the effect of DSLET. Partial alkylation by increasing concentrations of Superfit gradually reduced the extent of stimulation of GTPase by DSLET. The successive treatment of membranes with Superfit and /?-funaltrex-amine blocked the actions of DSLET, sufentanil and levorphanol, but had no effect on the stimulation of the GTPase by <b>bremazocine.</b> Selective coupling of an opioid receptor to GTPase was also obtained after incubation of membranes with B-chlornaltrexamine in the presence of protective concentrations of mu, kappa or delta opioid ligands.

40|$|Opioid receptors {{are members}} of the guanine {{nucleotide}} binding protein (G protein) -coupled receptor family. Three types of opioid receptors have been cloned and characterized and are referred to as the delta, kappa and mu types. Analysis of receptor chimeras and site-directed mutant receptors has provided {{a great deal of information}} about functionally important amino acid side chains that constitute the ligand-binding domains and G-protein-coupling domains of G-protein-coupled receptors. We have constructed delta/mu opioid receptor chimeras that were express in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in order to define receptor domains that are responsible for receptor type selectivity. All chimeric receptors and wild-type delta and mu opioid receptors displayed high-affinity binding of etorphine (an agonist), naloxone (an antagonist), and <b>bremazocine</b> (a mixed agonist/antagonist). In contrast, chimeras that lacked the putative first extracellular loop of the mu receptor did not bind the mu-selective peptide [D-Ala 2,MePhe 4,Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAMGO). Chimeras that lacked the putative third extracellular loop of the delta receptor did not bind the delta-selective peptide, [D-Ser 2,D-Leu 5]enkephalin-Thr (DSLET). Point mutations in the putative third extracellular loop of the wild-type delta receptor that converted vicinal arginine residues to glutamine abolished DSLET binding while not affecting <b>bremazocine,</b> etorphine, and naltrindole binding.

Spontaneous behavior was videotaped and analyzed by estimating the percentage of time spent by the animals in performing certain specific behavioral items. Mu agonists stimulated DA-release and metabolism in the accumbens at lower doses than in the caudate. Maximal stimulation of DA release did not exceed 100 % except after high doses of methadone (10 mg/kg) which stimulated DA release in the accumbens by more than 300 %, possibly {{as a result of}} hypoxia.

The successive treatment of membranes with Superfit and [beta]-funaltrex-amine blocked the actions of DSLET, sufentanil and levorphanol, but had no effect on the stimulation of the GTPase by <b>bremazocine.</b> Selective coupling of an opioid receptor to GTPase was also obtained after incubation of membranes with [beta]-chlornaltrexamine in the presence of protective concentrations of mu, kappa or delta opioid ligands. Alkylation resolved the coupling of the non-selective opiate etorphine: the sum of stimulation of GTPase in the receptor-selective membranes equalled maximal stimulation of enzyme in untreated membranes. Naloxone blocked the stimulation of GTPase by mu, kappa or delta agonists, but ICI- 174, 864 specifically inhibited the effect of DSLET. The results describe the use of receptor-selective membranes from brain to characterize the coupling of multiple opioid receptors to high-affinity GTPase, the inhibitory binding protein for GTP of the adenylate cyclase complex...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{demonstrated}} that a membrane receptor for glucocorticoids (mGR) exists in neuronal membranes from the roughskin newt (Taricha granulosa) {{and that this}} receptor {{appears to be a}} G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). The present study investigated the question of whether this mGR recognizes nonsteroid ligands that bind to cognate receptors in the GPCR superfamily. To address this question, ligand-binding competition studies evaluated the potencies of various ligands to displace [3 H]corticosterone (CORT) binding to neuronal membranes. Initial screening studies tested 21 different competitors and found that [3 H]CORT binding was displaced only by dynorphin 1 – 13 amide (an endogenous �-selective opioid peptide), U 50, 488 (a synthetic �-specific agonist) and naloxone (a nonselective opioid antagonist). Follow-up studies revealed that the � agonists <b>bremazocine</b> (BRE) and ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) also displace...|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that mu opioid agonists such as morphine may produce greater antinociception in male than in female rodents. The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the generality of this finding across dose, time and type of opioid agonist. In adult female and male Sprague-Dawley rats, time-effect curves were obtained for vehicle and three doses each of the mu agonists fentanyl and buprenorphine, the kappa agonists (5 a, 7 a, 8 a) -(2) -N-methyl-[7 -(1 -pyrrolidinyl) - 1 -oxaspiro-(4, 5) dec- 8 -yl]benzeneacetamide (U 69, 593) and <b>bremazocine</b> and the delta agonists [D-Pen 2,D-Pen 5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and deltorphin on the 52 °C hot-plate and tail-withdrawal (immer-sion) assays.

40|$|In rhesus monkeys, kappa oploid {{agonists}} {{have been}} shown to 1) increase urinary output, 2) increase tail-withdrawal latencies from warm water and 3) produce distinct discriminative stimulus effects. In order to explore further the relation between these effects and activity at the kappa opioid receptor type, the antag-onist activity of quadazocine against several kappa oploid ago-fists was examined with the tail-withdrawal and dwg-discrimi-nation procedures. Quadazocine dose dependently antagonized the icreases in tI-withdrawal latency produced by the kappa agonists bremazoane, ethylketazocine and U- 50, 488, as well as the discriminative stimulus effects of these drugs. The dose-ratio analysis of Schild revealed apparent pA 2 values for quadazocine in combination with <b>bremazocine,</b> ethylketazocine and U- 50, 488 of 6. 1, 6. 4 and 6. 4, respectively, with the tail-withdrawal proce...|$|E

40|$|A {{diuretic}} {{effect of}} the pentapeptide BW 942 C [Tyr-D-Met(O) -Gly-pNO 2 -Phe-Pro-NH 2 HCII was demonstrated in humans and rats; it was characterized pharmacologically using whole animal, iso-lated tissue and in vitro binding studies. A single 2 -mg dose of BW 942 C increased urine output 5 -fold over control values in humans. In Long-Evans rats, BW 942 C produced a biphasic dose-response curve for urine output with lower doses increas-ing and higher doses suppressing output. Low doses of naltrex-one antagonized the antidiuresis, and high doses antagonized the diuresis produced by BW 942 C. BW 942 C was less effica-cious in producing diuresis than the full kappa agonists brema-zocine and U 50, 488 H (trans- 3, 4 -dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2 -(1 -pyr-rolidinyl) -cyclohexylj-benzeneacetamide methanesulfonate, hy-drate).

40|$|By {{screening}} a rat brain cDNA library using a cloned mu {{opioid receptor}} cDNA as probe, a clone was identified {{that is very}} similar to both the mu and delta opioid receptor sequences. Transient expression of this clone in COS- 7 cells showed that it encodes a kappa opioid receptor, designated KOR- 1, which is capable of high-affinity binding to kappa-selective ligands. Treatment of transfected cell membranes with <b>bremazocine,</b> a kappa-selective agonist, resulted in a 53 % decrease in adenylate cyclase activity, indicating that this kappa opioid receptor displays inhibitory coupling to adenylate cyclase. Thus, one member from each of the three opioid receptor types, mu, kappa and delta, has been molecularly cloned. Analysis of sequence similarities among these opioid receptors, as well as between opioid receptors and other G-protein-coupled receptors, revealed regions of sequence conservation that may underlie the ligand-binding and functional specificities of opioid receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} analgesic {{potency of}} 1 1 opkd agents {{was assessed by}} ung the acec add test in amphibians. Systemic administra-tion of the mu agonists, fentan 1, levorphanol, methadone, mor-phine, meperkiine and codeine; the partial mu agonist, bupren-orphine; and the kappa agonists nalorphine, <b>bremazocine,</b> U 50488 and CI- 977 was made by s. c. injection into the dorsal lymph sac of the Northern grass frog, Rana pipiens. All agents produced a dose-dependent and long-lasting analgesia which persisted for at least 4 hr. The analgesic effects of single doses of each agent were significandy blocked or reduced by pretreat-ment with naltrexone. Systemic oploids produced log dose-response curves which yielded EDse values ranging from 1. 4 nmol/g for fentanyl to 320. 9 nmol/g for nalorphine.

40|$|The {{effect of}} various {{drugs on the}} {{extracellular}} concentration of dopamine in two terminal dopaminergic areas, the nucleus accumbens septi (a limbic area) and the dorsal caudate nucleus (a subcortical motor area), was studied in freely moving rats by using brain dialysis. Drugs abused by humans (e. g., opiates, ethanol, nicotine, amphetamine, and cocaine) increased extracellular dopamine concentrations in both areas, but especially in the accumbens, and elicited hypermotility at low doses. On the other hand, drugs with aversive properties (e. g., agonists of kappa opioid receptors, U- 50, 488, tifluadom, and <b>bremazocine)</b> reduced dopamine release in the accumbens and in the caudate and elicited hypomotility. Haloperidol, a neuroleptic drug, increased extracellular dopamine concentrations, but this effect was not preferential for the accumbens and was associated with hypomotility and sedation. Drugs not abused by humans [e. g., imipramine (an antidepressant), atropine (an antimuscarinic drug), and diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) ] failed to modify synaptic dopamine concentrations. These results provide biochemical evidence for the hypothesis that stimulation of dopamine transmission in the limbic system might be a fundamental property of drugs that are abused...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} opioids were {{compared}} in five field-stimulated isolated tissue models, the guinea-pig ileum and vasa deferentia from rat, rabbit and mice of the Alderley Park and C 57 BL/ 6 strains. Although the mu-receptor agonist [D-Ala 2, MePhe 4, Gly-ol 5] enkephalin appeared to act at similar receptors in the guinea-pig ileum, rat vas deferens, mouse vas deferens and C 57 BL/ 6 mouse vas deferens preparations, its potency varied considerably between these preparations. Similar potency differences were also observed with the kappa-agonist, ethylketocyclazocine. It is proposed that these variations in potency reflect {{differences in the}} number of spare receptors present in each model. The finding that some drugs which have agonist activity in the more sensitive preparations behave as antagonists in the less sensitive tissues supports this proposal and highlights the importance of intrinsic activity in determining the action of opioids. Many of the prototypic opioid agonists were found to be either partial agonists (eg. morphine and <b>bremazocine)</b> or to possess affinity for more than one receptor type (eg. ethylketocyclazocine, Mr 2034) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{identification}} of a gene, named SLC- 11, encoding a novel G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). A customized search procedure of a database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) retrieved a human cDNA sequence that partially encoded a GPCR. A genomic DNA fragment identical to the cDNA was obtained and used to screen a library to isolate the full-length coding region of the gene. This gene was intronless in its open reading frame, and encoded a receptor of 402 amino acids, and shared − 40 % amino acid identity in the transmembrane (TM) regions to the five known human somatostatin receptors. Northern blot analysis revealed that SLC- 1 is expressed in human brain regions, including the forebrain and hypothalamus. Expression in the rat was highest in brain, followed by heart, kidney, and ovary. Expression of SLC- 1 in COS- 7 cells failed to show specific binding to radiolabelled Tyr 1 -somatostatin- 14, naloxone, <b>bremazocine,</b> 1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) -guanidine (DTG), or haloperidol.
