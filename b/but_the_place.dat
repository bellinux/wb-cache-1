As time passed and no signs of surrender appeared, {{the approach of the}} dreaded rainy season caused alarm among the Burmese command. Several senior commanders advised calling off the invasion. However, Maha Nawrahta decided to continue the invasion, and his colleague Thihapate supported him. The Burmese command now made preparations to meet the rise of the river by collecting boats and building embankments on the bits of high ground.|$|E

2500|$|... "Anglesey" [...] {{is derived}} from Old Norse, {{originally}} either Ǫngullsey [...] "Hook Island" [...] or Ǫnglisey [...] "Ǫngli's Island".
