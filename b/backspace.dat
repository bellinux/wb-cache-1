25|$|In {{informal}} {{applications such}} as personal letters where low priority {{was placed on the}} appearance of the document, or conversely in highly formal applications in which it was important that any corrections be obvious, the <b>backspace</b> key could be used to back up over the error and then overstrike it with hyphens, slashes, Xs, or the like.|$|E
500|$|The album {{title was}} chosen {{in part because}} of nostalgia for the {{historical}} name of the <b>backspace</b> key on typewriters that went out of use in the 1950s and also as a reference to looking back on one's life. Vedder is known to use typewriters when writing lyrics and letters. Vedder said, [...] "Backspacer [...] actually you kind of {{have to go back and}} look at your mistake." [...] Gossard said, [...] "There's some retrospective moods on this record, where Ed is looking at both his past and his future." [...] The album title Backspacer was also used for the name of a leatherback turtle that was sponsored by Pearl Jam for Conservation International and National Geographic's Great Turtle Race.|$|E

50|$|The motor at {{the back}} of the machine drives a belt {{connected}} to a two-part shaft located roughly halfway through the machine. The cycle shaft on the left side powers the tilt and rotate mechanism. The operational shaft on the right side powers functions such as spacing, <b>backspacing,</b> and case shifting, as well as serving as a governor, limiting the left-to-right speed with which the carrier moves. A series of spring clutches power the cams which provide the motion needed to perform functions such as <b>backspacing.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Insert key {{is mainly}} used to switch between overtype mode, {{in which the}} cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a {{character}} at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The Delete key discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position [...] "back" [...] towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and <b>Backspace</b> are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a <b>Backspace</b> key. The <b>Backspace</b> key deletes the preceding character.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>backspace</b> (BS) – a {{keystroke}} {{that moved}} the cursor backwards one position (on a physical platen, {{this is the}} exact opposite of the space key), for the purpose of overtyping a character. This could be for combining characters (e.g. an apostrophe, <b>backspace,</b> and period make an exclamation point—a character missing on some early typewriters), or for correction such as with the correcting tape that developed later.|$|E
2500|$|The letter [...] "Í" [...] {{is often}} placed {{left of the}} space key, leaving {{the width of the}} left Shift key intact. [...] "Ű" [...] may be located to the left of <b>Backspace,</b> making that key smaller, but {{allowing}} for a larger Enter key. Ű being close to Enter often leads to it being typed instead of hitting Enter, especially when one has just switched from a keyboard that has Ű next to <b>backspace.</b>|$|E
40|$|Framed by Erving Goffman's (1963) {{concept of}} <b>backspaces,</b> this article interprets the {{accounts}} people provide {{for participating in}} playful deviance during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. <b>Backspaces</b> provide a liminal license for people to transgress norms, participate in playful deviance, and present their secret self in urban settings. The major findings are that playful deviance is an urban tourist attraction that provides self-validation and enjoyment for participants. Examples of playful deviance include flashing the breasts, penises, buttocks; masturbating; performing or receiving oral sex; orhaving penetrative sex in public with strangers onBourbon Street during Mardi Gras...|$|R
5000|$|... is the tilde, {{an accent}} <b>backspaced</b> and printed over other letters for non-English languages. Nowadays the key {{does not produce}} a backspaceable {{character}} in US/UK keyboard layouts, and is used for 'not' or 'circa'.|$|R
50|$|Terminals may {{be given}} time to {{exercise}} various control codes that would (on a teletypewriter or similar) result in physical movements of the carriage that may take significant (from the computer's point of view) amounts of time, such as <b>backspaces,</b> horizontal tabs, carriage returns, form feeds, and line feeds.|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, POSIX {{defines a}} [...] as a text file whose {{characters}} are printable or space or <b>backspace</b> according to regional rules. This excludes control characters, {{which are not}} printable.|$|E
2500|$|Most Selectric IIIs and Electronic Typewriters {{only had}} keys for 92 {{printable}} characters; the 96-character keyboard was an optional feature. [...] Fitting the additional keys onto the keyboard required shrinking the Return key and <b>Backspace</b> keys. This was annoying to many typists, {{so it was}} not the default configuration. The keytops on the Selectric III and Electronic Typewriters were larger and more square than those on earlier Selectrics.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the {{operating}} system, the space bar used with a modifier key such as the control key may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or even <b>backspacing.</b> On web browsers, the space bar usually allows the user to page down or to page up when the space bar is used with the shift key.|$|R
50|$|Escape {{sequences}} are {{a general}} technique for represent characters that are otherwise difficult to represent directly, including delimiters, nonprinting characters (such as <b>backspaces),</b> newlines, and whitespace characters (which are otherwise impossible to distinguish visually), {{and have a}} long history. They are accordingly widely used in string literals, and adding an escape sequence (either to a single character or throughout a string) is known as escaping.|$|R
50|$|Aftermarket {{wheel studs}} offer {{the ability to}} mount a wheel that is not factory {{supplied}} to that vehicle. Screw-in studs with a larger than original threaded diameter portion permit mounting of wheels with larger diameter holes. Wheel studs of longer length allow the use of wheel spacers to move a wheel further out to compensate for rubbing or <b>backspacing</b> issues or to make the wheel look like it is larger than factory standard.|$|R
2500|$|The Perkins Brailler is a [...] "braille typewriter" [...] {{with a key}} {{corresponding}} {{to each of the}} six dots of the braille code, a space key, a <b>backspace</b> key, and a line space key. [...] Like a manual typewriter, it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a carriage return lever above the keys. [...] The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.|$|E
2500|$|Many older {{typewriters}} did {{not include}} a separate key for the numeral 1 or the exclamation point, and some even older ones also lacked the numeral zero. [...] Typists who trained on these machines learned the habit of using the lowercase letter l ("ell") for the digit 1, and the uppercase O for the zero. A cents symbol (¢) was created by combining (over-striking) a lower case 'c' with a slash character (typing 'c', then <b>backspace,</b> then '/').|$|E
5000|$|Turn the {{delete key}} into a <b>backspace.</b> Fn+Delete remains <b>backspace,</b> and Fn + {{top-right}} key remains delete.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{invention}} of Tipp-Ex, it became possible to erase a typographical error typed with a typewriter. The typewriter would be <b>backspaced</b> to the letter that was to be changed, the correction paper would be placed in front of the ribbon, and the mistyped letter would be re-typed. The system only worked if the typewriter repositioned the re-typed letter in exactly the same place as originally typed, which could be problematic if returning to a previous line.|$|R
25|$|Characters were {{proportionally}} spaced, {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being selectable as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 characters per inch). Tab stops could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support <b>backspacing</b> over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the control}} codes area (the C0 range), the Spectrum mostly uses {{proprietary}} controls, such as INK and PAPER to control foreground and background colour. However, the common [...] and [...] code points {{are the same}} as in ASCII. Cursor-down (0x0A, ASCII Line Feed) can be simulated with 32 spaces printed with OVER 1 (transparent overprint) and cursor-up 0x0B (ASCII Vertical Tabulation) can be simulated with 32 <b>backspaces.</b> The system ROM has a fault which prevents cursor-right at 0x09 (c.f. ASCII Horizontal Tabulation) from working.|$|R

50|$|In modern systems, the <b>backspace</b> key {{is often}} mapped to the delete {{character}} (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the <b>backspace</b> key's function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exclamation mark}} {{did not have}} its own {{dedicated}} key on standard manual typewriters before the 1970s. Instead, one typed a period, <b>backspaced,</b> and typed an apostrophe. In the 1950s, secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as [...] "bang", perhaps from comic books where the ! appeared in dialogue balloons to represent a gun being fired, although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing. This bang usage is behind {{the names of the}} interrobang, an unconventional typographic character, and a shebang line, a feature of Unix computer systems.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and take-up spools of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the supply reel is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when <b>backspacing</b> or rewinding.|$|R

5000|$|The {{delete key}} is located {{directly}} above the enter key; the key normally found {{there is the}} second rightmost key on the row above it. Furthermore, this is an actual delete key, not a historically named <b>backspace.</b> <b>Backspace</b> is accessible through Fn+Delete.|$|E
50|$|GNOME Terminal {{supports}} {{a couple of}} different compatibility options for interfacing with older software that depends on varying keyboard-to-ASCII assignments. In computing, there has been ambiguity between the <b>backspace</b> key and delete key. When the user presses the <b>backspace</b> key, the computer can either delete the character before the cursor, or the character at the cursor, which introduces this ambiguity (see ASCII). GNOME Terminal allows the user specify which control character or escape sequence the delete and the <b>backspace</b> keys should generate. Users can specify this option on a per-profile basis.|$|E
500|$|The European Commission also {{specified}} a euro logo with exact proportions and foreground {{and background}} colour tones. While the Commission intended the logo to be a prescribed glyph shape, font designers {{made it clear}} that they intended to design their own variants instead. Typewriters lacking the euro sign can create it by typing a capital 'C', <b>backspacing</b> and overstriking it with the equal ('=') sign. Placement of the currency sign relative to the numeric amount varies from nation to nation, but for texts in English the symbol (or the ISO-standard [...] "EUR") should precede the amount.|$|R
40|$|A minor {{release to}} {{incorporate}} a few bugfixes and minor features before the upcoming big 0. 7 release Bugfix: fixed {{a problem when}} trying to set the loglevel to DEBUG Bugfix: fixed a random crash of the heartbeat thread (see # 101). Feature: added [...] force/-f option to disable errors and warnings concerning suspicious changes. (thanks to Yannic Kilcher) Feature: experiments can now be run in Jupyter notebook, but will fail with an error by default, which can be deactivated using interactive=True Feature: added support for adding a captured out filter, and a filter that and applies <b>backspaces</b> and linefeeds before saving like a terminal would. (thanks to Kevin McGuinness...|$|R
25|$|The {{correction}} key (an extra key {{at the bottom}} right of the keyboard) <b>backspaced</b> the carriage by one space and also put the machine in a mode wherein the next character typed would use the correction tape instead of the normal ribbon, and furthermore would not advance the carriage. The typist would press (and release) the {{correction key}} and then re-type the erroneous character, either lifting it off of the page or (if using other than the correctable ribbon) covering it with white-out powder, then type the correct character. Any number of mistakes could be corrected this way, but the process was entirely manual, as the machine had no memory of the typed characters.|$|R
