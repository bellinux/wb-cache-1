5|$|Several {{chemical}} compounds with potential biological activities {{are found in}} sundews, including flavonoids (kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin and hyperoside), quinones (plumbagin, hydroplumbagin glucoside and rossoliside (7–methyl–hydrojuglone–4–glucoside)), and other constituents such as carotenoids, plant acids (e.g. <b>butyric</b> acid, citric acid, formic acid, gallic acid, malic acid, propionic acid), resin, tannins and ascorbic acid (vitamin C).|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, <b>butyric</b> acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as <b>butyric</b> acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic Archaea that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming Archaea keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the blood–brain barrier, but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., <b>butyric</b> acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the blood–brain barrier and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E
25|$|<b>Butyric</b> acid is a bacteria-induced wine {{fault that}} can cause a wine to smell of spoiled Camembert or rancid butter.|$|E
25|$|Parmigiano {{has many}} aroma-active compounds, {{including}} various aldehydes and butyrates. <b>Butyric</b> acid and isovaleric acid together are sometimes used {{to imitate the}} dominant aromas.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation {{products}} like 2-ethyl-3-methyl <b>butyric</b> acid and esters like ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate {{give rise to}} the sweet and fruitiness of rum.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylic acids {{often have}} strong odors, {{especially}} the volatile derivatives. Most common are acetic acid (vinegar) and <b>butyric</b> acid (human vomit). Conversely esters of carboxylic acids {{tend to have}} pleasant odors and many are used in perfume.|$|E
25|$|PEPCK levels rose in {{roots and}} stems when the plants were watered with {{ammonium}} chloride {{at a low}} pH (but not at high pH), or with <b>butyric</b> acid. However, PEPCK levels did not increase in leaves under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, various {{amino acids}} were {{isolated}} from the meteorite fragment at Johnson Space Center. Among them were aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, alanine, and <b>butyric</b> acid. However, {{it is not clear}} whether they were originally from the meteorite or the product of terrestrial contamination.|$|E
25|$|Fibre, {{especially}} cellulose and hemi-cellulose, {{is primarily}} {{broken down into}} the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and <b>butyric</b> acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water {{and many of the}} inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream.|$|E
25|$|Organic acids {{comprise}} {{most of the}} {{acids in}} honey, accounting for 0.17–1.17% of the mixture, with gluconic acid formed {{by the actions of}} an enzyme called glucose oxidase as the most prevalent. Other organic acids are minor, consisting of formic, acetic, <b>butyric,</b> citric, lactic, malic, pyroglutamic, propionic, valeric, capronic, palmitic, and succinic, among many others.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of short-chain fatty acids has several possible {{actions on the}} gut mucosa. All of the short-chain fatty acids are readily absorbed by the colonic mucosa, but only acetic acid reaches the systemic circulation in appreciable amounts. <b>Butyric</b> acid appears {{to be used as}} a fuel by the colonic mucosa as the preferred energy source for colonic cells.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{butter is}} about 80% {{butterfat}} and 15% water; traditionally made butter may have {{as little as}} 65% fat and 30% water. Butterfat {{is a mixture of}} triglyceride, a triester derived from glycerol and three of any of several fatty acid groups. Butter becomes rancid when these chains break down into smaller components, like <b>butyric</b> acid and diacetyl. The density of butter is 0.911g/cm3 (0.527oz/in3), about the same as ice.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, <b>butyric,</b> linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} a biological/chemical method for converting any biodegradable material (e.g., urban wastes, such as municipal solid waste, biodegradable waste, and sewage sludge, agricultural residues such as corn stover, sugarcane bagasse, cotton gin trash, manure) into useful chemicals, such as carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, <b>butyric</b> acid), ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone) and biofuels, {{such as a}} mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, n-butanol) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true biorefinery.|$|E
25|$|The undigested residue {{from the}} {{fermentation}} {{may be used}} in gasification to make hydrogen (H2). This H2 can then be used to hydrogenolyze the esters over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite), which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., ammonium acetate, propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, <b>butyric</b> acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., hexanol, heptanol). From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the esterification, and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).|$|E
25|$|As the {{chlorine}} atom moves {{further away from}} the acidic O—H bond, its effect diminishes. When {{the chlorine}} atom is just one carbon removed from the carboxylic acid group, the acidity of the compound increases significantly compared to butanoic acid (a.k.a. <b>butyric</b> acid). However, when the chlorine atom is separated by several bonds, the effect is much smaller. Bromine is much more electronegative than either carbon or hydrogen, but not as electronegative as chlorine, so the pKa of 2-bromobutanoic acid is slightly greater than the pKa of 2-chlorobutanoic acid.|$|E
25|$|The {{first four}} names {{were derived from}} methanol, ether, propionic acid and <b>butyric</b> acid, {{respectively}} (hexadecane is also {{sometimes referred to as}} cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix -ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel (-a or -o) from the basic numerical term. Hence, pentane, C5H12; hexane, C6H14; heptane, C7H16; octane, C8H18; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example nonane, use the Latin prefix non-. For a more complete list, see List of alkanes.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese whaling fleet {{had several}} clashes with anti-whaling protesters and activists from various groups, {{including}} the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, endeavoring to follow, document and disrupt the whaling fleet since the 2005–2006 season. On January 15, 2008 two crew members traveling on the MV Steve Irwin boarded the whaling ship Yushin Maru 2 without permission and were subsequently detained {{on board the}} ship {{for a number of}} days. Japan claimed that four crew members on board a Japanese whaling ship in Antarctic waters were injured March 3, 2008 when the anti-whaling group threw <b>butyric</b> acid on board.|$|E
25|$|A major use of {{formic acid}} is as a {{preservative}} and antibacterial agent in livestock feed. In Europe, it is applied on silage (including fresh hay) {{to promote the}} fermentation of lactic acid and to suppress the formation of <b>butyric</b> acid; it also allows fermentation to occur quickly, and at a lower temperature, reducing the loss of nutritional value. Formic acid arrests certain decay processes and causes the feed to retain its nutritive value longer, {{and so it is}} widely used to preserve winter feed for cattle. In the poultry industry, it is sometimes added to feed to kill E. coli bacteria. Use as preservative for silage and (other) animal feed constituted 30% of the global consumption in 2009.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Millikan {{referred}} I. H. Lyons {{from the}} National Postal Meter Company to Arnold Beckman. Lyons wanted a non-clogging ink so that postage could be printed by machines, {{instead of having}} clerks lick stamps. Beckman's solution was to make ink with <b>butyric</b> acid, a malodorous substance. Because of this ingredient, no manufacturer wanted to manufacture it. Beckman decided to make it himself. He started the National Inking Appliance Company, obtaining space in a garage owned by instrument maker Fred Henson and hiring two Caltech students, Robert Barton and Henry Fracker. Beckman developed {{and took out a}} couple of patents for re-inking typewriter ribbons, but marketing them was not successful. This was Beckman's first experience at running a company and marketing a product, and while this first product failed, Beckman repurposed the company for another product.|$|E
25|$|The {{acids in}} wine are an {{important}} component in both winemaking and the finished product of wine. They are present in both grapes and wine, having direct influences on the color, balance and taste of the wine {{as well as the}} growth and vitality of yeast during fermentation and protecting the wine from bacteria. The measure of the amount of acidity in wine is known as the “titratable acidity” or “total acidity”, which refers to the test that yields the total of all acids present, while strength of acidity is measured according to pH, with most wines having a pH between 2.9 and 3.9. Generally, the lower the pH, the higher the acidity in the wine. However, there is no direct connection between total acidity and pH (it is possible to find wines with a high pH for wine and high acidity). In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. During the course of winemaking and in the finished wines, acetic, <b>butyric,</b> lactic and succinic acids can play significant roles. Most of the acids involved with wine are fixed acids with the notable exception of acetic acid, mostly found in vinegar, which is volatile and can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity. Sometimes, additional acids, such as ascorbic, sorbic and sulfurous acids, are used in winemaking.|$|E
500|$|Byne was {{convinced}} that <b>butyric</b> acid was present together with calcium acetate in the affected shells, although he never really described the methods he used in the so-called [...] "extensive chemical tests" [...] he claimed to [...] have applied to these specimens. Among other conclusions, he assumed that the <b>butyric</b> acid originated from bacterial activity. He also concluded that the decaying effect 'travelled from shell to shell and drawer to drawer', and thus the condition {{came to be called}} a [...] "disease".|$|E
500|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} to produce many {{commercial}} and industrial chemicals, enzymes and other bioactive molecules. Organic acids produced on a large industrial scale by microbial fermentation include acetic acid produced by acetic acid bacteria such as Acetobacter aceti, [...] <b>butyric</b> acid made by the bacterium Clostridium butyricum, lactic acid made by Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria, and citric acid produced by the mould fungus Aspergillus niger.|$|E
500|$|In 1944 Vrba {{married a}} {{childhood}} friend, Gerta, {{who took the}} surname Vrbová, the female version of Vrba. They moved to Prague in 1945, where Vrbová graduated in medicine. Vrba graduated, in 1949, {{with a degree in}} chemistry ((Ing. Chern.) from the Czech Technical University in Prague, and in 1951 he received his doctorate (Dr. Tech. Sc.) for a thesis entitled [...] "On the metabolism of <b>butyric</b> acid". The couple had two daughters: Helena (1952–1982) and Zuzana (b. 1954). Vrba undertook post-doctoral research at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, where he received his C.Sc. in 1956. From 1953 to 1958 he worked for Charles University Medical School in Prague.|$|E
500|$|Several other {{connections}} play {{important roles}} in hippocampal function. [...] Beyond the output to the EC, additional output pathways go to other cortical areas including the prefrontal cortex. [...] A major output goes via the fornix to the lateral septal area and to the mammillary body of the hypothalamus (which the fornix interconnects with the hippocampus). The hippocampus receives modulatory input from the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine systems, and from the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus to field CA1. [...] A very important projection comes from the medial septal nucleus, which sends cholinergic, and gamma amino <b>butyric</b> acid (GABA) stimulating fibers [...] (GABAergic fibers) to {{all parts of the}} hippocampus. [...] The inputs from the medial septal nucleus {{play a key role in}} controlling the physiological state of the hippocampus; [...] destruction of this nucleus abolishes the hippocampal theta rhythm and severely impairs certain types of memory.|$|E
500|$|The atomic {{bombings of}} Hiroshima and Nagasaki are {{identified}} {{as the cause of}} Japanese whaling. The two Japanese cities were destroyed by atomic weapons during the final stages of World War II under orders by U.S. President Harry Truman, which killed about 220,000 people. In [...] "Whale Whores", the Japanese are presented with a doctored picture of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The picture shows a dolphin and a whale piloting the plane to bomb the city. The Miami Dolphins, a National Football League professional football team, are killed along with real dolphins by the whalers in [...] "Whale Whores". Near the end of the episode, Stan and the crew of the MY Steve Irwin encounter fishing ship captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the Discovery Channel reality series, Deadliest Catch. The scene with Paul Watson's crew throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew's practice of throwing stink bombs containing <b>butyric</b> acid, an acid found in rancid butter and cheese, at Japanese whaling vessels, including the factory vessel, the Nisshin Maru.|$|E
2500|$|... n-Butanol {{is readily}} absorbed through the {{intestinal}} tract and lungs, {{and also to}} some extent through the skin. It is metabolized completely in vertebrates {{in a manner similar}} to ethanol: alcohol dehydrogenase converts n-butanol to butyraldehyde; this is then converted to <b>butyric</b> acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. <b>Butyric</b> acid can be fully metabolized to carbon dioxide and water by the β-oxidation pathway. In the rat, only 0.03% of an oral dose of 2,000mg/kg was excreted in the urine.|$|E
2500|$|The word butter derives (via Germanic languages) {{from the}} Latin butyrum, {{which is the}} latinisation of the Greek βούτυρον (bouturon). This {{may have been a}} {{construction}} meaning [...] "cow-cheese", from βοῦς (bous), [...] "ox, cow" [...] + τυρός (turos), [...] "cheese". Nevertheless, the earliest attested form of the second stem, turos ("cheese"), is the Mycenaean Greek tu-ro, written in Linear B syllabic script as 𐀶𐀫. The root word persists in the name <b>butyric</b> acid, a compound found in rancid butter and dairy products such as Parmesan cheese.|$|E
2500|$|Female plants do {{not produce}} cones. Two ovules are formed {{at the end of}} a stalk, and after pollination, one or both develop into seeds. The seed is 1.5–2nbsp&cm long. Its fleshy outer layer (the sarcotesta) is light yellow-brown, soft, and fruit-like. It is {{attractive}} in appearance, but contains <b>butyric</b> acid (also known as butanoic acid) and smells like rancid butter or vomit when fallen. Beneath the sarcotesta is the hard sclerotesta (the [...] "shell" [...] of the seed) and a papery endotesta, with the nucellus surrounding the female gametophyte at the center.|$|E
2500|$|Spastic {{cerebral}} palsy {{is by far}} the most common type, occurring in 70% to 80% of all cases. Moreover, spastic CP accompanies one of the other types in 30% of all cases. People with this type are hypertonic and have a neuromuscular condition stemming from damage to the corticospinal tract or the motor cortex that affects the nervous system's ability to receive gamma amino <b>butyric</b> acid in the area(s) affected by the disability. Spastic CP is further classified by topography dependent on the region of the body affected; these include: ...|$|E
2500|$|Carboxylic acids are {{commonly}} identified using their trivial names, and usually have the suffix -ic acid. IUPAC-recommended names also exist; in this system, carboxylic acids have an -oic acid suffix. For example, <b>butyric</b> acid (C3H7CO2H) is butanoic acid by IUPAC guidelines. The -oic acid nomenclature detail {{is based on}} the name of the previously-known chemical benzoic acid. For nomenclature of complex molecules containining a carboxylic acid, the carboxyl can be considered position one of the parent chain even if there are other substituents, for example, 3-chloropropanoic acid. Alternately, it can be named as a [...] "carboxy" [...] or [...] "carboxylic acid" [...] substituent on another parent structure, for example, 2-carboxyfuran.|$|E
2500|$|Acetic acid– Considered a main {{component}} of volatile acidity {{that can make}} a wine taste unbalanced and overly acidic. While acetic acid is the main volatile acid produced by yeast, trace amounts of <b>butyric,</b> formic and propionic acids can also be formed depending on the yeast strain. Most countries have wine laws setting the legal limit of volatile acidity, usually expressed as acetic acid, to 1200–2000mg/L. Acetic acid can also lead {{to the development of the}} wine fault ethyl acetate which is characterized by a [...] "nail polish remover" [...] smell. However, small amounts of acetic acid are actually beneficial for the yeast as they use them to synthesis lipids in the cell membrane.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book Cholesterol and The French Paradox, Frank Cooper {{argues that}} the French paradox {{is due to the}} lack of {{hydrogenated}} and trans fats in the French diet. The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon <b>butyric</b> acid to the 16-carbon palmitic acid. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids. [...] In addition, these hydrogenated fats include small quantities of trans fats which may have associated health risks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between some gut flora and humans {{is not merely}} commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a mutualistic relationship. Some human gut microorganisms benefit the host by fermenting dietary fiber into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetic acid and <b>butyric</b> acid, which are then absorbed by the host. [...] Intestinal bacteria {{also play a role}} in synthesizing vitamin B and vitamin K as well as metabolizing bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics. [...] The systemic importance of the SCFAs and other compounds they produce are like hormones and the gut flora itself appears to function like an endocrine organ, and dysregulation of the gut flora has been correlated with a host of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.|$|E
