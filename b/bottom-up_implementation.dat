50|$|Both-ends-against-the-middle (BEATM) {{design is}} a design process that endeavors {{to combine the}} best {{features}} of top-down design, and bottom-up design into one process. A BEATM design process flow may begin with an emergent technology which suggests solutions which may have value, or it may begin with a top-down view of an important problem which needs a solution. In either case the key attribute of BEATM design methodology is to immediately focus {{at both ends of}} the design process flow: a top-down view of the solution requirements, and a bottom-up view of the available technology which may offer promise of an efficient solution. The BEATM design process proceeds from both ends in search of an optimum merging somewhere between the top-down requirements, and <b>bottom-up</b> efficient <b>implementation.</b> In this fashion, BEATM has been shown to genuinely offer the best of both methodologies. Indeed some of the best success stories from either top-down or bottom-up have been successful because of an intuitive, yet unconscious use of the BEATM methodology.

40|$|Uncertainty {{management}} {{is identified as}} a challenging issue in databases [SSU 91]. Logic database programming, with its declarative advantage and its powerful top-down and bottom-up query processing techniques has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers, and numerous logic frameworks with uncertainty have been proposed over the last decade. On the basis in which uncertainty is associated with the facts and rules in a program, we classify the approaches taken to uncertainty in these frameworks into the annotation based (AB) and implication based (IB). In the AB approach, certainties are associated with the atoms in the rules and facts, while in the IB approach, they are associated with the implications in the programs. In this thesis, we attempt to address the aforementioned challenging issue. To this end, we take an axiomatic approach and study the relevant issues: (1) the language aspects, (2) query optimization, (3) the termination behaviors and data complexity of the bottom-up evaluations of logic programs with uncertainty, (4) the expressive power, and (5) the ease and efficiency of implementing such languages. Each of these issues is discussed in a chapter of this thesis, in that order. Although our focus in this study is on the IB approach, the insights provided and the lessons learned are useful in a more general context of deduction with uncertainty. In order to study these issues in a framework independent manner, we first identify a number of "reasonable" properties which are normally satisfied by combination functions in programs with uncertainty. We will then propose a language, called the parametric framework, where the parameters are the combination functions defined on the underlying certainty lattice. The proposed framework uses multisets as the basis {{of the structure of the}} semantics, as opposed to using sets, which are often used. This is the key point to the expressive power of our framework, which unifies and generalizes the IB approach to uncertainty. With this framework as a basis, we study the other relevant issues mentioned and establish various results. A main advantage of our axiomatic approach in studying the various issues in the thesis is that it makes the results applicable to a wide range of (IB) frameworks. Our top-down and <b>bottom-up</b> <b>implementations</b> of the parametric framework show that the ideas in the thesis are practical which lend themselves to an-easy-to-use and efficient "environment" for deduction with uncertainty at larg...|$|R

40|$|This article reviews gender {{mainstreaming}} in practices of urban governance in Europe by comparing Sweden and Italy, which have distinct welfare-state systems: {{that of the}} former is firmly embedded in institutional and social structures, whereas that of the latter is markedly more familistic. This review illustrates this relatively strong contrast case {{on the basis of}} a literature and policy analysis, and elaborates how the everyday policies of urban governance regarding the living environment are considerably more gender-sensitive in Sweden than is the case in Italy. The main explanation for this difference lies in Sweden’s political socialism and longer socio-democratic tradition of incremental and equity-planning approaches in urban governance, in contrast to Italy’s social tradition of rather more conservative corporatism and patriarchal commune tactics. Socio-political and formal-institutional barriers, which are impeding both the top-down and the <b>bottom-up</b> <b>implementation</b> of gender-sensitive initiatives, could be overcome by creating more mental and formal legislative room for urban-based {{gender mainstreaming}}.

40|$|While {{using the}} Action Research Methodology, this {{dissertation}} considers a double perspective for its author {{as a researcher}} and public official involved in Mexico's Decentralization Policy Implementation, and also as a policy designer and policy consultant. It narrates two settings where the author had a major involvement from a Federal and sub- national (State) governmental employee position. The said experiences were a top-down policy implementation experience in the State of Guanajuato (1995) and a <b>bottom-up</b> policy <b>implementation</b> process in the State of Nuevo Le 6 n (2002 onwards). Evidence from the experiences shows that the bottom-up model of decentralization policy implementation performs better {{in the process of}} strengthening local government capabilities, 'pulling' the necessary functions, regulations, and resources to make decentralization work, rather than it being imposed or 'pushed' by the central government. To the extent that the main assumption behind an Action-Research experience is that social research and knowledge production that doesn't lead to social change is somewhat useless because any researcher involved within Action Research should serve a two-fold purpose of knowing reality but having as its aim the drive to change it, the main contribution of this thesis is to help local governments in an exercise of self-diagnosis (the Desde Lo Local instrument) of their strengths and weakness in order to set a new local government agenda that stresses governance and sustainability.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Regionalization of {{agricultural}} research across countries has received considerable attention in recent years, {{with the establishment}} of regional and sub-regional organizations in most regions. Recently, the CGIAR System has called for a regional approach to research involving <b>bottom-up</b> priority-setting and <b>implementation,</b> and integrating this with global priority-setting. This paper explores the possibility of developing an approach for research priority-setting that would satisfy national, regional and global expectations of regionalization and allow the regional and sub-regional organizations to assume a bigger role. The paper also considers how the CGIAR Centres may support this priority-setting process and how they may use it to define their regional activities. A review of existing regional research initiatives show the many models in use, with different extents of collaboration, and with different challenges and promises. Regional priorities can strengthen the relevance {{of agricultural}} research in a region or sub-region.

The primary aim {{of the study was to}} look more closely at the context, processes and outcomes of selecting and implementing specific quality assurance tools.

The findings are presented around the structure of this three-level framework and indicate that the process of implementing a quality assurance tool is more important than the tool itself. It is suggested that a <b>bottom-up</b> approach to <b>implementation,</b> which locates ownership and control of the quality assurance tool with practitioners, is seen to result in more favourable staff responses and positive programme outcomes.
