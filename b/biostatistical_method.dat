40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} {{developments}} of imaging technologies used for medical diagnosis. Giddens' sociological theory of modernity {{serves as a}} basis for the consideration of the bureaucratisation of medicine {{and the use of the}} patient file as source of information about health. The importance of 'inscriptions', in relation to scientific knowledge and power, is analysed through Bruno Latour's theory. Donna Haraway's call to rethink objectivity, not as a quality of universal knowledge, but as a given point of view, also influence the approach of this discussion of diagnostic practices. The author demonstrates the need for abstract concepts of patient and disease to achieve modern medicine. The links between theoretical notions (anatomical pathology, in particular) and diagnostic practices, as well as the concept of objectivity underlying the use of technology to gather information about health are examined. The effects of the <b>biostatistical</b> <b>method</b> used to evaluate health are also discussed. Finally, the importance of context in the experience of illness is noted...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Differences in {{gastric cancer}} (GC) {{clinical}} outcomes between patients in Asian and non-Asian countries has been historically attributed to variability in clinical management. However, recent international Phase III trials suggest {{that even with}} standardised treatments, GC outcomes differ by geography. Here, we investigated gene expression differences between Asian and non-Asian GCs, and if these molecular differences might influence clinical outcome. DESIGN: We compared gene expression profiles of 1016 GCs from six Asian and three non-Asian GC cohorts, using a two-stage meta-analysis design and a novel <b>biostatistical</b> <b>method</b> (RUV- 4) to adjust for technical variation between cohorts. We further validated our findings by computerised immunohistochemical analysis on two independent tissue microarray (TMA) cohorts from Asian and non-Asian localities (n= 665). RESULTS: Gene signatures differentially expressed between Asians and non-Asian GCs were related to immune function and inflammation. Non-Asian GCs were significantly enriched in signatures related to T-cell biology, including CTLA- 4 signalling. Similarly, in the TMA cohorts, non-Asian GCs showed significantly higher expression of T-cell markers (CD 3, CD 45 R 0, CD 8) and lower expression of the immunosuppressive T-regulatory cell marker FOXP 3 compared to Asian GCs (p 1600 GCs suggest that Asian and non-Asian GCs exhibit distinct tumour immunity signatures related to T-cell function. These differences may influence geographical differences in clinical outcome, and the design of future trials particularly in immuno-oncology. Open Acces...|$|E

While whole-genomics approaches have been valuable for studying the molecular basis of several intestinal diseases, a thorough analysis of gene expression along the healthy gastrointestinal tract is still lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} map gene expression in gastrointestinal regions of healthy human adults and to implement a procedure for microarray data analysis that would allow its use as a reference when screening for pathological deviations. We analyzed the gene expression signature of antrum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and transverse colon biopsies using a <b>biostatistical</b> <b>method</b> based on a multivariate and univariate approach to identify region-selective genes. One hundred sixty-six genes were found responsible for distinguishing the five regions considered. Nineteen had never been described in the GI tract, including a semaphorin probably implicated in pathogen invasion and six novel genes. Moreover, by crossing these genes with those retrieved from an existing data set of gene expression in the intestine of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease patients, we identified genes that might be biomarkers of Crohn's and/or ulcerative colitis in ileum and/or colon. These include CLCA 4 and SLC 26 A 2, both implicated in ion transport. This study furnishes the first map of gene expression along the healthy human gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the approach implemented here, and validated by retrieving known gene profiles, allowed the identification of promising new leads in both healthy and disease states...|$|E
40|$|Despite high {{responses}} to initial chemotherapy most patients with ovarian cancer (OC) relapse and inevitably die from their disease. Aberrant DNA methylation is frequently seen in ovarian tumours and may provide biomarkers of clinical outcome or insight into mechanisms of chemoresistance. We firstly performed Differential Methylation Hybridisation (DMH) to identify loci that gained methylation between 34 matched cisplatin sensitive and resistant OC tumour cell lines. Differentially methylated loci identified were further validated by Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and bisulphite pyrosequencing. Selected loci were further investigated for association with clinical outcome in primary OC tumour samples and matched tumour samples from patients' pre- and post-chemotherapy. Frequent increased methylation of a CpG island at the NR 2 E 1 gene was {{identified in this}} experiment. Increased methylation correlated with decreased gene expression and could be reversed following treatment with a demethylating agent. Increased methylation at NR 2 E 1 was observed between matched pre- and post-treatment tumour pairs. A novel <b>biostatistical</b> <b>method,</b> methylation linear discrimination analysis (MLDA), was next used to identify differentially methylated loci in sensitive and resistant A 2780 human ovarian cell lines. Eight of nine loci identified were validated by MSP. A locus at the SP 5 gene was further investigated by pyrosequencing and found to show {{a very high level}} methylation in most cell lines and ovarian tumours. Increased methylation correlated with decreased gene expression and this could be reversed using decitabine treatment. Knockdown of SP 5 expression caused increased apoptosis. DMH was next used to identify loci that gained methylation between 3 in vivo derived matched sensitive and resistant cell lines. KIAA 1383, a gene of unknown function, was identified and methylation shown to correlate with response to chemotherapy and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with OC. Over-expression was found to attenuate the response to cisplatin, in the PEA 2 cell line, as measured by cell cycle analysis.

In the Disinfectant Efficacy Testing, regarding parasitic field, only protozoa and helminths are considered to the DVG-guidelines (2000, 2007; from 2015 DVG-testing guidelines). Musca domestica {{can be used as}} an indicator in testing methods against harmful arthropods (Victor, 1999; Mielke et al, 2001; Simmet, 2013; Al Halbouni and Hiepe, 2015; Hiepe et al., 2015). The wide spectrum of arthropods species requires a representative for Acari as Parasites indicator, in addition to M. domestica as representative for insects. After extensive preliminary examinations, it has been found that Dermanyssus gallinae is suitable to be this indicator. That is because D. gallinae is able to represent harmful arthropod spectrum as an infectious agent as well as a vector. The problem of the low reproductive rate of these parasites (average 4 - 7 eggs / female / week) has been solved by the <b>biostatistical</b> <b>method</b> "one-sample t-test". By Using D. gallinae laboratory strain H- 0 another two problems have been solved: the exclusion of potential drug resistance of field strains and ensuring a stable D. gallinae- reproduction rate by the in vivo feeding. After intensive literature studies about disinfectant problems, with special consideration of antiparasitic disinfectants, a many examinations on chemical disinfectant efficacy testing, three produkts with different active ingredients groups have been selected: - Neopredisan 135 - 1; ingredient: p-chloro-m-cresol - Ascarosteril AB; ingredients in Component A: o -Hydroxydiphenyl fatty acid eutectic and in component B: peracetic acid. - Preventol VET 100; ingredients: 4 -chloro- 3 -methyl phenol, 2 -benzyl- 4 -chlorophenol, biphenyl- 2 -ol By Neopredisan 135 - 1 and Ascarosteril AB all D. gallinae-developmental stages (eggs, larvae, nymphs I and II) as well as hungry and full soaked adults have been included in the disinfectant efficacy testing. The examination of Preventol VET 100 was carried out exclusively on eggs of D. gallinae and soaked adults, as {{there were no significant differences}} in efficacy within the different stages of the parasite. The methodical equipment has been proved scientifically and technically through further development of germ carriers using poplar wood and concrete, and thus it fulfills the requirements of the DVG-testing standards and guidlines. The three tested disinfectants with the different drug components meet the target minimum efficiencies of DVG disinfectant commission (98 % in suspension test, 95 % in germ carrier tests) within the prescribed exposure times at 3 % concentration.

40|$|The main {{scope of}} this thesis is the {{application}} of <b>biostatistical</b> <b>methods</b> to genomic and proteomic data analyses. Each part deals specifically with one bioinformatics subfield. In the first part, we examine the preprocessing of spotted gene expression microarray data. Gene expression microarrays can measure simultaneously the expression levels of thousands of genes. As the microarray signals are usually very noisy, {{there is a clear}} need to develop statistical methods and bioinformatics tools discriminating more efficiently a specific signal from the background noise. Accordingly, the current work has contributed to develop tools that include a new method combining microarray data acquired through multiple laser scans, a new hybrid transformation as well as an outlier detection method for microarray data normalization. The second part of this thesis, also related to system biology discipline, focuses on the development of computational methods for reconstructing transcriptional networks from microarray data and functional similarities. The third part of this thesis focuses on a structural analysis of protein-protein interactions. In this last part, signal processing and statistical tools are used to develop a method predicting the locations of sites of interest on the protein surfaces. The method is used for mapping the location of binding sites on various protein surfaces.

This will help to increase knowledge about the burden of drug safety in African region. The burden {{is a result of}} multiple factors like medication errors, irrational drug use, poor drug quality, adverse reactions and counterfeits. Moreover, adequate decision making processes needs easy-to-use analytical methodologies for evidence-based decisions despite the scarcity of data. The first and second parts of the thesis respectively {{reviewed and}} applied the data mining algorithms for detection and evaluation of safety signals. This involved looking at the commonly used data mining algorithms applied to spontaneous adverse reports and applying them to late phase clinical trials safety pediatric database. The third section utilized the standard data mining analysis method of classification and regression tree (CART) to determine the predictors of prescription practices in rural based health facilities of Africa. The use of data mining and <b>biostatistical</b> <b>methods</b> for handling drug safety and utilization data collected using diverse approaches like the traditional passive reporting systems, electronic medical records, clinical trials and post marketing surveys was demonstrated.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{different}} tissues, estrogens, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERAIs), and anti-estrogens exert diferent biologic activities. For the endometrium, estradiol and tamoxfien induce proliferation, {{and because}} of this, tamoxifen treatment of breast cancer patients results in a two- to sevenfold increased riskfor development ofendometrial cancer. Use ofraloxftene, or the anti-estrogen IC 1182780, does not result in such an increased risk. The objective {{of the current study}} was to generate and analyze gene expression profiles that reflect the transcriptional response of the human endometrium to estradiol, SERMs like tamoxfen and raloxifene, and anti-estrogens like ICI 182780. METHODS: Transient transfections were performed to analyze the transcriptional response ofECC- 1 cells to estradiol, tamoxjfen, raloxifene, and ICIl 82780. Subsequently, to reveal the molecular mechanism ofaction, gene expression profiles were generated and some of the observed regulated genes were confirmed by Northern blotting. <b>Biostatistical</b> <b>methods</b> were employed to analyze the expression profile resultsfurther, and amphiregulin effects on ECC- 1 cell signaling were investigated uasing Northern and Western blotting, and 3 H-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS: Analysis of the profiles revealed that estradiol, tamoxifen, raloxfene, and ICI 182780 influence the same biologic processes, but they do so via regulation of different sets ofgenes. Upon construction of a genetic network it was observed that the largest possible network centered on epidermal growth facto...|$|R
