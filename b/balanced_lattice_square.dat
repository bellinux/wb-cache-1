40|$|Grain yield is {{a complex}} {{phenomenon}} which results from the interaction of various contributing factors highly influenced by different selection procedures. Recurrent selection is vital selection method for improving morphological and yield related attributes in maize crop. Half-sib families (HS) were generated from the most adapted maize variety “Pahari” at Cereal Crop Research Institute, CCRI Pakistan with the objective to improve its yield in 2009 and 2010, respectively. All the HS families were detassled well before pollen shedding to avoid any kind of selfing. At maturity, each family was harvested and shelled separately for evaluation in the respective years. 12 x 12 and 11 x 11, Partial <b>balanced</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>square</b> design were used during summer crop seasons 2009 and 2010, respectively at The University of Agriculture, Peshawar Pakistan. Results revealed significant differences in both cycle among families for all traits. High heritability (0. 74) was observed for grain yield in C 0, while moderate heritability (0. 45) was recorded for kernel rows ear_ 1 in C 1. Selection differential was quite reasonable and varied according to the traits of interest. Observed response (815. 74) was greater for grain yield in C 0 than the expected response (681. 76). Negative value of gain cycle- 1 for plant height and ear height showed a declining trend, while positive value for grain yield validated selection for high yield. Regression of all the morphological and yield related traits were calculated based on the selected individuals in each cycle. Highly significant positive correlation was observed among grain yield with all the traits under investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{latin square}} design has been {{extensively}} used in field experiments, because {{of its ability to}} eliminate from the experimental errors the effects of soil fertility variations in two directions. More recently, Yates (1, 2) developed the <b>lattice</b> <b>square</b> designs for varietal trials conducted under a plant breeding program. In these designs, the number of varieties must be an exact square. Within each replication, the plots are laid out in a square array, in which every row and column contains the same number of plots. (The physical dimensions of the rows and columns will, of course, be different unless the plots are square in shape.) In successive replications the groupings of the varieties into rows and columns are changed so that with the complete design every pair of varieties has appeared together once either in the same row or in the same column. This symmetry makes it possible to adjust the varietal total or average yields, by simple calculations, for variations in the fertility of different rows and columns. In this way the effects of soil fertility variations in two directions can be eliminated from the experimental errors, just as in the latin square. These designs will be described as <b>balanced</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>squares,</b> in order to distinguish them from the designs which form the subject of this bulletin. In the useful range for most practical purposes, the available selection of <b>balanced</b> <b>lattice</b> <b>squares</b> is shown in table 1 a...|$|R

A traditional method of a designing factorial experiments based on the ordinary Kronecker product of matrices leads to the designs having desirable statistical properties but also with large number of units. In the paper we present application of a semi-Kronecker (Khatri-Rao) product of matrices in a construction procedure of incomplete split-plot × split-block designs for three factor experiments.

For the triple lattice designs at Iowa State College, three replications were on the average somewhat more accurate than five replications of the type of randomized blocks design previously used. Since part of this increase in accuracy was presumably due to the long and narrow shape of replication in the randomized blocks designs, somewhat smaller increases would be expected over a randomized blocks design with a more compact replication.
