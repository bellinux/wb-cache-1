5|$|Having {{been cut}} with {{irrigation}} channels, and been {{the site of}} <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> peat working, Salta Moss has different flora than other bogs or mires on the Solway Plain. The Moss today is common ground, but a track runs through it to provide access for local farmers to outlying fields, which surround it. An irrigation ditch has also been dug to provide drainage to the surrounding farmland.|$|E
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in the war}} which followed, Thorfinn {{defeated}} Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at {{the east}} end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at Tarbat Ness {{on the south side of}} the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> plundering as he passed. A later note in the saga claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms.|$|E

5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and fire alarms began to ring {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those <b>burning,</b> <b>and</b> {{by the time the}} flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.|$|E
5|$|Disturbance {{has been}} implicated in the {{formation}} of vegetation dominated by large Attalea species. In seasonally dry Amazonian forests the density of large adult A.maripa palms was correlated with canopy openness; the species also dominates savannas formed by repeated forest fires in Trinidad and Tobago. Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and <b>burning,</b> <b>and</b> are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E

As Cornwallis had, Washington also called for a council of war. Using the road leading to Princeton, and his council of war agreed to make an attempt against the British garrison there. By 2am on January 3, the army {{was on its way to}} Princeton. Washington left behind 500 men and two cannons to keep the fires <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> to make noise with picks and shovels to make the British think they were digging in. By morning, these men too had evacuated, and when the British came to attack, all of the American troops were gone.|$|E

5|$|Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and {{passenger}} traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The President Warfield and State of Maryland were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had sprinkler systems installed in 1938. In 1939, the State of Virginia was converted to oil <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> all three ships were equipped with radio direction finders and ship-to-shore telephones.|$|E
5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through {{ground based}} and aerial reconnaissance has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> the amount of fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E

5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species occurs {{in a number of}} protected areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat to the species.|$|E
5|$|Phil England {{writes in}} The Ecologist that the {{strength}} of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: Jim Hoggan’s Climate Cover-Up, George Monbiot’s Heat: How to Stop the Planet <b>Burning</b> <b>and</b> Ross Gelbspan’s The Heat is On and Boiling Point. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which Exxon Mobil has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting climate change denial and doubt.|$|E
5|$|Prickly pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth eggs were distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. Phenazopyridine is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Mary Lambert, portrays Madonna {{as a witness}} to the murder of a girl by white supremacists. While a black man is arrested for the murder, Madonna hides in a church for safety seeking strength to go forth as a witness. The clip depicts a church and Catholic symbols such as stigmata. It also features a Ku Klux Klan-style cross <b>burning,</b> <b>and</b> a dream about kissing a black saint. The Vatican condemned the video, while family and religious groups protested its broadcast. They boycotted products by soft drink manufacturer Pepsi, who had used the song in their commercial. The company canceled their sponsorship contract with Madonna, but allowed her to retain the fee.|$|E

By midnight, the plan was complete, with the baggage on its way to Burlington and the guns wrapped in heavy cloth to stifle noise and prevent the British from learning of the evacuation. Washington left 500 men behind with two cannon to patrol, keep the fires <b>burning,</b> <b>and</b> to work with picks and shovels to make the British think that they were digging in.

5|$|A common mushroom, Mycena nargan {{is found}} growing singly or in {{clusters}} {{on the underside}} of rotting wood in wet and shaded areas, and is especially partial to Eucalyptus and Pinus pinaster. Fruit bodies usually appear from April to June. The species has been recorded from Tasmania, Victoria and southeastern South Australia. The Australian Fungimap initiative has reported isolated collections in Western Australia, South Australia, and New South Wales, although the majority of sightings have been in Tasmania and Victoria. The fungus is saprobic, meaning it derives nutrients from dead or dying organic matter. A field study conducted in Tasmania showed that it is {{much more likely to be}} found in mature eucalypt forest (defined as having grown at least 70 years before the last wildfire) than young, regenerating forest that had experienced clearfelling, <b>burning,</b> <b>and</b> sowing two to three years previously.|$|E
5|$|Around mid-afternoon on July 9, {{observers}} {{with the}} 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry spotted {{a column of}} 200 vehicles led by 11 North Korean T-34 tanks, subsequently calling for an airstrike. For {{the next few hours}} the U.S. Air Force ravaged the North Korean column with repeated bombings and strafing, and by sunset half of the vehicles were destroyed or <b>burning</b> <b>and</b> {{a large portion of the}} infantry had also been killed. The next day, a similar airstrike by B-26 Invaders, F-80 and F-82 Twin Mustang aircraft of the Fifth Air Force took place around Pyongtaek, with 38 North Korean tanks, seven half-tracks and 117 other trucks destroyed, in addition to a large number of infantry. Much of the village of Chonui was left burning, although it had already been abandoned by South Korean soldiers and civilians. In addition, the airstrikes caused some of the largest losses of North Korean armor of the war, and were a major blow against the T-34 tanks which had been so successful during previous encounters.|$|E
