I show, further, that in the development of ‘knowledge’, following some necessary conceptual readjustments in our understanding of this term, there is considerably greater common ground than admitted by theorists.

40|$|One recent {{development}} of cultural globalization emerges in {{the convergence of}} taste in media consumption within geo-cultural regions, such as Latin American telenovelas, South Asian Bollywood films and East Asian trendy dramas. Originating in Japan, the so-called trendy dramas (or idol dramas) have created a craze for Japanese commodities in its neighboring countries (Ko, 2004). Following this Japanese model, Korea has also developed as a stronghold of regional exports, ranging from TV programs, movies and pop music to food, fashion and tourism.

40|$|Unfortunately, working {{scientists}} sometimes reflexively {{continue to}} use "buzz phrases" grounded in once prevalent paradigms that have been subsequently refuted. This can impede both earthquake research and hazard mitigation. Well-worn seismological <b>buzz</b> <b>phrases</b> include "earthquake cycle," "seismic cycle," "seismic gap," and "characteristic earthquake.

It is of note that personalizing medical treatment based on genetic information is not the revolution of the 21 st century. Indeed, the use of genetic information, such as human leukocyte antigen-matching for solid organ transplantation or blood transfusion based on ABO blood group antigens, has been standard of care for several decades.

It arose from the Western doing society, a perceived progress in the design and production of goods. The ideology of progress has been efficiency, rationality, and control. Progress has been equated with the Darwinian theory of evolution and the acceleration of humanity towards science, commerce, communication, transportation, and increased entertainment and leisure activities.

Many sceptics believe the term {{has more to do}} with business strategy and little to do with the complex process of designing products, services and systems. Moreover, many view the term as misleading and a cheap attempt to piggyback the world of business management onto design. This paper seeks to ask is design thinking anything new? Several authors have explicitly or implicitly articulated the term “Design Thinking ” before, such as Peter Rowe’s seminal book “Design Thinking ” [1] first published in 1987 and Herbert Simon’s “The Sciences of the Artificial ” [2] first published in 1969. In Tim Brown’s “Change by Design ” [3], design thinking is thought of as a system of three overlapping spaces rather than a sequence of orderly steps namely inspiration – the problem or opportunity that motivates the search for solutions; ideation – the process of generating, developing and testing ideas; and implementation – the path that leads from the design studio, lab and factory to the market.

Initially this {{practice}} was called Knowledge Transfer until {{it came to be}} realized that that description was one-way only and that academia might in fact learn something from industry. After 25 years as a professional cinematographer, in 2007 Terry Flaxton first won an AHRC Creative Research Fellowship that focused on high-resolution imaging and how that might affect the production of art, and then in 2010 Flaxton won an AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship, which completed at the end of November 2012. Flaxton’s first fellowship required a practitioner to turn their creative acts into research – with all the problems and opportunities that entailed – as many involved in practice as research understand. The second fellowship then asked for a distillation of knowledge gained from that research and production of ‘research artefacts’ (cinematic installations and artworks) and the dissemination and exchange of the new knowledge gained with the creative industries of the UK. But just how much of the research council’s initiative was simply a ‘buzz phrase’? Just how much was effective research knowledge exchanged with communities – that themselves were not research oriented – and was there in fact a two-way exchange at all?

However, in terms of planning practice in the State of Victoria, Australia, the meaning of ‘iconic development’ is unclear amongst property development professionals – one only needs to peruse the local newspaper, The Age on any given week and publications by key bodies such as the Planning Institute of Australia, the Victorian Planning and Environment Law Association, the Urban Development Institute of Australia and the Property Council of Australia on their websites and in professional newsletters, to appreciate the different ways the phrase {{is used in the}} property development context.

After a fervent first phase in which information technology and digital data were considered the answer for making mobility more efficient, more attractive and for increasing the quality of travel, some disappointing has grown around this concept: the distance between the visionarypotentialthatsmartness is providingis too far from the reality of urban mobility in cities. We argue in particular that two main aspects of smart mobility should be eluded: the first refers to the merely application to technology on mobility system, what we called the techo-centric aspect; the second feature is the consumer-centric aspect of smart mobility, that consider transport users only as potential consumers of a service. Starting from this, the study critics the smart mobility approach and applications and argues on a“smarter mobility” approach, in which technologies are only oneaspects of a more complex system. With a view on the urgency of looking beyond technology and beyond consumer-oriented solutions, the study arguments the need for a cross-disciplinary and a more collaborative approach that could supports transition towards a“smarter mobility” for enhancing the quality of life and the development ofvibrant cities. The article does not intend to produce a radical critique of the smart mobility concept,denying a priori its utility. Our perspectiveisthat the smart mobility is sometimes used as an evocativeslogan lacking some fundamental connection with other central aspect of mobility planning and governance. Main research questions are: what is missing in the technology-oriented or in the consumers-oriented smart mobility approach? What are the main risks behind these approaches? To answer this questions the paper provides in Section 2 the rationale behind the paper;Section 3 provides a literature review that explores the evolution on smart mobility paradigm in the last decades analysing in details the “techno-centric”and the “consumer-centric” aspects. Section 4 proposes an integrated innovative approach for smart mobility, providing examples and some innovative best practices in Belgium. Some conclusions are finally drawnin Section 5, based on the role of smart mobility to create not only virtual platforms but high quality urban places...|$|E
50|$|Buzz wears a {{high-tech}} space suit, {{similar to those}} of modern-day astronauts though more streamlined and iconic. The suit chest features a control panel. On the left hand side of the suit, a large red button activates the suit's flight system, which are two purple wings with candy cane lining, and green and red wing tips. The buttons on the right of the suit have numerous functions such as contacting Star Command, shooting grappling hooks, and activating full throttle. On the toy Buzz of movies however, all they do is make Buzz say different catch <b>phrases.</b> <b>Buzz's</b> suit also protects against the vacuum and cold of space. It can also translate all he says into any language even an outer space dialect. A retractable helmet, when activated, covers Buzz's head and allows him to breathe in space or on planets lacking a sufficient supply of oxygen. The left arm of the suit has a panel that flips open to reveal a display that contains a mission log in the wrist area to record history and provide records. The right arm contains the weapon system which projects an unusually strong and powerful red-colored laser out of the small cannon {{on the back of the}} wrist. Buzz has a utility belt as an upgrade to suit. It has various things such as anti-gravity servos, magnets for climbing purposes, and a grappling hook.|$|R
