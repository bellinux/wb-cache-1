50|$|Shank boutons have {{a hollow}} {{protrusion}} {{on the back}} through which thread is sewn to attach the button. Button shanks may be a separate piece added {{to the back of}} a button, or be carved or moulded directly onto the back of the button, in which case the button is referred to by collectors as having a 'self-shank'. This is a common construction for older shell and glass buttons, for example. Buttons with shanks have no holes in the <b>button</b> <b>blank</b> (the main part of the button) itself because they are not needed for sewing. Buttons with shanks are more expensive to produce than shankless buttons.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Lightpill site is {{one actually}} located in Rodborough, but {{in light of}} inter-war and 1960s developments, exists now further in Dudbridge. A cloth mill from the 17th century, in 1910 it became home to a printing works. In 1910 Syrolit Ltd {{became one of the}} world's first plastic manufacturers, which in 1914 was reorganised into Erinoid ltd in order to gain a UK license to manufacture a German process to manufacture a new plastic substance used for buttons and ornaments. By 1933, the business had expanded south on the site and employed 500 people. Taken over by O. & M. Kleeman Ltd in 1957, it was than merged into Mobil Chemicals Ltd in 1961. In 1965 the complex was acquired by British Petroleum, operating initially as BP Plastics and later as BP Chemicals International Ltd. After takeover the site expanded west up to the Stroud railway line spur, producing polyvinyl chloride products, latterly bin bags. In 1973, when 700 people were employed, the factory manufactured polystyrene, articles in thermo-plastic materials for use in the electrical and building industries, and casein and polyester <b>button</b> <b>blanks.</b> To accommodate increased production, three large chemical containers were constructed {{on the west side of}} the railway line on the former dye works, supplied daily by Wincanton Transport trucks shipping raw chemical products from the docks at Southampton, Bristol and Sharpness. Closed in the late 1980s, the production site became the Bath Road Trading Estate, while the former dye works and chemical storage area became a new housing estate.|$|R
40|$|The Allais Paradox is a {{well-known}} bias in which people 2 ̆ 7 s preferences result in contradictory choices between two normatively identical gamble pairs. Studies have shown that these preference reversals depend on how information is described and presented. In an experiment, we investigate the Allais gambles in several formats including an experiential paradigm, where participants make selections from two <b>blank</b> <b>buttons</b> and get an outcome {{as a result of}} a draw from distributions of outcomes in the selected gamble. Results indicate that a large proportion of Allais reversals are found in the traditional descriptive format, they are reduced when gambles are presented in a descriptive table format, and they disappear when choices are made from experience. Although a majority of participants made consistent choices from experience, the proportion of individual reversals is similar to that of descriptive choices. Detailed analyses of experiential choice suggest interesting behavioral differences between participants classified as consistent and those classified as reversals: consistent participants explore and maximize more than reversal participants. Furthermore, consistent participants demonstrate a different switching behavior after experiencing a rare outcome than do reversal participants. We find that, both, overweighting or underweighting of rare outcomes may occur within the course of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s experience; depending on the timing of those experiences, the magnitude of the outcomes observed, and the general accumulated value of the gambles...|$|R
