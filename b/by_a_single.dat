5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit.
