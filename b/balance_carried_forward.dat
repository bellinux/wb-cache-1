5000|$|The oldest {{record of}} a {{complete}} double-entry system is the Messari (Italian: Treasurer's) accounts of the Republic of Genoa in 1340. The Messari accounts contain debits and credits journalised in a [...] form, and include <b>balances</b> <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> from the preceding year, and therefore enjoy general recognition as a double-entry system. By {{the end of the}} 15th century, the bankers and merchants of Florence, Genoa, Venice and Lübeck used this system widely.|$|R

30|$|The SAM {{built for}} this study {{included}} sixty-four commodities and sixty-four activities, 2 four value-added components (compensation of employees, mixed income, gross operating surplus, and indirect net taxes) and four institutional sectors (households, firms, government, {{and the rest of}} the world). Insertion of financial accounts into the SAM requires the inclusion of flows related to capital accounts and financial asset (or liability) accounts (Emini and Fofack 2004) by each Institutional Sector. More specifically, net savings by institutional sector is a balance of incomes and expenditures. Together with net capital transfers (receivables and payables), net savings by institutional sector is used to accrue the non-financial flows (United Nations 2008). The resulting surplus or deficit is the net lending or borrowing, and this figure is the balancing item to move forward from the capital accounts to the financial accounts. In contrast, the financial accounts do not have any <b>balancing</b> item <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> to other accounts.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a meticulous {{description}} {{and analysis of}} the development of the Target balances, with a rich set of new data and detailed information that specialists will treasure and the general public will find illuminating. The last part of the paper, in which the author discusses measures to prevent Target balances from ballooning in the future and includes a comparison of settlement possibilities, is particularly thoughtprovoking and useful. In the US system, balance-of-payment imbalances between commercial banks and, much later, district Feds, were settled for two hundred years using gold and gold certificates; and the US system only recently adopted settlement with marketable securities. In Europe no settlement procedure for Target balances has been introduced to-date. Target <b>balances</b> are merely <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> on the <b>balance</b> sheets of national central banks from year to year, with interest added to the debt and liability positions that have accumulated between the national central banks. This could imply risks that limit the policy choices of member countries. After all, Moody 2 ̆ 019 s decided to consider downgrading the Netherlands and Germany because of their huge outstanding Target claims. It is high time for the Eurosystem partners to discuss the settlement issue more seriously...|$|R

30|$|Recognizing the {{existence}} of loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and <b>carried</b> backward in the US corporate tax system, Mackie–Mason (1990) analysed {{the effects of the}} marginal tax rate on debt policy. He found that when a company has loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit (i.e., another tax shield), it is less likely to raise capital by new debt issue. Since both existing loss <b>carried</b> <b>forward</b> and investment tax credit are substitutes for new debt issue in terms of tax savings, this result is consistent with the trade-off theory.|$|R
