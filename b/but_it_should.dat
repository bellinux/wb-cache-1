The ears are small and folded forward just above skull level. They are preferably slightly darker {{than the rest of}} the coat.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of Burma's armies brought Judson out of prison, but his release was not complete freedom. In 1826, {{several months after}} the surrender, Burma pressed Judson into service as a translator for the peace negotiations. Some have used Judson's acceptance of {{a role in the}} treaty negotiations as evidence of complicity in imperialism, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that he first acted on behalf of the defeated Burmese as translator, not for the Western victors.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s Interactive fiction {{was mainly}} written with C-like languages, such as TADS 2 and Inform 6. A number of systems for writing {{interactive}} fiction now exist. The most popular remain Inform, TADS, or ADRIFT, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> {{be noted that}} they diverged in their approach to IF-writing during the 2000s, giving today's IF writers an objective choice. By 2006 IFComp, most games were written for Inform, with a strong minority of games for TADS and ADRIFT, followed by {{a small number of}} games for other systems.|$|E
25|$|The list {{below is}} by no means exhaustive, but the works {{included}} are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport {{from the end of the}} 17th century to the commencement of officially defined first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, all of the sources listed in Bibliography of cricket, though again this is not an exhaustive list, are reliable <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that autobiographies and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly not if used in isolation, to determine match status.|$|E

25|$|FI {{is thought}} to be very common, but much under-{{reported}} due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population. It affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults (<b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be considered a normal part of aging). Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female). In 2014, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that one out of every six seniors in the U.S. who lived in their own home or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Data on the {{metabolism}} of CoQ10 {{in animals}} and humans are limited. A study with 14C-labeled CoQ10 in rats showed most of the radioactivity in the liver two hours after oral administration when the peak plasma radioactivity was observed, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that CoQ9 (with only 9 isoprenyl units) is the predominant form of coenzyme Q in rats. in vivo and Bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 Preparations in Japan |title=Biomedical and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q |pages=131–142 |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |year=1964}} It appears that CoQ10 is metabolised in all tissues, while a major route for its elimination is biliary and fecal excretion. After the withdrawal of CoQ10 supplementation, the levels return to normal within a few days, irrespective {{of the type of}} formulation used.|$|E
25|$|In {{the civil}} calendar, intercalations {{did not always}} follow a regular pattern, but {{during the reign of}} Artaxerxes II (circa 380 BC) astronomers {{utilised}} a 19-year cycle which required the addition of a month called Addaru II in years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14 and 19, and the month Ululu II in year 17 of the cycle. Older research suggests the first intercalation took place in 309 BC. Fuller information on the naming of months in the Zoroastrian calendar will be found below, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that the first month of the year was called Frawardin, and the first day of Frawardin was the 'New Year's Day' or Nawruz (also reckoned Now-Ruz, Nowruz, No Roz, No-Rooz, Norouz, or Navroz), from which all other religious observances were reckoned – this day being, in theory, the day of the northern vernal equinox, 21 March (Gregorian).|$|E

25|$|As {{the need}} for such service {{functions}} became more acute (as, for example, during the Investiture Controversy), and their duties and privileges, at first nebulous, became more clearly defined, the ministeriales developed in the Salian period (1024–1125) into a new and much differentiated class. They received fiefs, which to begin with were not heritable, in return for which they provided knightly services. They were also allowed to possess, and often did hold, allods: ownership of real property (land, buildings and fixtures) that is independent of any superior landlord, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> not be confused with anarchy as the owner of allodial land is not independent of his sovereign. Ministerials were found holding the four great offices necessary to run a great household: seneschal, butler, marshal and chamberlain. They were vidames (vice dominus, or runners of estates) or castellans, having both military and administrative responsibilities. Conrad II of Kuchl was the financial adviser to four archbishops over the course of 40 years.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E
25|$|Mongol invaders {{were still}} causing many {{problems}} for the Ming Empire. The Yongle Emperor prepared to eliminate this threat. He mounted five military expeditions into the Mongol steppes and crushed {{the remnants of the}} Yuan dynasty that had fled north after being defeated by the Hongwu Emperor. He repaired the northern defences and forged buffer alliances to keep the Mongols at bay in order to build an army. His strategy was to force the Mongols into economic dependence on the Chinese and to launch periodic initiatives into Mongolia to cripple their offensive power. He attempted to compel Mongolia to become a Chinese tributary, with all the tribes submitting and proclaiming themselves vassals of the Ming Empire, and wanted to contain and isolate the Mongols. Through fighting, the Yongle Emperor learned to appreciate the importance of cavalry in battle and eventually began spending much of his resources to keep horses in good supply. The emperor spent his entire life fighting the Mongols. Failures and successes came and went, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that after the emperor's second personal campaign against the Mongols, the Ming Empire was at peace for over seven years.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason that}} some people believe the {{assimilation}} of Hispanics in the U.S. is not {{comparable to that of}} other cultural groups is that Hispanic and Latino Americans have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, California, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico (1598), Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Puerto Rico have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (<b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> be noted that the language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, and later Mexico (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848. Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior {{to the creation of the}} Thirteen Colonies. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. Santa Fe, New Mexico was founded in 1604, and Albuquerque was established in 1660. El Paso was founded in 1659, San Antonio in 1691, Laredo, Texas in 1755, San Diego in 1769, San Francisco in 1776, San Jose, California in 1777, New Iberia, Louisiana in 1779, and Los Angeles in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and Spanish language well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
