40|$|The Idaho National Engineering Laboratory has {{designed}} an laboratory tested a prototype retractable spiked <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> for law enforcement. The proposed system, which {{is ready for}} controlled field testing, expands the functionality of existing spiked barrier strips. A retractable <b>barrier</b> <b>strip,</b> one that can place the spikes in either the active (vertical) or passive (horizontal) position, would allow law enforcement personnel to lay the unobtrusive strip across a road far in advance of a fleeing vehicle. No damage occurs to passing vehicles until the spikes are activated, {{and that can be}} done from a safe distance and at a strategic location when the offending vehicle is close to the strip. The concept also allows the strips to be place safely across several roadways that are potential paths of a fleeing vehicle. Since they are not activated until needed, they are harmless to nonoffending vehicles. The laboratory tests conducted on the system indicate that it will puncture tires only when the spikes are rotated to the active position and is safe to travel over when the spikes are in the down position. The strip itself will not cause instability to a vehicle driving over it, nor is the strip disturbed or adversely affected by vehicles driving over it. The spikes can be quickly rotated between the active (vertical) and passive (horizontal) position. However, the laboratory tests have only demonstrated that the retractable spiked <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> can perform its intended function in a laboratory environment. Field tests are needed to finalize the design and develop the system into a functional law enforcement tool...|$|E
40|$|Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD) {{is one of}} {{the major}} factors {{limiting}} cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) productivity in West Africa. The only cure for CSSVD is to cut out visibly infected trees and the official eradication campaign in Ghana has cut out more than 200 million trees since 1946. 80 years of research on preventive control measures have mainly focused on resistance breeding, mild strain cross-protection (inoculation of cocoa seedlings with a mild strain of the virus to protect against the severe strain) and control of mealybug vectors. Meanwhile, diversification measures such as agroforestry (for shading) or <b>barrier</b> (<b>strip)</b> cropping have received less attention. Despite promising results, CSSVD is more prevalent in the field than ever before. The large body of knowledge on preventive control measures for CSSVD is fragmented and many publications are not easily accessible. Furthermore, the literature has never been systematically evaluated and quantitatively assessed. Hence, we consolidated this knowledge with an extensive literature review followed by meta-analysis to identify the pertinent research gaps. Out of 423 publications on CSSVD-related issues, we selected 34 studies, which contained 52 datasets on seven different preventive control measures. Results showed that resistance breeding and mild strain crossprotection may reduce CSSVD infection by 30 percent, while the potential of diversification measures (shading/agroforestry and <b>barrier</b> (<b>strip)</b> cropping) seems to be considerably higher (40 and 85 percent, respectively). However, there is a lack of evidence because of a low number of studies about diversification measures, indicating that our results have to be interpreted with care and calling for more research in this area. Future testing is needed to evaluate the efficacy of <b>barrier</b> (<b>strip)</b> cropping to reduce CSSVD, and address the effect of shade on CSSVD symptom severity. Furthermore, the practical relevance of different preventive control measures for farmers needs to be assessed, and shade should be considered in current breeding programs for CSSVD resistance...|$|E

The first Varrier paper {{appeared}} at SPIE in 2001, and much has changed since then. What began as a single-panel prototype has grown to a full scale VR autostereo display system, with a variety of form factors, features, and options. Varrier is a <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> AS display system that qualifies as a true VR display, offering a head-tracked ortho-stereo first person interactive VR experience without the need for glasses or other gear to be worn by the user. Since Varrier’s inception, new algorithmic and systemic developments have produced performance and quality improvements. Visual acuity has increased by a factor of 1. 4 X with new fine-resolution <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> linescreens and computational algorithms that support variable sub-pixel resolutions. Performance has improved by a factor of 3 X using a new GPU shader-based sub-pixel algorithm that accomplishes in one pass what previously required three passes. The Varrier modulation algorithm that began as a computationally expensive task is now no more costly than conventional stereoscopic rendering. Interactive rendering rates of 60 Hz are now possible in Varrier for complex scene geometry on the order of 100 K vertices, and performance is GPU bound, hence it is expected to continue improving with graphics card enhancements. Head tracking is accomplished with a neural network camera-based tracking system developed at EVL for Varrier.

40|$|Land {{management}} practices on tropical soils {{have been studied}} extensively during the past decades. However, assessments of their impact on field-scale spatial variability in crop performance are rare. A case of practices affecting spatial crop response at field level in a systematic way is the contour hedgerow system, a widespread soil conservation technique on steep lands in the tropics. The objectives {{of this study were}} to assess: (i) spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems in the Andes and (ii) implications for management of steep land alley farming. In order to measure spatial variability in crop response, Triticum aestivum was sown in rows following the contours, placed every 25 cm along the slope direction. Grain yield was monitored on eight alleys, having slopes from 15 to 30 %, a length of 4 – 8 m and soils ranging from Dystri-Vertic Cambisols to Haplic Phaeozem, in the Andes region of Ecuador. In order to relate crop response with soil fertility, soil sampling was carried out in bands following the contour. Top soil properties, such as organic carbon, NTotal, NO 3 −, P, exchangeable Aluminium, P fixation, exchangeable bases, CEC and texture, were analysed. The barrier strips of the contour hedgerow systems were composed of: (i) Pennisetum clandestinum and Lolium multiflorum or (ii) Phalaris tuberosa. Spatial variability in crop response was described by fourth-order polynomial equations, where position in the alley was the independent variable and plant characteristics were the dependent variables. Grain yield ranged from 0. 8 to 4. 0 t ha− 1 (net area). Clear and significant patterns of spatial variability in crop response were found in all alleys, with R 2 varying from 0. 55 to 0. 90. Crop response was strongly and positively correlated with NO 3 −, P, exchangeable bases or organic carbon, dependent on the management, age and soil conditions of the alleys. Tillage erosion and soil accumulation on respectively the upper and lower elevations of the alleys were the main causes for a tendency to a significantly increased crop response along the slope direction. However, according the type of grass used in the <b>barrier</b> <b>strip,</b> competition for soil fertility and soil moisture occurred and influenced in negative way crop productivity in the lower elevations of the alleys. An index is proposed to assess the effect of contour hedgerows on crop response. The present study shows that contour hedgerow systems cannot always be evaluated as completely positive. Soil fertility improvement on {{the upper part of the}} alleys and a better management of the <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> are suggested to enhance crop productivity of contour hedgerow systems.

40|$|A novel <b>barrier</b> <b>strip</b> autostereoscopic (AS) {{display is}} {{demonstrated}} using a solid-state dynamic parallax barrier. A dynamic barrier mitigates restrictions inherent in static barrier {{systems such as}} fixed view distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewers may move closer to the display and move faster laterally than with a static barrier system. Furthermore, users can switch between 3 D and 2 D modes by disabling the barrier. Dynallax is head-tracked, directing view channels to positions in space reported by a tracking system in real time. Such head-tracked parallax barrier systems have traditionally supported only a single viewer, but by varying the barrier period to eliminate conflicts between viewers, Dynallax presents four independent eye channels when two viewers are present. Each viewer receives an independent pair of left and right eye perspective views based on their position in 3 D space. The display device is constructed using a dual-stacked LCD monitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and the rear display produces a modulated VR scene composed of two or four channels. A small-scale head-tracked prototype VR system is demonstrated. Performance data are analyzed while advantages, disadvantages, ongoing and future work are identified...|$|E
40|$|A resilient, flexible, pressure-activated, {{high-temperature}} seal {{is adapted}} to be interposed {{between high and low}} pressure regions to provide sealing between opposing surfaces of adjacent relatively movable structures. The seal comprises at least one C-shaped sheet element. The C-shaped element design enables the seal to be pressure-activated to provide a radially outward biasing force, responsive to a seal-activating pressure differential acting across the seal thereby increasing resiliency. A centrally-located, resilient core structure provides load bearing and insulating properties. In an exemplary embodiment where at least two seal elements are used, each layer has a cutout slot pattern and the remaining strip material pattern. The slots provide flexibility to the seal, enabling the seal to be manually contoured to seal around corners and curves. The strip material of each layer covers the slots in each adjacent layer to minimize leakage through the slots. Attached <b>barrier</b> <b>strips</b> can block interface leakage between the seal and the opposing surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The West African Sahel (WAS) is the {{transition}} zone between the Sahara desert {{in the north}} of Africa and the more humid Sudanian zones in the south. Although diverse in many ways, the WAS countries have in common a fragile agricultural sector, brought about by poor soil, limited rainfall, frequent drought, and wind erosion that accelerates soil degradation and desertification, compounded by rapidly' growing populations. Erosive winds '"occur during two distinct seasons. During the dry season (October- April) the region is invaded by strong northeasterly winds, known as harmattan, resulting in moderate wind erosion. The second and most important wind-erosion period is the early rainy season (May-July), when rainfall comes with heavy thunderstorms. that move westward through the Sahel.

40|$|Though {{construction}} methods vary widely, use {{of physical}} or biological barriers to conserve {{soil and water}} is common throughout the world. Rock or earthen bunds are common physical <b>barriers.</b> <b>Strips</b> of perennial grass, shrubs or trees serve as biological barriers. Often these barriers are arranged on a slope in roughly parallel contour bands. The spacing between barriers has important economic consequences, because distance from the barrier may create patterns of soil fertility and water availability that influence crop yields and because the spacing determines land available for cropping. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a method for determining the optimal economic spacing of conservation barriers and apply that method to spacing of rock bunds in Burkina Faso. The steps in the optimization method include estimating a continuous yield response to distance between barriers, developing a mathematical expression to describe how costs change as spacing is altered, and optimizing using calculus. The method is general and can be applied to determining spacing of any conservation technique that is applied in bands. For example, this method could be adapted to spacing of grass strips, hedges, windbreaks, or terraces. This analysis suggests that the economically optimal spacing of rock bunds on the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso depends on the type of construction, materials transport cost, and how labor is organized...|$|R
