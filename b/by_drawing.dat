5|$|After re-establishing his {{authority}} in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> the French from Paris while another army (under Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor) attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the Battle of Bouvines {{in one of}} the most decisive battles in French history. John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing absolute monarchy in France.|$|E

5|$|Batman Forevers tone is {{significantly}} different from the previous installments, becoming more family-friendly since Warner Bros. believed that the previous Batman film, Batman Returns (1992), failed to outgross its predecessor due to parent complaints about the film's violence and dark overtones. Schumacher eschewed the dark, dystopian atmosphere of Burton's films <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> inspiration from the Batman comic book of the Dick Sprang era, as well as the 1960s television series. Keaton chose not to reprise the role due to Burton stepping down as director. William Baldwin and Ethan Hawke were initially considered for Keaton's replacement before Kilmer joined the cast.|$|E

They came from two goals down during the semi-finals against Blackpool to gain a place in the play-off final. Having been relegated the previous season, Notts County had the chance to win an instant promotion back to the First Division. They finished fourth during the regular season and defeated Crewe Alexandra in the semi-final <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> the away tie and winning by one-goal in the second leg at home.|$|E

5|$|In June 1942, Nichols {{was again}} summoned by Marshall, {{this time to}} Washington, D.C. Marshall had {{recently}} been appointed as district engineer of the new Manhattan Engineer District (MED), and had received authorization to staff it <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> on officers and civilians working for the Syracuse Engineer District, which was now winding down as the major part of its construction program was nearing completion. Marshall started by designating Nichols as his Deputy District Engineer, which became effective when the Manhattan District was officially formed on 16 August 1942.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E

In the same month, the club's consultancy agreement with Adam Pearson was terminated. On 8 June 2012, Steve Bruce was appointed manager of the club on a three-year deal, and he guided Hull back to the Premier League <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> with League champions Cardiff City {{on the final day}} of the season.|$|E

5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a heat sink <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Ravenloft is an {{adventure}} module for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy role-playing game. The American game publishing company TSR, Inc. released it as a standalone adventure booklet in 1983 {{for use with}} the first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. It was written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, and includes art by Clyde Caldwell with maps by David SutherlandIII. The plot of Ravenloft focuses on the villain Strahd von Zarovich, a vampire who pines for his lost love. Various story elements, including Strahd's motivation and the locations of magical weapons, are randomly determined <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> cards. The player characters attempt to defeat Strahd and, if successful, the adventure ends.|$|E

However, Georg also pursued his own interests, which led to completely independent explorations in comparative geography and ethnology. He quickly learned the languages of the Polynesian islands. His reports {{on the people of}} Polynesia are well regarded today, as they describe the inhabitants of the southern islands with empathy, sympathy and largely without Western or Christian bias.|$|E

5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E

Tod reconstructed Rajput history {{on the basis of}} the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone– for example, the polymath James Mill– accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
5|$|When Linnaeus {{returned}} to Sweden on 28 June 1738, {{he went to}} Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa.

Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; he became the first Praeses in the academy <b>by</b> <b>drawing</b> of lots.|$|E

In the last group game, Germany drew 3–3 against Brazil; by conceding a last minute equalizer, Germany failed to win the group and subsequently {{had to face the}} hosts in the quarter-final. With 54,642 people in attendance, among them U.S. President Bill Clinton, the crowd at the Jack Kent Cooke Stadium was the biggest the German team had ever played in front of.
