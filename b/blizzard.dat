5000|$|Prevailing winds {{spilling}} into McMurdo Sound shoot between {{mountain passes}} and other land formations, stirring up <b>blizzards</b> {{known locally as}} [...] "Herbies". Such <b>blizzards</b> can occur any time of year.

5|$|On June 24, 2010, at a press-only Korean event, <b>Blizzard</b> {{announced}} that Korean players {{would be able}} to play StarCraft II for free with an active World of Warcraft subscription. In PC bangs, or other cybercafés, players can play the game by paying 500 to 1500 South Korean won (approx. $.50 to $1.50) per hour. Other options include a 30-day subscription for ₩9900 (approx. $8), a 24 hours play-time ticket for ₩2000 (approx. $1.50), and unlimited access for ₩69,000 (approx. $56). The end-user license agreement (EULA) for StarCraft II differs significantly from those of Blizzard's earlier titles in that buying the game only grants the buyer a license to play, while the game itself remains the property of <b>Blizzard.</b> Any breach of the EULA amounts not only to breach of contract but copyright infringement as well, giving <b>Blizzard</b> greater control over how the game is used. Concerns have been raised by Public Knowledge over how the altered EULA may affect multiplayer tournaments not endorsed by <b>Blizzard.</b>|$|E
5|$|StarCraft: Ghost is an {{unreleased}} military {{science fiction}} stealth-action video game previously under development by <b>Blizzard</b> Entertainment. Part of Blizzard's StarCraft series, {{the game was}} announced on September 20, 2002, and was to be developed by Nihilistic Software for the Nintendo GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 video game consoles. Several delays in development caused <b>Blizzard</b> to move back the release date and the game has not yet materialized. Nihilistic Software ceded development to Swingin' Ape Studios in 2004 before <b>Blizzard</b> bought the company, and plans for the GameCube version were cancelled in 2005.|$|E

5|$|After {{three years}} of negotiations, <b>Blizzard</b> decided that the Korean e-Sports Players Association (KeSPA) was unwilling to {{cooperate}} with them {{in regards to the}} sharing of profits from competitive StarCraft multiplayer games. This breakdown led to an uncertain future of KeSPA's legal ability to broadcast Blizzard's intellectual property of both StarCraft and StarCraft II without paying royalties.
