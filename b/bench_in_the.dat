5|$|The 2011–12 season saw Totti {{initially}} receive few starts under Roma's {{new manager}} Luis Enrique, as the club's early struggles continued. Totti sustained an injury on 1 October 2011 {{in the second}} half of a match against Atalanta, which kept him out of action until the 20 November; he returned to the pitch against Lecce, when he came off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 66th minute, as Roma won the match 2–1.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873, which unified the Common Pleas, Exchequer, King's Bench and Court of Chancery into one body, the High Court of Justice, with the {{divisions}} between the courts to remain. Thus, while the reform epitomised by the Bill of Middlesex aided the King's <b>Bench</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short term, it eventually led to its dissolution.|$|E

5|$|This was Arsenal's tenth Charity Shield {{appearance}} and Liverpool's ninth. Arsenal made no {{changes to the}} first team which played in the FA Cup Final the previous season, whereas for Liverpool new signing Avi Cohen started on the <b>bench.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> match Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the 38th minute when Terry McDermott scored past goalkeeper Pat Jennings.

5|$|When {{designing}} the exterior, Pei {{borrowed from the}} tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby Kyoto. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone {{and covered with a}} glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old keyaki tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350million.|$|E
5|$|After four largely injury-free seasons, {{the muscular}} {{injuries}} {{that had previously}} plagued Messi reoccurred. After he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 April, during the first quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain, his appearances became sporadic. In the second leg against PSG, with an underperforming Barcelona down a goal, Messi came off the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. Still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against Bayern Munich {{and was unable to}} play at all during the second, as Barcelona were defeated 7–0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.|$|E

5|$|Bonneau {{came off}} the <b>bench</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> start of his {{freshman}} season for the SUNY Orange Colts, but he eventually was the team's leading scorer with 16.5 points and 1.9 steals per game, also averaging 3.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists per game.
