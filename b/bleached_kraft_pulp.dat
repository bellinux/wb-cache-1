40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} {{of different}} cellulosic fibres during acid hydrolysis {{has been investigated}} and the levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) has been determined.

Experimental results from the investigation, together with results found in literature, imply that ultrastructural differences between different fibres affect their susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis. Drying of a <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> was found to enhance the rate of acid hydrolysis and also result in a decrease in LODP.

30|$|Methanol {{liberation and}} {{methoxyl}} loss during chlorine <b>bleaching</b> of softwood <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> were quantitatively investigated {{to estimate the}} degree of structural modification of lignin aromatics. An increase in the chlorine multiple led to enhanced methoxyl loss from lignin. Our result, using pH-adjusted chlorine water (pH 5.7), by which chlorination under oxidation-favorable conditions was achieved, strongly supported {{the importance of the}} oxidation reaction by chlorine during delignification and lignin degradation. It was also suggested that methanol can be produced not only via catalytic hydrolysis by chlorine but via oxidative cleavage of the ether bond as well. The infrared spectrum of chlorolignins suggested that chlorine oxidation can open aromatic rings to muconic acid derivatives without cleaving ether bonding of the methoxyl group. No straight relation between the methoxyl content and the kappa number of chlorinated pulps was shown. The methoxyl content of <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> subjected to successive chlorination and alkali extraction showed a good relation with the kappa number. This means that almost all the portions of the oxidatively modified lignin structure were successfully removed during these treatments, and the aromatic structures of residual lignin in chlorinated and alkali-extracted pulps were thought to remain intact.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to {{study the effects of}} partial removal of wood hemicelluloses on the properties of <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> The work was conducted by extracting hemicelluloses (1) by a softwood chip pretreatment process prior to <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping,</b> (2) by alkaline extraction from <b>bleached</b> birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp,</b> and (3) by enzymatic treatment, xylanase treatment in particular, of <b>bleached</b> birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> The qualitative and quantitative changes in fibers and paper properties were evaluated. In addition, the applicability of the extraction concepts and hemicellulose-extracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> as a raw material in papermaking was evaluated in a pilot-scale papermaking environment. The results showed that each examined hemicellulose extraction method has its characteristic effects on fiber properties, seen as differences in both the physical and chemical nature of the fibers. A prehydrolysis process prior to the <b>kraft</b> <b>pulping</b> process offered reductions in cooking time, bleaching chemical consumption and produced fibers with low hemicellulose content that are more susceptible to mechanically induced damages and dislocations. Softwood chip pretreatment for hemicellulose recovery prior to cooking, whether acidic or alkaline, {{had an impact on the}} physical properties of the non-refined and refined pulp. In addition, all the pretreated pulps exhibited slower beating response than the unhydrolyzed reference pulp. Both alkaline extraction and enzymatic (xylanase) treatment of <b>bleached</b> birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> fibers indicated very selective hemicellulose removal, particularly xylan removal. Furthermore, these two hemicellulose-extracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> were utilized in a pilot-scale papermaking environment in order to evaluate the upscalability of the extraction concepts. Investigations made using pilot paper machine trials revealed that some amount of alkalineextracted birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp,</b> with a 24. 9 % reduction in the total amount of xylan, could be used in the papermaking stock as a mixture with non-extracted pulp when producing 75 g/m 2 paper. For xylanase-treated fibers there were no reductions in the mechanical properties of the 180 g/m 2 paper produced compared to paper made from the control pulp, although there was a 14. 2 % reduction in the total amount of xylan in the xylanase-treated pulp compared to the control birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp.</b> This work emphasized the importance of the hemicellulose extraction method in providing new solutions to create functional fibers and in providing a valuable hemicellulose co-product stream.

This study investigated the adsorption kinetics involved, using isothermal adsorption equations. Cellulose binding domains (CBDs) were isolated from a commercial cellulase, and their role in the adsorption and enzymatic reaction was evaluated. Approximately 13 % to 24 % of the refining energy was saved after northern <b>bleached</b> softwood <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> samples were pretreated with full cellulase, CBDs, or cellulase lacking CBDs under optimal conditions. The absence of CBDs in cellulase resulted in less effective enzyme adsorption and hydrolysis of the fibers.

Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) revealed a gradient of stations on both shorelines which was strongly correlated with distance from effluent outfall and hence exposure to the efflu-ent plume. Within this gradient were two distinct clusters of stations. The first cluster contained all but one station on both shores 90 %) by tubificids (Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri, Tubifex tubifex, T. ignotus and Spirosperma ferox) and the naidid Chaetogaster diaphanus.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the {{utilisation}} of sawdust and wood chip screenings for different purposes. A substantial amount of these byproducts are readily available in the Finnish forest industry. A black liquor impregnation study showed that sawdust-like wood material behaves differently from normal chips. Furthermore, the fractionation and removal of the smallest size fractions did not {{have a significant effect on}} the impregnation of sawdust-like wood material. Sawdust kraft cooking equipped with an impregnation stage increases the cooking yield and decreases the lignin content of the produced pulp. Impregnation also increases viscosity of the pulp and decreases chlorine dioxide consumption in bleaching. In addition, impregnation increases certain pulp properties after refining. Hydrotropic extraction showed that more lignin can be extracted from hardwood than softwood. However, the particle size had a major influence on the lignin extraction. It was possible to extract more lignin from spruce sawdust than spruce chips. Wood chip screenings are usually combusted to generate energy.

40|$|After cooking, <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> always contain {{not only}} {{residual}} lignin but also {{significant amounts of}} hexenuronic acid and other non-lignin structures oxidizable by permanganate under the standard kappa number determination conditions. These here referred to as false lignin. Like ordinary lignin, the false lignin also consumes bleaching chemicals, thus increasing both the production costs and {{the environmental impact of}} bleach plant effluents. The false lignin also has an effect on pulp properties such as brightness stability. This necessitates the development of efficient experimental routines for the determination of false lignin in different types of unbleached and <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps,</b> together with studies of its formation, chemical behaviour, and ultimate fate. The main aim of this work has been to establish a method for the quantification of various types of oxidizable structures in <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> and to study their impact on pulp quality, particularly, on the brightness stability of pulps bleached in elemental-chlorine-free (ECF) and a totally-chlorine-free (TCF) processes. Part of this research deals with the relationship between the kappa number and the lignin content in the case of partly oxidized lignins. Spruce and birch <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> processed according to the ODEQP and OQ(OP) Q(PO) bleaching sequences, respectively, have been analyzed. It has been found that the oxidation equivalent of the residual lignin decreases with increasing degree of oxidation along each bleaching sequence. This finding has been further supported by experiments with a number of model compounds. The Ox-Dem kappa number method {{has been shown to be}} an accurate means of determining the residual lignin content and of monitoring the efficiency of lignin removal along different bleaching sequences. It has been demonstrated that the kappa number can always be fractioned into partial contributions, the first of which comes from the residual lignin and is measured by the Ox-Dem kappa number, and the second from the false lignin and is given by the difference between the standard kappa number and the Ox-Dem kappa number. The effect of false lignin on the pulp kappa number is most pronounced in unbleached and oxygen-delignified <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps.</b> The extractability of residual and false lignin in different solvents has been investigated. The changes that occurred in the kappa number following different extraction steps have been compared with corresponding changes in the chemical composition and the conclusion has been drawn that the hemicellulose component of a <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> is a major sourse of non-lignin structures contributing to the kappa number. The influence on the brightness stability of various oxidizable structures, viz. : residual lignin, hexenuronic acid and other non-lignin structures, in spruce, birch and eucalyptus <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> <b>bleached</b> in ECF and TCF type processes was studied. It was demonstrated that the selective removal of all false lignin structures significantly improves the brightness stability. The degree of yellowing was found to be proportional to the content of HexA groups in pulps. It has been shown that 2 -furancarboxylic acid, 5 -formyl- 2 furancarboxylic acid and reductic acid are formed during the course of thermal yellowing. The influence of two bleaching sequences, D 0 (EP) D 1 (ECF-type) and Q 1 (OP) Q 2 (PO) (TCF) -type, on the content of different oxidizable structures in eucalyptus <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> was studied in relation to the brightness stability of the pulp. It was shown by kappa number fractionation that pulp bleached to full brightness with ECF- and TCF-type sequences contains different amounts of HexA. The most significant discoloration was observed in the case of TCF-bleached pulp having an especially high content of HexA. The mechanism of the moist (8 % moisture) thermal yellowing of fully <b>bleached</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulps</b> was further studied using dissolving pulp impregnated with a set of model compounds representing the most likely HexA degradation products, viz. as 2 -furancarboxylic acid (FA), 5 -formyl- 2 -furancarboxylic acid (FFA) and reductic acid (RA), either alone or in combination with Fe(II) or Fe(III) ions. It was found that the latter two acids take part in reactions leading to colour formation whereas 2 -furancarboxylic acid does not. The effect of iron ions on the colour formation appears to vary with their oxidation state. The brightness loss caused by either FFA or RA, present in an amounts similar to the content of HexA in industrial pulps, was of the same order of magnitude as that observed in industrial pulps aged under the same conditions. Based on these findings, it is suggested that the overall mechanism of moist thermal yellowing involves several stages, including the degradation of hexenuronic acid and the formation of reactive precursors, such as 5 -formyl- 2 -furancarboxylic acid and reductic acid. The presence of ferrous ions further enhances the discoloration. QC 2010100...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that Trametes (Coriolus) versicolor <b>bleaches</b> <b>kraft</b> <b>pulp</b> brownstock with the {{concomitant}} release of methanol. In this work, the fungus is shown to produce both laccase and manganese peroxidase (MnP) but not lignin peroxidase during pulp bleaching. MnP production was enhanced {{by the presence of}} pulp and/or Mn(II) ions. The maximum level of secreted MnP was coincident with the maximum rate of fungal bleaching. Culture filtrates isolated from bleaching cultures produced Mn(II) - and hydrogen peroxide-dependent pulp demethylation and delignification. Laccase and MnP were separated by ion-exchange chromatography. Purified MnP alone produced most of the demethylation and delignification exhibited by the culture filtrates. On the basis of the methanol released and the total and phenolic methoxyl contents of the pulp, it appears that MnP shows a preference for the oxidation of phenolic lignin substructures. The extensive increase in brightness observed in the fungus-treated pulp was not found with MnP alone. Therefore, either the MnP effect must be optimized or other enzymes or compounds from the fungus are also required for brightening...|$|R
