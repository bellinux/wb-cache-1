5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} {{to serve as an}} aerial spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> an enemy without the need for an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must also}} be remembered that this cry of illicit knowledge, backed by more or less {{appropriate}} texts, has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> every advance of human knowledge. It <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the new astronomy, and Galileo had actually to recant. It <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Galvani and electricity. It <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Darwin, who would certainly have been burned had he lived a few centuries before. It <b>was</b> even <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Simpson's <b>use</b> of chloroform in child-birth, {{on the ground that}} the Bible declared [...] "in pain shall ye bring them forth." [...] Surely a plea which has been made so often, and so often abandoned, cannot be regarded very seriously.|$|R

5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Wilson {{agreed that the}} use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} constitution (co-written by the Queen and two legislators, Joseph Nāwahī and William Pūnohu White) {{would have}} restored {{the power to}} the monarchy, and voting rights to economically disenfranchised native Hawaiians and Asians. Her ministers, and closest friends, were all opposed to this plan; they tried unsuccessfully to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> her in the brewing constitutional crisis.|$|E
50|$|According to Mosab Hassan Yousef, the CIA has {{provided}} sophisticated electronic eavesdropping {{equipment to the}} Palestinian Authority that has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> suspected Palestinian militants.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Pacts of May, {{which ended}} the near-war {{tensions}} between Argentina and Chile, Argentina sold its two armored cruisers, Rivadavia and Moreno, that were under construction in Italy to Japan. Constitución and Libertad were put up for sale in early 1903. While the United Kingdom was not entirely interested in the ships, international politics took precedence: when the Russian Empire made an offer for the ships, the British grew concerned that the Swiftsure class could <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> their new ally Japan. To prevent this, the British purchased both Chilean battleships on 3 December 1903 for £2,432,000.|$|E
5|$|As {{the forward}} {{companies}} {{began to move}} back towards the main defensive position, jeeps were sent up to collect the wounded while McKinna led a force of two platoons and two tanks out to the perimeter at the Hatai junction. There {{they were able to}} reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed them so that they could not <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game, players are given an introductory level and boss to overcome. Afterward, they are given access to eight different stages, each representing one of the above-mentioned Robot Masters. At the end of each stage, players must battle a Robot Master. When a Robot Master is destroyed, it will give Mega Man its respective weapon, which can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> other Robot Masters or enemies but has limited ammunition. If Mega Man defeats the Robot Master using his primary weapon, the Robot Master will be captured and reprogrammed. This allows players to play through stages as one of the Robot Masters.|$|E
50|$|Putkonen throws four pitches. He has a four-seam fastball and two-seam fastball at 92-95 mph {{with good}} tailing action, a changeup {{in the mid}} 80s, and a good curveball in the upper 70s. His four-seamer and curveball <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> right-handers, and his two-seamer and changeup <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> left-handers.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} {{variants}} of the Ataka missile for different tasks. The 9M120 Tandem High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) warhead variant <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> tanks fitted with Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA), its penetrative ability is stated at 800 mm Rolled Homogeneous Armour (RHA). The 9M120F Thermobaric variant <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> infantry, buildings, bunkers, and caves. The 9M120O expanding rod warhead variant <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> other helicopters. All the variants have {{a range of}} 6 km. The 9M120M improved version has a longer range (8 km) and better penetration (900 mm of RHA). All of the variants use SACLOS missile guidance.|$|R
5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression that would <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to {{those who want to}} be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942 Puttick was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy and Alysa {{escape the}} ruins and pursue the vampires that stole the Blood Seal. Castello {{and the holy}} order are also {{pursuing}} the vampires. Jeremy and Alysa reach Godskeep, a human stronghold. In order {{to pass through the}} town, the pair must first rescue the town's sheriff, who went into a nearby forest with the town guard in an attempt to kill the powerful vampire Blood Fox. Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful weapon that can <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the vampires, in order to prove that Jeremy is still loyal to the order.|$|E

5|$|Schmerber v. California, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> that suspect {{in the course of a}} criminal prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|Task Group 111.2 sailed from Manus Island on 12 June. While {{en route}} to Truk, its orders were broadened to also include a cruiser {{bombardment}} of Japanese positions at Truk. This change was made as the cruisers were expected to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> shore targets during future operations. In preparation for these bombardments, the Task Group conducted gunnery exercises during its voyage north. Ahead of the attacks on Truk, a US Navy submarine took up position near the atoll to rescue any British airmen who crashed into the sea.|$|E

5|$|The fort's {{armament}} was revised {{several times}} during its seventy years of military usage, as its role evolved in the river's defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located {{to the south and}} east respectively on the Kent shore. Over time, as batteries and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and its fabric was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> fast-moving surface and aerial targets. Its last military usage was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoi’s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>against</b> the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 the United States also introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E
