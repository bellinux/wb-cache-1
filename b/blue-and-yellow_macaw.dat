5|$|What Bouton {{described}} {{is likely}} to remain a mystery, but various theories have been proposed. In 1906, Tommaso Salvadori noted that the Martinique macaw seemed similar to the <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara ararauna) of mainland South America, and may have been the same bird. The American ornithologist James Greenway suggested Bouton's description could have been based on a captive bird. Edwards' Dodo, a 1626 painting by the Dutch artist Roelant Savery, shows several birds including a blue and yellow macaw, which is different from the mainland bird in having yellow undertail covert feathers instead of blue, but the origin of this macaw is unknown. Another macaw in the painting may be the also extinct Lesser Antillean macaw (Ara guadeloupensis). Another Savery painting from about the same time shows a similar blue and yellow macaw, as does a mid-1700s illustration by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin. In 1936, a Cuban scientist claimed to have found a stuffed Martinique macaw specimen, which {{was supposed to have been}} collected in 1845. After examination it was shown to be a hoax, combining a burrowing parakeet (Cyanoliseus patagonus byroni) with the tail of a dove.|$|E
25|$|The Ara macaws have a Neotropical {{distribution}} from Mexico to Argentina. The {{centre of}} Ara distribution is the Amazon Basin and the Panama–Colombia border region; each {{with as many}} as four species found together (marginally five where the military macaw approach the western Amazon). Seven species are found in Bolivia, but no single locality in that (or any other) country surpasses four species. The most widespread species, the scarlet macaw, is (or was) distributed throughout large parts of Central America and the Amazon. On the other hand, the blue-throated macaw and the red-fronted macaw have tiny distributions in Bolivia. The overall range of many species and the genus as a whole has declined in historical times due to human activities. The military macaw is distributed from northern Mexico to northern Argentina, but the distribution is discontinuous, with populations in Mexico, a large gap, then a population in the Venezuelan Coastal Range and a population along the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Argentina. The <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaw</b> was expiated from Trinidad in the 1960s, as well as retreating from northern Argentina, and several species apparently became extinct in the islands of the Caribbean.|$|E

50|$|The {{project was}} {{established}} by Eduardo Nycander, a Peruvian nature enthusiastic and architect, {{with the goal of}} studying the ecology and natural history of large macaws so that this information could be used to help protect these birds throughout the tropics. In 1991 and 1992 the researchers accelerated the formation of natural dead palm cavities by cutting off the crowns of 23 live Mauritia flexuosa palms in a natural monoculture of thousands of these palms in a 0.5 km2 swamp near the Tambopata Research Center (TRC), as <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaws</b> almost exclusively nest in dead mauritia palms. Decapitating these palms began the process of rotting the interior of the trunks, which eventually provides nesting sites for these macaws.|$|R
500|$|The Martinique macaw or orange-bellied macaw (Ara martinicus) is a {{hypothetical}} extinct species of macaw {{which may have}} been endemic to the Lesser Antillean island of Martinique, in the eastern Caribbean Sea. It was scientifically named by Walter Rothschild in 1905, based on a 1630s description of [...] "blue and orange-yellow" [...] macaws by Père Jacques Bouton. No other evidence of its existence is known, but it may have been identified in contemporary artwork. Some writers have suggested that the birds observed were actually <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaws</b> (Ara ararauna). The [...] "red-tailed blue-and-yellow macaw" [...] (Ara erythrura), another species described by Rothschild in 1907 based on a 1658 account, is thought to be identical to the Martinique macaw, if either has ever existed.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} reference values for selected ophthalmic diagnostic tests in healthy <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaws.</b> We investigated a total of 35 adult macaws (70 eyes) of undetermined sex and with an average weight of 1 kg, who were living in captivity in the Federal District, Brazil. Tear production using the Schirmer tear test (STT), normal conjunctival flora, intraocular pressure (IOP) using a rebound tonometer and horizontal palpebral fissure length (HPFL) were evaluated. In this study, 84. 1 % of samples were positive for microbial growth. Bacteria, fungi and yeasts were isolated, and Staphylococcus spp. (21. 9 %) and Bacillus spp. (26. 8 %) were the most frequently isolated microorganisms. The mean value for STT was 7. 6 ± 4. 6 mm/min in the right eye (OD) and 6. 6 ± 4. 4 mm/min in the left eye (OS) (median = 7, 11 ± 0, 76 mm/min). Mean IOP was 11. 4 ± 2. 5 mm Hg OD and 11. 6 ± 1. 8 mm Hg OS (median = 11. 49 ± 0. 22 mm Hg), prior to anesthesia, and 7. 6 ± 2. 4 mm Hg OD and 7. 8 ± 1. 8 mm Hg OS (median 7. 71 ± 0. 08 mmHg) after anesthesia. The IOP was significantly lower when the animals were under anesthesia as compared to when they were conscious (p≤ 0. 05). Horizontal palpebral fissure length was 11. 7 ± 0. 1 mm OD and 11. 8 ± 0. 1 mm OS (median = 11. 72 ± 0. 07 mm). The STT showed a positive correlation with palpebral fissure measurement for this species. These selected ophthalmic reference values will be particularly useful in diagnosing pathological changes in the eyes of <b>blue-and-yellow</b> <b>macaws...</b>|$|R
