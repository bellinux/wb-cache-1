5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, multiplayer game <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E

Lynch believed the Treaty to be the practical solution, arguing {{for it in the}} Dáil debates, saying that “I stand for this Treaty on four grounds, and the one I mention last is the one that will mean the most to me. I stand for <b>it</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> us an army, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> us evacuation, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> us control over the finances of the country, and lastly, and greatest of all to me, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> us control over our education.” ...|$|R

25|$|NUHHCE {{used the}} {{retained}} per capita for organizing and administration. The union grew swiftly, organizing statewide amalgamated local unions outside New York and New Jersey. The 'union within a union' arrangement was to NUHHCE's advantage <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> {{the image that}} the division was a national union of hospital and health care employees rather than a union of retail, wholesale and department store workers.|$|E
25|$|As {{economic}} growth slowed, Republican presidents relied on foreign loans. Saavedra (1920–25) and Hernando Siles Reyes (1926–30) borrowed {{heavily in the}} United States to finance major development projects, despite opposition by Bolivian nationalists to the favorable terms for the lender. The so-called Nicolaus loan aroused national indignation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> the United States control over Bolivia's tax collections {{in return for a}} private banking loan of US$33 million.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, after a five-year {{absence from the}} organisation, Wright resumed his UVF activities. This was in {{consequence}} of the November 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which angered unionists <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> the Irish Government an advisory role in Northern Ireland's government. There were constant raids by the RUC and British Army on his home in Portadown's Corcrain estate. Although he was arrested repeatedly on suspicion of murder and conspiracy, he never faced any charges.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland Trust Company {{was founded}} in 1894, {{and was one of}} the first banks in Cleveland to have branch locations. Cleveland Trust merged with the Western Reserve Trust Co. in 1903, and by 1905 had outgrown the space it rented for its headquarters. The bank decided to {{construct}} a building which would be large enough to serve as its headquarters for years to come. Bank officers also settled on the Neoclassical architectural style, a common choice for banks at the time <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> banking an air of grandeur and prestige.|$|E

Schooling herself in reform issues, {{she found herself}} drawn to the more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon she was wearing the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E
25|$|India largely {{retained}} {{the same team}} {{it had in the}} semi-final against Pakistan, with just one change. Ashish Nehra, left-arm medium pacer, had suffered a finger fracture while fielding in that match, and he was replaced by another pacer, Sreesanth. India was widely rated as having the strongest batting line-up in the tournament, and chose to back this strength throughout the campaign by playing seven batsmen and four bowlers. Due to Yuvraj Singh performing well with both bat and ball in the tournament, India could afford to play with only four specialist bowlers. Yuvraj bowled his full quota of 10 overs in many matches, including the semi-final against Pakistan. Among the four bowling slots, Zaheer Khan was the pace spearhead supported in most matches by Munaf Patel, while Harbhajan Singh was the regular off-spinner. The fourth slot was taken by different bowlers in different matches, including Sreesanth, Nehra, leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, or off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin. The captain had chosen Nehra over Ashwin in the match against Pakistan also. Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had then said he preferred having three seamers (a synonym for a fast bowler) <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> him more options. He already had proven spinners in Harbhajan and Yuvraj, and could call upon many other Indian players who can bowl part-time spin (including Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, and Virender Sehwag).|$|E

Lane has stated she draws inspiration from her own past, as an angle to portray Kylie. Lane's first scenes aired on 26August2010. Lane later signed a new contract with the serial, which was later extended and meant Kylie would stay into July2012.

Digital Spy said Robin [...] "goes to drastic lengths to keep Zeke and Sunny apart" [...] and Holy Soap and Jay labelled him as [...] "creepy". Robin was seen trying to manipulate Sunny and he locked Zeke in a store cupboard, so he could spend time with her. Lee named the storyline with Robin as her favourite from her time in the show. She said [...] "That {{was probably the best}} storyline ever <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> me a chance to show who Sunny Lee was".|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 744, he met Li Bai (Li Po) for the first time, and the two poets formed a friendship. David Young {{describes}} this as [...] "the most significant formative element in Du Fu's artistic development" [...] <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> him a living example of the reclusive poet-scholar life {{to which he was}} attracted after his failure in the civil service exam. The relationship was somewhat one-sided, however. Du Fu was by some years the younger, while Li Bai was already a poetic star. We have twelve poems to or about Li Bai from the younger poet, but only one in the other direction. They met again only once, in 745.|$|E

500|$|McKinsey {{consultants}} published Creative Destruction in 2001. The book {{suggested that}} CEOs {{need to be}} willing to change or rebuild a company, rather than protect what they have created. It found that out of the first S 500 list from 1957, only 74 were still in business by 1998. The New York Times said it [...] "makes a cogent argument that in times of rampant, uncertain change... established companies are handcuffed by success." [...] In 2009, McKinsey consultants published [...] "The Alchemy of Growth", which established three [...] "horizons" [...] for growth: core enhancements, new growth platforms and options. Its three horizons became adopted widely, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> executives a simple vocabulary about business growth.|$|E
500|$|In 1723 Burnet was {{informed}} that the French had begun construction of Fort Niagara at {{the western end of}} Lake Ontario; this action presented a clear threat to British attempts to more directly access and control the fur trade. [...] He consequently ordered the construction of Fort Oswego {{at the mouth of the}} Oswego River. [...] This decision not only upset Albany traders, who would lose their monopoly on the fur trade, but also upset the French (<b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> the British direct access to Lake Ontario) and the Iroquois, who had wanted a fort sited at Lake Oneida instead. [...] Burnet tried to placate the Iroquois by stationing militia forces in the Oneida area, but they also resented this intrusion.|$|E

Some admirers of Fauré's music have expressed regret {{that although he}} played the organ professionally for four decades, he left no solo compositions for the instrument. He was renowned for his improvisations, and Saint-Saëns said of {{him that he was}} [...] "a first class organist when he wanted to be". Fauré preferred the piano to the organ, which he played only <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> him a regular income. Duchen speculates that he positively disliked the organ, possibly because [...] "for a composer of such delicacy of nuance, and such sensuality, the organ was simply not subtle enough." ...|$|E

[...] A testimony to the Boom's global impact is the fact that [...] "up-and-coming international writers" [...] look upon the likes of Fuentes, García Márquez or Vargas Llosa as their mentors.|$|E
500|$|The {{technology}} for the bridge was based on recent {{technology for}} pontoon bridges combined with Norwegian offshore technology. Among the technologies initially considered, but later ruled out, was that used in the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge and the Hood Canal Bridge in the United States. Instead, an orthotropic deck was chosen, such as the Bergsøysund Bridge had used. The choice of a box girder bridge and the orthotropic deck were chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>gave</b> the lower material use. Conventional pontoon bridges have lateral anchorage systems which fasten the bridge to the seabed. The technique had previously been used down to , but Salhusfjorden is [...] deep, making the method prohibitively expensive. The choice of a cable-stayed section allowed reduced traffic hazards in storms, a reduction in corrosion on the bridge deck, and improved passage of water beneath the bridge in support of wildlife.|$|E

Following the injury, she was advised by a specialist to avoid dancing and other physical activities for a week; MTV News further reported that the injury could further postpone the filming of the video. However, the next week, the group revealed {{in an interview with}} the publication that the video would be filmed as originally planned as Beyoncé's leg healed fast.
