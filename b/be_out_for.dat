FEMA informed the North Carolina congressional delegation about the storm's threat to their constituents. The agency later received compliments for their timely preparations for storm-related operations. All airports on the Outer Banks were reopened by September1.

Six emergency vehicles were sent to Dare County to provide drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Davies and Caldwell {{began the}} 2012–13 season as first choice until an ankle injury {{sustained}} by Davies during a League Cup match at Coventry City gave Pablo an early opportunity to impress. He kept his place after Davies returned to fitness, but chipped a {{bone in his}} foot in the defeat to Barnsley and was expected to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a month. Further injuries, the return to fitness of Caldwell, {{and the emergence of}} young left-back Mitch Hancox, which allowed Paul Robinson to partner Davies in the centre, meant that Pablo played only twice more, and he was released {{at the end of his}} contract.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the game, there was much media {{discussion}} of the future site of the game due to Jacksonville's expiring contract to host the ACC Championship. The media also discussed whether Virginia Tech would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> revenge against Boston College after its last-second defeat in Blacksburg on October 25. Despite its previous loss, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win the game, with most favoring the Hokies by 4.55points.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August, Alex Ferguson claimed Carrick would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{two weeks}} with an ankle injury and would miss England's {{friendly}} against Hungary the following Wednesday.

Capello made a 'call me' sign as Carrick walked past his seat to collect the winner's medal.|$|E
5|$|On December 8, Emery {{was placed}} on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally {{expected}} to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when {{it was discovered that}} he had avascular necrosis.

5|$|Samaras {{suffered}} a knee cartilage injury in mid-October, after a successful operation {{he was expected}} to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a month. This meant he would be likely to miss crucial Champions League ties against Manchester United and Aalborg. He returned earlier than expected and was back in training on 9 November, having missed seven games. Samaras returned to action on 12 November, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock. On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not play well and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2–1. This loss consigned Celtic to a bottom place finish in their group.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the season}} started, however, Orr {{underwent}} another surgery on September 20, 1975. The Bruins' contract talks with Orr and Eagleson became difficult. The Bruins' insurer would not insure {{a contract with}} Orr and doctors advised the Bruins that Orr {{would not be able}} to play much longer. Orr returned to the lineup on November 8, 1975, the day after the Bruins traded Esposito to the New York Rangers. Orr was able to play the next ten games for the team but had to stop on November 28 due to pain in his knee. The next day, he underwent another knee surgery. Originally expected to only <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> seven to eight weeks, his knee did not respond to therapy and he returned home to Parry Sound. His season was over after ten games and he would not play again for the Bruins. His impending free agency led to speculation that the Bruins would trade him, but despite his injury, they were negotiating to keep him until the end.|$|E
5|$|Coulson joined newly {{promoted}} League Two club York City on {{a two-year}} contract on 29 June 2012. He scored on his debut with a long-range strike away to League One team Doncaster Rovers in the League Cup first round to give York a 1–0 lead, with the match finishing 1–1 after extra time. Coulson missed York's first penalty {{in the ensuing}} penalty shoot-out, which the team lost 4–2. He then played in York's first Football League fixture since their promotion, a 3–1 defeat at home to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012. After sustaining a cruciate ligament injury during York's away match against Accrington on 23 October 2012, Coulson was expected to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the rest of 2012–13. However, he made his return as a 73rd-minute substitute in York's 0–0 draw away to Bristol Rovers on 30 March 2013. He finished the season with 21 appearances and five goals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} {{game of the}} 1992 season, Majkowski injured a {{ligament}} in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe enough that he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski {{for the remainder of}} the game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23–17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game–winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{earned a}} spot in the 2007 Money in the Bank ladder match by {{defeating}} Sabu in an Extreme Rules match in a February episode of ECW on Sci Fi. At WrestleMania 23, Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match, giving him the right to challenge any World Champion in WWE at any date up until WrestleMania XXIV. Kennedy announced on the April 30 episode of Raw that he would be cashing in his Money in the Bank championship opportunity at WrestleMania 24. On the May 7 episode of Raw, Kennedy, however, lost his Money in the Bank opportunity to Edge, losing mere moments after being struck with a monitor before the match began. Because of the injury Kennedy sustained during his match with Edge, it was revealed that his right triceps muscle tore off the bone and he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a minimum of five to seven months. The injury, however, was not as serious, as the triceps tendon did not tear off the bone but was, in fact, a massive hematoma.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{took the}} new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball. He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over. Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32/2. Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later. England were 46/4 and Australia were firmly in control. Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings, scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes. After the tea break, Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball. Compton edged Johnston to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> 53. One run later, Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134/6 with their skipper dismissed for 44. Johnson then removed Evans for nine, before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Johnston removed both. England's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9/207.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2013 it was {{announced}} that Solo was one of three members from the United States national team, along with Megan Rapinoe and Amy Rodriguez, allocated to the Seattle Reign FC for the inaugural season of the National Women's Soccer League, as part of the NWSL Player Allocation. Two months later, it was reported that she was undergoing wrist surgery and would miss about half the season because of recovery. Joining news that Amy Rodriguez would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the season because of pregnancy and Megan Rapinoe would be returning mid-season after a six-month stint for Olympique Lyonnais, the Reign faced a tough first half of the season and went 0–9–1 in their first ten games. With the return of Solo, Rapinoe, and some additional lineup changes made during the early summer, the Reign turned their regular season record around and finished the season in seventh place with a 5–14–3 record. Solo started in all 14 matches in which she played with a 1.357 goals against average. She made 81 saves and tallied 1,260 minutes in goal.|$|E

5|$|The loan {{was twice}} {{extended}} {{for a further}} month, and on 11 November 2002 Gill left Birmingham permanently, signing for Northampton {{until the end of}} the season. His season proceeded successfully– a new two-year contract had been discussed, and he finished as runner-up for the club's Player of the Year award– until with two games remaining he damaged his anterior cruciate ligament and was expected to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> several months. Northampton were prepared to give him a six-month contract, albeit on reduced wages, to allow him time to recover and prove his fitness. Birmingham City allowed him to use their facilities for his rehabilitation, and he recovered sufficiently to play a couple of reserve games for Northampton, but by that time new manager Colin Calderwood had other players in Gill's position and he was not offered another contract.|$|E
5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. Just {{a couple of weeks}} before the start of 2013 Allsvenskan, he picked up a knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months. On his Allsvenskan debut on 25 August 2013 in an away match against Malmö FF he {{suffered}} another injury, which meant that he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Alex Song ahead of the 2012–13 season, Diaby started all three of Arsenal's opening games. His performance against Liverpool saw him awarded Man of the Match by Sky Sports in Arsenal's 2–0 win at Anfield. However, he was later injured in Arsenal's 2-1 loss against Chelsea on 29 September and was substituted. On 13 January 2013, Diaby made his return against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium. This controversial fixture in the Premier League, saw two red cards awarded, one for each team. Arsenal lost the match 2–0. Following several spells on the sidelines during February and March, it was announced on 28 March 2013 that Diaby had torn the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in his left knee and that after surgery, he would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> approximately eight or nine months.|$|E
