2500|$|In 1880 the Low Level Shaft was {{extended}} to the Lucy Tongue Level. The company employed an outside contractor to do this work. Warsop and Hill used their own rock drills and the more powerful <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatine.</b> Impressed by this technology, the company installed an air compressor in 1884 and bought {{a number of the}} rock drills from the contractors. These contractors also drove the crosscut which was needed to connect the bottom of the shaft to the Lucy Tongue Level. This crosscut, [...] long, was known as Warsop's Crosscut ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade Smith's Shaft was sunk to the 40Fathom Level, the 60Fathom Level, and in 1899 to the 75Fathom Level. In 1896 it was fitted with cages and an {{electric}} winding engine, and the old Lucy Engine Shaft was abandoned in 1899. By 1902 all ore production from above the Lucy Level had ceased. In 1904 Smith's Shaft was extended to the 90Fathom Level which became the major working level for many years. A small patch of ore above {{the north end of}} the Lucy Tongue Level was opened up in the 1890s, known as the Alma Workings. [...] Gelignite was introduced in the 1890s, replacing both <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatine</b> and gunpowder. The first carbide lamps were introduced at Greenside from 1909 onwards; before then all work had been done by candlelight.|$|E

50|$|Nobel Industries Limited {{was founded}} in 1870 by Swedish chemist and {{industrialist}} Alfred Nobel {{for the production of}} the new explosive dynamite. The factory was overseen and run by George McRoberts. McRoberts and John Downie raised the Â£24,000 needed to found the company rather than Nobel himself. It was chaired by the Glasgow shipbuilder, Charles Randolph (1809-1878). Ardeer, on the coast at Ayrshire, was chosen for the company's first factory. The business later diversified into the production of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatine,</b> gelignite, ballistite, guncotton, and cordite. At its peak, the factory employed nearly 13,000 men and women.|$|E
50|$|In 1870 Nobel Industries Limited {{had been}} founded by Alfred Nobel for the {{manufacture}} of the dynamite. Ardeer was chosen for the company's first factory because of its isolation and desolation. <b>Blasting</b> <b>gelatine,</b> gelignite, ballistite, guncotton, and cordite were also produced here. At its peak, the factory was employing nearly 13,000 men and women. The firm merged in 1926 with Brunner, Mond & Company, the United Alkali Company, and the British Dyestuffs Corporation, forming Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), then one of Britain's largest firms. Nobel Industries continued as the ICI Nobel division of the company, however in 2002 Nobel Enterprises was sold to Inabata.|$|E
5000|$|Braamfontein explosion: On 19 February 1896, an {{explosives}} {{train at}} Braamfontein station in Johannesburg, loaded with between 56 and 60 tons of <b>blasting</b> <b>gelatine</b> {{destined for the}} burgeoning gold mines of the Witwatersrand and having been standing {{for three and a}} half days in searing heat, was struck by a shunting train. The load exploded, leaving a crater in the Braamfontein rail yard 60 m long, 50 m wide and 8 m deep. The explosion was heard up to 200 km away. 75 people were killed, and more than 200 injured. Surrounding suburbs were destroyed, and roughly 3000 people lost their homes. Almost every window in Johannesburg was broken.|$|E
50|$|McNaughton tubes {{were found}} to have {{significant}} defects. <b>Blasting</b> <b>gelatine</b> explosives were expected to remain potent for several years, but in 1941 it was evident that the explosives in some of the tubes had been affected by water, losing power significantly. A brass spearhead on a long rod was provided for withdrawing the explosives from the tubes, but in some cases the explosive had deteriorated into a porridge-like mush. Second Lieutenant Cameron, who as a civilian was an experienced oil drilling engineer, suggested washing out the explosives with water delivered by a narrow diameter tube pushed down the main pipe. The mush, along with globules of nitro-glycerine was caught in burlap bags for disposal. The original pipes were then re-charged with stable explosives.|$|E
