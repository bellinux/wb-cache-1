From a basic {{column of}} colored marble, about whose base disport three bronze amorini, one with wings and drunk, and another {{uplifting}} a wreath, rises an emaciated and strongly modelled bronze figure of an aged man, crowned with a bird's nest at whose edge two doves bill and coo.

About the round <b>base</b> <b>circle</b> 18 heads, including those of the Saviour and the Virgin, and others, crowned and uncrowned, but nearly all grotesquely ugly.

5000|$|In the Indian {{mathematical}} tradition, the sine ( [...] or jya) of {{an angle}} {{is not a}} ratio of numbers. It is {{the length of a}} certain line segment, a certain half-chord. The radius of the <b>base</b> <b>circle</b> is basic parameter for the construction of such tables. Historically, several tables have been constructed using different values for this parameter. Āryabhaṭa has chosen the number 3438 as the value of radius of the <b>base</b> <b>circle</b> for the computation of his sine table. The rationale of the choice of this parameter is the idea of measuring the circumference of a circle in angle measures. In astronomical computations distances are measured in degrees, minutes, seconds, etc. In this measure, the circumference of a circle is 360° = (60 × 360) minutes = 21600 minutes. The radius of the circle, the measure of whose circumference is 21600 minutes, is21600 / 2π minutes. Computing this using the value π = 3.1416 known to Aryabhata one gets the radius of the circle as 3438 minutes approximately. Āryabhaṭa's sine table is based on this value for the radius of the <b>base</b> <b>circle.</b> It has not yet been established who is the first ever to use this value for the base radius. But Aryabhatiya is the earliest surviving text containing a reference to this basic constant.|$|E
5000|$|Transverse base pitch, pb, pbt : In an {{involute}} gear, {{the pitch}} {{is on the}} <b>base</b> <b>circle</b> or {{along the line of}} action.

50|$|The {{width of}} the slot {{is equal to the}} angular extent of the closing flank of the lobe. One edge of the slot extends diagonally the full length of the lobe across the 170 degree {{constant}} nose radius. The other edge is ground so that it is all at <b>base</b> <b>circle</b> level. The slot in fact replaces the closing flank on {{the main body of the}} cam lobe. Bridging the slot is a segment of lobe (about 10 mm in thickness) which is ground to the profile of the closing flank. The segment is attached to the inner shaft. One edge of the slot has a constant cylindrical radius, the same radius as the lobe’s nose radius. The other edge has the radius of the lobe’s <b>base</b> <b>circle.</b> A small region along each edge of the closing flank segment has the same constant radius as the edge of the slot that it is adjacent to.|$|E

5000|$|The Free Training mode {{is simply}} a means of testing all of the {{available}} traps in a controlled environment with an immortal invader who can be programmed to adopt behavioral patterns, to learn their effects and uses without any real consequences.

Typical missions include [...] "Crush the invader with a 4-hit combo" [...] and [...] "Make the killing hit a Pendulum trap." [...] Also included is a Trap License mode which functions as a further tutorial, asking the player to perform various tasks that teach the nuances {{of the game in}} the name of learning helpful tips or trap functions. Traps are even more customizable than in previous games through the uses of <b>Base</b> <b>Circles,</b> Orbs, Emblems, and Rings. <b>Base</b> <b>Circles</b> contain the variety of trap involved (Pendulum, Arrow Slit, Bear Claw, etc.); Orbs determine the power level of the trap, ranging from 1 to 4; Emblems give the trap an element or special characteristic (Lightning, Fire, Slave, etc.); and Rings further enhance a trap by increasing their power, shortening their charge time, or a myriad number of other changes. The more modifications a trap employs, the more [...] "Dreak" [...] (the replacement for Kageros Ark) it takes, but again, traps could be used infinitely upon creation.
