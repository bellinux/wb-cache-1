5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E
5|$|The Judges of the Underworld– Featured in God of War III, King Minos, King Rhadamanthus, and King Aeacus {{were the}} judges of the dead. The statues of the trio held the Chain of <b>Balance</b> <b>that</b> {{connected}} Olympus to the Underworld. Kratos encountered the statues, who {{declared that he}} was not yet ready for the afterlife. Kratos later returned to the statues and destroyed them in order to raise the labyrinth so that Pandora could reach Pandora's Box. King Minos, who was the only Judge to speak through his statue, was voiced by Mark Moseley.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{possible}} ways the poem was composed. The first, Mason's concept, {{argues that the}} Eton copy was the original for the Elegy poem and was complete in itself. Later critics claimed that the original was more complete than the later version; Roger Lonsdale argued that the early version had a <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> set up the debate, and was clearer than the later version. Lonsdale also argued that the early poem fits classical models, including Virgil's Georgics and Horace's Epodes. The early version of the poem was finished, according to Mason, in August 1742, {{but there is little}} evidence to give such a definite date. Mason argued that the poem was in response to West's death, but there is little to indicate that Mason would have such information.|$|E
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork escapement mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E

25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio sets the <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> the Federal Reserve System requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.|$|E

25|$|In the 1890s (around 100 years later) two British physicists, William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh, {{realized}} that their newly discovered inert gas, argon, {{was responsible for}} Cavendish's problematic residue; he had not made an error. What he had done was perform rigorous quantitative experiments, using standardized instruments and methods, aimed at reproducible results; taken {{the mean of the}} result of several experiments; and identified and allowed for sources of error. The <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> he used, made by a craftsman named Harrison, {{was the first of the}} precision balances of the 18th century, and as accurate as Lavoisier's (which has been estimated to measure one part in 400,000).

Her experiences in the culture have fueled an interest to preserve cultural traditions and understand the impact of the past on contemporary life. A well-known novelist and poet, Silko's career has been characterized by making people aware of ingrained racism and white cultural imperialism, and a commitment to support women's issues. Her novels have many characters who attempt what some perceive a simple yet uneasy return to balance Native American traditions survivalism with the violence of modern America. The clash of civilizations is a continuing theme in the modern Southwest and of the difficult search for <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> the region’s inhabitants encounter.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds and levels of loss in Albee’s play A Delicate Balance. Most obvious {{is the loss of}} <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> has been precariously maintained by Agnes, the main character in the play and mistress of the house in which the play takes place. Agnes begins the play musing about sanity, a condition, at least in Agnes’s mind, that can easily be lost. Agnes wonders what would happen if she were to lose her sense of the rational. Who would take care of things? The way in which Agnes maintains the delicate balance in her home, as well as the delicate balance of her sanity, is to lose contact with her own emotional reality. She also tries to convince everyone else to suppress his or her emotions. Agnes believes that by saying that the emotions are gone, circumstances will return to some condition that resembles normalcy.|$|E

40|$|Load {{balancer}} is {{a fundamental}} software building block for implementing high-throughput applications onto multi-core architectures (e. g., network processors). In this paper, we consider two canonical load balancing schemes {{in the context of}} packet processing systems: (1) packet-level load <b>balancing</b> <b>that</b> determines the mapping of a packet to processor independently for each packet; and (2) flow-level load <b>balancing</b> <b>that</b> maps a flow to a processor and directs all subsequent packets of that flow to the mapped processor. By identifying the application, system, and trace characteristics that affect their relative performance, we address the fundamental question: under what operating conditions, should one choose packet-level load balancing over flow-level load balancing, and vice versa?...|$|R
25|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{is the change}} in the {{amplitude}} or sign of the geostrophic wind due to a horizontal temperature gradient. The geostrophic wind is an idealized wind that results from a balance of forces along a horizontal dimension. Whenever the Earth's rotation plays a dominant role in fluid dynamics, as in the mid-latitudes, a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure-gradient force develops. Intuitively, a horizontal difference in pressure pushes air across that difference in a similar way that the horizontal difference in the height of a hill causes objects to roll downhill. However, the Coriolis force intervenes and nudges the air towards the right (in the northern hemisphere). This is illustrated in panel (a) of the figure below. The <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> develops between these two forces results in a flow that parallels the horizontal pressure difference, or pressure gradient. In addition, when forces acting in the vertical dimension are dominated by the vertical pressure-gradient force and the gravitational force, hydrostatic balance occurs.|$|E
25|$|DiNunno was {{initially}} offered {{a scholarship to}} play for Northern Illinois by Rob Judson, but committed to the school in 2007 as the offer was confirmed by new head coach Ricardo Patton. Three games into his freshman season, DiNunno had a Northern Illinois career-high in scoring with 27 points, to help the Huskies overcome Indiana State 86–79. Against Southeast Missouri State he posted a career-high 6 steals to combine with 16 points and 5 assists. By leading all MAC freshmen in scoring, assists, free throw percentage, three pointers made and minutes played, he was named in the conference's all-freshman team. Before {{the start of his}} sophomore season, three of DiNunno's grandparents died within a month and a half; later on he admitted it was a difficult task to <b>balance</b> <b>that</b> with performing at 19 years of age. Versus Western Michigan, DiNunno recorded his first career double-double by posting a season-high 21 points and a career-best 10 assists, to help his team win its fourth game in a row. Following the end of his sophomore season DiNunno announced that he would not return to Northern Illinois for his junior season.|$|E
25|$|While {{the war on}} the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the {{southern}} Laotian panhandle was considered {{an extension of the}} Vietnam War, the war in northern Laos was the heart of the Laotian Civil War. It was a seesaw war. In November 1968, Vang Pao and his guerrillas had waged Operation Pigfat and been rather successful with Operation Raindance. The North Vietnamese short sharp riposte of Campaign Toan Thang during 1827 June 1969 redressed the balance by capturing the strategic forward air base at Muang Soui. From 115 July, the Royalists hastily struck back with Operation Off <b>Balance.</b> <b>That</b> was followed up by Kou Kiet, also called Operation About Face, which in August and September 1970 recaptured the Plain of Jars from the Communists at the cost of excessive Hmong casualties. Stepping on the tail of Kou Kiet, the Communist combined arms offensive of Campaign 139 was a gross escalation of the war, waged from September 1969 through April 1970. At its end, the Vietnamese Communists had conquered the Plain and besieged the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng, nearly winning the war. The aptly named Operation Counterpunch by the Royalists, fought during Autumn 1970, succeeded in buying the Hmong some time. In turn, Campaign 74B was a Communist combined arms offensive during Spring 1971 that once again besieged Long Tieng.|$|E
