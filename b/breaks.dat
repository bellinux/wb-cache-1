40|$|We {{present a}} general method for {{dynamically}} posting symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints during search. The basic idea is very simple. Given any set of symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints, if during search a symmetry {{of one of}} these constraints is entailed and this is consistent with previously posted symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints, then we post this constraint. We illustrate the method with two examples where a polynomial number of symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints <b>break</b> an exponential number of symmetries. Like existing static methods for symmetry <b>breaking,</b> this symmetry <b>breaking</b> method benefits from fast and effective constraint propagation. In addition, like existing dynamic methods for symmetry <b>breaking,</b> this symmetry <b>breaking</b> methods does not conflict with the branching heuristic.

25|$|A <b>break</b> point occurs if the receiver, not the server, has {{a chance}} to win the game with the next point. <b>Break</b> points are of {{particular}} importance because serving is generally considered advantageous, with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. A receiver who has one (score of 30–40 or advantage), two (score of 15–40) or three (score of love-40) consecutive chances to win the game has <b>break</b> point, double <b>break</b> point or triple <b>break</b> point, respectively. If the receiver does, in fact, win their <b>break</b> point, the game is awarded to the receiver, and the receiver is said to have converted their <b>break</b> point. If the receiver fails to win their <b>break</b> point it is called a failure to convert. Winning <b>break</b> points, and thus the game, is also referred to as <b>breaking</b> serve, as the receiver has disrupted, or broken the natural advantage of the server. If in the following game the previous server also wins a <b>break</b> point it is referred to as <b>breaking</b> back.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the issue of}} testing a time series for a unit root in the possible presence of a <b>break</b> in a linear deterministic trend at an unknown point in the series. We propose a new <b>break</b> fraction estimator which, where a <b>break</b> in trend occurs, is consistent for the true <b>break</b> fraction at rate O (T − 1). Unlike other available estimators, however, {{when there is no}} trend <b>break,</b> our estimator converges to zero at rate O (T − 1 / 2). Used in conjunction with a quasi difference (QD) detrended unit root test that incorporates a trend <b>break</b> regressor, we show that these rates of convergence ensure that known <b>break</b> fraction null critical values are asymptotically valid. Unlike available procedures in the literature, this holds even if there is no <b>break</b> in trend (the <b>break</b> fraction is zero). Here the trend <b>break</b> regressor is dropped from the deterministic component, and standard QD detrended unit root test critical values then apply. We also propose a second procedure that makes use of a formal pretest for a trend <b>break</b> in the series, including a trend <b>break</b> regressor only where the pretest rejects the null of no <b>break.</b> Both procedures ensure that the correctly sized (near-) efficient unit root test that allows (does not allow) for a <b>break</b> in trend is applied in the limit when a trend <b>break</b> does (does not) occur. ...|$|R

That is, the floods resulted by dams <b>break</b> have caused the most hazardous disasters in last two centuries. During a dam <b>break,</b> financial loss is inevitable; however, the death tolls depend on drowned area, population of downstream and the available alarm time. The analysis of dam <b>break</b> is a 2 -step process. In the first step, they analyze the real <b>break.</b> Then, specific models will rout the outflow caused by the <b>break</b> and estimate it in populated areas. If the population exposed to danger, exactly resides downstream a dam, the details of dam <b>break</b> will not affect the results much; however, the flood duration and other key parameters will be significant.

Dominance relations are a generalization of symmetry and conditional symmetry. However, unlike symmetry <b>breaking</b> which is relatively well studied, dominance <b>breaking</b> techniques are not very well understood and are not commonly applied. In this paper, we present formal definitions of dominance <b>breaking,</b> and a generic method for identifying and exploiting dominance relations via dominance <b>breaking</b> constraints. We also give a generic proof of the correctness and compatibility of symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints, conditional symmetry <b>breaking</b> constraints and dominance <b>breaking</b> constraints. ...|$|R
