No painting in the world could have been softer or richer; no shading out of one tint into another could have been more perfect; no work of art of any kind could have been more faultless than this flute, and yet to count the multitude of little fragments of stone of which they swore it was formed would bankrupt any man's arithmetic! I do not think one could have seen where two particles joined each other with eyes of ordinary shrewdness. Certainly we could detect no such blemish. This table-top cost the labor of one man for ten long years, so they said, and it was for sale for thirty-five thousand dollars.|$|E

Still swang the clappers to and fro, When, in the far-spread fields below, I saw a ploughman {{with his team}} Lift to the bells and fix on them His distant eyes, {{as if he would}} Drink in the utmost sound he could; While near him sat his {{children}} three, And in the green grass placidly Played undistracted on, as if What music earthly bells might give Could only faintly stir their dream, And stillness make more lovely seem. Soon night hid horses, children, all In sleep deep and ambrosial; Yet, yet it seemed from star to star, Welling now near, now faint and far, Those echoing bells rang on in dream, And stillness made even lovelier seem.|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a one year project to provide Monash Motorsports FSAE team with vital {{predictions}} regarding how the 2011 450 CC KTM SX-F engine would respond to planned reconstructions and how to optimise different parts of the engine. The phases of operation have been: Learning the software, building the engine, confirming the trustworthiness of the results, rebuilding the engine to predict future results, optimising the simulation and finally providing Monash Motorsport with results and recommendations. The entire engine has been required to be fully defined to be able to run proper simulations. This includes: intake system, engine, exhaust system, physical and environmental properties and also combustion and other sub-models. There were three options to obtain the required data. Either by the engine manufacturer (KTM), manually measuring or using values from example engines included in the simulation software. All three options have been used depending on availability, the time it takes to get hold of topical data and the reliability of the source. By building the engine in the software and simulating the planned changes one step ahead of the team, the simulations have served part of their purpose to work as guidelines to shortening the time of optimisation. Before approaching the real task the stock engine was created, tested and confirmed to work properly in the simulation. By doing so credibility was added to the simulation which are most important if the simulation predictions was to be accepted as guidelines. The stock engine worked as reference and the dynamometer results was used as benchmark together with results from KTM while building the engine. As a next step the simulation engine was upgraded to the geometry of the final design including components not yet created for the real engine. By doing so the simulation engine could take the role of reference and various simulation tests was performed to map out how each new component affect the engine individually and in conjunction with other related new components. The step of rebuilding the simulation engine to correspond to the future race engine was most crucial to be performed properly hence there was no reference to compare the outcome with but rather being the reference for the real engine. The results from the final optimisation advocate that a spherical plenum chamber with the volume of 3. 89 l should be added to the engine. By doing so a buffer of air is created after the restrictor decreasing the negative impact of the FSAE regulated restrictor. Plenum volume was selected with respect to power/torque, throttle response and packaging. Optimum runner length is 170 mm. This is with respect to the narrow engine speed of 7000 – 11000 rpm the car will be driven during competition. It is also necessary to limit the rpm range of maximum interest since different geometries are optimum within different rpm range. The simulation clearly states that a high discharge coefficient at the diffuser-plenum and plenum-runner ends is to prefer. To do so <b>bell-mouths</b> are beneficial and doe smoothen out the air flow. The components that have been delimitated from this work are thous that will be limited affected by the outcome of the simulations. This includes the air filter, throttle body and different shape of the diffuser including the restrictor. These components have already been carefully investigated and optimised by previous thesis students. The FSAE regulation had made it extra challenging to optimise the car by allocating points on different criteria hence it is not only being the first car over the finish line that decide if you win or not. Optimum was therefore defined as the best compromise between all the criteria providing points. A total number of approximately 264 simulations were produced in the process which now lays the foundation for Monash Motorsport engine simulation database for future years to come. This report can serve new engine simulation users as a guideline through all steps to a solid foundation of how to design tests, interpret results and optimise an engine.

50|$|The dam wall {{does not}} have a {{traditional}} spillway to control water height but discharges into a tunnel under the side of the valley, via a large <b>bell-mouth</b> drop-shaft overflow in one corner, a feature not normally seen on Pennine dams ⁬which usually have masonry spillways.|$|E
50|$|The lake is {{approximately}} 60 acre, and is impounded by an earthen dam. The dam contains a <b>bell-mouth</b> service spillway which exits via an overflow tower {{on the dry}} side of the dam. There is also an uncontrolled auxiliary spillway that only functions during high water periods.|$|E

50|$|It was Chapelon's {{theory that}} such a {{multi-stage}} mixing and suction arrangement would be more efficient than the single stage arrangement hitherto popular in steam locomotive draughting, in which an exhaust nozzle simply is fired up {{the middle of the}} stack <b>bell-mouth.</b> It would also ensure a more even flow through all the firetubes, rather than concentrating the suction on one area. The efficiency of the Kylchap system relied on careful proportioning of its components, and perfect alignment and concentricity.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} {{account of}} the British high mast in its fully developed state at Cardington, and its operation, is abridged from Masefield.Mooring masts were developed {{to act as a}} safe open harbour to which airships could be moored or unmoored in any weather, and at which they could receive (hydrogen or helium) gas, fuel, stores and payload.The Cardington mast, completed in 1926, was an eight sided steel girder structure, 200 ft high, tapering from 70 ft diameter at ground level to 26 ft at the passenger platform, 170 ft from the ground. Above the passenger platform was the 30 ft of the conical housing for the mooring gear. A lower platform 142 ft above the ground accommodated searchlights and signalling gear in a gallery 4 ft wide.The top platform, at the height of 170 ft, from which passengers embarked and disembarked to and from the airships, was 40 ft in diameter and encircled by a heavy parapet. The top rail of the parapet formed a track on which a gangway, let down from the airship, ran on wheels to give freedom for the airship to move around the tower as it swung with the wind. An electric passenger lift ran up the centre of the tower, encircled by a stairway to provide foot access.The upper portion of the tower, from the passenger platform upwards, was a circular steel turret surmounted by a truncated cone with its top 23 ft above the passenger platform. A three-part telescopic arm, mounted on gimbals, projected through an opening at the top, free to swing from the vertical in any direction up to 30 degrees of movement. The top of the arm consisted of a bell-shaped cup mounted to rotate on ball bearings.A cable extended through the <b>bell-mouth</b> which, linked to a cable dropped from airship to be moored, enabled the nose of the airship to be drawn down until a cone on the nose locked home into the cup and so secured the airship to the tower. The telescopic arm was then centred, locked in the vertical position, and made free to rotate on a vertical axis so the airship could swing, nose to tower, in any direction of the wind.In the machinery house {{at the base of the}} tower three steam-driven winches operated the hauling gear through drums 5 ft in diameter to give cable hauling speeds of 50 feet a minute.|$|E

The internal flow {{pattern of the}} cube-type intake passage and the vorticity distribution around the <b>bell-mouth</b> of flare tube were analyzed. Four types of antisubmerged vortex devices were designed based on the vortex tubes intensity conservation theorem. The high-speed photography was applied to observe the flow pattern of the cube-type intake passage with 4 types of vortex-elimination devices. The predicted trajectory of submerged vortex was validated by the comparison with the tested results by PIV (particle image velocimetry).
