5|$|In March, Joan has a Marilyn Monroe hairstyle and {{the safe}} at the cinema is broken into. Ahead of the party, Freddie gives Reg {{the use of}} his car, to return unused decorating {{materials}} to Guildford and he takes his father, Reenie and her boyfriend Clayton Cooper (Roger Griffiths) with him. They run out of petrol on the way, leaving Freddie and Joan the only ones at the party. They dance, and Freddie admits that he wanted to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Joan so they could talk about art. They end the night by sleeping together.|$|E
5|$|Standish {{called all}} of the Wessagusset colonists into the stockade for defense. The {{following}} day, several natives including the local chief, Pecksuot, were at Wessagusset. Historical sources give different accounts of the killings. In some manner, four of the natives, including the local chief, {{were in the same}} room as Standish and several of his men. One source, from the 1880s, suggests that it was the natives that arranged to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Standish to allow them to attack the colonist. Others sources state that it was Standish who had invited the natives into the situation on peaceful pretenses. When four of them, including the local chief, were in a room within the village, Standish gave the order to strike, quickly killing Pecksuot with his own knife. Several other natives in the village were attacked next; only one escaped to raise the alarm. As many as five Englishmen were also killed in the brief battle and one native's head was cut off, to be displayed in Plymouth as a warning to others.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Callie {{eventually}} {{confesses to}} Arizona why the date didn't go well: {{they went to}} an expensive restaurant that she couldn't afford because she has been disowned by her father and now she is broke. Arizona tells her they will stay in to eat and they reconcile. Meredith tells Bailey and Derek's idea to Izzie: they give her their wedding. Yang becomes the maid of honor and Meredith serves as Alex's best man. Back at the hospital, Izzie is sad about her hair loss but Alex tells her she doesn't need it to be beautiful. The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as she wants to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her husband.|$|E

500|$|... "Cookalein" [...] is a {{story of}} tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country.

500|$|Webster in turn became {{increasingly}} resentful of Thomas, {{to the point}} that Thomas attempted to persuade friends to stay with her as she did not like to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Webster. It was arranged that Webster would leave Thomas' service on 28 February. Thomas recorded her decision in her last diary entry: [...] "Gave Katherine warning to leave".|$|E
500|$|Aware that a regency was {{becoming}} increasingly unlikely, Conroy and the Duchess began promoting {{the view of}} Victoria as a [...] "weak-minded, frivolous and foolish" [...] girl in need of guidance. While increasing their bullying of the princess, they implied that Victoria desired a regency even if she succeeded later than her majority at eighteen. Victoria was forbidden to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her beloved Lehzen; either the Duchess's ally Lady Flora Hastings or a Conroy sister (now appointed as companions) were required to accompany her.|$|E

The courage of women in some conditions of life surpasses anything that man can do.|$|R
500|$|In {{or before}} 1327 Salisbury married Catherine, {{daughter}} of William de Grandison, 1st Baron Grandison. Two anecdotal stories revolve around Catherine Montagu; in one she {{is identified as}} the [...] "Countess of Salisbury" [...] from whose dropped garter Edward III named the Order of the Garter. In the other, Edward III {{falls in love with}} the countess, and arranges to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her so he can rape her. Neither story is supported by contemporary evidence, and the latter almost certainly is a product of French propaganda.|$|E
500|$|Despite Caroline's {{demands for}} better {{treatment}} {{now that she}} had given birth to the second-in-line to the throne, George restricted her contact with the child, forbidding her to see their daughter except {{in the presence of a}} nurse and governess. [...] Caroline was allowed the usual daily visit which upper class parents paid to their young offspring at this time; she was not allowed any say in the decisions made about Charlotte's care. [...] Sympathetic household staff disobeyed the Prince and allowed Caroline to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> her daughter. [...] George was unaware of this, having little contact with Charlotte himself. [...] Caroline was even bold enough to ride through the streets of London in a carriage with her daughter, to the applause of the crowds.|$|E
500|$|However, all is {{not well}} with the love {{triangle}} as the third act opens. The General sent out news of rewards should Fatinitza be found, and has now received word {{that she has been}} found (much to Julian and Wladimir's confusion). As Lydia lives with him, the General, unaware of Wladimir's love for her, but wanting to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Fatinitza, has promised Lydia in marriage to an old, crippled friend of his, who had the advantage of being available for marriage. He does not want to break his word to his friend, but when Wladimir announces he has promised his [...] "sister" [...] to one of his friends, the General agrees to break Lydia's betrothal if Wladimir will break Fatinitza's.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s BSA {{developed}} its Youth Protection program, {{to educate}} youth, leaders and {{parents about the}} problem as a whole, and to introduce barriers to sexual abuse of children using the Scout program to reach victims. [...] "Two deep" [...] leadership dictates that no adult member [...] can <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> any youth member (other than their own child). [...] Before joining, youth must discuss with their parents a pamphlet on sexual abuse and adults must take youth protection training and, since 2003, new adult members must pass a criminal background check (adults who were already members had to pass a background check by 2008). [...] The Youth Protection Plan from the organization is linked to in a CDC report on such programs.|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, Darryl Braxton was {{introduced}} to the show and The Daily Telegraph reported that he was set to get to know Charlie in a future storyline. Charlie meets Darryl after she comes to ask him to keep his surf gang under control. During an interview with Digital Spy, Peacocke was asked if Darryl likes Charlie romantically and he said, [...] "For a bloke like Brax, Charlie is pretty ideal – she's smart, sexy and is strong enough to take him on. He's all about testing himself and he knows he'll be running a gauntlet if he pursues her. She's got that X-factor he can't ignore." [...] When a fight breaks out at the Surf Club, Charlie arrives to investigate and she asks Darryl to step outside, so they can talk. Darryl misinterprets the situation and believes Charlie just wants to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him, he then kisses her. Charlie is [...] "horrified" [...] and she arrests Darryl for assaulting a police officer. Peacocke revealed that after the arrest, [...] "things will develop dangerously" [...] between Charlie and Darryl and that it will be [...] "tense to watch!" [...] Charlie is put under pressure from the community to find a more serious crime with which to charge Darryl and his gang. She believes that he is selling stolen alcohol to Angelo, but everything checks out and Darryl come to the belief that the kiss has [...] "sparked something in Charlie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with the}} House Chaplain, the Senate Chaplain is {{responsible}} for overseeing the Capitol Prayer Room, located near the Capitol Rotunda. Dedicated in 1955, there are no worship services held in the room, nor is it normally open to the public. [...] Instead, as described by Sam Rayburn during the room's dedication, {{it is a place}} for members [...] "who want to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> their God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contemplative {{prayer is}} a silent attentiveness which looks at God by contemplating and adoring his attributes. St. Teresa {{describes}} Contemplative prayer [...] as [...] "...nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him who we know loves us.” In this inner prayer {{we can still}} meditate, but our attention is fixed on the Lord himself. Contemplation, like all prayer, is pure gift, and not anything one can achieve.|$|E
2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{taught that}} the servant left Haran at noon, and took Rebekah and her nurse Deborah {{riding on the}} camels. So that the servant would not <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> the maiden Rebekah by night, the earth once again {{contracted}} before them, and in three hours, they came to Hebron {{at the time of}} the afternoon prayer (that is, at 3 p.m.).

2500|$|Teresa {{is one of}} the {{foremost}} writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology is unique. In all her writings on this subject she deals with her personal experiences. Her deep insight and analytical gifts helped her to explain them clearly. Her definition was used in the Catechism of the Catholic Church: [...] "Contemplative prayer [...] in my opinion is nothing else than a close sharing between friends; it means taking time frequently to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him who we know loves us." [...] She used a metaphor of mystic prayer as watering a garden throughout her writings.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Thanksgiving", Noah invites Claire to {{his first}} Thanksgiving dinner so he won't <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> Sandra and her new boyfriend. At the grocery store, he runs into Lauren Gilmore, whom he jokingly admits to be [...] "stalking"; she then helps Noah shopping. Once Claire arrives at Noah's apartment, Claire notices Lauren, {{referring}} to her as Noah's date, which he refutes; once Sandra and Doug arrive, Sandra mistakes Lauren for a maid; after correction, Sandra believes Lauren to be Noah's date too. During dinner, Claire confesses her decision to drop out college, which Noah is immediately opposed to. After Claire cuts herself and Doug faints, she and Noah discuss the clippings on Noah's wall; Noah insists Samuel and the carnival are dangerous and shows her the compass. Gretchen then appears, and tells Claire she was invited by Noah as Claire was feeling bad those days. Once everyone is leaving, Noah assures Claire she has many options, unknowing she later takes this advice to visit the carnival. Before leaving, Lauren asks Noah {{to go out and}} watch a movie some day.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1992, Ferguson {{was awarded}} $26,250 for his workers' {{compensation}} claim against Ademco Security Group. In April 1993, Ferguson insisted {{he was still}} in pain and demanded the case be reopened so he could get more money for medical treatment. In the following weeks, he visited a Manhattan law firm for a consultation. Lauren Abramson, an attorney with the firm, said she immediately felt uncomfortable and threatened by Ferguson. She asked a law clerk to sit in on the meeting because [...] "I did not want to <b>be</b> <b>alone</b> <b>with</b> him", something Abramson said she had never done before. Although Ferguson was neatly dressed during the consultation, he acted strangely and identified himself by a false name before providing his real name. Months later, Ferguson made threatening calls to members of the firm, claiming they were discriminating against him. In one of the calls, he made reference to a massacre that occurred in California. The calls prompted the lawyers to start locking their inner office doors out of fear. Ferguson tried to have his workers' compensation claim reopened by the New York State Workers' Compensation Board, which reexamined the case due to his persistence, but it was ultimately rejected. The board placed Ferguson on a list of potentially dangerous people security guards were to watch out for.|$|E
