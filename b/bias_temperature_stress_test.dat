40|$|The {{filtered}} cathodic vacuum arc (FCVA) {{technique is}} a well established deposition method for wear resistant mechanical coatings. More recently, this method has attracted attention for growing ZnO based transparent conducting films. However, the potential of FCVA deposition to prepare ZnO layers for electronic devices is largely unexplored. This thesis addresses the use of FCVA deposition for the fabrication of active ZnO based electronic devices. The structural, electrical and optical characteristics of unintentionally doped ZnO films grown on different sapphire substrates were systematically investigated. The potential of FCVA to grow both polar and non-polar ZnO films was demonstrated. The resulting films showed considerable promise for device applications with properties including high transparency(> 90 %), moderate intrinsic carrier concentrations (10 ¹⁷ - 10 ¹⁹ cm⁻³), electron mobilities up to 110 cm⁻²/Vs, low surface roughness (< 5 nm) and well-structured photoluminescence. Post-growth annealing in oxygen at temperatures up to 800 C produced significant improvements in the electronic and optical properties of these films, due {{to the formation of}} larger grains with lower inter-grain potential barriers. Silver oxide (AgOᵪ) and iridium oxide (IrOᵪ) Schottky diodes fabricated on annealed FCVA ZnO films showed ideality factors as low as 1. 20, barrier heights up to 0. 85 eV and high sensitivity to ultraviolet light (up to ̴ 10 ⁻⁵ at - 2 V). Transparent and opaque MESFETs fabricated on these films showed well defined field effect characteristics, channel mobilities up to 70 cm⁻²/Vs and insensitivity to 1 mW/cm⁻² visible light. These devices were further subjected to extensive <b>bias</b> and <b>temperature</b> <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> MESFET stability appeared to be strongly dependent on Schottky gate type, bias conditions and ZnO film morphology. Positive bias stress of AgOᵪ gated devices resulted in irreversible damage, that is thought to be due to Ag electromigration across the gate interface. Mapping of the surface potential of the ZnO channel material with Kelvin probe force microscopy suggested a strong relationship between the defect density at grain boundaries and both channel mobility and current stability. Interval growth techniques were found to reduce the density of defects at grain boundaries and produced MESFETs with higher current stability. IrOᵪ gated devices showed superior <b>bias</b> stability and <b>temperature</b> resilience from 25 C- 195 C...|$|R

It is shown that these species are likely not released from the Si substrate.

It is found that Vth shift increases with time, like a power law, with an exponent that decreases {{with the amount of}} Hf in the HfSiON layer. Within the reaction-diffusion model for negative <b>bias</b> <b>temperature</b> instabilities, this finding suggests that the transport of hydrogen species in the gate stack is slower (i. e., more dispersive) in Hf-rich silicate layers. This result is also consistent with the observed increase in activation energy related to the ho ping of the species in the gate stack with the p Hf content, extracted from the temperature acceleration of V-th shifts. It is also found that negative <b>bias</b> <b>temperature</b> instabilities are reduced in layers with Hf content of about 50 at. %. This ''optimum" is tentatively attributed to the interplay between the slower transport of the hydrogen species and the larger density of interface and bulk defects in the gate stack when the Hf content increases.

40|$|Exhibiting high {{electron}} mobility compared to amorphous Silicon, transparency in the visible spectrum, and compatibility with large area and flexible substrate applications, the semiconductor Zinc Oxide (ZnO) {{has become a}} major focus of research. This work investigates insertion of high dielectric constant (high-k) insulators into ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) in an effort to reduce the threshold voltage and increase performance for next-generation devices. Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT), Barium Strontium Titanate (BST), Aluminum Oxide (Al 2 O 3), and Hafnium Oxide (HfO 2) were selected for high-k investigation. Metal - Insulator - ZnO capacitors revealed that each material’s high-k qualities can be integrated with ZnO, but PZT and BST show poor gate leakage characteristics, possibly due to small conduction band offsets with ZnO. Al 2 O 3 and HfO 2 emerged as the most robust materials, however, each device exhibited clockwise hysteresis, which is indicative of interface charge. Devices also exhibited translational instability with respect to gate voltage. TFTs were fabricated with ZnO/high-k film stacks. In each case, the high-k dielectric effectively reduced the dielectric equivalent oxide thickness and thus threshold voltage. HfO 2 emerged as the best candidate for ZnO/high-k devices. Admittance Spectroscopy was found to be the most comprehensive technique to measure interface charge density in ZnO/HfO 2 films and values are reported in this work. Bias - Temperature - Instabilities were investigated where positive <b>bias</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>stress</b> instability (PBTI) analyses reveal the dominant instability mechanism is carrier injection into the HfO 2.

40|$|Human {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) is {{the most}} important viral cause of serious pediatric respiratory illness worldwide. Currently, the most promising live-attenuated vaccine candidate is a temperature-sensitive (ts) cDNA-derived virus named rA 2 cp 248 / 404 / 1030 SH, in reference to its set of attenuating mutations. In a previous clinical study, more than one-third of postvaccination nasal wash isolates exhibited partial loss of the ts phenotype. Most of this instability appeared to be due to rever-sion at a missense point mutation called 1030. This 1030 mutation is a single-nucleotide tyrosine-to-asparagine substitution at position 1321 (Y 1321 N) of the polymerase L protein that contributes to the ts and attenuation phenotypes of the vaccine candi-date. The goals of the present study were to identify a reversion-resistant codon at position 1321 conferring a comparable level of attenuation and to use this to develop a genetically stable version of the vaccine virus. Wemodified wild-type (wt) RSV to insert each of the 20 possible amino acids at position 1321; 19 viruses were recoverable. We also investigated small deletions at or near this position, but these viruses were not recoverable. Phenotypic analysis identified alternative attenuating amino acids for posi-tion 1321.
