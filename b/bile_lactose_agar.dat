When the FCA method was compared with standard VRBL for enumeration of fecal coliforms, based on counting carried out on 170 different food samples, results {{were not significantly different}} (P > 0. 05). Based on 203 typical identified colonies selected as found on VRBL and FCA, the latter medium appears to allow the enumeration of more true fecal coliforms and has higher performance in certain ways (specificity, sensitivity, and negative and positive predictive values) than VRBL. Most colonies clearly identified on both media were E. coli and H. alvei, a non-fecal coliform. Therefore, the replacement of fecal coliform enumeration by E. coli enumeration to estimate food sanitary quality should be recommended...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to isolate enterococci and Escherichia coli from faeces {{collected}} from commercial and communal pigs, and to characterise these isolates using antibiotic susceptibility profiles. Enterococcus selective agar and eosin methylene blue <b>lactose</b> <b>agar</b> were used for enterococci and E. coli isolation, respectively. Gram staining, API 20 Strep and API 20 E were used for identification of enterococci and E. coli, respectively. Three-hundred-and-four enterococci and 208 E. coli were identified. The most prevalent enterococci species were Enterococcus faecium (58 %) and Enterococcus gallinarum (23 %). A large proportion of enterococci (62. 5 % to 100 %) and E. coli (88. 5 to 100 %) were resistant to erythromycin, oxytetracycline and sulphamethoxazole. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found and PCR analysis for vanA, vanB and vanC- 1 were all negative. Less than 7 % of enterococci were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin, whereas 45 % of E. coli isolates were resistant to the same antibiotics.

In the study 191 samples of axone collected from 7 tribes (44 Angami, 12 Ao, 36 Chakesang, 3 kuki, 62 Lotha, 2 Pochury and 32 Sema) were analyzed. The pH of matured axone (5. 7 to 8. 62) was significantly (p¡ 0. 001) higher than fresh (4. 56 to 7. 54) and dried axone (5. 58 to 8. 54). The pH of Sema axone (8. 02) was significantly (p, 0. 001) higher than average pH of axone of other tribes. Total aerobic mesophilic plate count (TAMPC) of axone ranged between 6. 44 Log 10 cfu/g and 12. 98 Log 10 cfu/g. The aerobic endospore count (AEC) in axone (5. 6 Log 10 to 10. 55 Log 10 cfu/ g) had strong correlation with TAMPC (r, 0. 41) and was the major constituent of it.

40|$|A {{strain of}} Escherichia coli {{in which the}} lacZ gene was fused to the bioA {{promoter}} was constructed. Colonies of this strain formed Lac+ colonies on low-biotin agar (1. 6 to 4. 1 nM) and Lac− colonies on high-biotin agar (41 nM). This lac-bio fusion strain was used to study {{the question of whether}} cells growing on the biotin vitamers d-biotin-d-sulfoxide (BDS) and dethiobiotin (DTB) generate enough biotin to give maximal repression of β-galactosidase synthesis. Repression by high concentrations (400 nM) of BDS was almost maximal (about 96 %), whereas DTB repression reached a saturation level of about 80 % with increasing DTB concentrations. The levels of repression obtained with both vitamers were sufficient to cause the colonies to appear Lac−. When the lac-bio fusion was transduced into lines carrying mutations (bis) that prevent reduction of BDS to biotin, the transductants were not repressed by added BDS. Repression by BDS is unlikely to result from accumulation of extracellular biotin-related substances because (i) washed bis+ cells were not detectably derepressed when transferred into medium containing BDS and (ii) washed bis cells were not detectably repressed when transferred into medium in which bis+ cells had grown. <b>Lactose</b> <b>agar</b> plates containing high concentrations of DTB or BDS comprise an efficient selective medium for bioB or bis mutants and were used to isolate spontaneous mutations of these genes.

40|$|The name B. coli mutabile was {{employed}} by Neisser (1906) to designate a non-lactose-fermenting coliform organism which suddenly acquired {{the capacity to}} ferment lactose. The muta-tion-like variation became manifest through the formation of secondary colonies on <b>lactose</b> <b>agar.</b> Subcultures from a secon-dary colony proved to be active fermenters while similar cultures from {{the remainder of the}} colony had no such capacity. Other workers have since shown that this mode of variation occurs {{in a wide variety of}} bacterial species and that various carbon com-pounds may be involved. Since the term "mutabile " denotes variation by mutation, Burri (1910) objected to it and proposed the name, "imperfec-tum, " for a form which varied to sucrose in a similar manner. While Burri's contention that the term is a misnomer may be well founded, it has been so widely used that it will doubtless survive. Our knowledge of bacterial variation has been extended through the study of various mutabile strains but there are still differences of opinion which are difficult, if not impossible, to harmonize. Previous workers have based their conclusions on experiments conducted with complex media containing peptone as well as the carbon compound to which variation occurs.

The emergence of drug resistance and particularly the Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production by Escherichia coli and methicillin resistance in Staphylococci, limits the choice of antimicrobials. Materials and Methods: Patients in different stages of pregnancy with or without symptoms of urinary tract infection attending the antenatal clinic of obstetrics and gynaecology were screened for significant bacteriuria, by standard loop method on 5 % sheep blood <b>agar</b> and teepol <b>lactose</b> <b>agar.</b> Isolates were identified by using standard biochemical tests and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using Kirby Bauer disc diffusion method. Results: A total of 4290 (51. 2 %) urine samples from pregnant females showed growth on culture. Prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria 3210 (74. 8 %) was higher than symptomatic UTI 1080 (25. 2 %). Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen accounting for 1800 (41. 9 %) of the urinary isolates. Among the gram-positive cocci, coagulase negative species of Staphylococci 270 (6. 4 %) were the most common pathogen. Significantly high resistance was shown by the gram negative bacilli as well as gram positive cocci to the β-lactam group of antimicrobials, flouroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Most alarming was the presence of ESBL in 846 (47 %) isolates of Escherichia coli and 344 (36. 9 %) isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, along with the presence of methicillin resistance in 41 % of Staphylococcus species and high-level aminoglycoside resistance in 45 (30 %) isolates of Enterococcus species. Glycopeptides and carbepenems were the only group of drugs to which all the strains of gram positive cocci and gram negative bacilli were uniformly sensitive, respectively. Conclusions: Regular screening should be done for the presence of symptomatic or asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy and specific guidelines should be issued for testing antimicrobial susceptibility with safe drugs in pregnant women so that these can be used for the treatment. For empirical treatment cefoperazone-sulbactum can be recommended, which is a safe drug, covering both gram positive and gram negative organisms and with a good sensitivity...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} revertants, {{selected}} on <b>lactose</b> minimal <b>agar</b> medium, of the Escherichia coli lacZ(am) strain that {{was first used}} by Cairns and his colleagues to demonstrate the phenomenon of ``adaptive mutation. '' We have found, by performing appropriate reconstruction studies, {{that most of the}} late-arising Lac(+) revertants of this lac amber strain (appearing as colonies in 3 - 5 days) are slow-growing ochre suppressor mutants that probably existed in the culture prior to plating and cannot, therefore, be classified as ``adaptive. '' The appearance of a small number of fast-growing, late-arising Lac(+) revertants may result from residual cell growth and turnover or from phenomena related {{to the fact that the}} lacZ(am) mutation in strain SM 195 is carried on an F' plasmid. Thus, the appearance of late-arising revertants in this lacZ(am) system does not provide convincing evidence that selective conditions specifically increase the rate of occurrence of favorable mutations...|$|R

40|$|Para o conhecimento do estado de poluição bacteriológica dos rios Anil e Bacanga, Estado do Maranhão (Brasil), coletaram-se amostras de água em 5 pontos, no Rio Anil, e 3 pontos, no Rio Bacanga, mensalmente, durante 12 meses, nas fases enchente e vazante da maré. Foram determinados números de bactérias totais/ml; índice de coliformes/ 100 ml e índice de coliformes fecais/ 100 ml, em ágar simples, caldo lactosado, verde brilhante - bile e E. C. Os resultados mostraram que os índices bacterianos de poluição dos rios sofrem variações sazonais, diretamente relacionadas às fases da maré. As localidades que apresentaram maiores concentrações bacterianas foram as nascentes. As águas destes rios, de acordo com o padrão ditado pelo Ministério do Interior, demonstraram alto grau de poluição microbiana de origem fecal. Sampling of liquids {{was carried}} out monthly at both high and low tide, for one year, at 5 sites on the Anil river and at 3 sites on the Bacanga river, for {{bacteriological}} pollution study. Total viable bacteria/ 100 ml, MPN (Most Probable Numbers) of coliforms/ 100 ml and MPN fecal coliforms/ 100 ml were determined {{by the use of}} nutrient <b>agar,</b> <b>lactose</b> broth, brilliant green - <b>lactose</b> <b>bile</b> broth and E C broth. The results indicated that both rivers contained a higher bacterial concentration at the sources and showed a seasonal bacteriological pollution variation directly related to the tidal phases. According to the Brazilian Ministry of the Interior's standards, the water of both rivers presented a high degree of microbial pollution...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} methods {{available}} for demonstration of enterococci contained in samples of foods and for determination of their numbers by {{the table of}} M. P. N. The author undertook a study of basic problems involved {{in one of the}} methods by which the numbers of enterococci are determined {{on the basis of the}} result of incubation of the culture of a confirmative medium which has been inoculated with the culture of a presumptive medium generally used to reveal the presence of coliform organisms. The results of the study are summarized as follows: (1) Enterococci of some strains are easily affected by sodium azide; if samples examined for enterococci contain them in minute amounts, multiplication of the micro-organisms would be inhibited. In order to obtain an accurate and reliable result, any inhibitor should not be added to the presumptive medium so that all varieties of enterococci may be allowed to multiply. (2) Experiments revealed that, when lactose broth was used as the presumptive medium, and a medium made by adding 0. 03 % sodium azide and 0. 00006 % ethyl violet to dextrose broth was used as the confirmative medium, the result was far better than would have been the case if any other methods had been used. The presence of enterococci was proved by morphologic and taxonomic study in nearly all the tubes which had been found positive by the above tests. We might, therefore, be justified in doing without morphologic and taxonomic study in some instances. (3) The method developed by the author makes it possible to carry on the experiments on enterococci side by side with those on coliform organisms at the same time; lactose broth is used as the presumptive medium for the two types of organisms, while brilliant green <b>bile</b> <b>lactose</b> broth and B. T. B. ethyl violet azide dextrose broth (Miyabayashi) are used as the confirmative media for coliform organisms and enterococci, respectively; and the final examinations are performed by the method specific to each type of organisms. It is to the credit of this method that both enterococci and coliform organisms could be examined at the same time using the same specimens, and that little technical complexity is involved in the procedure...|$|R
40|$|Bacteriophage-resistant dairy streptococci were {{obtained}} following conjugal transfer of pTR 2030 from a lactose-negative donor, Streptococcus lactis TEK 12, to lactose-positive recipient strains, Streptococcus cremoris LMA 13 and 924 and S. lactis LMA 12. Fast acid-producing, phage-resistant transconjugants were selected by challenge with homologous phage on fast-slow differential <b>agar</b> or <b>lactose</b> indicator <b>agar.</b> Acquisition of pTR 2030 by the transconjugants {{was confirmed by}} DNA-DNA hybridization. Resistance of transconjugants to homologous phage was complete. Curing or deletion of pTR 2030 in the transconjugants confirmed that phage resistance was due to pTR 2030 acquisition and not to coincident background mutation. Phage-sensitive pTR 2030 deletion derivatives of LMA 12 transconjugants were isolated in vivo. The HindIII fragment B of pTR 2030 was subcloned into pBR 322 to yield a recombinant plasmid, pMET 2, useful {{as a source of}} pTR 2030 DNA. A specific, chemically synthesized oligomer useful as a pTR 2030 probe was derived from the sequence of a small portion of pTR 2030. The conjugal strategy presented here was effective in yielding fast acid-producing, phage-resistant S. cremoris and S. lactis strains without the use of antibiotic resistance markers and without interfering with the acid-producing ability of the recipient strain...|$|R
