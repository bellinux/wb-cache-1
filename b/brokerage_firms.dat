5000|$|Generally, selling away is a {{violation}} of securities regulations and the firm's compliance procedures by which its brokers must abide. Further, such [...] "outside" [...] investments may be in themselves fraudulent. The regulatory basis for selling away cases is found in NASD rule 3040 and FINRA rule 3270 (formerly NASD rule 3030). Rule 3270 provides that a <b>brokerage</b> <b>firm</b> adviser may not engage in any outside business activity unless he has provided prompt written notice to his or her <b>brokerage</b> <b>firm.</b> Rule 3040 provides that a <b>brokerage</b> <b>firm</b> adviser must not engage in private securities transactions (that is, selling away) and states the procedures that a <b>brokerage</b> <b>firm</b> must follow to approve of such investments. Once approved, the <b>brokerage</b> <b>firm</b> must supervise these private securities transactions.|$|R

25|$|Now, Chengdu is {{not only}} the gateway of Western China for foreign {{financial}} institutions, but also a booming town for Chinese domestic financial firms. The Chinese monetary authority, People's Bank of China (China's central bank), set its southwest China headquarters in Chengdu City. In addition, almost all domestic banks and securities <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> located their regional headquarters or branches in Chengdu. At the same time, the local financial firms of Chengdu are strengthening their presences nationally, notably, Huaxi Securities, Sinolink Securities and Bank of Chengdu. Moreover, on top of banks and <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms,</b> the flourish of local economy lured more and more financial service firms to the city to capitalise on the economic growth. Grant Thornton, KPMG, PWC and Ernst & Young are the four global accountants and business advisers with West China headoffices in the city.|$|E

Bridges organized meetings between Gardner and branch managers at the major stock <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> that offered training programs—such as Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, E.F.

25|$|Wealth {{management}} can {{be provided}} by large corporate entities, independent financial advisers or multi-licensed portfolio managers who design services to focus on high-net-worth clients. Large banks and large brokerage houses create segmentation marketing-strategies to sell both proprietary and non-proprietary products and services to investors designated as potential high-net-worth clients. Independent wealth-managers use their experience in estate planning, risk management, and their affiliations with tax and legal specialists, to manage the diverse holdings of high-net-worth clients. Banks and <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> use advisory talent-pools to aggregate these same services.|$|E
25|$|When the Civil War {{ended in}} 1865 he {{returned}} to Memphis, Tennessee, where he resumed his pre-war business affairs. In 1866 he married Hayes Dunn, with whom he would have three daughters, and shortly thereafter changed the spelling of his name to Fizer, reasoning {{that was the way}} it had sounded all his life. Three streets in Memphis were later named after him, all using this spelling. He also became a partner in a large and successful cotton <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> and actively participated in local Democratic politics.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{securities}} industry, arbitration {{has long}} been the preferred method of resolving disputes between <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms,</b> and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms,</b> other than Securities class action claims, are resolved in arbitration. The SEC has come under fire from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues. The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.|$|E
25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. <b>Brokerage</b> <b>firms,</b> in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, {{which could not}} be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss {{of billions of dollars in}} assets.|$|E

25|$|Online brokers in the US {{are often}} {{referred}} to as discount brokers but in Europe and Asia many so-called online brokers work with high-net-worth individuals. Their popularity is attributable to the speed and ease of their online order entry, and to fees and commissions significantly lower than those of full service <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> within the US. Two types of online brokerages have emerged in the US in the mid-2000s: those offering direct-access trading on exchanges, and those that route orders to market maker firms to have their orders filled.|$|E
25|$|In an {{emissions}} trading system, permits may be traded by emitters who {{are liable to}} hold {{a sufficient number of}} permits in system. Some analysts argue that allowing others to participate in trading, e.g., private <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms,</b> can allow for better management of risk in the system, e.g., to variations in permit prices (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). It may also improve the efficiency of system. According to Bashmakov et al.. (2001), regulation of these other entities may be necessary, as is done in other financial markets, e.g., to prevent abuses of the system, such as insider trading.|$|E
25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that retail investors were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where retail investors were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E

25|$|Stock prices {{dropped by}} 20 percent from September 24 to October 1, while trade was minimal. Between January 1870 to September 1870, only 4 {{million shares of}} stock were exchanged. Dozens of <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> went bankrupt, while those who bought paper gold from Fisk's gold room went unpaid. Farmers, who {{constituted}} 50 percent of the country's workforce, suffered the worst; wheat prices on the Chicago trade fell from $1.40 to $0.77 cents a bushel. Corn dropped from $0.95 to $0.68 cents; while other commodities such as rye, oats, and barley had similar losses. The New York Tribune reported that goods ready for export could not be shipped. American agriculture went into steep decline and would be plagued by tight money and dwindling markets for years to come. Grant's and Boutwell's actions to break the Gold Ring, however, kept the Wall Street panic from growing into a national depression. Butterfield was allowed to resign from the U.S. Treasury without an investigation in October, 1869.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans {{began as}} a strategically-located trading entrepôt, and it remains, above all, a crucial {{transportation}} hub and distribution center for waterborne commerce. The Port is the fifth-largest in the United States based on cargo volume and second-largest in the state after the Port of South Louisiana. It is the twelfth-largest in the U.S. based on cargo value. The Port of South Louisiana, also located in the New Orleans area, is the world's busiest in terms of bulk tonnage. When combined with Port of New Orleans, it forms the 4th-largest port system in volume. Many shipbuilding, shipping, logistics, freight forwarding and commodity <b>brokerage</b> <b>firms</b> either are based in metropolitan New Orleans or maintain a local presence. Examples include Intermarine, Bisso Towboat, Northrop Grumman Ship Systems, Trinity Yachts, Expeditors International, Bollinger Shipyards, IMTT, International Coffee Corp, Boasso America, Transoceanic Shipping, Transportation Consultants Inc., Dupuy Storage & Forwarding and Silocaf. The largest coffee-roasting plant in the world, operated by Folgers, is located in New Orleans East.|$|E

If that occurred it would send [...] TC shares plummeting, devastating Moore and Schley and triggering further panic in the market.|$|E
