Storyboards and scripts for seasons 1 and 2 had his {{original}} names as [...] "Puff Puff" [...] and [...] "Swanson" [...] respectively. In [...] "AWESOM-O", he says his <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> September 11, referencing the terrorist attacks of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, another sign of his misfortunes. He learns from his parents in [...] "Going Native" [...] that he was born on the island of Kaua'i. During the show's first 58 episodes (1997 through Season 4 episode [...] "4th Grade" [...] in 2000), Butters and the other main child characters were in the third grade. He lives in South Park as the only child of Stephen and Linda Stotch, from whom he perpetually faces the looming prospect of being grounded and abused. When the character of Kenny McCormick was temporarily written off the show near the end of Season 5, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, and Eric Cartman allow Butters into their group as the [...] "fourth friend", a role he continued to fill until midway through season 6, namely, the episode [...] "Professor Chaos". During this period, the boys would often take advantage of Butters' mild temperament by making him a stooge in their own personal schemes. The three eventually ousted him in favor of Tweek Tweak.|$|E

6000|$|... “The {{fact that}} we’ve both {{forgotten}} them proves {{that they are}} important,” said Clovis; “you must have noticed that it’s always the important things that one forgets, while the trivial, unnecessary facts of life stick in one’s memory. There’s my cousin, Editha Clubberley, for instance; I can never forget that her <b>birthday</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the 12th of October. It’s a matter of utter indifference to me on what date her birthday falls, or whether she was born at all; either fact seems to me absolutely trivial, or unnecessary—I’ve heaps of other cousins to go on with. On the other hand, when I’m staying with Hildegarde Shrubley I can never remember the important circumstance whether her first husband got his unenviable reputation on the Turf or the Stock Exchange, and that uncertainty rules Sport and Finance out of the conversation at once. One can never mention travel, either, because her second husband had to live permanently abroad.” ...|$|E
