50|$|The term 'self build' is {{specifically}} {{used in the}} UK and Ireland when an individual obtains a <b>building</b> <b>plot</b> and then builds their own home on that plot.

50|$|The first {{town house}} built by Victor Horta was the Maison Autrique. This {{dwelling}} was already innovative for its {{application of a}} novel 'Art Nouveau' decorative scheme that didn't include references to other historical styles. However the floor plan and spatial composition of the Maison Autrique remained rather traditional. On the deep and narrow <b>building</b> <b>plot</b> the rooms were organised according to a traditional scheme used in most Belgian town houses at that time. It consisted of a suite of rooms {{on the left side}} of the <b>building</b> <b>plot</b> flanked by a rather narrow entrance hall with stairs and a corridor that led to a small garden at the back. From the three room suite only the first and the last had windows so that the middle room (mostly used as a dining room) was rather gloomy.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, {{until the}} mid-20th century, {{the back yard}} of a {{property}} would traditionally contain a fowl run, outhouse, vegetable patch, and woodheap.

But, since the 1990s, the trend in Australian suburban development has been for back yards to disappear as the dwellings now occupy almost all of the <b>building</b> <b>plot.</b>|$|E
