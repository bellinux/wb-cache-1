The event study aims at identifying whether abnormal returns to the <b>bidding</b> <b>company</b> are made in the time period subsequent to the deal announcement. The data used consists of publicly available share price data and market data. The data sample used has been thoroughly screened in order to ensure that no other events interfere with the effects of an M&A announcement on the returns during the examined time period. The companies included in the sample were randomly selected within a time horizon of 5 years. The time horizon was chosen to avoid the share price slumps stemming directly from the financial crisis in 2007 / 2008 and thereby causing a distortion of the data. In conclusion it can be seen that the findings to not depict cumulatively significant abnormal returns to acquiring companies within the short-, midor long-run event window. Even though 5 out of 34 companies in the sample yield significant cumulative abnormal returns, 4 out of those 5 are negative.

Therefore, this research summarized main risk which resulted from <b>bidding</b> <b>company</b> and target company. Methodology is based on Piotroski''s(2000) F-Score model, additionally adding some risk factors as MA_Score, expecting to be a reference for risk level of every M&A cases. The second segment discuss whether market return, interest rate, volatilities of net trading from Institutional Investors, and volatilities of margin buy and sell volumes have influences on M&A arbitrage profit. First, for all samples, there is no profit in M&A arbitraging. But separate whole samples into three parts, discovering that in Stage I and Stage II the return is negative, and in Stage III the arbitrage return would be 19 %. And the regression results revealed that all variables do not have significant effects on M&A arbitrage profit before meeting of shareholders. After meeting of shareholders, market return, volatilities of margin buy and sell volumes have significant effects on M&A arbitrage profit, it also means that the market is inefficiency. 本研究主要分析併購所產生的風險，並探討影響併購套利報酬的因素，樣本為 1999 年到 2009 年在台灣發生的併購案。 併購案從宣告日開始到基準日結束之間，平均有半年的時間，期間會有許多因素會影響到併購案的成敗，本研究整理出幾項主要的併購風險，有來自主併公司的風險也有來自被併公司的風險，參考Piotroski（ 2000 ）的F_Score模型再加入併購風險因子成為MA_Score來分析併購風險。 利用迴規模型探討大盤報酬率、利率、三大法人買賣超變動率與散戶的融資券變動率等總體因素是否會影響到併購套利報酬。實證結果發現，全部樣本的平均套利報酬率為 0 %，但分三段期間探討，發現Stage I與Stage II的套利報酬率是負值，而Stage III產生正的套利報酬率，年報酬率有 19 %。另外，股東會召開前，所有變數皆不顯著，市場是有效率的；股東會之後，顯著的變數是大盤報酬率與散戶的融資融券變動率，表示市場處於非理性狀態。目錄 第一章 緒論	 1 第一節	研究動機	 1 第二節	研究目的	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 第一節 併購風險	 3 第二節 併購套利報酬率	 4 第三節 機構投資人交易對股價報酬率的影響	 4 第三章 研究方法與設計	 6 第一節 併購風險分析	 6 第二節 併購套利報酬分析	 9 第四章 實證分析	 13 第一節 併購風險分析	 13 第二節 併購套利報酬分析	 14 第三節 相關性分析	 16 第五章 結論與建議	 17 第一節 結論	 17 第二節 建議	 18 參考資料	 1...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: In this thesis, I {{study the}} effects that {{including}} a reverse termination fee, which is a termination fee payable by the <b>bidding</b> <b>company,</b> have on mergers & acquisitions (M&A) outcomes. In more detail, I examine how including a reverse termination fee affects premiums paid to target shareholders, bidder and target company cumulative abnormal returns around the deal announcement date and deal completion. Furthermore, by dividing the reverse termination fee deals into sub-samples according to fee size, I examine whether {{the size of the}} reverse termination fee (measured as a percentage of transaction value) affects deal premiums and cumulative abnormal returns. Finally, I study what factors explain the inclusion of a reverse termination fee in an M&A transaction. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The dataset consists of 2630 M&A deals, where both the bidder and target company are based in the United States, occurring between 1990 and 2012. To be included in the sample, the transaction value must be greater than $ 10 million and the bidder must seek a majority stake in the target company. The M&A deal data is obtained from Securities Data Corporation (SDC) and the stock price data and financial data are from Center for Research in Securities Prices (CRSP) and COMPUSTAT, respectively. To test the hypotheses, I employ several regressions using both Ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic models. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The main findings of the thesis are five-folded. Firstly, the mean and median premiums paid to target shareholders are smaller in transactions that contain a reverse termination fee. However, after controlling for several control variables the premiums are not statistically significantly smaller. Secondly, the cumulative abnormal returns for both bidder and target companies are statistically significantly smaller around the deal announcement date. Thirdly, inclusion of a reverse termination fee only increases the probability of completing a transaction by 0. 1 %. Fourthly, target termination fees, stock financing {{and the size of the}} target company explain the Fifthly, the reverse termination fee size (measured as a percentage of the transaction value) affects M&A outcomes.

40|$|Sustainable {{production}} and consumption have become more important internationally, {{which has led to}} the transformation of market structures and competitive situations into the direction of servitisation. This means that manufacturing companies are forced to compete through the supply of services as opposed to products. Particularly the suppliers of long-life products such as submarines and airplanes no longer simply sell these products but provide their capability or availability. Companies such as Rolls-Royce Engines achieve 60 % of their revenue through selling a service rather than the engine itself. For a manufacturing company, the shift towards being a service provider means that they usually have to bid for service contracts, sometimes competitively. In the context of competitive bidding, the decision makers face various uncertainties that influence their decision. Ignoring these uncertainties or their influences can result in problems such as the generation of too little profit or even a loss or the exposure to financial risks. Raising the decision maker’s awareness of the uncertainties in the form of e. g. a decision matrix, expressing the trade-off between the probability of winning the contract and the probability of making a profit, aims at integrating these factors in the decision process. The outcome is to enable the <b>bidding</b> <b>company</b> to make a more informed decision. This was the focus of the research presented in this thesis. The aim of this research was to support the pricing decision by defining a process for modelling the influencing uncertainties and including them in a decision matrix depicting the trade-off between the probability of winning the contract and the probability of making a profit. Three empirical studies are described and the associated decision process and influencing uncertainties are discussed. Based on these studies, a conceptual framework was defined which depicts the influencing factors on a pricing decision at the bidding stage and the uncertainties within these. The framework was validated with a case study in contract bidding where the uncertainties were modelled and included in a decision matrix depicting the probability of winning the contract and the probability of making a profit. The main contributions of this research are the identification of the uncertainties influencing a pricing decision, the depiction of these in a conceptual framework, a method for ascertaining how to model these uncertainties and assessing the use of such an approach via an industrial case study.

40|$|Mergers and Acquisitions(M&A) {{are major}} {{strategic}} initiatives undertaken by many organisations. The choice of payment type in (M&A) { Cash, Stock Debt, {{or a combination}} of these { can have a substantial impact on the successful completion of the transaction. In this thesis, we provide an empirical investigation into the determinants of the Number of Mergers by introducing the Announced Total Value (ATV) according to the payment type investment characteristics of the companies involved as additional variables which have not been considered in previous studies. We considered the payment types and TVA of a particular payment type of the companies involved in (M&A) to explore their effects on the number of Mergers completed in given year. It is generally regarded to be preferable by shareholders of the target company to receive a Cash payment rather than shares of the <b>bidding</b> <b>company</b> as we can see 67. 33 % of the total Mergers were completed by Cash. We have focused on how the number of Mergers depends on ATV in between the bidding companies. From the univariate analysis of total number of Mergers, number of Mergers by Cash and number of Mergers by Stock on the Mean, Median and the Standard Deviation of the ATV, we have found that Negative binomial regression model performs better than the Poisson regression model and all of these three response variables have positive weak but significant ant association with the standard deviation of the ATV. So we can recommend that the Standard Deviation of the ATV can be treated as significant cant predictor to model the number of Mergers in a given year. The Bi-variate Poisson regression model shows the positive effect of the mean ATV for Mergers by Stock on the joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock, which is statistically significant cant. After the Adjustment of Overdispersion Parameters for the Mergers by Cash(1 = 0 : 08267357) and the Number of Mergers by Stock (2 = 0 : 08267357) respectively, the negative impact of the standard deviation of ATV by Stock on their joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock becomes statistically significant cant. Here we have found that, the standard deviation of ATV by Stock influence the joint distribution of the number of Mergers by Cash and Stock in the presence of overdispersion. The research can be further extended in particular at how mixed offers of the payment types is determined by considering investment characteristics such as the target growth rate, relative size of the company, debt ratio, investment portfolio, tax effects and budget constraints etc. Department of Mathematical SciencesThesis (M.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{observed in}} a number of countries with developed capital markets, including the US and the UK, have produced inconclusive evidence on the presence of gains to acquiring company shareholders and indeed to the existing of net wealth gains. Thus, the current study aims to contribute to the debate on takeover activity by examining whether operational gains arise, using operating cash flow to measure operating performance of Malaysian companies involved in takeover activity between the period 1988 - 1992. Rather than investigating the distribution of shareholder wealth changes, however, the focus is whether takeover in Malaysia lead to an improvement in corporate performance. Consistent with the characteristics of private acquisitions in the sample of 97 quoted acquiring and 117 target companies (comprising of 113 private, 3 public listed and 1 non-public listed), acquisitions in Malaysia appear to be non-disciplinary. Despite the non-disciplinary motives, the overall results reported in the current study suggest that acquisitions in Malaysia during the period 1988 - 1992 lead to operating cash flow improvements in the long run. The improvement in performance results from both increases in return on sales (operating cash flow per dollar of sales) and in asset turnover (sales per dollar of assets). These improvements are not achieved {{at the expense of the}} long-term viability of the combined firms nor does it appear to be driven by cost-cutting strategies. In addition, empirical evidence in the thesis indicates that the major source of operating gains is the acquisition of companies with a high overlap of product market relatedness. In addition acquisitions that are financed by equity produce higher operating gains. Acquirers who make no immediate change to the management team of the target company following the acquisition also achieve a greater increase in post acquisition performance, reinforcing the likelihood that this sample does not consist of disciplinary acquisitions. Further, the significant positive correlation between the share price market revaluation of acquiring firms around the bid period, the change in post acquisition operating performance and the premium paid for the target indicate that managers who anticipate post acquisition operating cash flow improvements will pay a premium to acquire the targets. The findings can also be viewed as evidence that cash flow data and market value data can capture real economic phenomena which explain a substantial proportion of the market's reaction to takeovers around the announcement period. The results demonstrate that Malaysian acquisitions do lead to improvements in operating performance that provide potential for benefits to both the economy as a whole and <b>bidding</b> <b>company</b> shareholders. However, as the majority of target companies in the current study were previously privately owned businesses, researchers and policy makers should be wary before generalising from these results...|$|E
