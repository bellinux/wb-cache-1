40|$|Abstract: We draw {{attention}} to an apparent puzzle in the aggregate consumption behaviour of Singaporeans. In {{stark contrast to the}} rest of the world, the average propensity to consume has plummeted to a record low of two-fifths of income in 2000 leaving the economy without a good <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> This phenomenon is a notable departure from the stable long-run equilibrium relationship between consumption, disposable income and wealth observed elsewhere. The explanation of this puzzle is the main focus of the paper but we also {{draw attention}} to some policy measures that may reverse the process. JEL classification: C 52, E 2...|$|E
40|$|An {{industry}} is modeled in which entrepreneurs, who are heterogeneous in ability, may enter formally or informally. With a limited pool of entrepreneurs or an aggregate capital constraint, output supply is non-monotonic: for {{low and high}} prices only formality is chosen; at intermediate prices an informal-formal mix is chosen. Depending {{on the level of}} demand, informal supply may be a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer</b> or destabilizer. Because some entrepreneurs choose informality, some workers forgo social benefits, but others gain employment; consumer surplus rises but aggregate profit mayriseorfall. However, profit is redistributed towards less able entrepreneurs, and this may damage investment and growth...|$|E

40|$|An {{industry}} is modeled in which entrepreneurs, who are heterogeneous in ability, may produce formally or informally. It is shown how the formalinformal mix {{depends on the}} distribution of ability, product demand and various parameter values. The industry equilibrium is compared to one in which informality is prohibited. With relatively high product demand, the effect of entrepreneurs being free to choose informality is that consumer surplus and total employment are reduced, but profit is redistributed towards more able entrepreneurs. With relatively low product demand the opposite effects obtain. We also show that informality may be a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer</b> or destabilizer. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the role of {{unemployment}} insurance during recession. Firstly, it presents a brief literature review, according to which unemployment insurance works as a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer</b> for the economy. Secondly, it highlights certain characteristics of these programs in developed and developing countries, in recession periods. Also, it analyzes the evolution of Romanian unemployment insurance indicators during 2004 - 2009 and finds that public expenditures had an opposite trend to that of GDP and budgetary revenues, decreasing during periods of economic growth and increasing during the current recession, which suggests an interaction with the economic cycle. iunemployment insurance, economic crisis, unemployment rate...|$|E
40|$|Unemployment {{compensation}} in the United States {{is provided}} through a federal-state system of unemployment insurance (UI). UI provides temporary partial wage replacement to active job seekers who are involuntarily out of work. For older workers, UI {{is an important}} source of income security and a potential influence on work incentives. For many, the transition from full-time work in a career job to retirement is voluntary and orderly. For others, job displacement greatly disrupts plans. The transition often involves many intermediate steps. The chain of transitions may include full- or part-time work on another job which most often is not in the same industry and occupation (a bridge job). There may also be movement between bridge jobs, perhaps back from a bridge job to a career job, and finally a gradual movement into full retirement while out of the labor force. Many issues at the forefront of current UI policy debate are also issues of prime importance to those {{in the second half of}} their working life. Issues occur in all the standard areas of UI policy: coverage, eligibility, benefit adequacy, duration of benefits, work incentives, benefit financing, and interaction with other programs. This paper provides a brief background sketch of the labor market situation of older workers to examine issues of prime concern to older workers in these areas of UI policy. Our survey of policy issues suggests that changes in UI rules concerning, initial eligibility, continuing eligibility, wage replacement, and partial benefits should all be examined to evaluate effects on the likely employment patterns of older workers. Particular attention should be given to UI features affecting the choice of self-employment, part-time work, seasonal work, and agricultural jobs. The financing consequences of possible UI program changes should also be estimated, as should the macroeconomic impact of broadening recipiency. UI program features which would promote flexible and extended labor force participation by older workers should also enrich the employment choice environment for other workers. Therefore, it would be useful to examine the impact of such program changes on UI as a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer</b> of aggregate expenditures. While younger workers are usually committed to long-term participation in the labor force, older citizens are often more flexible in choosing to use their time. Worsening labor shortage conditions in the United States mean that efforts to retain older workers in the labor force will intensify. The current and potential influence of UI on the income security and labor force participation of older workers should be well understood. unemployment, insurance, compensation, older, workers, O'Leary, Wandner...|$|E

The analysis involves rational expectations, policy expectations effects, and a short-run Phillips curve whose slope varies with changes in "demand" and "supply" policies.

40|$|Under the Stability and Growth Pact, {{countries}} {{are committed to}} achieve medium-term budget positions of 'close-to-balance or in surplus'. The rationale for this commitment is that such budgetary positions would allow for the full working of the <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizers</b> without triggering the sanctions procedures of the Pact. This article sets out to show how quantifications of the medium-term (structural) requirement can accommodate the desired aim and suggests how fiscal measurement and forecasting errors {{as well as the}} budgetary effects of ageing may be allowed for. All in all, broadly balanced budgets in the medium term appear to be 'roughly right' for most euro-zone countries. Of course, as the cyclical behaviour of the euro-zone economy adapts to the new EMU environment, the medium-term targets will need to be addressed again...|$|R
40|$|Dans l'industrie du textile, les {{variations}} saisonnières et cycliques se font particulièrement sentir {{au niveau}} de l'emploi et conséquemment un chômage assez considérable en résulte. L'auteur, avant d'étudier ces problèmes, situe cette industrie dans le cadre général industriel de la Province et cite certains chiffres et faits significatifs; il s'arrête ensuite au chômage proprement dit, à ses causes et conséquences et termine en dégageant quelques conclusions et en suggérant quelques moyens d'assurer une certaine stabilité de l'emploi dans ce secteur. The Canadian primary textile industry', {{with more than half}} of its 82, 000 employees located in Quebec, offers relatively stable employment. Indeed, the textile employment is relatively stable, although there are small seasonal changes, and a degree of unemployment {{in the midst of an}} expanding economy. In an average year it (textile employment) varies up and down by 4. 3 %; in all Canadian industry the variation is 7 %. Variations in textile employment are completely opposite in time to the seasonal changes in all other industry. Textiles employ more in the months when other industries are reduced; textile employment drops when other industries are rising. Values of textile employment were many, in addition to stability. The textile industry should not be regarded as a decadent industry but rather as a growth industry; Canada's increasing needs would, in 20 years, require the output of 182, 000 textile workers. It is a "small town" industry; out of every dollar of the value added to goods during textile manufacture 58 cents goes for wages, a higher proportion than in any other manufacturing industry; the types of labour required in textiles are such that they fit in well with the requirements of other industries. This industry does not suffer from any inefficiency which modern machinery can overcome. The general level of equipment quality is good. Expenditures, chiefly for renovation, have been very large and show a more progressive investment program than for manufacturing in general. The technology and merchandising ability of the industry has been sharpened to a high pitch. That employment in the Canadian textile industry had dropped by 15, 000 since 1950 is to be due to a structural change in the position of the Canadian industry, a sharp rise in the intensity of competition from imports, a marked reduction in the share of the total domestic market supplied by Canadian workers. Such changes had also affected other industries, but none so severely as textiles because the extra exposure of textiles is chiefly due to precisely those factors which provide its unique advantage as a source of employment. And yet it has the same problems as other Canadian industries which must encounter the mass-production or low-wage products of other countries. It is fortunate for Canada that there are industries, and textiles is important among them, which are relatively non-seasonal and provide inherently stable employment. Textiles provide a <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizer</b> against the large and more erratic seasonal and cyclical fluctuations in the employment of other industries. There is a plus for textiles in that the seasonal pattern of employment exactly complements the changes in other industry. Experience has shown that workers are transferable between industries only with great dislocation and difficulty. Transfer between areas is even more difficult. A hopeful remedy for instability of employment, therefore, lies in maintaining a reasonable continuity of the established Canadian industrial pattern with some emphasis towards those industries in the private sector of the economy which are inherently stable in their employment pattern...|$|E

40|$|What has {{happened}} to the economy in Styria {{over the past two decades}} could be described as a case history of regional recovery. If we limit ourselves to employment, we find the following overall situation: A massive crisis in the primary industry (first oil price shock of 1975) and the expiry of <b>built-in</b> <b>stabilizers</b> in approximately 1980 resulted in a sharp tumble in employment figures (second oil price shock). In 1981 – 1986, attempts were made to achieve stabilization by traditional tools, especially by loss compensation. In 1986 - 87, the traditional approach at last began to be reconsidered and the first structural reorganization schemes were introduced after it had finally dawned that expectations of economic recovery would not materialize. During 1991 – 1993, the main future-oriented concepts and organizational structures were developed, after which recovery set in. In 1995, Styria was finally on the fast track to recovery. If the current speed is sustained, it could be able to regain lost terrain (job creation rate in line with the Austrian average) in about five years. The time it took to reach this position must be seen as the typical time requirement for the recovery of a region. The true problem of any regional policy is the discrepancy between political legitimization and evolutionary structural change.

40|$|Since, WWII, it {{has been}} the stated policy of the U. S. {{government}} to simultaneously pursue high employment and stable prices. Paradoxically, neither accepted economic theory nor practical experience appears to indicate that high or full employment is even possible with stable prices. In this paper, we argue that stable prices and truly full employment are indeed possible. In fact, the Humphrey-Hawkins Act sets the goalpost too low; we argue that the government can guarantee a zero unemployment rate, defined as all who are ready, willing, and able to work at the going wage will {{be able to find a}} job [...] only those unwilling (or unable) to work at the going wage would be left without work (which are not normally counted as unemployed). The government does this by acting as the employer of last resort, offering to hire all who show up to work at a fixed wage. In doing so, the government ensures that all who are ready, willing, able to work at that wage will be provided a job. At the same time, by setting this wage, the government will provide a price anchor that will impart price stability to the system, that is, we will show that a true full employment policy is not, in itself, "inflationary" and indeed could reduce inflationary pressures under some conditions. Further, the full employment policy would help to reduce economic fluctuations (the "business cycle") through a powerful <b>built-in</b> automatic <b>stabilizer</b> feature. ...|$|R
