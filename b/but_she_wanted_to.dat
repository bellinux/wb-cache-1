A Chinese language version of [...] "Yellow" [...] was recorded by Chinese rock singer Zheng Jun in 2001, {{six months after the}} original release of the single. Singaporean singer Tanya Chua covered the song. The cover band and comedy act Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered this as a Lounge style version on his 2004 album I'd Like a Virgin. The song has also been performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. American musicians Petra Haden and Bill Frisell covered the song, featuring it in their album Petra Haden and Bill Frisell; the cover appears in episode 3.08 of The O.C.. In 2006, Tre Lux covered [...] "Yellow" [...] on the cover album A Strange Gathering. Fame Academy winner Alex Parks often performed [...] "Yellow" [...] and a cover appears on her debut album. English vocal troupe G4 covered the song for their second album, G4 & Friends, with [...] "unique harmonies". American singer-writer Brooke White covered [...] "Yellow" [...] on her 2006 album Songs from the Attic. White's manager directed her to cover American hard rock band Aerosmith's 1973 single [...] "Dream On", <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do [...] "Yellow". Since they had contradicting ideas, they compromised and ended up producing cover versions of the two. In 2009, Jem performed a cover of [...] "Yellow" [...] for Starbucks Entertainment's Valentine's Day compilation Sweetheart: Our Favorite Artists Sing Their Favorite Love Songs. Russian singer Grigory Leps has covered the song, featuring it in his 2006 album V Tsentre Zemli.|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{was less}} {{pleased with the}} dustjacket of the book, {{complaining}} to the Bodley Head that the illustration (by an unnamed artist) {{looked as if the}} incident at the Tube Station occurred in [...] "mediaeval times", when she wanted something [...] "more clear, definite and modern". The Bodley Head were anxious to sign a new contract with Christie, now recognising her potential, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move on, feeling that [...] "they had not treated a young author fairly." [...] The US serialisation was in the Blue Book magazine in three instalments from September (Volume 39, Issue 5) to November 1924 (Volume 40, Issue 1) with each issue containing an uncredited illustration.|$|E
2500|$|This {{narrative}} gives a mistaken {{impression of}} the ending. For the trip, Fogg took £20,000 - in cash - in a suitcase, amounting to 1/2 of his fortune at the time. The other half of his fortune - the other £20,000 was {{to be held in}} escrow at the bank to pay off his wager if he lost - the men {{on the other side of}} the bet, similarly put £20,000 to be held during the wager. Much of what Fogg took with him was spent during the trip, as detailed above. Before the date was discovered, Fogg confessed to Aouda that he was now poor, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> marry him anyway, as set out above. When the true date was discovered, as above, Fogg collected the £20,000 wagered - and his £20,000 that was held in escrow, restoring him to his original fortune of £40,000 - distributing the remaining balance of his [...] "travel money".|$|E

I don't know what's got into the girl, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> go to Madison. I suppose her learnin' of that Bluff-Sidin' girl goin' has kind o' spurred her on.

2500|$|Madhubala's {{illness was}} known to Kishore, but like all the others, he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his {{son-in-law}} at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: [...] "She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she {{spent most of her}} time." [...] Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: [...] "After marriage they flew to London where the doctor told her she had only two years to live. After that Kishore left her at our house saying: 'I can't look after her. I'm on outdoors often'. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be with him. He’d visit her once in two months, though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn't hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout Lorde's career she {{included}} {{the idea of}} a collective identity in many of her poems and books. Audre Lorde did not just identify with one category <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> celebrate all parts of herself equally. She was known to describe herself as African-American, black, dyke, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel [...] Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of life. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just to what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible. In her late book The Cancer Journals she said [...] "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." [...] This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, it is something that must be defined by the individual. [...] "The House of Difference" [...] is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.|$|E
