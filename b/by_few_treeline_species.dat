40|$|Background and Aims The most {{plausible}} explanation for treeline formation {{so far is}} provided by the growth limitation hypothesis (GLH), which proposes that carbon sinks are more restricted by low temperatures than by carbon sources. Evidence supporting the GLH has been strong in evergreen, but less and weaker in deciduous <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> Here a test is made of the GLH in deciduous-evergreen mixed species forests across elevational gradients, with the hypothesis that deciduous <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> show a different carbon storage trend from that shown by evergreen species across elevations. Methods Tree growth and concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in foliage, branch sapwood and stem sapwood tissues were measured at four elevations in six deciduous-evergreen treeline ecotones (including treeline) in the southern Andes of Chile (40 °S, Nothofagus pumilio and Nothofagus betuloides; 46 °S, Nothofagus pumilio and Pinus sylvestris) and in the Swiss Alps (46 °N, Larix decidua and Pinus cembra). Key Results Tree growth (basal area increment) decreased with elevation for all species. Regardless of foliar habit, NSCs did not deplete across elevations, indicating no shortage of carbon storage in any of the investigated tissues. Rather, NSCs increased significantly with elevation in leaves (P < 0 · 001) and branch sapwood (P = 0 · 012) tissues. Deciduous species showed significantly higher NSCs than evergreens for all tissues; on average, the former had 11 % (leaves), 158 % (branch) and 103 % (sapwood) significantly (P < 0 · 001) higher NSCs than the latter. Finally, deciduous species had higher NSC (particularly starch) increases with elevation than evergreens for stem sapwood, but the opposite was true for leaves and branch sapwood. Conclusions Considering the observed decrease in tree growth and increase in NSCs with elevation, it is concluded that both deciduous and evergreen <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> are sink limited when faced with decreasing temperatures. Despite the overall higher requirements of deciduous tree species for carbon storage, no indication was found of carbon limitation in deciduous species in the alpine treeline ecoton...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{sustainable}} adaptation pathways under {{climate change}} conditions in mountain regions requires accurate predictions of treeline shifts and future distribution ranges of <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> Here, we {{model for the}} first time the potential distribution of Betula utilis, a principal Himalayan <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> to provide a basis for the analysis of future range shifts. Our target species Betula utilis is widespread at alpine treelines in the Himalayan mountains, the distribution range extends across the Himalayan mountain range. Our objective is to model the potential distribution of B. utilis in relation to current climate conditions. We generated a dataset of 590 occurrence records and used 24 variables for ecological niche modelling. We calibrated Generalized Linear Models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and evaluated model performance using threshold-independent (AUC, Area Under the Curve) and threshold-dependent (TSS, True Skill Statistics) characteristics as well as visual assessments of projected distribution maps. We found two temperature-related (Mean Temperature of the Wettest Quarter, Temperature Annual Range) and three precipitation-related variables (Precipitation of the Coldest Quarter, Average Precipitation of March, April and May and Precipitation Seasonality) to be useful for predicting the potential distribution of B. utilis. All models had high predictive power (AUC ≥  0. 98 and TSS ≥  0. 89). The projected suitable area in the Himalayan mountains varies considerably, with most extensive distribution in the western and central Himalayan region. A substantial difference between potential and real distribution in the eastern Himalaya points to decreasing competitiveness of B. utilis under more oceanic conditions in the eastern part of the mountain system. A comparison between the vegetation map of Schweinfurth (1957) and our current predictions suggests that B. utilis does not reach the upper elevational limit in vast areas of its potential distribution range due to anthropogenically caused treeline depressions. This study underlines the significance of accuracies of current environmental niche models for species distribution modelling under climate change scenarios. Analysing and understanding the environmental factors driving the current distribution of B. utilis is crucial for the prediction of future range shifts of B. utilis and other <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> and for deriving appropriate climate change adaptation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Summary To {{test whether}} the altitudinal {{distribution}} of trees {{is determined by}} a carbon shortage or an insufficient sugar fraction (sugar:starch ratio) in treeline trees, we studied the sta-tus of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and their compo-nents (total soluble sugars and starch) in Abies fabri (Mast.) Craib and Picea balfouriana var. hirtella Rehd. et Wils. trees along three elevational gradients, ranging from lower eleva-tions to the alpine treeline, on {{the eastern edge of}} the Tibetan Plateau. For comparison, we investigated a low-altitude spe-cies (Tsuga yunnanensis (Franch.) Pritz.) which served as a warm-climate reference because it is distributed in closed montane forests below 3100 m a. s. l. in the study area. The car-bon status of T. yunnanensis responded to altitude differently from that of the <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> At the species level, total NSC was not consistently more abundant in treeline trees than in trees of the same species growing at lower elevations. Thus there was no consistent evidence for carbon limitation of growth in treeline trees. For the three <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> studied (P. balfouriana and A. fabri in the Kang-Ding Valley and A. fabri in the Mo-Xi Valley), winter NSC concentrations in treeline trees were significantly lower than in lower-elevation trees of the same species, suggesting that, in winter, carbon is limited in treeline trees. However, in no case was there total overwinter depletion of NSC or its components in treeline trees. <b>Treeline</b> and low-altitude <b>species</b> had similar sugar:starch ra-tios of about three at their upper-elevational limits in April. We conclude that survival and growth of trees at the elevational or latitudinal climate limit depend not only on NSC concentration in perennial tissues, but also on the maintenance of an over-wintering sugar:starch ratio greater than three...|$|R
30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that {{increasing}} temperatures would favor the growth of P. glauca seedlings at those places where it is too cold now. On the other hand, it is questionable whether Alaskan P. glauca {{would be able to}} continue to grow in its current habitat below treeline as climate warms. Current mature forests could become unfavorably warm for seedling growth of P. glauca. Warming may also promote increased competition, likely belowground, which could slow rates of habitat expansion of P. glauca above treeline. P. glauca is likely to remain the dominant <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> and <b>treeline</b> expansion will keep occurring in this subarctic mountain region as the climate warms, but may not be as fast as we have seen during the past 50  years.|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of lower treeline {{in the southwestern}} United States {{has been the subject}} of recent debate. An understanding of seed predation and dispersal is required to evaluate these predictions. Experimental plots were established along the oak woodland/semi-desert grassland boundary to investigate seed predation and dispersal of emory oak, a common lower <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> An aviary experiment investigated acorn selection by grey-breasted jays, important emory oak seed dispersers. I found sufficient acorn dispersal for emory oak recruitment in adjacent grassland, and that seed predation does not limit oak recruitment in adjacent grasslands; in fact, acorns dispersed into adjacent grasslands are more likely to escape predation. I determined that grey-breasted jays select and cache acorns in a manner favorable to oak recruitment. Taken collectively, these studies and other research into emory oak life history stages illustrate mechanisms by which rapid downslope shifts in lower treeline can occur...|$|R
50|$|Treeline is the {{elevation}} above which trees cannot grow. It {{is controlled by}} a complex of environmental conditions, primarily soil temperatures {{and the length of}} the growing season—which becomes shorter with higher elevations. The elevation of treeline rises steadily at the rate of 100 m per degree of latitude from the northern to the southern Rocky Mountains. Dominant <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> including spruces, firs, and white pines, often have a shrublike form in response to the extreme conditions at {{the elevation}}al limits of their physiological tolerance; such dwarfed trees are called krummholz. Krummholz islands may actually move about 2 centimeters per year in response to the wind; they reproduce by vegetative layering on their lee sides, while dying back from wind damage on their windward sides. Under favorable climatic conditions, krummholz can assume an upright treelike form or can increase their cone crops and seedling establishment.|$|R
40|$|Identifying {{the factors}} {{controlling}} tree mortality {{is key to}} understanding the effects of ongoing global change on <b>treeline</b> movement and <b>species</b> composition. One potentially significant but little studied factor that impacts the formation of treelines is mortality caused by snow fungi. We studied the mortality patterns of Pinus cembra, a typical <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> of the Central Alps of Switzerland, in two plantations located on opposite slopes of the Dischma valley (Northeast [NE] and Southwest [SW]) above the current treeline. In 1975, 33, 000 P. cembra trees were planted at the NE site and 550 trees at the smaller SW site. All trees have been periodically monitored for survival since then. After 30 years, only ca. 5 % of all P. cembra trees survived in both plantations. Two species of pathogenic snow fungus, Gremmeniella abietina and Phacidium infestans, were major mortality agents for saplings. High rates of infection by Gremmeniella corresponded to late snowmelt and high ratios of rainfall to temperature. High rates of infection by Phacidium corresponded to earlier snowmelt and were spatially associated with P. cembra mature trees that had been present in the area before the time of planting. We provide experimental evidence that snow fungi are a primary cause of sapling tree mortality at treeline. Although additional evidence from different geographic regions and more natural treeline distributions is needed, our {{results suggest that the}} prevalence of snow fungi may prevent establishment of trees above the current treeline at present, and under future climate scenarios...|$|R
30|$|To date, {{the manner}} by which climate {{variability}} affects radial growth and seedling recruitment of many upper <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> in different geographic locations {{is not completely}} understood (Wang et al., 2006; Dang et al., 2009). Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is considered {{as one of the}} most sensitive areas to global climate change in China (Hou et al., 2008). Some dendrochronological studies have been conducted in the northeastern QTP (Liu et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008; Fang et al., 2009), but few of these have explored the main climatic factors of temperature and precipitation to determine how each (alone and in combination) influence the subalpine treeline on the eastern edge of QTP. Based on recent data, the temperature in QTP has increased significantly over the past 50  years (Ding et al., 2009). Thus, the study presented herein was designed to determine how radial growth and recruitment of Abies faxoniana responded to the variability of temperature and precipitation on both northwestern and southeastern aspects in the Min Mountains on the eastern edge of QTP. We predicted that: climate warming enhanced both the radial growth and the seedling recruitment of A. faxoniana in the latest decades.|$|R
30|$|Annual average {{temperature}} in Alaska has increased 1.9 °C {{over the past}} 50  years and is projected to rise from 2.8 °C to 7.2 °C above the 1960 s- 1970 s baseline {{by the end of}} this century (Karl et al. 2009). The projection is higher than the estimated 2.4 °C to 6.4 °C rise in global {{average temperature}} over the same period of time (IPCC 2008). This recent climate warming is expected to alter the relative abundance of arctic and subarctic vegetation in Alaska. Photographic comparisons of past and current vegetation (Sturm et al. 2001, Tape et al. 2006, Hamm 2007, Stueve et al. 2011) have shown both northward and altitudinal expansions of shrubs and treeline into tundra. Studies in Denali National Park and Preserve (DNPP) reported the maximum treeline advance was 150  m upslope into tundra (Stueve et al. 2011) and the average treeline advance was 40 to 60  m (Hamm 2007) in the last 50  years. Those studies suggest that higher temperatures stimulate successful recruitment, and possibly growth of <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> predominantly Picea glauca (white spruce) in the subarctic mountain region.|$|R

Mill.) and eastern larch (Larix lahcina (DuRoi) K. Koch). Eighteen tree ring width (TRW) chronologies were constructed at five alpine treeline sites across a 600 km long transect from the Labrador Sea to the Quebec border. The {{effects of climate}} and forest disturbance events on radial tree growth were examined at various spatial and temporal scales. [...] This study {{is the first to}} conduct dendrochronological studies on black spruce, fir and larch in Labrador and to use samples from across central Labrador. The chronology statistics are in accordance with regional publications, {{with the exception of the}} larch chronologies, which have exceptionally high sensitivity values (MS> 0. 3). These results suggest that the radial growth response of each one of the tree species sampled is uniquely adapted to monthly and/or seasonal temperature and precipitation values during the growing season and, in some cases, to winter snowfall amounts. These climate sensitivities are also site-specific and indicative of a strong reliance on the proximity of the Labrador Sea. This study simultaneously compares the radial growth patterns of the four alpine <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> in a region that, to date, has been largely understudied. As a result, this study has identified possible periods of outbreaks of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) and larch sawfly (Pristiphora erichsonii Hartig), which are synchronous with outbreaks reported from eastern Quebec. The intensity and frequency of these insect outbreaks is also climate-dependent, and can be so severe as to mask the climate sensitivity in the larch trees. A palaeoclimatic reconstruction (1847 - 2004) using merged spruce chronologies at one of the sites, the Mealy Mountains, is in accordance with other published records but has weak significance values due to a high degree of variability in climate sensitivity throughout the instrumental record (1942 -present). The high degree of variability in the climate sensitivity of spruce trees across central Labrador is partly due to the effect of spruce budworm outbreaks on the radial growth of trees, but other site-specific factors such as moisture effects must also be contributing to the variability. Further studies are needed to determine the cause of this episodic divergence in the relationship between radial tree growth and climate in central Labrador in order to comprehend more fully which environmental factors influence radial tree growth, and how this changes with time...|$|R

Its {{occupation}} of high elevations previously protected whitebark pine from long-term mountain pine beetle outbreaks. The mountain pine beetle, however, is currently reaching outbreaks of record magnitude in high-elevation whitebark pine. We used a factorial laboratory experiment to compare mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) life history characteristics between a typical host, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Engelmann), and whitebark pine. We tested the effects of natal host and brood host on beetle fecundity, offspring size, and brood sex-ratio. We reared mountain pine beetles from whitebark pine and from lodgepole pine, and infested half of them into their natal host and half into the other host. Fecundity was greater overall in lodgepole pine brood hosts. Among lodgepole brood hosts, beetles from whitebark pine had greater fecundity. Fecundity was also significantly related to phloem thickness, which was greater in lodgepole pine. Offspring were larger from whitebark brood hosts than from lodgepole, regardless of their parents’ natal host. Finally, sex-ratio was closer to 1 : 1 in lodgepole than in whitebark brood hosts. We conclude that host species affects life history of mountain pine beetle with consequences for individual beetle fitness...|$|R
40|$|Sergei Koussevitzky {{was one of}} the world’s premier {{conductors}} and virtuoso bass players whose favorite {{instrument was}} an unusually-shaped bass reportedly made in 1611 by the Amati brothers, Antonio and Girolamo. In 1962, 11 years after Koussevitzky’s death, his widow gave the bass to Gary Karr, currently considered to be the world’s premier double bassist. In 2004, Karr donated the bass to the International Society of Bassists. Close inspection by a team of experts in 2004, however, revealed stylistic inconsistencies that suggested a later construction date. We used four reference tree-ring chronologies developed from <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> in the European Alpine region to anchor the dates for the tree rings from the double bass absolutely in time. The bass yielded a 317 -year long sequence, the longest sequence yet developed from a single musical instrument. Statistical and graphical comparisons revealed that the bass has tree rings that date from 1445 to 1761. Based on the strength of these correlations, the spruce tree harvested to eventually construct the double bass likely came from the treeline Alpine area of western Austria, not too far from Obergurgl at the Italian border.

30|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the mechanistic effects of warming and interspecific competition on the performance of seedlings of P. glauca in a range of habitats above and below the current treeline on subarctic Alaskan mountains, in order to inform future conservation. Our hypotheses are as follows. 1) Growth of P. glauca seedlings above treeline is reduced relative to seedlings below treeline due to negative environmental conditions such as low temperatures and low water content in soil. 2) Warming in a cold environment positively affects seedlings as long as no drought stress occurs. 3) Interactions between P. glauca and neighboring plants are mostly competitive, but harsh conditions can trigger less competitive or even facilitative effects. We planted P. glauca seedlings at three different habitats to test habitat effects (hypothesis 1). At each site, the seedlings were planted inside or outside a small greenhouse to compare the effects of warming vs. ambient temperatures (hypothesis 2). Both inside and outside the greenhouses, the seedlings were planted either with neighboring plants or with neighbors removed, to examine the interspecific interaction at ambient and raised temperatures (hypothesis 3). Our results will provide insight how seedlings of <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> will respond to climate change, and how habitat type and interspecific competition affect treeline shifts and the establishment and growth of spruce seedlings.|$|R
40|$|Most {{studies that}} examine forest changes from climate warming focus on species {{distribution}} patterns or altered disturbance regimes. This study examines the physiologic process of {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) production along elevational gradients. As an alpine <b>treeline</b> <b>species,</b> Great Basin (GB) bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) is confined to the highest elevations of Great Basin mountains in the western United States, and have received attention for their potential as biological indicators of climate change. Warming temperatures may increase mortality, change community structure, and affect the interacting role of disturbances such as mountain pine beetle and natural re regimes. VOCs are important for tree ammability, defense against pests and pathogens, and can be early indicators of abiotic plant stress. To better understand GB bristlecone pine ecology, we collected and examined VOCs emitted under varying conditions along environmental gradients. We hypothesize that warmer temperature will increase VOCs emitted from GB bristlecone pine foliage. We address the following research questions in this paper: Will VOCs decrease with elevation as a surrogate for climate change/temperature? How will GB bristlecone pine respond chemically to a warming climate and how will they adapt? And which VOC ratios are important for GB bristlecone pine evolutionary response?

40|$|Identifying {{the factors}} that {{influence}} the climate sensitivity of <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> is critical to understanding carbon sequestration, forest dynamics, and conservation in high elevation forest/meadow ecotones. Using tree cores from four sub-alpine conifer species collected from three sides of Mt. Rainier, WA, USA, we investigated the influences of species identity and sites with different local climates on radial growth–climate relationships. We created chronologies for each species at each site, determined influential plant-relevant annual and seasonal climatic variables influencing growth, and investigated how the strength of climate sensitivity varied across species and location. Overall, similar climate variables constrained growth on all three sides of the mountain {{for each of the four}} study species. Summer warmth positively influenced radial growth, whereas snow, spring warmth, previous summer warmth, and spring humidity negatively influenced growth. We discovered only a few subtle differences in the climate sensitivity of co-occurring species at the same site and between the same species at different sites in pairwise comparisons. A model including species by climate interactions provided the best balance between parsimony and fit, but did not lead to substantially greater predictive power relative to a model without site or species interactions. Our results imply that at treeline in moist temperate regions like Mt. Rainier, the same climatic variables drive annual variation in growth across species and locations, despite species differences in physiology and site differences in mean climates...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of boreal forests to {{anthropogenic climate change}} remains uncertain, with potentially significant impacts for the global carbon cycle, albedo, canopy evapotranspiration and feedbacks into further climate change. Here, we focus on tree-ring data from the Firth River site at treeline in northeastern Alaska, in a tundra–forest transition region where pronounced warming has already occurred. Both tree-ring width (TRW) and maximum latewood density (MXD) chronologies were developed to identify the nature of tree growth and density responses to climatic and environmental changes in white spruce (Picea glauca), a dominant Arctic <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> Good agreement {{was found between the}} interannual fluctuations in the TRW chronology and summer temperatures from 1901 to 1950, whereas no significant relationships were found from 1951 to 2001, supporting evidence of significant divergence between TRW and summer temperature {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century. In contrast to this unstable climatic response in the TRW record, the high frequency July–August temperature signal in the MXD series seems reasonably stable through the 20 th century. Wider and denser rings were more frequent during the 20 th century, particularly after 1950, than in previous centuries. Finally, comparison between the tree-ring proxies and a satellite-derived vegetation index suggests that TRW and MXD correlate with vegetation productivity at the landscape level at different times of the growing season...|$|R

Expert opinion can be a useful tool to address knowledge gaps in the absence of adequate data. Experts with experience in Alpine ecology were approached to rank threat levels for 69 Alpine bird species over the next 50 years for the whole European Alps in relation to ten categories: land abandonment, climate change, renewable energy, fire, forestry practices, grazing practices, hunting, leisure, mining and urbanization. There was a high degree of concordance in ranking of perceived threats among experts for most threat categories. The major overall perceived threats to Alpine birds identified through expert knowledge were land abandonment, urbanization, leisure and forestry, although other perceived threats were ranked highly for particular species groups (renewable energy and hunting for raptors, hunting for gamebirds).

We used a multispecies perspective {{to try to}} better assess the radial growth response of al-pine <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> within the Northeast Atlantic region of North America to climate variables using bootstrapped correlation analysis. The four species present, black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), and eastern larch (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) were sampled {{in an effort to}} capture tree–climate sensitivity that is representative of this entire alpine treeline. The climate–growth rela-tionships of spruce trees were comparable with those reported in other Labrador studies, but spring drought sensitivity as reported for coastal northern white spruce trees was not observed. Rather, high levels of precipitation suggest that drought did not limit the radial growth of any of the four species. The relatively small number of statistically significant correla-tions between monthly climate variables and fir and larch trees suggests that factors other than climate limit their radial growth. The multispecies approach better highlighted the range of species-specific relationships between alpine treeline forests and maritime climates (monthly temperature and precipitation) found at the treeline ecotone.

40|$|Mountain birch (Betula utilis) is {{the most}} {{important}} <b>treeline</b> <b>species</b> in alpine forests of southwestern China. In order to understand the effects of future warming on treeline birch, this study was conducted {{to examine the effects of}} experimental warming on leaf phenology, growth and gas exchange of B. utilis saplings using the open top chamber (OTC) method in a treeline ecotone of eastern Tibetan Plateau. The OTCs enhanced daily mean air temperature by 2. 9 K throughout the growing season. Conversely, soil moisture within the OTCs on average declined by 3 % over the experimental period. Experimental warming did not affect the timing of bud break, although treeline birch saplings growing in the OTCs manifested later leaf abscission, resulting in longer leaf life span. Artificial warming significantly accelerated the leaf and shoot growth rates of treeline birch saplings, resulting in larger leaf area and longer shoot elongation late in the growing season. Moreover, experimental warming significantly reduced the leaf fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and tended to increase specific leaf area (SLA). Moreover, elevated temperatures significantly enhanced the transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g (s)), maximum net assimilation rate (A (max)), dark respiration rate (R (d)) and apparent quantum yield (AQY) but did not influence the light compensation point (LCP) and light saturation point (LSP) of treeline birch saplings. Taken together, our results indicated that short-term experimental warming markedly altered structural/functional leaf traits and enhanced photosynthetic capacity of treeline birch saplings; such positive responses in treeline birch would be favorable for the growth of this species under future warmer world.

These species form monodominant communities on the north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. Stern density, DBH-distribution, distribution pattern of different tree size classes, and intraspecific spatial association between different tree size classes of both species were analyzed. Spatial structure varied between A. forestii var. georgei and J. saltuaria, and for the same species, the spatial structures were also different from timberline to treeline. Stein density, mean tree height and Young individuals of A. forestii var. georgei were significantly higher than those of J. saltuaria. For the same species, they were different from timberline to treeline, i. e., stem density and mean tree height of both species became lower. Size classes of both species were mainly clustered either at treeline or at timberline but at different scales, and spatial patterns of young J. saltuaria were mainly dominated by random patterns. Clumps of trees created more favorable microenvironments in harsh environments at treeline and timberline. Most tree size classes showed positive intraspecific spatial associations, but positive associations between size classes of J. saltuaria were not as significant as those of A. forestii var. georgei. The south-facing slope was usually subjected to varying intensities of pastoralism. Livestock disturbance greatly changed the microhabitat and reduced the number Of Young individuals. The potential of trees to regenerate was greatly inhibited, while A. forestii var. georgei showed greater regeneration potential. Spatial structures of J. saltuaria were also modified by this kind of human impact.

40|$|Altitudinal treelines form where {{tree growth}} {{is limited by}} low growing season {{temperature}}s. However, exactly what aspects of temperature are critical remains unclear. Temperate New Zealand treelines are at a lower altitude than in comparable temperate regions elsewhere. Past studies have shown them to be warmer, and suggested that New Zealand montane trees are not capable of growing at cool temperatures. A detailed study at six sites showed that New Zealand treelines are not anomalously warm, but instead are within the global range of growing season soil temperature at treeline. The thermal environment in summer did not differ between abrupt and gradual treelines, but winters were much colder at the former. The consistency of mean daily minimum air temperature {{during the growing season}} at 20 oceanic treelines across the New Zealand archipelago suggests that thermal thresholds to tree growth are better described by minimum temperature, rather than often-used mean temperature. Extreme freezing temperatures are unlikely to control treeline position through dieback of adult trees, as the frost tolerance of trees of all species studied was in excess of the extreme minimum temperatures experienced at the New Zealand treeline. Overall, the proposition that an absence of hardy taxa in New Zealand has resulted in low treelines appears incorrect. In controlled environment experiments, the response of photosynthesis and growth to growing season temperatures differed between the six <b>treeline</b> <b>species.</b> Three species showed evidence of reduced growth activities at low temperature (carbon sink limitation), whereas one species showed reduced growth at low temperature because of limited carbon acquisition (carbon source limitation). Different measures of sink- and source activities provided support for both hypotheses for two other species. These results highlight species-specificity in the temperature response of photosynthesis and growth as well as the complexity in the interpretation of carbon sink and source limitation hypotheses. A combined approach in the field will be required to untangle the processes and thresholds that interact to determine tree growth and treeline positions. ...|$|R
40|$|The prospected strong high-latitude {{warming is}} {{projected}} to cause a northward move of the arctic-boreal treeline. These changes will potentially have significant effects on climate, but their timing and mode are not well understood. Besides being governed directly by temperature increases, speed of treeline changes will also {{be influenced by the}} capacity of migration and establishment, and by competition between different <b>treeline</b> forming <b>species.</b> In Siberia, where about half of the global circum-arctic boreal treeline is located, the treeline is formed by monospecific stands of three species of larch, Larix sibirica, Larix gmelinii and Larix cajanderi. There is clear evidence for ecological separation, particularly between L. sibirica and the northeastern species, with only L. gmelinii and L. cajanderi being able to survive on permafrost with an active layer depth of less than 1 - 2 m, but L. sibirica being competitively superior at sites with low permafrost tables. Under a warming climate, the respective ranges of the <b>treeline</b> forming <b>species</b> are projected to shift to the Northeast, causing turnovers of forest tree <b>species.</b> The Siberian <b>treeline</b> has undergone several pronounced latitudinal fluctuations in the Holocene, and detailed analyses of the historical processes of vegetation change and competitive displacement would add to predictions for the projected future shift. We are using sedimentary ancient DNA to analyze lake sediment cores spanning most of the Holocene from the southern Taymyr peninsula, where the ranges of L. sibirica and L. gmelinii come together. Changes of the complete vegetation are revealed by DNA metabarcoding and pollen analyses, while diagnostic mitochondrial haplotypes trace the temporal dynamics in distribution of the two closely related larch species. We incorporated these two species into our larch population dynamics model LAVESI to understand the influence competition between these species might have on the speed and timing of treeline movement under changing climates. Simulations were forced with regional climate series at locations {{in the vicinity of the}} sampled lakes. These analyses offer a very high degree of resolution and shed light on the complicated ecological processes leading to a change in overall vegetation...|$|R
