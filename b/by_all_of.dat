5|$|In 1957-58 Littleton took a yearâ€™s leave. A {{university}} research grant {{allowed him to}} visit Europe to study the influence of Islamic culture on contemporary Spanish pottery. He first stopped in Paris to visit Jean Sala, who had been recommended to him as an artist who worked alone in glass. Though Sala was no longer active in glass, he took Littleton to his now-idle studio. Conditioned <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his experience at Corning, Littleton knew only of glass-making in an industrial setting, {{by a team of}} workers.|$|E

5|$|A Ganapatya legend {{recalls how}} the creator-god Brahma, the preserver-god Vishnu and the dissolver-god Shiva, the Divine Mother Devi and the Sun-god Surya {{mediated}} at Morgaon {{to learn about}} their creator and their purpose of existence. Ganesha emerged before them in form of an Omkara flame and blessed them. Another legend records that when Brahma created his son Kama (desire), he became a victim of desire and lusted for his own daughter Sarasvati (Goddess of learning). Upon invocation <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the deities, the sacred Turiya Tirtha river appeared and Brahma bathed in her waters to cleanse his sin of incest. Brahma then came to Morgaon to worship Ganesha, carrying water from the river in his water pot. Entering the Ganesha shrine, Brahma stumbled and water fell from the pot. When Brahma tried to pick it up, it was turned into the sacred Karha river, that still flows at Morgaon.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} whether there would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E

5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in a tent and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his fellow councilors.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Howe defied naval {{convention}} {{by ordering}} his fleet to turn towards the French {{and for each}} of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his captains, {{and as a result}} his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade {{for the remainder of the}} war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Star Trek, he was {{nominated}} for Hugo Awards for two television movies, Genesis II and The Questor Tapes. In addition to awards, Roddenberry also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame following a campaign by the fan clubs of Star Trek, which sought to have each fan donate a dollar towards the overall $3500 cost of upkeep. Following these donations, the Committee {{in charge of the}} Walk of Fame voted Roddenberry in. The star was unveiled on September 4, 1985, at the 6600 block, near to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Las Palmas. The induction ceremony was attended <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the main cast of Star Trek, as well as Roger C. Carmel, who portrayed Harry Mudd in The Original Series. Following Roddenberry's death in 1991, he was posthumously awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Memorial Award by the National Space Society and The George Pal Memorial Award at the Saturn Awards. He was also awarded the Exceptional Public Service Medal by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).|$|E

5|$|The P.1154 {{was judged}} to be {{technically}} superior, however, the Mirage acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, however this {{did not lead to}} orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The {{artillery}} {{guns in the}} Device forts {{were the}} property of the Crown and were centrally managed by the authorities in the Tower of London. The Tower moved them between the various fortifications as they felt necessary, often resulting in complaints from the local captains. Various surviving records record the armaments held by individual forts on particular dates, and between 1547 and 1548 a complete inventory was made of the Crown's possessions, detailing the weapons held <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the forts. The number of guns varied considerably from site to site; in the late 1540s, heavily armed forts such as Hurst and Calshot held 26 and 36 guns respectively; Portland, however, had only 11 pieces. Some forts had more guns than the level of their regular, peace-time garrison; for example, despite only having an establishment of 13 men, Milton Blockhouse had 30 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

5|$|The three recent {{treatments}} (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a {{total of}} 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting {{of four or five}} species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.attaleoidesâ€”A.camopiensis, A.degranvillei, A.guianensis and A.maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A.guianensis, A.maripensis and A.attaleoides were all very similar, and thought it likely that they all represented the same species.|$|E
5|$|The vacancy {{may also}} have {{occurred}} because Wilfrid, who {{was at that point}} having problems in Northumbria, desired to become Archbishop of Canterbury. A contemporary biographer of Wilfrid, Stephen of Ripon, says that Theodore had wished for Wilfrid to succeed Theodore at Canterbury. Ã†thelred of Mercia may have supported Wilfrid's translation to Canterbury also, but despite these desires, the translation did not happen. Berhtwald was consecrated on 29 June 693, having travelled to France for his consecration as archbishop of Canterbury by Godwin, Archbishop of Lyon. Berhtwald went to the continent for consecration probably because he feared that his election was not supported <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the kings and bishops. After his consecration, Berhtwald travelled to Rome to obtain the support of Pope Sergius I, who wrote to a number of Anglo-Saxon kings and bishops in support of the archbishop. Two of these letters survive, and their authenticity has been doubted, mainly because they are only preserved as part of the post-Norman Conquest Canterbury-York dispute. Historians have since come to regard the two letters as genuine. Sergius also gave Berhtwald a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority.|$|E
5|$|Returning home, JJ {{sees his}} mother, Cecilia (Juliet Cowan), {{overwhelmed}} <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his issues and blames himself. He calls Cook {{to tell him}} how he feels, but Cook is preoccupied with having sex with a girl who JJ assumes is Effy. When he visits Effy, however, she reveals that she has not seen Cook in days. He asks her to leave Freddie and Cook alone; she refuses but offers to be his friend. JJ then visits Cook and discovers that he is having sex with their friend Pandora Moon (Lisa Backwell). Pretending not to have seen this, he then confronts Cook about ruining their friendship with Freddie and shouts at Cook for not caring about how he feels. Cook tells JJ that he loves him and brings JJ with him to buy drugs. They are almost arrested and, after running from the police, JJ pressures Cook into taking his prescription drugs instead before they meet their friends at a club. In the queue, Effy tells Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) that she knows about Naomi and Emily's relationship. Naomi reveals that she is unsure of her sexuality and realises that Effy is in love with Freddie, not Cook. JJ and Cook arrive and Thomas Tomone (Merveille Lukeba) lets them into the club where British electronica duo You Love Her Coz She's Dead are playing, announcing that Emily is already inside. Cook gets into a fight on the dancefloor and Freddie moves in to help when he discovers that JJ gave Cook his prescription drugs.|$|E
