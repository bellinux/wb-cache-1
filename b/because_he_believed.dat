5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds {{with some of his}} fellow Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck.

5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
5|$|Smith's early musical {{influences}} {{were his}} mother, and his father, who played guitar. At {{the age of}} four years, Buster was playing the organ with his brother, pianist Boston Smith; Buster played the keys and Boston stepped on the pedals. Soon thereafter, his grandfather gave away the family organ <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> it would only direct Buster {{to a life of}} sin.|$|E

5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art of Rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. It was believed that Socrates took Alcibiades as a student <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E
5|$|Hulk Hogan's visibly damaged eye was {{explained}} in the storyline {{as the result of}} Ted DiBiase hiring a group of men to attack Hogan before the match. In reality, the cause of injury has been open to debate. One theory is that Randy Savage punched Hogan <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> that his ex-wife Elizabeth Hulette had an affair with Hogan while Savage and Hulette were married (the couple divorced in September 1992). WWF officials claimed that the injury {{was the result of a}} Jet Ski accident.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>{{believed}}</b> them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final shot that came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E

5|$|In week nine, the Bulldogs {{played the}} Buffalo All-Americans, who were undefeated at the time. Thorpe started the game but came out at halftime <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> {{it would end}} in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the {{football}} became soggy after three quarters. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Feeney. The game was the only loss of the season for the All-Americans.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} in 2006 that suicide {{was one of the}} top causes of death of Singapore youths. In 2001, five children younger than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so. The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed himself <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> his penis was too small {{was reported}} in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.|$|E
5|$|While {{boarding}} at the Hale {{house in}} Harmony, Pennsylvania, Smith met and began courting Emma Hale. When Smith proposed marriage, Emma's father, Isaac Hale objected, primarily <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> Smith had no means to support Emma besides money-digging. Smith and Emma eloped and married on January 18, 1827, {{after which the}} couple began boarding with Smith's parents in Manchester. Later that year, when Smith promised to abandon treasure seeking, Hale offered to let the couple live on his property in Harmony and help Smith get started in business.|$|E

Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E

5|$|In week nine, the All-Americans {{played the}} Bulldogs. Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but he came out at halftime <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> it would end in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{original}} title, Cheating Death: Final Destination 3, {{was changed}} during development. The companies that co-produced the franchise's first film—Craig Perry and Warren Zide's Zide/Perry Productions, and Wong and Morgan's own Hard Eight Pictures—returned to produce Final Destination 3. Practical Pictures and Manitee Pictures also {{helped with the}} film's production. The film was initially intended to be filmed in 3D, but plans for this were abandoned. Morgan revealed {{that the decision to}} not film in 3D was mostly due to financial reasons, but also <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> that fire and blood would not be shown properly in the red color filters of anaglyph 3D.|$|E

5|$|The major Russian ORT TV station {{organised}} {{a national}} televised debate {{as to what}} should be done with the station. Former cosmonaut Georgi Grechko suggested that it should be kept in orbit long enough to salvage any useful equipment from it, for transfer to the International Space Station or other spacecraft, however Konstantin Feoktistov argued that it would cost more to retrieve the equipment than to replace it. Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|The next {{significant}} {{manager of}} Bristol Rovers was Albert Prince-Cox, who introduced blue-and-white quarters as the team's kit <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> {{it made the}} players look larger and more intimidating. He also became the first manager {{to win a major}} cup competition with the club when they won the Division 3 (South) Cup in 1935. More success followed in the 1952–53 season when Bristol Rovers' longest serving post-war manager, Bert Tann, won a league title {{for the first time since}} 1905 and won promotion for the first time ever when the club won Division 3 (South). Tann remained in charge for eighteen years from 1950 to 1968.|$|E
5|$|Added to {{the state}} highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route198 {{extended}} from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> {{that it would be}} too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long-term, especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with U.S. Route 80 (US80) by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000.|$|E
