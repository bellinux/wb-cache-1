The males pick and choose which song they want to mimic; however, when one male chooses a song from a host bird, the other males mimic other songs from a different host species (1). This is {{an effective way to}} discriminate each male from another when mimicking the songs. There are also several distinct host species that the Indigobirds mimic from and the most common host species are <b>Black-bellied</b> <b>Firefinch</b> (Lagonosticta rara) and African Firefinch (L. rubricata) (1).|$|E
