5|$|The {{front of}} the head of the female in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> is yellow, {{gradually}} changing to olive green {{at the back of the}} head, except for the broad yellow rear brow, while the area between the eye and the bill is dark greenish grey, and the area around the ear is green. The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> is identical to the male's.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|M. c. leggei, {{described}} by Gregory Mathews in 1912, {{is found in}} eastern South Australia. Males in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> {{differ from those of}} subspecies cyanochlamys by having blue tinges on their belly below the chest band and on their wing remiges.|$|E
5000|$|Four {{subspecies}} of Epthianura crocea {{were initially}} identified, however only three are currently recognised. These subspecies are primarily distinguished by their morphological variances {{in the adult}} males <b>breeding</b> <b>plumages.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of white-eyed gull at all ages is its long slender bill. This is black in younger birds, but in adults it is deep red {{with a black}} tip. The legs are yellow - dullest in younger birds, brightest in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumaged</b> adults. The eye itself is not white; the bird {{takes its name from}} white eye-crescents, which are present at all ages.|$|R
50|$|In the non-breeding season, grebes are plain-coloured in dark {{browns and}} whites. However, most have ornate and {{distinctive}} <b>breeding</b> <b>plumages,</b> often developing chestnut markings {{on the head}} area, and perform elaborate display rituals. The young, particularly those of the Podiceps genus, are often striped and retain some of their juvenile plumage even after reaching full size. In the breeding season, they mate at freshwater lakes and ponds, but some species spend their non-breeding season along seacoasts.|$|R
5|$|M. l. lamberti is the {{nominate}} subspecies from coastal eastern Australia and {{the original}} form described by Vigors and Horsfield in 1827. Unlike other subspecies, {{the head of a}} male in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> is a more uniform blue, with the crown azure and ear coverts lighter. It also has a blue rather than purple back.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the {{albatrosses}} {{is usually}} some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile-like <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three albatross species, the black-footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled albatross). Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage.</b>|$|E
5|$|The female has {{no black}} {{markings}} or grey crown. Its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium. Its underparts are pale grey-brown. The female's bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> approaching {{the black of}} the male's bill.|$|E

50|$|The plumage of the pipits is {{generally}} drab and brown, buff or faded white. The undersides are usually {{darker than the}} top, {{and there is a}} variable amount of barring and streaking on the back, wings and breast. The drab mottled brown colours provide some camouflage against the soil and stones they are generally found on. A few species have slightly more colourful <b>breeding</b> <b>plumages,</b> for example the rosy pipit has greenish edges on the wing feathers. The yellow-breasted pipit, if it is retained in this genus, is quite atypical in having bright yellow plumage on the throat breast and belly.|$|R
5|$|The scaly {{juvenile}} plumage is retained until January or February of {{the year}} following hatching, when a lengthy moult of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage,</b> but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly of head, body and tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|The white-winged fairywren (Malurus leucopterus) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the fairywren family, Maluridae. It lives in the drier parts of Central Australia; from central Queensland and South Australia across to Western Australia. Like other fairywrens, this species displays marked sexual dimorphism and one or more males of a social group grow brightly coloured plumage during the breeding season. The female is sandy-brown with light-blue tail feathers; it is smaller than the male, which, in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage,</b> has a bright-blue body, black bill, and white wings. Younger sexually mature males are almost indistinguishable from females and are often the breeding males. A troop of white-winged fairywrens in spring and summer has a brightly coloured older male accompanied by small, inconspicuous brown birds, {{many of which are}} also male. Three subspecies are recognised. Apart from the mainland subspecies, one is found on Dirk Hartog Island, and another on Barrow Island off the coast of Western Australia. Males from these islands have black rather than blue <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before their return to the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage.</b> They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E

5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage,</b> when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and throat, and the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, {{the superb}} fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays. The breeding male has a bright-blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle and tail, brown wings, and black throat, eye band, breast and bill. Females, immatures, and non-breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn (females and immatures) or dull greyish blue (males) tail. The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter. Immature males moult into <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> the first breeding season after hatching, though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect. Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding, with males assuming an eclipse non-breeding plumage. They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring. Breeding males' blue plumage, particularly the ear-coverts, is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules. The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly, and so {{may be even more}} prominent to other fairywrens, whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E

5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts {{on the sides of}} the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage,</b> with the former being significantly more grey.|$|E
5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{breeding}} male {{is mostly a}} deep shade of chestnut in colour with black colouration on the face, wings, and tail. The breeding male is not easily confused with any other birds except the chestnut weaver, which is substantially larger and has white on its wings. The breeding male's legs and feet are horn (pale grey) in colour. The non-breeding male chestnut sparrow has white flecking on the upperparts, and much of its plumage is buff or whitish with chestnut crescent markings, until the bright chestnut of the <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> is exposed by wear. The non-breeding male's bill fades to a dusky-tipped horn, {{similar to that of}} females, but without dusky tones {{on the cutting edge of}} the mandible (lower portion of beak).|$|E

5|$|The splendid fairywren (Malurus splendens), {{also known}} simply as the splendid wren or more colloquially in Western Australia as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the Maluridae family. It is found {{across much of the}} Australian continent from central-western New South Wales and southwestern Queensland over to coastal Western Australia. It inhabits predominantly arid and semi-arid regions. Exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism, the male in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> is a small, long-tailed bird of predominantly bright blue and black colouration. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. It comprises several similar all-blue and black subspecies that were originally considered separate species.|$|E
5|$|The superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus), {{also known}} as the superb blue-wren or colloquially as the blue wren, is a {{passerine}} bird of the family Maluridae, common and familiar across southeastern Australia. The species is sedentary and territorial, also exhibiting a high degree of sexual dimorphism; the male in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> has a striking bright blue forehead, ear coverts, mantle, and tail, with a black mask and black or dark blue throat. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour; this gave the early impression that males were polygamous, as all dull-coloured birds were taken for females. Six subspecies groups are recognized: three larger and darker forms from Tasmania, Flinders and King Island respectively, and three smaller and paler forms from mainland Australia and Kangaroo Island.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} in <b>breeding</b> <b>plumage</b> has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly {{streaked}} with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish {{on the lower}} belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium ("eyebrow"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists {{of four or five}} blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.|$|E
50|$|Prinias have short wings {{but long}} {{tapering}} tails. They are fairly drab birds, brown or grey above (sometimes with dark streaks) and whitish below.
