5|$|A retired {{military}} operative {{on a mission}} to save his old teammates. The character's name is an homage to the 1978 action film Good Guys Wear Black, where Norris plays John T. Booker. During the film, Booker claims to have <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by a cobra and states that the cobra later died as a result; this is a reference to Chuck Norris facts, satirical factoids about the actor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the {{harassment}} of coyotes practiced by rural people, urban coyotes are losing their fear of humans, which is further worsened by people intentionally or unintentionally feeding coyotes. In such situations, some coyotes have begun to act aggressively toward humans, chasing joggers and bicyclists, confronting people walking their dogs, and stalking small children. Non-rabid coyotes in these areas sometimes target small children, mostly under the age of 10, though some adults have <b>been</b> <b>bitten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mulder, still {{restrained}} {{in his bed}} at the hospital, {{sees the}} silhouette of the monster at the window. He screams for the nurse, but she has already <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> and opens the window to let the monster in. Scully tries to visit Mulder but the nurse refuses access. Suddenly Scully sees the nurse as a corpse, realizes that Mulder is in danger, and runs into Mulder's room. There she sees the monster {{on the wall and}} shoots at it. It leaps through the partially open window, breaking the glass and wooden frame.|$|E
5000|$|Onychotillomania is a {{compulsive}} neurosis {{in which a}} person picks constantly at the nails or tries to tear them off.

5|$|The player, as Sabreman, has <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by the Sabre Wulf and now {{transforms}} into a werewolf at nightfall. He has forty days {{to collect}} items throughout a strange castle and brew {{a cure for}} his curse. An onscreen timer shows the progression of day into night, when Sabreman changes to a werewolf, returning to human form at sunrise. Some of the castle's monsters only attack Sabreman when he is a werewolf. The game ends if the player does not finish the cure in forty days. The game's only directions are given through a poem included with the game's cassette tape.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd <b>been</b> <b>bitten.</b> He thought the snake had only brushed his hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
5000|$|... 1997 - {{a coyote}} {{attacked}} a two-year-old boy in Tucson, Arizona's Wildlife Ridge Park, {{but did not}} damage his skin. The next day in that same park, a four-year-old boy <b>was</b> <b>bitten</b> and scratched and a twenty-two-month-old toddler <b>was</b> <b>bitten</b> around her right eye and required seven stitches for serious puncture injuries.|$|R
50|$|Up {{to three}} fourths of dog bites happen to those younger than 20 years-old. In the United States, the costs {{associated}} with dog <b>bites</b> <b>are</b> estimated to be more than $1 billion annually. The age groups that suffer most from dog <b>bites</b> <b>are</b> children 5 to 9 years-old. Often, bites go unreported and no medical treatment given - these bites go unreported. As many as one percent of pediatric emergency room visits are for treatment for animal <b>bites.</b> This <b>is</b> more frequent during the summer months. Up to five percent of children receiving emergency care for dog <b>bites</b> <b>are</b> then admitted to the hospital. Bites typically occur in the late afternoon and early evening. Girls <b>are</b> <b>bitten</b> more frequently by cats than they are by dogs. Boys <b>are</b> <b>bitten</b> by dogs two times more often than girls <b>are</b> <b>bitten</b> by dogs.|$|R

5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, and people have <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E
5|$|In {{this stage}} of the myth, Horus is a {{vulnerable}} child beset by dangers. The magical texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through the magical healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but even that figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E

They are instead broken into fragments and can then <b>be</b> <b>bitten,</b> sucked, left to melt in the mouth or be soaked in coffee. Couques de Dinant have been traditionally given to babies during teething.|$|R

5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held in houses to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by many snakes without ill effect, and {{toward the end of his}} career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Several Smilodon fossils {{show signs}} of {{ankylosing}} spondylitis, hyperostosis and trauma; some also had arthritis, which gave them fused vertebrae. One study of 1,000 Smilodon skulls found that 30% of them had eroded parietal bones, {{which is where the}} largest jaw muscles attach. They also showed signs of microfractures, and the weakening and thinning of bones possibly caused by mechanical stress from the constant need to make stabbing motions with the canines. Bony growths where the deltoid muscle inserted in the humerus is a common pathology for a La Brea specimen, which was probably due to repeated strain when Smilodon attempted to pull down prey with its forelimbs. Sternum injuries are also common, probably due to collision with prey. Some bones also show evidence of having <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by other Smilodon, with one skull showing an unhealed wound from a canine, seemingly fatal, and a scapula from the same site that had been pierced by a canine. The frequency of trauma in S. fatalis specimens was 4.3%, compared to 2.8% in the dire wolf, which implies the ambush predatory behavior of the former led to greater risk of injury than the pursuit predatory behavior of the latter. Smilodon remains exhibit relatively more shoulder and lumbar vertebrae injuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader of}} the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), {{promises}} to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has <b>been</b> <b>bitten</b> by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter); after they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected, but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.|$|E
