5|$|On 19 January 2006, Hessenthaler {{signed for}} League Two strugglers Barnet on a {{short-term}} contract {{until the end}} of the season. Although he considered retiring at the end of the season, he was persuaded by manager Paul Fairclough to sign a new contract for a further year. In October 2006, he was named in the League Two team of the week, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 2006–07 season, Barnet announced that his contract would not be renewed.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the length}} of closure is {{defined in terms of}} time between the closure of the vocal tract after the {{preceding}} vowel, and the release before the following vowel, stops at the beginning or end of a word do not have a fortis-lenis contrast. Orthographically in Wagiman, word-initial stops are written using the voiced Roman letters (b, d and g), <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of a word, voiceless letters (p, t and k) are used instead.|$|E
5|$|After their wedding, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to Provo, Utah, where Kinne had been attending college, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> {{of the fall}} semester, Kinne again put his studies on hold. He and his new wife returned to Independence, where both took jobs—Sharon, babysitting and tending shops, and James as an electrical engineer at Bendix Aviation. Although Sharon claimed to have miscarried the child that had brought about their marriage, she soon became pregnant again. In the fall of 1957, {{she gave birth to}} a girl they named Danna.|$|E
5|$|Around 260 AD, {{the fall}} of the Agri Decumates {{territory}} north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the Alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the Castrum Rauracense near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.|$|E

5|$|During spring {{training}} {{in a game}} against the Boston Red Sox, Kershaw gained much attention for throwing a curveball to Sean Casey that started behind Casey <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> looped into the strike zone and struck him out looking. Kershaw was 0–3 and had a 2.28 ERA with 47 strikeouts through 43 innings pitched in his first stint of the year with the Suns. He was then called up to the majors on May 28, 2008, but optioned back to Jacksonville on July 2.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa. Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a good actor. Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
5|$|O'Reilly {{continued}} {{to work as a}} schoolteacher after he broke into international cricket, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 1934, after missing more than {{six months of the year}} in England, he resigned from his government post, reasoning that his career could not progress if he was going to be overseas so often. However, he had not made any plans for his future employment. Soon after, O'Reilly received an offer to work as a sportsgoods salesman for the department store David Jones with sporting leave entitlements. The Premier of New South Wales, Bertram Stevens, tried to coax O'Reilly into staying in the government education system, offering him a post at Sydney Boys High School if he returned to STC to complete the Bachelor of Arts that he had abandoned a decade before.|$|E
5|$|Thus the consulship of Drusus was successful, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of {{the year}} he fell ill. His illness {{prompted}} the equestrian, Clutorius Priscus, to write his elegy, who had thought his life in jeopardy. Priscus previously wrote an elegy for Germanicus {{for which he was}} paid. He thought that he would be rewarded again, and so recited his elegy before an audience in preparation for Drusus' death. An unamused informer brought the matter before the Senate, and it was voted that he be executed. Hid execution was decreed and carried out without first consulting the emperor. This induced Tiberius to introduce a law where the Senate must wait 10 days after such condemnations before making such decrees public as to allow him to learn of their decisions first.|$|E

5|$|Having lost O'Rourke {{as manager}} in 1921, {{after he had}} {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} death of his son two years earlier, Bradford's results suffered back in Division Two. Both Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) had been relegated in 1922, and with the rise of fellow West Yorkshire side Huddersfield Town, attendances in Bradford dropped. City's average attendance fell from a record high of 22,585 in 1920–21 to between 12,000 and 14,000 in Division Two. Five consecutive bottom half finishes culminated in relegation to Division Three (North) in 1926–27, when they finished bottom of the table following a then record 8–0 defeat to Manchester City {{on the final day of}} the season. New manager Colin Veitch missed out on guiding the club to an immediate promotion when they finished sixth, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the season the players had not been paid and the bank was unable to advance any more money because of the club's overdraft. Had it not been for donations by fans, Bradford City would not have started the following campaign. A new board was appointed, and they reinstated Peter O'Rourke as manager. Success was immediate, when the 1928–29 season started with a record 11–1 victory over Rotherham United, as the side scored a club record 128goals to earn promotion by just one point. City's successful team had also brought the fans back and the average attendance of 18,551 is the highest average recorded by the club, since 1925, when The Football League started to keep official records.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season, Yardley improved considerably, becoming a dominant force in University Cricket according to Wisden. His maiden first-class century {{came in a}} narrow Cambridge victory over the Army, and he scored a second against Surrey, remaining not out for 116 {{in a total of}} 359. Bowling much more regularly, his maiden wickets in first-class cricket came in a performance of four wickets for 45 against Yorkshire, including the wicket of Len Hutton. Yardley topped the Cambridge batting averages and played an effective innings of 90 in the University Match. This display impressed Stanley Jackson, an influential former Yorkshire amateur cricketer, and he urged the Yorkshire selectors to include Yardley in the first team. Yardley was still appearing in the county second team at this stage, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of August, he made his debut for the Yorkshire first eleven, appearing in the County Championship match against Derbyshire. He scored 12 in his only innings and took a wicket. He played in a further seven matches for Yorkshire, scoring 309 runs in ten innings with a highest score of 89 against Hampshire, with further fifties against Surrey and Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). In all first-class cricket that season, Yardley scored 1,017 runs at an average of 37.66 and took 12 wickets at an average of 26.08.|$|E
