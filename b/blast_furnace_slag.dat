25|$|Fine and coarse {{aggregates}} make up {{the bulk}} of a concrete mixture. Sand, natural gravel, and crushed stone are used mainly for this purpose. Recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition, and excavation waste) are increasingly used as partial replacements for natural aggregates, while a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> and bottom ash are also permitted.|$|E
25|$|Portland {{blast-furnace}} slag cement, or Blast furnace cement (ASTM C595 and EN 197-1 nomenclature respectively), contains up to 95% ground granulated <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag,</b> {{with the}} rest Portland clinker and a little gypsum. All compositions produce high ultimate strength, but as slag content is increased, early strength is reduced, while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes. Used as an economic alternative to Portland sulfate-resisting and low-heat cements.|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} for medium active wastes in the nuclear {{industry}} {{to be treated with}} ion exchange or other means to concentrate the radioactivity into a small volume. The much less radioactive bulk (after treatment) is often then discharged. For instance, it is possible to use a ferric hydroxide floc to remove radioactive metals from aqueous mixtures. After the radioisotopes are absorbed onto the ferric hydroxide, the resulting sludge can be placed in a metal drum before being mixed with cement to form a solid waste form. In order to get better long-term performance (mechanical stability) from such forms, they may be made from a mixture of fly ash, or <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag,</b> and Portland cement, instead of normal concrete (made with Portland cement, gravel and sand).|$|E

40|$|The viscosities of high alumina <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were {{experimentally}} {{determined by}} the rotating cylinder method using the Brookfield digital viscometer model LVDV-II+ pro. Two different slag systems were considered for the current study, the CaO-SiO_ 2 -MgO-Al_ 2 O_ 3 quaternary and the CaO-SiO_ 2 -MgO-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -TiO_ 2 quinary system. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1650 to 1873 K. The effects of temperature, basicity, TiO_ 2, and silica activity of slags on viscosity were studied. The viscosity decreases with basicity for high alumina <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> with basicity {{in the range of}} 0. 46 to 0. 8. At high basicity (∼ 0. 8), slag viscosity decreases even {{with a small amount of}} TiO_ 2 (∼ 2 pct) addition in the slag. With an increase in silica activity in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 4, the slag viscosity increases, the increases being steeper below the liquidus temperature...|$|R
25|$|Type V is used where sulfate {{resistance}} is important. Its typical compound composition is: 38% (C3S), 43% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 9% (C4AF), 1.9% MgO, 1.8% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. This cement {{has a very}} low (C3A) composition which accounts for its high sulfate resistance. The maximum content of (C3A) allowed is 5% for type V Portland cement. Another limitation is that the (C4AF) + 2(C3A) composition cannot exceed 20%. This type is used in concrete {{to be exposed to}} alkali soil and ground water sulfates which react with (C3A) causing disruptive expansion. It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada. As with type IV, type V Portland cement has mainly been supplanted by the use of ordinary cement with added ground granulated <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> or tertiary blended cements containing slag and fly ash.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag,</b> a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground granulated <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slag</b> addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, viscosities and {{sulphide}} capacities of high alumina <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were investigated. The systems investigated were four component CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 quaternary system, CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -TiO 2 and CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-Al 2 O 3 -CaF 2 quinary systems. Viscosities of high alumina <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> were experimentally {{determined by the}} rotating cylinder method using Brookfield digital viscometer model LVDV-II+ pro. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1573 - 1873 K. The effects of temperature, basicity, TiO 2, CaF 2 and silica activity of slags on viscosity were studied. Viscosity decreases with basicity for high alumina <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> with increase in basicity and CaF 2. At higher basicity (~ 0. 8), slag viscosity decreases even with small amount of TiO 2 (~ 2 %) addition in the slag. With increase in silica activity {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 0. 4,viscosity of slag increases and the increase is steeper below liquidus temperature. Sulphide capacity of the slag was measured using gas-slag equlibria. The liquid slag was equilibrated with Ar-CO-CO 2 -SO 2 gas mixture. The slag systems studied were the same {{as in the case of}} viscosity measurements. Experiments were conducted in the temperature range of 1773 to 1873 K. Effect of temperature, basicity, MgO,TiO 2 and CaF 2 contents of slags on sulphide capacity were studied. As expected, sulphide capacity was found to increase with increase in temperature and basicity. At higher experimental temperature (~ 1873 K) TiO 2 was found to decrease the sulphide capacity of slags. But, at lower temperature, there was no significant effect of TiO 2 on the sulphide capacity. Sulphide capacity increases with increase in MgO content of slag if MgO content is more than 5 %. Based on above experimental data, models were developed for estimation of viscosity and sulphide capacity of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags.</b> These models were later on applied for designing the slags for achieving the optimum slag characteristics so that slag volume can be reduced. With the help of these models slag volume was reduced to the extent of 5 - 10 kg per ton hot metal and also silicon content of the hot metal was reduced by around 10 % with some improvement in slag viscosity and sulphide capacity of the slag.

40|$|The {{composition}} and properties of <b>blast</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>slags</b> greatly affect the furnace productivity {{and the quality}} of hot metal produced. Viscosity is an important physical property of slags, strongly influenced by the chemical composition, structure and the temperature. Experimental measurement of slag viscosity requires high temperature equipment and is time consuming. Therefore, chemical parameters are used to identify trends in viscosity as function of chemical composition. Limited information is available for High Alumina <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnace</b> <b>Slags,</b> since much of the open literature deals with Low Alumina Slags, with alumina content less than 15 weight percentage. High Alumina slags (alumina content in the range of 15 % to 30 %) are predominantly encountered in Indian <b>Blast</b> <b>Furnaces.</b> It appears that these slags have higher viscosity and lower sulphide capacity than the low alumina slags. The effect of chemical composition / ionic structure on viscosity has been interpreted in this work, using the chemical parameter of optical basicity. Data reported in the literature have been used, along with the values of liquidus temperature, for high alumina slags. Three slag systems, i. e., CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO and CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO-TiO 2 have been considered in this work. The trends observed are discussed in the paper...|$|R
