25|$|Although {{plans were}} afoot for Tutu to become Vice Principal of Fedsem, {{he decided to}} leave the seminary to accept a {{teaching}} post at the University of <b>Botswana,</b> <b>Lesotho</b> <b>and</b> <b>Swaziland</b> (UBLS) in Roma, Lesotho. The new position allowed him to live closer to his children and offered twice the salary he earned at Fedsem. In January 1970, he and his wife moved to the UBLS campus; most of his fellow staff members were white expatriates from the U.S. or Britain although the university's policy was non-racial and inclusive. As well as his teaching position, he also became the college's Anglican chaplain and the warden of two student residences. In Lesotho, he joined the executive board of the Lesotho Ecumenical Association and served as an external examiner for both Fedsem and Rhodes University. He returned to South Africa on several occasions, including to visit his father shortly before the latter's death in February 1971.|$|E
25|$|Born to a poor {{family in}} Klerksdorp, Tutu is of mixed Xhosa and Motswana heritage. Moving around South Africa as a child, he {{trained as a}} teacher and married Nomalizo Leah Tutu, with whom he had several children. In 1960, he was ordained as a priest and in 1962 moved to the United Kingdom to study {{undergraduate}} and master's degrees in theology at King's College London. In 1966 he returned to southern Africa, teaching at the Federal Theological Seminary and then the University of <b>Botswana,</b> <b>Lesotho</b> <b>and</b> <b>Swaziland.</b> In 1972, he returned to London as the Theological Education Fund's director for Africa, necessitating regular tours of the continent. Back in southern Africa in 1975, he served first as dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg and then Bishop of Lesotho, taking an active role in opposition to South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation and white-minority rule. From 1978 to 1985 he was general-secretary of the South African Council of Churches, emerging as one of South Africa's most prominent anti-apartheid activists. Unlike other sectors of the anti-apartheid movement, he stressed non-violent protest, emphasising foreign pressure on the country's economy; this earned the antipathy of the National Party government and its supporters.|$|E
2500|$|Burundi {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in Africa, along with its neighbour Rwanda among others (such as <b>Botswana,</b> <b>Lesotho,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Swaziland),</b> to be a direct territorial continuation of a pre-colonial era African state. The early history of Burundi, and especially the role and nature of the country's three dominant ethnic groups; the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi, is highly debated amongst academics. [...] However, it is important to note that the nature of culture and ethnic groups is always fluid and changing. While the groups might have migrated to the area at different times and as distinctly different ethnic groups, the current distinctions are contemporary socio-cultural constructs. Initially the different ethnic groups lived together in relative peace. The first conflicts between ethnic groups can be dated back to the 17th century, when land was becoming ever more scarce because of the continuous growth in population.|$|E
