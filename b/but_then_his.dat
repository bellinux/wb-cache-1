5|$|In {{the first}} group of five runners, Prost paced the session, nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Félix da Costa in second, and Lopez third. D'Ambrosio and Ma Qinghua (who was unable to {{complete}} a maximum power lap) were the group's two slowest drivers. Buemi was the fastest driver in the second group, half a second ahead of teammate Turvey. Heidfeld, Sarazzin, and Evans rounded out the top five. In the third group, Vergne recorded the overall fastest time of any competitor in the group stages at one minute and 20.993 seconds. Di Grassi qualified 12th overall after narrowly avoiding colliding with the wall between the sixth and seventh turns. His teammate Abt was second quickest in the group, ahead of di Grassi, Maro Engel, and Duval (who went wide on his timed lap which was recorded on reduced power). Rosenqvist immediately employed his car's full power capacity and was the fastest driver in the fourth (and last) group. He finished ahead of Bird, who equalled Vergne's pace at first, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> rear tyre made contact with the wall which cost him time. Piquet was third on his fastest lap which saw him make contact with the wall once. Robin Frijns and Adam Carroll were the slowest drivers of the fourth group; the latter locked his rear tyres and went wide at the first corner, resulting in him starting 20th (and last). At the end of the group qualifying stage, Rosenqvist, Vergne, Buemi, Bird and Piquet were the five drivers to qualify for the Super Pole round.|$|E

25|$|Moro {{developed}} {{his interest in}} politics between 1943 and 1945. Initially, {{he seemed to be}} very interested in the social-democratic component of the Italian Socialist Party, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> Catholic faith moved him towards the newly constituted Democrazia Cristiana (DC). In the DC, he took part {{in the work of the}} leftist trend, headed by Giuseppe Dossetti. In 1945 he became director of the magazine Studium and president of the Graduated Movement of the Azione Cattolica.|$|E

He clashed with the makers (including director Sam Peckinpah) of what could have been a triumphant comeback, on Ride the High Country (1962). He closed out his film career with Mail Order Bride (1964), and saw several of his scores (including one for Bonnie and Clyde) rejected.|$|E
25|$|Sandhu's {{chance in}} first class cricket came in 1980-81 when Karsan Ghavri, the regular opening bowler for Bombay, was away with the {{national}} side. Sandhu did not play {{in the first two}} matches of the season <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> debut against Gujarat where he claimed nine wickets. He {{was not part of the}} side to play in the final against Delhi that season, but was included at the last moment when the originally chosen Ravi Kulkarni dropped out. In a sensational spell, he reduced Delhi to 18-5 on the first morning and finished with nine wickets in the match. His 25 wickets in the season came at an average of 18.72.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E

[...] Alexios at first disregarded the pretender's agitations, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> sister Theodora, the widow of the real Constantine Diogenes, who had retired to a monastery, protested the abuse of her husband's name, and the emperor had the pretender arrested and exiled to Cherson.|$|E

2500|$|... 1987 saw {{the inaugural}} World Touring Car Championship arrive at Silverstone. Luis Pérez-Sala {{had a meeting}} no one would believe; he led the race until the {{penultimate}} lap, with nearly one minute lead, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> Bigazzi-entered BMW M3 retired. He wasn't even sure that the car would start the race after Olivier Grouillard rolled the car in practice. However, the Munich marque still took victory when the CiBiEmme Sport's M3 finished first, {{in the hands of}} Enzo Calderari and Fabio Mancini. The Schnitzer M3 of Roberto Ravaglia, Roland Ratzenberger and Pirro managed to finished second, ahead of the Alfa Romeo 75 Turbo of Giorgio Francia and Nicola Larini.|$|E
2500|$|Reading in [...] that [...] "every living {{substance}} {{was destroyed}} that was upon {{the face of}} the ground" [...] — people and animals alike — the Gemara asked how the beasts had sinned (to deserve this punishment). A Baraita on the authority of Rabbi Joshua ben Karha compared this to a father who set up a bridal canopy for his son, and prepared a banquet with every sort of food. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> son died. So the father broke up the canopy, saying that he had prepared it only for his son. Now that the son was dead, the father had no need for a banquet. Thus God created the animals only for the benefit of people. Now that people had sinned, God had no need for the animals.|$|E
2500|$|Cobbett [...] "likes the cut and thrust, the falls, bruises, and dry blows of an {{argument}} ..." [...] But then he loses all interest. [...] "As to any good or useful results that may come of the amicable settling of it, any one is welcome to them for him. The amusement is over, when the matter is once fairly decided." [...] Hazlitt provides as one notable example Cobbett's brief fondness for some ideas of Thomas Paine. Cobbett even brought Paine's bones back with him from the United States to England, planning to erect a monument. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> enthusiasm dwindled, and he [...] "ratted from his own project", {{and went off to}} fight other battles. Often, it takes only firm resistance or an attack in response to turn Cobbett around. Cobbett attacks only until he meets serious opposition, and then runs away, like a bullying schoolboy.|$|E

2500|$|Faced {{with the}} more {{difficult}} part of the survey in the desolate waters of Tierra del Fuego, Captain Stokes {{fell into a deep}} depression. At Port Famine on the Strait of Magellan he locked himself in his cabin for 14 days, then after getting over-excited and talking of preparing for the next cruise, shot himself on 2 August 1828. Following four days of delirium Stokes recovered slightly, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>his</b> condition deteriorated and he died on 12 August 1828. Captain Parker King then replaced Stokes with the First Lieutenant of the Beagle, Lieutenant William George Skyring as commander, and both ships sailed to Montevideo. On 13 October King sailed the Adventure to Rio de Janeiro for refitting and provisions. During this work Rear Admiral Sir Robert Otway, {{commander in chief of the}} South American station, arrived aboard [...] and announced his decision that the Beagle was also to be brought to Montevideo for repairs, and that he intended to supersede Skyring. When the Beagle arrived, Otway put the ship under the command of his aide, Flag Lieutenant Robert FitzRoy.|$|E
