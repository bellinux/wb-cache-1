50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> feeds {{mainly on}} hairy {{caterpillars}} but also consumes termites and ants, including winged ones caught in flight, beetles, grasshoppers and other insects, {{as well as}} birds' eggs and nestlings.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater ani}} (Crotophaga major) {{is a large}} bird in the cuckoo family. It is a {{breeding}} species from Panama and Trinidad through tropical South America to northern Argentina. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|They are preyed {{on by the}} African goshawk, {{and their}} nest {{contents}} fall prey to the grey-headed bushshrike. They may be killed by ants or come under attack by territorial boubou shrikes. They are parasitised by the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> and emerald cuckoo, besides perhaps klaas's cuckoo and the red-chested cuckoo.|$|E
50|$|The museum also hosts a {{range of}} <b>Black</b> Forest <b>cuckoo</b> and quail clocks, trumpeter clocks, monks playing bells and other {{associated}} musical movements.|$|R
50|$|Seven colour {{varieties}} are {{recognised in the}} Netherlands: <b>black,</b> chamois, <b>cuckoo,</b> gold spangled, laced blue, silver spangled and white; in Germany there are thirteen.|$|R
50|$|Recognized color {{varieties}} include: <b>black,</b> white, <b>cuckoo,</b> buff, red, {{and blue}} in the United Kingdom and black, white, buff, and red in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus clamosus) is {{a species}} of cuckoo in the family Cuculidae. The species is {{distributed}} widely across sub-Saharan Africa. There are two subspecies. This cuckoo has a very wide range and is a common bird so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a [...] "least-concern species".|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Cuculus clamosus) is {{a common}} brood {{parasite}} of this boubou, parasitizing about 2% of its nests. When tropical boubous spot black cuckoos, they usually try to mob them away and are often successful in this; some pairs however {{seem to be very}} inept at preventing brood parasitism and may be affected several times per year.|$|E
50|$|The spotted ground-thrush is of {{particular}} note, as Pigeon Valley {{is one of the}} places where this endangered bird can be most reliably found in winter. It arrives typically in late March or early April, and is present until August or September; in 2015 it was present until 5 October. Summer migrants include, occasionally, <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> red-chested cuckoo and red-backed shrike.|$|E
50|$|While in Germany for {{postdoctoral}} work, Lang and {{his wife}} were enamored of <b>Black</b> Forest <b>cuckoo</b> clocks, and he became a sensation in the origami world when he successfully folded one after three months of design and six hours of actual folding.|$|R
50|$|The {{museum was}} set up in 1990 by {{brothers}} Roman and Maz Piekarski after bringing together a collection of antique <b>Black</b> Forest <b>cuckoo</b> clocks that has been continuously increased ever since. Both men were trained as clockmakers in Manchester from the age of 15, which is when their fascination with these timepieces began.|$|R
5000|$|Four colours are {{recognised}} in the Entente Européenne standard: <b>black,</b> blue, <b>cuckoo</b> and white., the Poultry Club of Great Britain recognises thirteen colours {{for both}} standard and bantam sizes; {{not all of them}} are currently bred, and the Australian Poultry Standards recognise black, blue, buff, white, columbian, red and [...] "any recognised colour".|$|R
50|$|The nest, built {{mainly by}} the female, is a shallow cup in a creeper or dense bush {{into which the}} usually two brown-blotched greenish-white eggs are laid. Both sexes {{incubate}} for 16-17 days to hatching, and both bring food to the chicks. Fledging takes place in about another 16 days. About 2% of nests are parasitised by the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is a {{medium-sized}} cuckoo. The sexes are similar, the plumage varying by subspecies; Cuculus clamosus clamosus has upper parts black glossed with green, slatey-grey wings and black tail tipped with white and sometimes with the outer feathers barred or spotted with white or buff; Cuculus clamosus gabonensis is mostly black {{with a red}} throat and black and white barring on the belly.|$|E
50|$|Various {{species of}} forest birds are found here including; green twinspot, Cape white-eye, {{southern}} boubou, spotted ground-thrush, purple-crested turaco and African paradise-flycatcher. The black sparrowhawk breeds here annually. Another bird that is seldom seen {{but that is}} generally present is buff-spotted flufftail. Unusual sightings of note in recent years include European nightjar, lemon dove, mountain wagtail, black-throated wattle-eye and <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> The current bird list for Pigeon Valley includes 152 species.|$|E
50|$|Balranald has {{a number}} of birds that can be viewed there {{regularly}} such as lapwings, corn buntings, greylag geese and the famous corncrake which has a distinctive rasping sound in the summer months. North Uist has also had some other rarer visitors such as the Snowy Owl, <b>Black</b> Billed <b>Cuckoo,</b> Gyrfalcon and the Hoopoe.|$|R
60|$|The varied {{forms and}} habits of birds do not favour the {{production}} among {{them of the}} phenomena of warning colours or of mimicry; and the extreme development of their instincts and reasoning powers, {{as well as their}} activity and their power of flight, usually afford them other means of evading their enemies. Yet there are a few imperfect, and one or two very perfect cases of true mimicry to be found among them. The less perfect examples are those presented by several species of cuckoos, an exceedingly weak and defenceless group of birds. Our own cuckoo is, in colour and markings, very like a sparrow-hawk. In the East, several of the small <b>black</b> <b>cuckoos</b> closely resemble the aggressive drongo-shrikes of the same country, and the small metallic cuckoos are like glossy starlings; while a large ground-cuckoo of Borneo (Carpococcyx radiatus) resembles one of the fine pheasants (Euplocamus) of the same country, both in form and in its rich metallic colours.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic of {{the plateau}} are mammals such as goats, wild boars, wolves, foxes, European wildcats, lynxes, badgers, and hares. Birds include <b>black</b> grouse, woodpeckers, <b>cuckoos,</b> pheasants, quails, hawks, owls, and fish include perch and the carp-like barbel.|$|R
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is a brood parasite. Its main hosts are bushshrikes, {{particularly}} the tropical boubou and crimson-breasted shrike. When parasitising the boubou, the eggs hatch after about fourteen days, {{three days before}} the boubou's eggs. The cuckoo chick evicts other eggs and nestlings usually within thirty hours of hatching. It is fledged in about sixteen days and leaves the nest a few days later. The foster parents continue to feed it for another three weeks.|$|E
50|$|Nesting {{sites are}} widely spaced. Breeding occurs {{at any time}} of the year, though in the south, mainly in spring. The nest is a shallow cup of loosely woven twigs, placed some 2 to 3 meters above ground in a tangle, or in an {{ornamental}} bougainvillea shrub. Two eggs are laid, measuring 23 x 20 mm. They are pale cream or greenish in colour, and lightly speckled with rufous. Parasitism by the <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> has been recorded. Moult occurs upon completion of the breeding period.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} twenty plumage {{varieties}} are listed for the Araucana by the Entente Européenne d’Aviculture et de Cuniculture. Of these, five are recognised by the American Poultry Association for large fowl: Black, Black Breasted Red, Silver Duckwing, Golden Duckwing, and White; for bantams, Buff {{is added to}} these. The Australian Poultry Standard recognises <b>Black,</b> <b>Cuckoo,</b> Lavender, Splash, White and any colour which is standard in Old English Game. The Poultry Club of Great Britain recognises twelve colours: Black, Black-red, Blue, Blue-red, Crele, Cuckoo, Golden Duckwing, Lavender, Pile, Silver Duckwing, Spangled, and White.|$|E
5000|$|Other varieties, {{including}} white, <b>black,</b> ermine, <b>cuckoo,</b> splash {{and blue}} also exist. Hens are good winter layers of medium-sized, light brown to pinkish eggs. Some cocks are the quietest of all breeds and Faverolles are {{also known for}} their extreme docility. As a result, they tend to get bullied in a mixed flock for being so gentle and friendly. They thrive in groups with other Faverolles, or perhaps, with other docile breeds such as the Sussex.|$|R
60|$|My {{practice}} was, therefore, to walk cautiously {{along the}} narrow pathways with which the country abounded, and on detecting any sign of a Pitta's vicinity to stand motionless and give a gentle whistle occasionally, imitating the notes as near as possible. After half an hour's waiting I was often rewarded by seeing the pretty bird hopping along in the thicket. Then I would perhaps lose sight of it again, until having my gun raised and ready for a shot, a second glimpse would enable me to secure my prize, and admire its soft puffy plumage and lovely colours. The upper part is rich soft green, the head jet black with a stripe of blue and brown over each eye; {{at the base of}} the tail and on the shoulders are bands of bright silvery blue; the under side is delicate buff with a stripe of rich crimson, bordered with black on the belly. Beautiful grass-green doves, little crimson and black flower-peckers, large <b>black</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> metallic king-crows, golden orioles, and the fine jungle-cocks--the origin of all our domestic breeds of poultry--were among the birds that chiefly attracted my attention during our stay at Labuan Tring.|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} home to a number of species, such as common buzzard, long-legged buzzard, Eurasian sparrowhawk, lesser spotted eagle, common kingfisher, white-throated dipper, fieldfare, grey wagtail, corn bunting, hawfinch, European stonechat, common <b>cuckoo,</b> <b>black</b> stork, {{different}} species of falcons, woodpeckers, swallows, etc.|$|R
50|$|The thick-billed cuckoo is a {{specialised}} brood parasite of helmetshrikes, being {{known to}} almost exclusive parasitise three {{species in the}} red-billed and chestnut-fronted helmetshrike in its eastern range and the chestnut-bellied helmetshrike in West Africa. In {{the case of the}} well-studied red-billed helmetshrike, the thick-billed cuckoo has caused probably the most dramatic reduction in nesting success by any brood parasitic bird, with one group of helmetshrikes unable to rear any of their own nestlings for five years and ten breeding attempts, with overall between 35 and 55 percent of nests parasitised. It is almost certain that the extinct Malagasy subspecies parasitised vangas, which are related to the helmetshrikes. This species’ parasitism of the helmetshrikes may complement the similarly sized <b>black</b> <b>cuckoo</b> which exclusively parasitises bush shrikes.|$|E
40|$|Roti island lies 10 km {{south of}} West Timor in the Lesser Sundas, Indonesia. Its bird fauna is poorly known. During 16 – 23 December 2004, 104 bird species were {{observed}} {{on the northern}} Tapuafu peninsula, including 32 new island records. Eight species of conservation importance were recorded: Yellow-crested Cockatoo Cacatua sulphurea (Critically Endangered), Timor Green Pigeon Treron psittacea (Endangered) and six Near Threatened species: <b>Black</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Dove Turacoena modesta, Pink-headed Imperial Pigeon Ducula rosacea, Darter Anhinga melanogaster, Olive-shouldered Parrot Aprosmictus jonquillaceus, Orange-sided Thrush Zoothera peronii and White-bellied Bushchat Saxicola gutturalis...|$|E
30|$|In DeNapoli (2014), I {{discuss the}} case of a female sādhu from the Khatik (butcher) {{community}} who, despite the emphasis given by renouncer traditions on physically separating from family and home in order to develop detachment, continued to live with her natal family, which consisted of three generations of kin, even though she maintained an ashram located one block from her home within her natal village. See chapter six, “Even the <b>Black</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> Sings Beautifully: Challenge and Reconfiguration in the Practices of a Khatik Sadhu,” in Real Sadhus Sing to God: Gender, Asceticism, and Vernacular Religion in Rajasthan (New York: Oxford University Press).|$|E
50|$|The Brabanter {{has been}} bred in the Netherlands, and {{particularly}} in Brabant, for a long time. The oldest known image of one is in a painting of 1676 by the Dutch artist Melchior d'Hondecoeter. They soon spread from their area of origin. <b>Black</b> and <b>Cuckoo</b> Brabanters were shown at the first German poultry exhibition, at Görlitz in Saxony, in 1854. The Brabanter became nearly extinct in the early 20th century, but was recovered by cross-breeding with other crested and bearded birds.|$|R
50|$|There are 9 {{recognized}} colours in the French Standard: <b>Cuckoo,</b> Golden <b>Cuckoo,</b> <b>Black,</b> Birchen, Black Copper, Wheaten, Black-tailed Buff, White and Columbian. Black Copper (black with copper feathers on the neck) and Cuckoo (barred feathers, {{giving a}} black and white speckled appearance) are the most common of these. Other colors not officially recognized (such as Blue Copper, Blue, and Splash) also exist.|$|R
50|$|There is no set colour for the Scots Dumpy, but <b>cuckoo,</b> <b>black,</b> {{and white}} {{are the most}} common colours. Other patterns/colours occur as sports, or are bred into the {{phenotype}} by fanciers. The breed's standard allows for any pattern/colour that is allowed for game fowl to be acceptable, however colour is only worth 10% of the breeds score in competition.|$|R
5000|$|This medium-sized, slim <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>cuckoo</b> with a crest is distinctive. The white wing patch {{on the black}} wing and the pattern make it unmistakable even in flight. They are very vocal during the {{breeding}} season. The call is a ringing series of whistling notes [...] "piu-piu" [...] with the calls of the nominate form more rapid and slightly mellower.|$|R
50|$|The first Pekins are {{alleged to}} have been looted from the private {{collection}} of the Emperor of China at Peking (now known as Beijing) by British soldiers {{towards the end of}} the Second Opium War around 1860. However, some sources suggest that a consignment of birds from China around 1835 were given to Queen Victoria, assuming the name of 'Shanghais' and that these birds were bred with further imports and were developed into the breed we know today as Pekins. The Pekins first brought to the United Kingdom are said to have been Buff in colour, with <b>Blacks</b> and <b>Cuckoos</b> arriving later on. They are known in the United States and Canada as Cochin Bantams.|$|R
50|$|The company won several awards {{as well as}} {{gold and}} silver medals for the quality in {{workmanship}} and design in different countries, like the Gold Medal of the Vienna World Trade Exhibition of 1873. He was the only <b>Black</b> Forest <b>cuckoo</b> clock maker who was honored in such a way. Former honors at the International exhibition in London 1862, and Paris 1867 and at regional exhibitions in Villingen 1858 and Karlsruhe 1861, had also testified to the excellent quality of the cuckoo clocks of Johann B. Beha. For the clocks shown in Philadelphia in 1876, the firm was honored with the meritory medal by the United States Centennial Commission. Further honors followed at the exhibitions in Karlsruhe 1877, London 1885, Freiburg 1877, Chicago 1893 and Strasbourg 1895.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, in {{a widely}} known {{handbook}} on music, Musurgia Universalis (1650), the scholar Athanasius Kircher describes a mechanical organ with several automated figures, including a mechanical cuckoo. This book contains the first documented description—in words and pictures—of how a mechanical cuckoo works. It {{should be noted}} that Kircher did not invent the cuckoo mechanism, because this book, like his other works, is a compilation of known facts into a handbook for reference purposes. The engraving clearly shows all the elements of a mechanical cuckoo. The bird automatically opens its beak and moves both its wings and tail. Simultaneously, there is heard the whistle—call of the cuckoo, created by two organ pipes, tuned to a minor or major third. There is only one fundamental difference from the <b>Black</b> Forest-type <b>cuckoo</b> mechanism: The functions of Kircher's bird are not governed by a count wheel in a strike train, but a pinned program barrel synchronizes the movements and sounds of the bird.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first is}} from Father Franz Steyrer, written in his [...] "Geschichte der Schwarzwälder Uhrmacherkunst" [...] (History of the Art of Clockmaking in the Black Forest) in 1796. He {{describes}} {{a meeting between}} two clock peddlers from Furtwangen (a town in the Black Forest) who met a travelling Bohemian merchant who sold wooden cuckoo clocks. Both the Furtwangen traders were so excited that they bought one. On bringing it home they copied it and showed their imitation to other Black Forest clock traders. Its popularity grew {{in the region and}} more and more clockmakers started producing them. With regard to this chronicle, the historian Adolf Kistner claimed in his book [...] "Die Schwarzwälder Uhr" [...] (The Black Forest Clock) published in 1927, that there is not any Bohemian cuckoo clock in existence to verify the thesis that this clock was used as a sample to copy and produce <b>Black</b> Forest <b>cuckoo</b> clocks. Bohemia had no fundamental clockmaking industry during that period.|$|R
2500|$|Booted Bantams are angular {{birds with}} profuse plumage. They have broad backs, breasts carried well forward, and {{relatively}} large, downward-pointing wings following {{the line of}} the vulture hocks. They do not quite reach the floor though. [...] Booted Bantams have a single upright comb with five points, horn-colored beaks, red wattles, and red earlobes. Almost exclusively an exhibition chicken raised by poultry fanciers, they appear in more than a twenty colour varieties. Colours accepted in shows include: Barred, <b>Black,</b> Blue, Buff, <b>Cuckoo,</b> Columbian, Gray, Golden Neck, Millefleur (the most common), Mottled, Partridge, Lavender, Lemon Millefleur, Porcelain, Self Blue, Silver Millefleur and White.|$|R
