25|$|The {{redundancy}} notices {{were issued}} on 27 September, {{together with a}} letter from the council's leader and deputy leader (John Hamilton and Derek Hatton) explaining that there was no intention to make any employee redundant but that the notices were a legal requirement. With time running out, the council had to hire taxis to distribute the notices. At the Labour Party conference the following week, David Blunkett agreed with Hatton that the GLC's Director-General Maurice Stonefrost could offer advice to Liverpool. Stonefrost suggested increasing rates by 15%, and cutting the housing programme. The council's budget problems for the 1985–86 financial year were only solved when the council removed £23m from its capital budget to fund revenue spending, and borrowed £30m from Swiss banks to replenish the capital fund. The council also transferred £3m in loans which it had given to other Labour councils and found £3m of <b>budget</b> <b>savings.</b> The council's Finance Committee approved this plan on 26 November 1985.|$|E
25|$|Under the Fiscal Year 2010 budget resolution, {{the text}} of the {{reconciliation}} bill submitted to the Budget Committee had to have been reported by the relevant Committees by October 15, 2009. Therefore, the Democrats combined {{the text of}} America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 as reported out of the Ways and Means Committee, and as it was reported out of the Education and Labor Committee, and {{the text of the}} Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act as reported out of the Education and Labor Committee. This version was never meant to be passed; it was only created so that the reconciliation bill would comply with the Budget resolution. The bill was automatically amended to the version that was meant to be passed per the special rule that was reported out of the Rules Committee. The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act was added to the Reconciliation Act as only one reconciliation bill can be passed each budget year, and it also faced a tough road through the Senate due to Republican filibuster and opposition from several centrist Democratic Senators. The move was also thought to give President Obama two key victories in overhauling the health care and student loan system. It also eventually became clear that the <b>budget</b> <b>savings</b> caused by the student loan bill would become essential to the overall reconciliation bill by reducing the deficit enough for the overall bill to qualify for the reconciliation process.|$|E
500|$|During {{the meeting}} with Eisenhower, Diệm asked about the American {{commitment}} towards the defense of South Vietnam. At the time, communist guerrillas had begun a low-level campaign against Diệm {{in an attempt to}} reunify Vietnam under their rule. In response, Diệm began a widespread campaign to crush the communist remnants. Diệm felt that the cloud cover over Indochina would make it difficult for air bombings against communist guerrillas to be effective. He predicted that the communists would try to enter South Vietnam through Laos, {{which turned out to be}} the case when the Ho Chi Minh trail came into full usage. Diệm asked the US for a guarantee of continuing aid; at the time, two thirds of South Vietnam's budget came from the CIP, which was mainly abused by the urban elite to buy consumer goods. Diệm knew that the Eisenhower administration and Congress wanted to make <b>budget</b> <b>savings</b> and implored them to refrain from cutting the CIP expenditure, fearing a deterioration in the Vietnamese economy. Eisenhower said that Vietnamese security was ensured by the South East Asian Treaty Organization, but Diệm remained anxious, believing that the other member states were too weak and lacking in resources to stand by their pledges to defend his country. Upon Diệm's departure from the capital, the White House released a statement praising [...] "the remarkable achievements of the Republic of Viet-Nam under his leadership."' ...|$|E

40|$|About the book] With {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of personal finance study and qualifications in both the Higher Education and post- 16 sectors, and an increased emphasis on ‘financial capability’, this innovative new book fills a yearning gap for a UK-centred introductory text on personal finance. It systematically covers all the main personal finance topics, such as expenditure and <b>budgeting,</b> <b>savings</b> and investments, borrowing, mortgages, insurance, and retirement planning. In addition, several unique features distinguish this book as a solid yet breakthrough academic text. Written by a team of experienced teachers and professors of Economics and Business, Personal Finance successfully balances the fundamental principles of personal finance with the challenges of practical application. This highly authoritative and accessible text helps students and educators alike to master the essentials and to become less reliant on overseas texts for guidance in this high-growth sector. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent lunar {{missions}} {{have confirmed}} {{the presence of}} water and miscellaneous volatiles within the craters of the Moon 2 ̆ 7 s South Pole. If harvested, these resources {{have the potential to}} provide an incredible <b>budget</b> <b>saving</b> to the human space exploration program by dropping the total mass that astronauts need to carry from the Earth. The area that develops these technologies is called In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). ISRU allows reducing the payload, and consequently reduces the energy consumption and cost of space exploration. The present thesis investigates methods for the extraction of volatiles from regolith within the shadowed craters of the Moon using solar power. Topics that are to be discussed within this thesis will include heat transfer calculations, experimental studies using a CO 2 laser, and lastly the design of the process schematic to validate the extraction of volatiles. ...|$|R

The empirical analysis supports the Keynesian view that there is a linkage between the current account, <b>budget</b> deficit and <b>saving</b> and investment gap. Trade openness was found to {{have a positive effect on}} the current account deficit but was statistically insignificant.
