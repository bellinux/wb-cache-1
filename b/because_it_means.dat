5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of the sail was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that the sail of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|Sam {{commits suicide}} by taking heroin and Martha is {{suspected}} of her murder, but she is later proved innocent. Jack and Martha grow close again, but Martha begins seeing Roman. Martha and Jack later get back together and decide to marry. Martha discovers she is pregnant, {{but she is not}} sure if the father is Jack or Roman. Following a paternity test, it is revealed that the baby is Roman's. Martha is diagnosed with breast cancer and is told she needs a termination for her own health. She decides not to and Jack is angry <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> she might die. Jack and Martha decide to get married again. Martha collapses and has to be resuscitated. She also discovers that she has lost the baby. Martha begins to recover and later goes into remission.|$|E
25|$|Neutrinos' {{low mass}} and neutral charge mean they {{interact}} exceedingly weakly with other particles and fields. This feature of weak interaction interests scientists <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> neutrinos {{can be used}} to probe environments that other radiation (such as light or radio waves) cannot penetrate.|$|E

25|$|Mössbauer {{found that}} a {{significant}} fraction of emission and absorption events will be recoil-free, which is quantified using the Lamb–Mössbauer factor. This fact is what makes Mössbauer spectroscopy possible, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> gamma rays emitted by one nucleus can be resonantly absorbed by a sample containing nuclei of the same isotope, and this absorption can be measured.|$|E
25|$|Rosencrantz {{is delighted}} {{to find that}} his mission is complete, but Guildenstern knows it is not over. Hamlet enters, {{speaking}} with a Norwegian soldier. Rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany Hamlet to England <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> freedom from the orders of the Danish court. Guildenstern understands that wherever they go, they are still trapped in this world.|$|E
25|$|Selfish helpfulness —those {{willing to}} help for a price— has also been {{attributed}} to fictional rats. Templeton, from E. B. White's Charlotte's Web, repeatedly reminds the other characters that he is only involved <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> more food for him, and the cellar-rat of John Masefield's The Midnight Folk requires bribery to be of any assistance.|$|E
50|$|In 1913, KEA {{was criticized}} for not fully {{supporting}} the women's suffrage movement in Kentucky. The Lexington Leader claimed <b>it</b> was <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would <b>mean</b> equal rights and therefore higher pay to female teachers. KEA denied the allegation.|$|R

25|$|Beloved and Sethe {{are both}} very much emotionally {{impaired}} {{as a result of}} Sethe’s previous enslavement. Slavery creates a situation where a mother is separated from her child, which has devastating consequences for both parties. Furthermore, the earliest need a child has is related to the mother: the baby needs milk from the mother. Sethe is traumatized by the experience of having her milk stolen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> she cannot form the symbolic bond between herself and her daughter.|$|E
25|$|Because {{thyristors}} {{can only}} be turned on (not off) by control action, and rely on the external AC system to effect the turn-off process, the control system only has one degree of freedom – when {{to turn on the}} thyristor. This limits the usefulness of HVDC in some circumstances <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that the AC system to which the HVDC converter is connected must always contain synchronous machines in order to provide the commutating voltage – the HVDC converter cannot feed power into a passive system.|$|E
25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This {{is a big problem}} in hosting environments <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E

Of course, Lucifer likes the idea of Armageddon <b>because</b> <b>it</b> will <b>mean</b> that a billion new corrupt souls will appear on his doorstep.|$|R
25|$|Taken together, {{proponents of}} {{reconciliation}} ecology see the species-area relationship and human domination {{of a large}} percentage of the earth's area as a sign that we will not be able to set aside enough land to protect all of life's biodiversity. There can be negative effects of setting land aside <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> the remaining land is used more intensely. For example, less land is required for crop production when high levels of inorganic fertilizer is applied, but these chemicals will affect nearby land set aside for natural ecosystems. The direct benefits of land transformation for the growing world population often make it ethically difficult to justify the tradeoff between biodiversity and human use. Reconciled ecosystems are ones in which humans dominate, but natural biodiversity is encouraged to persist within the human landscape. Ideally, this creates a more sustainable socio-ecological system and does not necessitate a trade off between biodiversity and human use.|$|E
25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} is {{also important}} {{in the development of}} herd immunity. For polio to occur in a population, there needs to be an infecting organism (poliovirus), a susceptible human population, and a cycle of transmission. Poliovirus is transmitted only through person-to-person contact and the transmission cycle of polio is from one infected person to another person susceptible to the disease, and so on. If {{the vast majority of the}} population is immune to a particular agent, the ability of that pathogen to infect another host is reduced; the cycle of transmission is interrupted, and the pathogen cannot reproduce and dies out. This concept, called community immunity or herd immunity, is important to disease eradication, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that it is not necessary to inoculate 100% of the population—a goal that is often logistically very difficult—to achieve the desired result. If the number of susceptible individuals can be reduced to a sufficiently small number through vaccination, then the pathogen will eventually die off.|$|E
25|$|The {{comparative}} use of Census Bureau data, {{as well as}} most {{sources of}} demographic income data, has been questioned by statisticians for being unable to account for 'mobility of incomes'. At any given time, the Census Bureau ranks all households by household income and then divides this distribution of households into quintiles. The highest-ranked household in each quintile provides the upper income limit for each quintile. Comparing changes in these upper income limits for different quintiles is how changes are measured between one moment in time and the next. The problem with inferring income inequality on this basis is that the census statistics provide only a snapshot of income distribution in the U.S., at individual points in time. The statistics do not reflect the reality that income for many households changes over time – i.e., incomes are mobile. For most people, income increases over time as they move from their first, low-paying job in high school to a better-paying job later in their lives. Also, some people lose income over time because of business-cycle contractions, demotions, career changes, retirement, etc. The implication of changing individual incomes is that individual households do not remain in the same income quintiles over time. Thus, comparing different income quintiles over time is like comparing apples to oranges, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> comparing incomes of different people at different stages in their earnings profile.|$|E
50|$|Tensions emerged {{between the}} {{conservative}} parties over {{issues such as}} the Liberal policy of halving tolls on the EastLink freeway.

500|$|Barrowman {{states that}} when fans {{ask him if}} Jack is really the Face of Boe, he tells them he {{believes}} he is and states that he and Davies hold {{it to be true}} [...] "in [...] little world"; the link is [...] "unconfirmed" [...] within the text of the show. As to how Jack becomes the Face, Barrowman feels the answer doesn't matter as it is intentionally mysterious. Barrowman likes the characters being connected <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> in spite of how the Doctor initially treats Jack, [...] "Boe becomes his confidante and the one the Doctor returns to for advice and information" [...] which he feels is a [...] "wonderful twist of events". However, Davies chooses not to confirm (within the story's narrative) whether or not Jack really is the Face of Boe, stating [...] "the moment it became very true or very false, the joke dies". He has refused the publication of spin-off novels and comic books that have tried to definitively link the two.|$|E

500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> that I still have a friend."

500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>means</b> we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{to say that}} nature should be {{protected}} {{for the sake of}} human beings just is to say that it should be protected <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a <b>means</b> to one or more anthropocentric ends. I argue that this assumption is false. In some contexts, claims that a particular natural X should be protected for our sakes mean that X should be protected, not <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a <b>means</b> to anthropocentric ends, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is part of something about human life that is of value: because, that is, its value is anthropocentric and constitutive rather than anthropocentric and instrumental. It follows, I suggest, that one does not need to endorse the non-anthropocentric claim that nature should be protected for its own sake in order to challenge the instrumentalist notion that it should be protected simply <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is a <b>means</b> to anthropocentric ends (as, say, a provider of ecosystem services). To make my case, I consider the UK Government's failed attempt to sell off England's publicly-owned forests...|$|R
