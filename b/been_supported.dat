5|$|Attalea {{is a large}} genus of palms {{native to}} Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America. This pinnately leaved, non-spiny genus {{includes}} both small palms lacking an aboveground stem and large trees. The genus has a complicated taxonomic history, and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers. Since the genera can only be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their male flowers, the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus. This has <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by a recent molecular phylogeny.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 {{an appeal}} to raise Â£3 million was {{launched}} to restore the pools. The fundraising has <b>been</b> <b>supported</b> by The Prince's Trust. The project aims not just to preserve the existing architecture, but also to reopen it as an outdoor lido. This is hampered by poor access to the site {{and the possibility of}} flooding. It is intended to make the work sustainable and environmentally friendly, with renewable sources of energy including water source heat pumps using latent heat from the River Avon. A small landing stage is being proposed to enable access to the pools from river craft.|$|E

Following these attacks, General Pershing took his forces into Mexico to pursue Pancho Villa.|$|E
