50|$|The {{film was}} given a limited release theatrically in the United States by Warner Bros. in 1987. It was {{released}} on VHS by Warner Home Video the following year. The film was released to <b>burn-on</b> -demand DVD by the Warner Archive Collection in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Up to 5% of {{reducing}} agents, such as coal powder, pitch, creosote, and fuel oil, may {{be added to}} the molding material to prevent wetting (prevention of liquid metal sticking to sand particles, thus leaving them on the casting surface), improve surface finish, decrease metal penetration, and <b>burn-on</b> defects. These additives achieve this by creating gases at the surface of the mold cavity, which prevent the liquid metal from adhering to the sand. Reducing agents are not used with steel casting, because they can carburize the metal during casting.|$|E
50|$|The Steam Infusion {{process was}} first {{conceived}} in 2000 {{as a method}} for marine propulsion. The process has since been developed {{to be used for}} steam infusion. On the right a diagram shows how the process creates an environment of vaporised product surrounded by high energy steam. The supersonic steam flow entrains and vaporises the process flow to form a multiphase flow, which heats the suspended particles by surface conduction and condensation. The condensation of the steam causes the process flow to return to a liquid state. This causes rapid and uniform heating over the unit making it applicable to industrial cooking processes. This process has been used in industry, predominantly in soup and sauces applications. Its possible benefits include reduced cooking times, easier cleaning with no <b>burn-on,</b> ingredient reduction and energy savings.|$|E
40|$|The <b>burn-on</b> sand {{is common}} surface defect {{encountered}} in CO 2 -cured silicate-bonded sand casting of hydroturbine blade of ultra-low-carbon martensitic stainless steel, its feature, causes and prevention measures {{are presented in}} this paper. Experiments showed that the <b>burn-on</b> defect is caused by oxidization of chromium in the molten steel at high temperature and can be effectively eliminated by using chromium-corundum coating...|$|E
40|$|Current passage tube {{technology}} is a heating technology in which a stainless steel tube carrying a pumpable food product is connected to low-voltage, high-amperage electrical power and heated due to {{the resistance of the}} tube. The heat is transferred to the product flowing in the tube by conduction and convection. A unique feature of the {{technology is}} the constant temperature differential between the wall of the tube and the product {{along the length of the}} tube. This causes less chemical change in the product than conventional heat exchangers which, in the case of UHT processing of milk, results in less <b>burn-on,</b> and hence reduced cleaning and better flavour of the final product...|$|E
