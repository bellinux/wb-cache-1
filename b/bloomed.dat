40|$|Abstract The North Atlantic Ocean {{contains}} diverse {{patterns of}} seasonal phytoplankton <b>blooms</b> with distinct internal dynamics. We analyzed <b>blooms</b> using remotely-sensed chlorophyll a concentration data and change point statistics. The first <b>bloom</b> {{of the year}} began during spring at low latitudes and later in summer at higher latitudes. In regions where spring <b>blooms</b> occurred at high frequency (i. e., proportion of years that a <b>bloom</b> was detected), there was a negative correlation between <b>bloom</b> timing and duration, indicating that early <b>blooms</b> last longer. In much of the Northeast Atlantic, <b>bloom</b> development extended over multiple seasons resulting in peak chlorophyll concentrations in summer. Spring <b>bloom</b> start day {{was found to be}} positively correlated with a spring phenology index and showed both positive and negative correlations to sea surface temperature and the North Atlantic Oscillation in different regions. Based on the characteristics of spring and summer <b>blooms,</b> the North Atlantic can be classified into two regions: a seasonal <b>bloom</b> region, with a well-defined <b>bloom</b> limited to a single season; and a multi-seasonal <b>bloom</b> region, with <b>blooms</b> extending over multiple seasons. These regions differed in the correlation between <b>bloom</b> start and duration with only the seasonal <b>bloom</b> region showing a significant, negative correlation. We tested the hypothesis that the near-surface springtime distribution of copepods that undergo diapause (Calanus finmarchicus, C. helgolandicus, C. glacialis, and C. hyperboreus) may contribute to the contrast in <b>bloom</b> development between the two regions. Peak near-surface spring abundance of the late stages of these Calanoid copepods was generally associated with areas having a well-defined seasonal <b>bloom,</b> implying a link between <b>bloom</b> shape and their abundance. We suggest that either grazing is a factor in shaping the seasonal <b>bloom</b> or <b>bloom</b> shape determines whether a habitat is conducive to diapause, while recognizing that both factors can re-enforce each other...|$|R
5|$|The Sisters faced {{controversy}} {{not only}} from public opinion, but also within the medical profession. Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive, and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie for training, which Bourget granted {{over the objections of}} the Sisters. However, friction arose between the Sisters and the students; the Sisters did not want the students present (a position shared by many of the unwed mothers), while the students were often contemptuous, rude, or dismissive towards their patients. Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters, and their non-profit mandate, this friction <b>bloomed</b> into hostility between the Sisters and Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat.|$|E

40|$|Almonds {{are one of}} {{the first}} {{commercial}} nut trees to <b>bloom</b> in early spring and thus are susceptible to temperature patterns prior to and during <b>bloom</b> which affect <b>bloom</b> timing, <b>bloom</b> length, pollination and nut set. Data used in this project include yearly dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> from 1996 - 2006, <b>bloom</b> length in days and final crop yields in pounds per tree for Nonpareil and Mission varieties. Data were collected from the University of California Cooperative Extension reports on the 1993 - 2006 Regional Almond Variety Trials in Butte, San Joaquin and Kern Counties. Temperature pattern models in the form of Chill Hours (Chill Hour Model), Chill Units (Chill Unit Model), Chill Portions (Chill Portion Model) and Growing Degree Hours (GDH°) (Heat Model) prior to <b>bloom</b> were used to predict the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> for each variety, site and year. Temperature model results were compared to averaged actual dates of 90 % <b>bloom</b> by site and variety used to predict <b>bloom</b> timing (Calendar Model). The relationship between <b>bloom</b> length in days and GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and the relationship between <b>bloom</b> length, GDH° during <b>bloom</b> and final crop yields were also evaluated. The average error in predicting the 90 % <b>bloom</b> date for both Nonpareil and Mission was smaller using the Calendar Model compared to the four temperature pattern models. The Chill Portion model did not have significantly higher average error in predicting the date of 90 % <b>bloom</b> than the Calendar model in Nonpareil. The Chill Unit and Chill Portion models had smaller errors in predicting 90 % <b>bloom</b> date than the Chill Hour or GDH° model in Mission. GDH° during <b>bloom</b> was positively correlated with <b>bloom</b> length. GDH° during the first four days of Nonpareil <b>bloom</b> was significantly correlated with crop yields, with each additional GDH° during <b>bloom</b> correlated with a 0. 4 lbs. /tree increase in crop yield. Further research is needed on specific temperature thresholds and their relationship to physiological changes during almond <b>bloom</b> and pollination. The practice of monitoring chilling and heat accumulation will allow growers to anticipate <b>bloom,</b> prepare to optimize bee activity during <b>bloom,</b> and plan for possible crop yield variations due to adverse weather conditions during <b>bloom</b> in almonds...|$|R

Decadal trends were analysed against inter-annual variability in <b>bloom</b> timing and intensity, and environmental drivers (nutrient concentration, temperature, radiation level, wind speed). Spring <b>blooms</b> developed from the south to the north, with the first <b>blooms</b> peaking mid-March in the Bay of Mecklenburg and the latest <b>bloom</b> peaks occurring mid-April in the Gulf of Finland. <b>Bloom</b> duration was similar between sea areas (43 [*]±[*] 2 day), except for shorter <b>bloom</b> duration in the Bay of Mecklenburg (36 [*]±[*] 11 day). Variability in <b>bloom</b> timing increased towards the south. <b>Bloom</b> peak chlorophyll  a concentrations were highest (and most variable) in the Gulf of Finland (20. 2 [*]±[*] 5. 7  mg m − 3) and the Bay of Mecklenburg (12. 3 [*]±[*] 5. 2  mg m − 3). <b>Bloom</b> peak chlorophyll  a concentration showed a negative trend of − 0. 31 [*]±[*] 0. 10  mg m − 3  yr − 1.

The Weibull <b>bloom</b> metric results were considered representative in the presence of <b>bloom</b> intensity trends. <b>Bloom</b> intensity was mainly determined by winter nutrient concentration, while <b>bloom</b> timing and duration co-varied with meteorological conditions.

40|$|Abstract: A <b>Bloom</b> filter is {{a compact}} data {{structure}} that supports membership queries on a set, allowing false positives. The simplicity and the excellent {{performance of a}} <b>Bloom</b> filter make it a standard data structure of great use in many network applications. In reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter, {{it is well known}} that the size of a <b>Bloom</b> filter and accordingly the number of hash indices should be increased. In this paper, we propose a new architecture reducing the false positive rate of a <b>Bloom</b> filter more efficiently. The proposed architecture uses cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters that are queried in case of positives of a main <b>Bloom</b> filter to cross-check the results. If every cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters produce negatives, the positive of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter can be determined as a false positive. The main <b>Bloom</b> filter is not necessarily large to reduce the false positive rate, since more numbers of the false positives of the main <b>Bloom</b> filter are identified by cross-checking <b>Bloom</b> filters. Simulation results show that the false positive of the proposed scheme converges to zero faster, while requiring the total memory size for <b>Bloom</b> filters smaller, than that of a single <b>Bloom</b> filter architecture...|$|R

We show that the <b>Bloom</b> paradox also applies to Counting <b>Bloom</b> Filters (CBFs), and depends on the product of the hashed counters of each element. In addition, both for <b>Bloom</b> filters and CBFs, we suggest improved architectures that deal with the <b>Bloom</b> paradox. We also provide fundamental memory lower bounds required to support element queries with limited false-positive and false-negative rates.
