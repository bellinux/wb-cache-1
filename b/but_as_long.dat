5|$|Otho and Vitellius {{realised}} {{the potential}} {{threat posed by}} the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him {{the advantage of being}} nearest to the vital province of Egypt, which controlled the grain supply to Rome. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire city garrison of Rome. Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as Galba and Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action. When Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the First Battle of Bedriacum however, the armies in Judaea and Egypt took {{matters into their own hands}} and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69. Vespasian accepted, and entered an alliance with Gaius Licinius Mucianus, the governor of Syria, against Vitellius. A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian himself travelled to Alexandria, leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The {{ranges of}} the American and Chinese {{alligator}} extend into regions that sometimes experience periods of frost in winter. Being ectothermic, the internal body temperature of crocodilians falls {{as the temperature}} drops, and they become sluggish. They may become more active on warm days, but do not usually feed at all during the winter. In cold weather, they remain submerged with their tails in deeper, less cold water and their nostrils just projecting through the surface. If ice forms on the water, they maintain ice-free breathing holes, {{and there have been}} occasions when their snouts have become frozen into the ice. Temperature sensing probes implanted in wild American alligators have found that their core body temperatures can descend to around , <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as they remain able to breathe they show no ill effects when the weather warms up.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves {{enough money to buy}} his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he has returned to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come {{under the control of the}} black man. Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as there are black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by the blacks and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E

25|$|A {{protracted}} {{conflict between}} pedestrians and cyclists plagued the seawall for years. Strolling pedestrians {{took issue with}} cyclists speeding by, while cyclists felt they {{had a right to}} cycle the seawall. As traffic increased over time, collisions were becoming more frequent. Cycling on the seawall was consequently outlawed, and by 1976, the Vancouver Police Department had issued 3,000 tickets to offenders. A solution was proposed in 1977 by a Calgary-based group of charitable foundations. It offered to pay $900,000 to widen the path on the English Bay side to six metres in order to accommodate both cyclists and pedestrians on the condition that the city match that amount. The proposal triggered an outcry from environmentalist groups, such as the Save Our Parkland Association. City council nonetheless agreed to the plan, but conflict between user groups persisted. The issue was not resolved until 1984 when the bicycle lane of the seawall was designated one-way in a counterclockwise direction around the park, which it remains today. That resolution brought fewer accidents, but as late as 1993, proposals to ban cycling on the seawall continued to be put forth. The popularity of inline skating in the 1990s also contributed to the debate over seawall use, as well as skateboarders to a lesser extent, until users were divided into wheeled versus non-wheeled camps. It appears unlikely that a consensus will emerge over the most appropriate mode of travelling the seawall, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as accidents remain minimal, it is unlikely to re-emerge as a pressing park-use issue. A survey conducted for a 1992 task force on the park found that 65% of park users were opposed to the elimination of bicycle traffic from the seawall compared with 20% who favoured such a ban. Needless to say, the task force's recommendation to phase out cycling went unheeded.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} round of the Football League Cup, Arsenal faced Manchester United at Highbury. With both {{managers}} making several first team changes to give their younger and fringe players game time, it was Arsenal who came out on top, with Wiltord scoring a hat-trick. A 2–0 win against First Division outfit Grimsby Town, who knocked out competition holders Liverpool in the previous round followed, but Arsenal was eliminated in the fifth round, losing 4–0 to Blackburn Rovers on 11 December 2001. Wenger shrugged off the significance of the defeat and suggested that a spot in Europe, given to the winners of the competition, should instead be allocated to the Premier League: [...] "I would give one more place to the championship because it's more difficult to play in the championship. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as there is a European place at stake, we will play in the competition." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay".

The former German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, also identified Russia, among other countries, as a country that backed Germany's bid. Former President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines also expressed his country's support for Germany's bid, together with Japan's.

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Grimaldi {{and his son}} first became strained during the early 1820s.

[...] He became resentful of his father and publicly shunned any association with him. [...] JS became an alcoholic and was increasingly unreliable. [...] In 1823, he became estranged from his parents, who saw their son only occasionally over the next four years, as JS {{went out of his way}} to avoid them. They communicated only through letters, with Grimaldi often sending his son notes begging for money.

500|$|The {{film has}} a 78% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 56 metascore on Metacritic. In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby, while quite {{critical}} of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as [...] "the funniest, canniest performance of his career". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and praised it for allowing [...] "all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most {{of the time we}} know what's going on. All of the time, we know why". Time magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, [...] "This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: [...] "But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult". Rita Kempley in the Washington Post wrote that the film [...] "is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally.

As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged."

500|$|When {{heard by}} the Belgian {{commission}} on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that [...] "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...)

Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: [...] "We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means..." [...] In addition, the Renseignements généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service [...] "Pastoral, sects and new beliefs" [...] ("Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: [...] "Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature." [...] Similarly, Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religious group, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it [...] "has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [...] shows no hostility towards social systems". According to Bégot, the group is a [...] "cult" [...] in the sociological language (not {{to be confused with the}} pejorative word [...] "cult"), characterized by a mystical experience, a break with the dominant religious tradition, and primacy of the individual on social issues; it has both magical and ethical dimensions.|$|E
