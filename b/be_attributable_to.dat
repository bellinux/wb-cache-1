5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, observed that Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers. The breed was considered to be a working breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Faisalabad {{was among}} four districts in Punjab, which {{included}} Gujranwala, Jhelum and Gujrat, that were experiencing low literacy rates, due primarily {{to either a}} lack of resources or family pressure; the latter of which may also <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> illiteracy. In 1998, Faisalabad progressed to a higher literacy rate with the most improvement realised at the primary school level. In 2008, Faisalabad District ranked 51.9% which placed the district 9th in literacy out of the 34 Punjab districts.|$|E

This may have been because of Mendelssohn's youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected by some to <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time {{over the next few}} years between Britain and Düsseldorf, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post as a musician) in 1833.|$|E

5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> the enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may <b>be</b> <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery of populations throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E
