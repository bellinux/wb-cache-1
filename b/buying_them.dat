5|$|The Yankees {{sought to}} develop their own players, rather than <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> from other teams, {{especially}} after the investment of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927. However, Weiss and Bill Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of Joe DiMaggio from the Pacific Coast League.|$|E
5|$|As late as December 31, neither {{team had}} sold its entire {{allotment}} of 17,500 tickets. Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> on the secondary market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E
5|$|Baird and Jackie {{were asked}} to visit Lennon at Kenwood which was his home in Weybridge in 1964. Cynthia Lennon—Lennon's wife at the time—took them both out {{shopping}} in Knightsbridge, <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> expensive clothes. During the same visit, The Beatles played at the Finsbury Park Astoria, and the sisters asked {{to be allowed to}} stand near the front, but had to be pulled out of the audience by security guards because of the crush. In December 1965, Dykins was killed in a car crash at the bottom of Penny Lane. Lennon was not told about his death for months afterwards. Dykins had married again, but Baird acknowledges that she and Jackie had very little contact with his wife, and did not attend their father's funeral.|$|E

50|$|In one episode, Jack accidentally gives {{away her}} {{favorite}} shoes to charity, and she rushes to <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> back, {{only to find}} that a poor woman is about to <b>buy</b> <b>them.</b> Karen gives the woman $500 for the shoes, and admonishes Jack not to tell anyone.|$|R

5|$|March {{was more}} {{successful}} in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> outright. Losing money on a deal to supply Jochen Neerpasch, then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to BMW and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season. March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships. However, BMW also put pressure on Herd {{to concentrate on the}} Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a race engineer.|$|E
5|$|Under manager George Scherger, the Sounds {{started the}} 1979 season poorly, before {{rallying}} to win 20 of 31games in late May and June. They entered {{the last day}} of the first half of the season in first place, but lost their game to cross-state rivals the Memphis Chicks and finished in second place. The Sounds and Chicks met again on {{the last day of}} the second half in a split doubleheader; both games were won by Nashville. The two teams then faced-off in a best-of-three series to determine the Western Division champion. The Sounds won the series, two games to one, before advancing to the Southern League championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville captured their first Southern League championship by defeating the Astros, three games to one. Schmittou wanted to give each player a $1,000 bonus for winning the pennant, but as that would have been against the National Association's rules, he settled for <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> championship rings instead. Geoff Combe, with a league-leading 27saves, won the league's Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. The Sounds compiled an 83–61 record that season. During the All-Star Break between the halves of the season, Nashville played host to the Southern League All-Star Game. The contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league Atlanta Braves. The All-Stars defeated the Braves, five to two. Nashville's Duane Walker was named the game's MVP.|$|E
25|$|A noted {{motoring}} enthusiast, he {{has owned}} {{a succession of}} Ferrari cars, but stopped <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> after realising that the depreciation and running costs were greater than hiring a private plane. In February 2016, Coogan was fined £670 and banned from driving for 28 days after being caught speeding in Brighton.|$|E

25|$|Gervais uses {{social media}} to raise {{awareness}} of animal welfare. He tweets links to petitions to rescue animals from captivity, he highlights the plight of animals being used for testing, and he encourages people to adopt dogs instead of <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> from breeders. Gervais won the Genesis Award from the Humane Society in March 2015 for his contribution to raising awareness for animal welfare on social media.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Dell {{expanded}} its product line to include televisions, handhelds, digital audio players, and printers. Chairman and CEO Michael Dell had repeatedly blocked President and COO Kevin Rollins's attempt {{to lessen the}} company's heavy dependency on PCs, which Rollins wanted to fix by acquiring EMC Corporation. In 2002, Dell started the Dell Direct Store model, opening kiosks in malls and airports in the United States to allow customers to examine products before <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> directly from the company, eventually opening 140 kiosks.|$|E
25|$|As a whole, a {{functional}} organization is best suited {{as a producer}} of standardized goods and services at large volume and low cost. Coordination and specialization of tasks are centralized in {{a functional}} structure, which makes producing {{a limited amount of}} products or services efficient and predictable. Moreover, efficiency can further be realized as functional organizations integrate their activities vertically so that products are sold and distributed quickly and at low cost. For instance, a small business could make components used in production of its products instead of <b>buying</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

I will no longer recommend his books to others, <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> as presents, or <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> for my own library. I will not attend his lectures or recommend that others do the same.|$|R
25|$|African slavery {{became more}} common in Brazil during the mid 16th century, though the {{enslavement}} of indigenous people continued into the 17th and even the 18th century in the backlands of Brazil. Indigenous slaves remained much cheaper during this time than their African counterparts, though they did suffer horrendous death rates from European diseases. Although the average African slave lived to only be twenty-three years old due to terrible work conditions, this was still about four years longer than Indigenous slaves, which was a big contribution to high price of African slaves. Even though prices for indigenous slaves were cheaper, {{there was never a}} focus on maintaining slave families. Because enslaved peoples were always so available, either through conquest or <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> through the market, the economic incentive to keep families together never manifested itself.|$|E
25|$|Factories are {{stations}} {{which use}} resources {{to create one}} or many products. The needed resources and produced wares need to be transported by a ship. Traders in the universe must move wares between the factories to keep production going; if supply exceeds demand a factory will often stop producing goods. The player can build factories by <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> at a shipyard and loading them on board a large transport ship (TL class). The player factories can own their own ships to buy resources and sell products. There are many factory options to configure the trader ships behaviour and job. Player factories can also connect to each other to share resources and products. The factories are connected through tubes and the docking bay is moved to a central complex hub.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1889, {{prerecorded}} wax cylinders were marketed. These have professionally made {{recordings of}} songs, instrumental music or humorous monologues in their grooves. At first, the only customers for them were proprietors of nickel-in-the-slot machines—the first juke boxes—installed in arcades and taverns, {{but within a}} few years private owners of phonographs were increasingly <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> for home use. Each cylinder can easily be placed on and removed from the mandrel of the machine used to play them. Unlike later, shorter-playing high-speed cylinders, early cylinder recordings were usually cut at a speed of about 120 rpm and can play for as long as 3 minutes. They were made of a relatively soft wax formulation and would wear out after they were played a few dozen times. The buyer could then use a mechanism which left their surfaces shaved smooth so new recordings could be made on them.|$|E
60|$|But {{if it is}} {{a sacred}} right for the people of Nebraska to take and hold slaves there, it is equally their sacred right to <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> where they can <b>buy</b> <b>them</b> cheapest; and that, undoubtedly, will be on the coast of Africa, {{provided}} you will consent not to hang them for going there to <b>buy</b> <b>them.</b> You must remove this restriction, too, from the sacred right of self-government. I am aware you say that taking slaves from the States to Nebraska does not make slaves of freemen; but the African slave-trader can say just as much. He does not catch free negroes and bring them here. He finds them already slaves in the hands of their black captors, and he honestly <b>buys</b> <b>them</b> at the rate of a red cotton handkerchief a head. This is very cheap, and it is a great abridgment of the sacred right of self-government to hang men for engaging in this profitable trade.|$|R

25|$|Under its eponymous founder, Osman I, the Beylik of Osmanoğlu {{expanded}} at Byzantine expense {{south and}} west of the Sea of Marmara in {{the first decades of}} the 14th century. With their annexation of the neighboring Beylik of Karasi and their advance into Roumelia as of 1354, they soon became strong enough to emerge as the main rivals of Karamanids, who at that time were thought to be the strongest. Towards the end of the 14th century, the Ottomans advanced further into Anatolia by acquiring towns, either by <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> off or through marriage alliances. Meanwhile, the Karamanids assaulted the Ottomans many times with the help of other beyliks, Mamluks, Aq Qoyunlu ("White Sheep Turkomans"), Byzantines, Pontics and Hungarians, failing and losing power every time. By the close of the century, the early Ottoman leaders had conquered large parts of land from Karamanids and other less prominent beyliks. These had a short respite when their territories were restored to them after the Ottoman defeat suffered against Tamerlane in 1402 in the Battle of Ankara.|$|E
25|$|Many {{historians have}} since decried this decision, arguing {{the lack of}} modern arms on the Union side, {{at a time when}} the Confederates were <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> in large numbers from France and the United Kingdom, {{lengthened}} the conflict by as much as two years. Others, however, counter that given the poor logistics of the Union armies at the outbreak of the war, the increased supply train needed to maintain the improved rates of fire would have bogged down the armies and made maneuver impossible (a situation which did indeed later contribute to the development of trench warfare in World War I). It is also argued that fouling due to black powder residue would have made it impossible to maintain such high rates of fire under field conditions with the rifles of the time. Individual units later purchased such weapons privately, and they were used to considerable effect, but did indeed present problems in extended firefights; these units are not known to have had any trouble maintaining their ammunition supplies. Ripley was replaced as head of the Ordnance Department on September 15, 1863 principally because of his continuing opposition to the introduction of breech loading rifles.|$|E
25|$|The mode is {{an update}} to the Ultimate Team mode from FIFA 09. Users {{who owned the}} {{original}} Ultimate Team were given two free Gold packs after creating their team, along with a date below the teams name to show the year the team was founded. Like the original, each team is given a full team of players to begin with, along with a stadium, emblem and a home and away kit. New players, staff and items can be purchased from the 6 different pack types available, split into three categories(Gold, Silver and Bronze), or by trading with other users by bidding on cards they are opting to sell, offering them deals or <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> for a specific price. The in-game currency is coins, which are awarded for playing games, playing in tournaments or trading with other users. Bonus coins are awarded for completing different requirements, such as winning a game, being awarded Man of the Match and for possession and passing accuracy. The card packs for Ultimate Team still have basic Bronze Packs (500 coins), Silver Packs (2500 coins) and Gold Packs (5000 Coins), but now also have a bonus pack in each category, called Premium Packs, costing slightly more coins (Bronze cost 750, Silver cost 3250 and Gold cost 7500) but giving 3 rare cards, instead of the 1 given in basic packs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Pablo Escobar kept four hippos {{in a private}} menagerie at his {{residence}} in Hacienda Nápoles, [...] east of Medellín, Colombia, after <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> in New Orleans. They were deemed too difficult to seize and move after Escobar's death, and hence left on the untended estate. By 2007, the animals had multiplied to 16 and had taken to roaming the area for food in the nearby Magdalena River.|$|E
500|$|Tracy Jordan's pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer, {{has been}} very {{successfully}} released since it {{was developed in the}} previous episode [...] "Cooter". He shows off a large royalty check and Jenna Maroney grows angry that she has not been compensated for her voice acting work in the game. Liz convinces him to make it up to her, and everyone else who helped him with the video game, by <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> presents. However, while everyone else receives extravagant gifts such as Frank getting gold-plated nunchucks and Pete getting a chinchilla fur coat, Jenna only gets a coupon for free hugs and decides to sue Tracy.|$|E
500|$|As {{a son of}} Queen Victoria's {{deceased}} prince consort, Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Victoria Melita's father, Prince Alfred, was in {{the line}} of succession to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the sovereign German duchy ruled by Albert's elder brother, Ernest II, until his death in 1893. Alfred became heir presumptive to the duchy when his older brother, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII), deferred his Saxon succession rights in favour of his younger brothers. Alfred and his family therefore moved to Coburg in 1889. Their mother immediately began attempting to [...] "Germanise" [...] her daughters by installing a new governess, <b>buying</b> <b>them</b> plain clothing, and having them confirmed in the German Lutheran church, even though they had previously been raised as Anglicans. The children rebelled and some of the new restrictions were eased.|$|E

This gave rise to great variability in manufacture and even in design details. These issues are often observed unnamed, although the official version was normally named on the edge.|$|R
