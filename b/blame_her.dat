500|$|James and Mona Rocha {{argued that}} while [...] "Veronica showed poor {{judgment}} in the episode, {{the blame for}} her rape should not be put on her—instead, Dick, Logan, Sean, Dick, and Cassidy (Beaver) should take the blame.

[...] Regarding Logan, they stated that [...] "she wouldn't have been raped, if not for Logan's buying the GHB." [...] On Dick, they wrote that [...] "Dick didn't intend to drug Veronica, but he did intend to drug someone." [...] The pair argued that Veronica made some choices that were causally related to her rape, but they concluded {{that she did not}} deserve blame. [...] "If someone like Veronica makes a bad prudential choice that causes her harm, then maybe she should blame herself, but we can't <b>blame</b> <b>her</b> for any moral wrong done to her as a result.

During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view?

500|$|Directed by Hannah Lux Davis, it is Aguilera's first {{music video}} as a soloist {{in four years}} and, despite the song being more than three minutes long, the video itself is 96 seconds in length.

500|$|Viewers saw {{the slow}} {{build-up}} to Pauline's climactic exit throughout {{the latter part}} of 2006. The character's bitter decline involves depression, pretending to have a brain tumour to scupper the revived relationship between her son Martin and his ex-wife Sonia, marital breakdown, and finally ostracism after Martin and the rest of Albert Square discover her lie. Having successfully alienated everyone around her, Pauline plans to go to America to join her daughter. Wendy Richard commented on the reasons behind Pauline's actions: [...] "she cannot forgive. For anyone to hurt a member of her family so badly is incomprehensible to Pauline. She is a good, but unforgiving woman. Sonia {{is more than just a}} thorn in Pauline's side. She is angry because she feels Martin has let her down in returning to Sonia. She feels he could have discussed it with her more and talked her round for the sake of Rebecca. Pauline will <b>blame</b> <b>her</b> decision to leave on Sonia—another way of punishing Martin. Even though she is really hurting over leaving Rebecca, Pauline is determined to go. She realised she never really loved Joe, he has lied to her too many times... Although I know Pauline better than anyone, even I cannot fathom out why she made up the brain tumour story." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the wake}} of the shooting, Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of {{political}} rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship. On the eve of the shooting, Giffords had written to a Republican friend, Trey Grayson, Secretary of State of Kentucky, saying, [...] "we need {{to figure out how to}} tone our rhetoric and partisanship down." [...] In March 2010, Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats, including Giffords's, in Arizona's 8th district. Shortly after the map's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month, Giffords said, [...] "We're in Sarah Palin's 'targeted' list, but the thing is that the way she has it depicted, we're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district. When people do that, they've got to realize that there are consequences to that action." [...] At that point in the interview, however, the interviewer said, [...] "campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years." [...] The image was removed from Palin's [...] "takebackthe20" [...] website following the January shootings. Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video, rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting, and accusing the press of manufacturing a [...] "blood libel" [...] to <b>blame</b> <b>her</b> and the right wing for the attacks.|$|E
