5|$|At {{some point}} after leaving Switzerland and {{arriving}} in England, Rossier was commissioned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Negretti and Zambra {{to travel to}} China to photograph the Second Opium War (18581860). It {{may be that the}} firm considered Rossier's Swiss citizenship an asset for such a voyage, that his country's neutrality might help him find passage aboard either British or French ships. Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{how much of}} the gains from productivity spillovers through worker mobility is retained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hiring <b>firms,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> workers who bring spillovers, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> other workers. Using linked employer-employee data from Danish manufacturing for the period 1995 - 2007, we find that at least two-thirds of the total output gain of 0. 11 % per year is netted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms,</b> while <b>the</b> workers who bring spillovers receive at most 6 % of it as the wage premium. The large share retained <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> implies that spillovers through worker mobility are mostly a positive externality to them...|$|R

5|$|Although {{working within}} the Neo-Gothic school of design, they {{differed}} from Neo-Gothic architects like Gilbert Scott who simply included certain Gothic features on modern styles of building; instead they sought to return completely to Medieval Gothic methods of craftmanship. The products created <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Firm</b> included furniture, architectural carving, metalwork, stained glass windows, and murals. Their stained glass windows proved a particular success in the firm's early years {{as they were in}} high demand for the surge in the Neo-Gothic construction and refurbishment of churches, many of which were commissioned by the architect George Frederick Bodley. Despite Morris's anti-elitist ethos, the Firm soon became increasingly popular and fashionable with the bourgeoisie, particularly following their exhibit at the 1862 International Exhibition in South Kensington, where they received press attention and medals of commendation. However, they faced much opposition from established design companies, particularly those belonging to the Neo-Classical school.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Louisville factory owner Alfred Victor du Pont donated $150,000 to {{the board}} of Louisville Public Schools to {{establish}} a training school to teach young men industrial arts ("manual") skills that would fit them for their duties in life. The Victorian building was built on the corner of Brook and Oak Streets <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Clark and Loomis, which also designed the Speed Art Museum and Waverly Hills Sanatorium. After Manual moved out of the building it was used as a Middle School until 1974 when it was converted to apartments. Manual's first principal, Henry Kleinschmid, was a favorite of du Pont but was unpopular with the school board, which conspired to replace him in 1895. Despite a summer of controversy and protest from the du Pont family, Manual's first two graduating classes and the four major local newspapers, the board replaced him with Harry Brownell on July 2.|$|E

40|$|Future wage {{payments}} drive a {{wedge between}} total <b>firm</b> output and <b>the</b> output share received <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> owners, thus potentially distorting strategic decisions <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> owners such as, e. g., whether to continue <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> sell it, or shut it down. Using an optimal contracting approach, we show that the unique optimal firm-wide employee compensation scheme from this perspective is a broad-based option plan. Broad-based option pay minimizes <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> expected future wage payments in states of nature where <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> is only marginally profitable, thus making continuation as attractive as possible in precisely those states of nature where, e. g., a high fixed wage would lead <b>the</b> <b>firm’s</b> owners to inefficiently exit. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This underscores the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom is {{historically}} significant {{as a historical}} reminder of the pivotal time in which Pawtucket was incorporated as a city and gave up its town-meeting form of governance.

Walker & Son constructed three such structures in Pawtucket with the First Ward Wardroom being extant and the third example having been demolished. Though both constructed by William R. Walker & Son, the two Pawtucket wardrooms are related, but not identical in construction and show variations <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> Another wardroom, with a bungalow style, is located in the Cato Hill Historic District in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R.

This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four {{miles east of the}} university campus and housed a 9.5-inch refractor, and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> of Walker and Weeks.

With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu {{for the better part}} of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released in the summer of 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
