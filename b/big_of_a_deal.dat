5000|$|Allmusic - [...] "Four {{years after}} his debut album, The RBX Files, RBX resurfaced on Street Solid with his sophomore effort, No Mercy, No Remorse/The X-Factor. While a {{four-year}} wait between albums wouldn't be as <b>big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> in jazz, blues, pop, or country, it's an eternity in hip-hop -- a genre in which trends and tastes can change radically {{in the course of}} a few years. And when you consider that the release of The RBX Files was delayed a few years because of RBX's problems with Dr. Dre in the early 1990s, you're really talking more than a four-year gap between albums. But delays and all, RBX's rapping style still sounds quite fresh on this 1999 CD...No Mercy, No Remorse/The X-Factor is a respectable, long overdue follow-up from an MC who should have recorded a lot more often in the 1990s." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Matthew Tsani of AbsolutePunk did frankly state, [...] "In the end, the main letdown {{of the album}} {{is the fact that}} this band had an ample amount of {{potential}} to write songs that could very well make them the next decent pop-punk hit, but instead are writing songs that prompt people to categorize them as merely “generic.” Whether this is because of the influence of the label or not is not really that <b>big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> What is important, however, is that Capital Lights swim themselves out of this monotonous sea of electro-pop before they make another album. In the meantime, fans will still have fun with This Is an Outrage!" [...] Matt Conner of CCM Magazine negatively said: [...] "Unfortunately, the bottom line is set low as many other bands simply do it better. If Tooth & Nail sticks with them, maturity is certainly a possibility as seen with other bands (i.e. Relient K). But for now, Capital Lights fails to make its mark." ...|$|E

5000|$|Like {{historical}} accounts, {{journalism and}} news media {{can also be}} framed in the dominant narrative lens. This like historical dominant narrative can affect what news people are actually being exposed to. This is problematic because only news that the dominant narrative deems important receives the most media attention. An example of the dominant narrative at play in the media {{can be seen in}} the events of the Rwandan Genocide, this genocide was almost completely ignored by western media and news. This genocide consists of the ethnic majority group, the Hutu, attempting to extinguish the Tutsi ethnic group. The Rwanda Genocide was first not framed by the media as a genocide, in an attempt to ignore the severity of the event. The early events of the Rwandan Genocide where minimalized as a way to excuse a lack of intervention by many countries. Since the events in Rwanda did not directly affect US citizens the genocide did not seem to be as <b>big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> in media, especially because the genocide consisted of black non-Americans this genocide was hardly discussed, as it is a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{is said to}} be {{influenced}} by a broad range of music and as individuals they possess different influences. Post-hardcore bands like Thursday, Refused, At the Drive-In, It's Not That <b>Big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Deal,</b> MKC and Glassjaw are just some examples of commonalities amongst the band. Drummer Brad Vander Lugt has said that the band with each record takes influences from other artists and musicians who are [...] "pushing the envelope and challenging themselves." [...] Vander Lugt personally cites his influences from blues and jazz musicians. Dreyer has stated his lyrical influences are derived from fiction writers rather than from poetry, as he likes to approach writing through stories and different characters. Particularly citing Kurt Vonnegut, Vladimir Nabokov as literary influences, and cites books from Nabokov like Pale Fire and Lolita as some of his favorites. The band credits now defunct Michigan based rock bands Ivan and Coal Black Horse as having a significant influence on La Dispute. Jacob Fricke of The Badger Herald commented on how Black Flag's third album combination of spoken word on its A-side and their typical [...] "hard-and-fast punk" [...] on the B-side acted as an influence on La Dispute's style.|$|E

On October 23, 2014, it was announced that McCreary was promoted to series regular after being credited as guest-starring until the eleventh episode. It was a couple of months after McCreary wrapped her stint on Scandal that she was invited to audition for Grey's. McCeary revealed that she originally auditioned for the character of [...] "Claudette" [...] with dummy sides, unbeknownst to her. The only information McCeary had about the character was [...] "that she was adopted, that she would recur, {{and she was going to}} be a very important storyline." [...] Just before the script reading for the season 10 finale, Rhimes summoned McCeary to inform her of Maggie's true identity. [...] "I was really psyched" [...] McCeary revealed when Rhimes informed her of Maggie's lineage. [...] "I felt really honored to be the one to accept the challenge." [...] However, it wasn't until McCeary experienced the reactions to Maggie's existence from her fellow cast mates that McCeary realized just how <b>big</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> the character would be.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the significance of}} participant assigned acceptability ratings for the post-adjectival degree construction ADJ (of/ 0) NP. The majority of studies in sociolinguistic variation have investigated phonological variables, such as alveolarization of (ing) and reduction or deletion of (t/d). Studies on syntactic variation often examine multiple realizations of a variable or the distribution of several variables. However, we base our study on Rickford et al. ’s (1995) finding that syntactic variables can also be successfully isolated. In the present study, we describe a current change in progress involving a previously unstudied syntactic variable: post-adjectival (of) in degree constructions such as “It’s not that <b>big</b> (<b>of)</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> ” We analyzed 3, 600 tokens collected from 150 participants in the Washington, DC, area, and found significance in participant age, participant ethnicity, and the linguistic conditioning of the phrase, all affecting the acceptability rating given to the construction. Most notably, we found that acceptability of (of) is negatively correlated with age. The younger participants showed a strong preference for constructions with (of), whereas older informants overall preferred (0) constructions. Our findings suggest that this feature {{is part of an}} ongoing change in progress in Washington, DC...|$|E
