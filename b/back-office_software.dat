50|$|Retail <b>Back-office</b> <b>software</b> is used {{to manage}} {{business}} operations that {{are not related to}} direct sales efforts and interfaces that are not seen by consumers. Typically, the business processes managed with <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> include some combination of inventory control, price book management, manufacturing, and supply chain management (SCM). <b>Back-office</b> <b>software</b> is distinct from front-office software, which typically refers to customer relationship management (CRM) software used for managing sales, marketing, and other customer-centric activities.|$|E
50|$|Cloud-based <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> {{provides}} the functionality necessary to manage numerous back-office functions {{from a single}} web-based interface. Many <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> platforms can be accessed from both mobile and desktop devices, and are cross compatible with back-office accounting software such as Quickbooks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Back-office</b> <b>software</b> {{solutions}} {{have evolved}} {{with the emergence}} of cloud-based Software as a service (SaaS). Several <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> providers offer cloud-based services that simplify and streamline back-office management functions, particularly for companies with multiple locations. These simplified platforms have given companies an alternative to business process outsourcing (BPO), which involves handing over the management of a company's back-office to a third-party service provider. With <b>back-office</b> <b>software,</b> companies can derive actionable intelligence from the system without any particular expertise.|$|E

40|$|I {{was talking}} with some friends recently, friends who don't own a computer. They were {{thinking}} of getting one so they could use Amazon. com to buy books and CDs. Not to use “the Internet,''not to use “the Web,''but to use Amazon. com. Now, that's the classic definition of a “killer application'': one that makes someone {{go out and buy}} a computer. What's interesting is that the killer application is no longer a desktop productivity application or even a <b>back-office</b> enterprise <b>software</b> system, but an individual web site. And once you start thinking of web sites as applications, you soon come to realize that they represent an entirely new breed, something you might call an “information application,''or perhaps even “infoware. ''Information applications are used to computerize tasks that just couldn't be handled in the old computing model. A few years ago, if you wanted to search a database of a million books, you talked to a librarian, who knew the arcane search syntax of the available computerized search tools and might be able to find what you wanted. If you wanted to buy a book, you went to a bookstore, and looked through its relatively small selection. Now, tens of thousands of people with no specialized training find and buy books online from that million-record database every day. The secret is that computers have come one step closer to the way that people communicate with each other. Web-based applications use plain English to build their interface [...] words and pictures, not specialized little controls that acquire meaning only as you learn the software. Traditional software embeds small amounts of information in a lot of software, infoware embeds small amounts of software in a lot of information. The “actions''in an infoware product are generally fairly simple: make a choice, buy or sell, enter a small amount of data, and get back a customized result...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{economy has}} a huge {{dependence}} on financial services, and this is increasingly based on digital platforms. Innovating new economic models around consumer financial services {{through the use of}} digital technologies is seen as increasingly important in developed economies. There are a number of drivers for this, ranging from national economic factors to the prosaic nature of enabling cheap, speedy and timely interactions for users. The potential for these new digital solutions is that they will allay an over-reliance on the traditional banking sector, which has proved itself to be unstable and risky, and we have seen a number of national policy moves to encourage growth in this sector. Partly {{as a result of the}} 2008 banking crisis, there has been an explosion in peer-to-peer financial services for non-professional consumers. These organisations act as intermediaries between users looking to trade goods or credit. However, building self-sustaining or profitable financial services within this novel space is itself fraught with commercial, regulatory, technical and social problems. This document reports on the value, use and interpretation of infrastructure in digital intermediaries to their users, describing analysis of contextual field studies carried out in two retail digital financial intermediary organisations: Zopa Limited and the Bristol Pound. It forms the second milestone document in the 3 DaRoC project, developing patterns of use that have arisen on the back of the technical infrastructures in the two organisations that form cases for examination. Its purpose is to examine how the two different technical infrastructures that underpin the transactions that they support–composed of the <b>back-office</b> hardware and <b>software,</b> data structures, the networking and communications technologies used, supported consumer devices, and the user interfaces and interaction design–have provided opportunities for users to realise their financial and other needs. While we orient towards the issues of service use (and its problems), we also examine the activities and expectations of their various users. Our research has involved teams from Lancaster University examining Zopa and Brunel University focusing on the Bristol Pound over approximately a one-year period from October 2013 to October 2014. Extensive interviews, document analysis, observation of user interactions, and other methods have been employed to develop the process analyses of the firms presented here. This report comprises of three key sections: descriptions of the user demographics for Zopa and the Bristol Pound, a discussion about the user experience and its role in community, and an examination of the role of usage data in the development of these a products. We conclude with final analytical section drawing preliminary conclusions from the research presented...|$|R

It provides both electronic trading platforms and <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> to manage a company's operations through its various subsidiaries.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{cloud-based}} HR solutions available for payroll management, timesheet tracking, and hiring. Using cloud-based HR software for payroll management is particularly advantageous because the software usually has up-to-date information on local tax rules, which otherwise require specialized tax knowledge. HR departments use <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> to match labor supply with demand based on sales forecasts.|$|E
50|$|Though {{turnover}} ratios {{depend on}} demand-side {{factors such as}} how desirable a product is, they can be increased through efficient back-office management. For instance, a case study involving a Pittsburgh-based convenience store operator showed {{that the company was}} able to achieve an average turnover ratio of 16.12 (compared to the 2013 US convenience store average of 11.36) by using cloud-based <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> for inventory management.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> {{reduces the}} {{likelihood}} of inventory record inaccuracies, they can still occur if items are not properly tracked as they enter/exit the retail space. One way to limit the impact of record inaccuracy {{is to use a}} Bayesian belief network of the physical inventory, creating a probability distribution that is updated as inventory inaccuracies are discovered. The application of Bayesian principles to inventories can avoid instances of inventory freezing (when physical inventory levels reach zero but records indicate otherwise).|$|E
50|$|<b>Back-office</b> <b>software</b> {{can also}} be used to account for the effects of demand {{substitution}} and subsequently determine the optimal inventory level for each item stocked. Researchers have attempted to predict the increases in demand for complementary items (resulting from demand substitution) using a probabilistic model for selecting item inventory levels in order to maximize expected profit. Another study employed a stochastic model to optimize the inventory management process at Spain-based retailer Zara: the new model increased sales by $275 million (3-4%) in 2007 and Zara continues to use the process for all of its products and at all retail locations.|$|E

According to Long, [...] "We had to become a global company to become an American one." [...] With Continuum finding success overseas {{as well as in the}} United States, it was valued at $1.7 billion and sold to Computer Sciences Corp. Long would stay with the newly combined company for one year.|$|E
50|$|Companies in the {{convenience}} and retail industries use <b>back-office</b> <b>software</b> to manage inventory and identify opportunities to improve profit margins by keeping popular items in stock, preventing spoilage and shrink, {{as well as}} reducing overstock of unpopular items (by offering discounts and promotions, for example). Software allows back-office store operators to forecast inventory levels based on sales volumes and therefore optimize the store's turnover ratios (the ratio of how many times inventory is sold and replaced over a given period). Moreover, the measurement of inventory performance data allows store operators to benchmark their performance with published industry averages (e.g. from the National Association of Convenience Stores).|$|E
50|$|In later years, ICL {{attempted}} to diversify its product line but {{the bulk of}} its profits always depended on the mainframe customer base. New ventures included marketing a range of powerful IBM clones made by Fujitsu, various minicomputer and personal computer ranges and (more successfully) a range of retail point-of-sale equipment and <b>back-office</b> <b>software.</b> Despite significant sales in overseas markets, ICL's mainframe base was dominated by large contracts from the UK public sector. Significant customers included Post Office Ltd, the Inland Revenue, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence. ICL also had a strong market share with UK local authorities and (at that time) nationalized utilities including the water, electricity, and gas boards. The company was eventually acquired by Fujitsu, and in April 2002 it was rebranded as Fujitsu.|$|E
