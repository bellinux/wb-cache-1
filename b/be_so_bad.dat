500|$|The Chicago Cubs {{decided to}} give Neuer a tryout, hoping to add some {{pitching}} depth to help them, {{as they were in}} a pennant race. He did not make the roster, and was sent to the Johnstown Johnnies of the Tri-State League, where he finished the 1908 season. In 1909, he was increasingly referred to with the nickname of [...] "Tacks", a nickname reserved for [...] "restless, uneasy, erratic athletes", due to both his lack of control and his general inconsistency on the mound. That season, he played with many teams, both professional and semi-pro, and was frequently released to his inability to control the ball. The following year, he attempted one more comeback with the Binghamton Bingoes of the New York State League. Manager Jack Warner found his control to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that he refused to use him in a regular season game, and Neuer's release from Binghamton marked the end of his professional career.|$|E
500|$|After a minute, Sirhan {{wrestled}} {{free and}} grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. [...] Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: [...] "I knew immediately it was a [...]22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> but then I saw {{the hole in the}} Senator's head, and I knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E
500|$|The play {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews, {{although some}} critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have you brought the cocaine?" [...] and [...] "You make my heart laugh and I feel like a woman of the streets." [...] Delivered seriously, this dialog drew laughter from the audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] in June {{marked the}} end of Button's superiority over the field, and was the first in a string of poor results for him. He {{achieved}} only sixth place, followed by a fifth place in Germany, as the Red Bull cars dominated both races. Brawn GP were hopeful of a strong result in the , as the car had been significantly updated and was usually at its best in hot conditions. However, Button struggled with tyre temperatures and achieved a season-worst seventh place; during the race, he asked frustratedly over team radio, [...] "How can this car <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> at the moment?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After Toole's death, Thelma Toole became {{mired in}} {{depression}} {{for two years}} and the manuscript for Dunces remained atop an armoire in his former room. She then became determined to have it published, believing it would be an opportunity to prove her son's talent. Over a five-year period, she sent it out to seven publishers and they each rejected it. [...] "Each time it came back I died a little," [...] she said. However, in 1976 she became aware that author Walker Percy was becoming a faculty member at Loyola University New Orleans. Thelma began a campaign of phone calls and letters to Percy to get him to read the manuscript. He even began complaining to his wife about a peculiar old woman's attempts to contact him. With time running out on his term as professor, Thelma pushed her way into his office and demanded he read the manuscript. Initially hesitant, Percy agreed to read the book to stop her badgering. He admitted to hoping it would <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that he could discard it after reading a few pages. Ultimately, he loved the book, commenting in disbelief: ...|$|E

Most students {{of his books}} would hesitate about accepting Renan's judgment, that he [...] "was certainly the most remarkable man in the French clergy of our day" [...] (op. cit., 273). Robert Irwin states that Renan said his own grasp of Arabic <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> because his teacher's <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Monica Herrera of Rolling Stone {{stated that}} [...] "the Compton MC doesn't {{seem to have}} given his long-delayed fourth album top priority." [...] however commented [...] "It's proof that, just when you least expect it, he can still rage compellingly." [...] Jayson Greene of The Village Voice gave a mixed review, writing [...] "when there is a firm hand reining him in, Game can still make good rap music. Left to his own devices, however, he {{produces}} a dismaying mess." [...] Chase McMullen of One Thirty BPM expressed a mixed response towards the album, stating [...] "With this mixed bag he's likely cemented {{his reputation as a}} MC that was blessed with a sack of classic beats for his debut, now just a rapper like the rest of 'em." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN wrote [...] "Fortunately, Game is on point most of the time here, delivering an excellent piece of hardened west coast rap leaving you wanting the two albums he promises before quitting rap as soon as possible." [...] Anupa Mistry of Now felt that [...] "The features wouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> if Game didn’t yield to the wattage and personalities of his co-stars. (Again, he can rap when he tries.) Used as a constant crutch, however, they quell his ferocity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regina later {{arrives with}} a locator spell {{to make their}} {{tracking}} of Emma easier. However, after Henry mentioned that Emma drove off, Hook suspects that Emma went to see Gold, so he sneaks off and makes {{a phone call to}} warn Emma about Gold's deception. Meanwhile, David and Mary Margret decide that it might not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> if Emma got rid of her magic and became [...] "normal," [...] which causes Elsa, who overhead their conversation, to sneak out of the room with the locator potion to try to find Emma on her own. Hook isn't the only one to suspect Gold, as Ingrid soon discovers Gold's plot after he visits her. It turns out that he needs Emma's power, which means that in order to do that, he has betrayed Ingrid by preventing her from taking Emma. When Ingrid tries to stop Gold, he uses a spell that he collected from remnants of the urn, creating a force field to prevent Ingrid from warning Emma or interfering in the events to come. As Ingrid sees Emma traveling to the mansion, Ingrid uses her mirror to send an illusion of her to stop Emma. When Emma sees the sudden appearance of Ingrid's figure {{in the middle of the}} road, her car spins out of control and crashes, causing Emma to temporarily lose consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|Gromyko was {{appointed}} Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations (UN) in April 1946. The USSR supported {{the election of}} the first Secretary-General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, a former Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, in the opinion of Gromyko, Lie became an active supporter of the [...] "expansionist behaviour" [...] of the United States and its [...] "American aggressionist" [...] policy. Because of this political stance, Gromyko believed Lie to be a poor Secretary-General. Trygve's successor, Swede Dag Hammarskjöld also promoted what Gromyko saw as [...] "anti-Soviet policies". U Thant, the third Secretary-General, once told Gromyko that it was close to impossible to have an objective opinion of the USSR in the Secretariat of the United Nations because the majority of secretariat members were of American ethnicity or supporters of the United States. Gromyko often used the Soviet veto power {{in the early days of}} the United Nations. So familiar was a Soviet veto in the early days of the UN that Gromyko became known as Mr Nyet, literally meaning [...] "Mr No". During the first 10 years of the UN, the Soviet Union used its veto 79 times. In the same period, the Republic of China used the veto once, France twice and the others not at all. [...] On May 14, 1947, Gromyko advocated the one-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the two-state solution as the second best option in the case that [...] "relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine... proved to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> that it would be impossible to reconcile them".|$|E

2500|$|In response, {{the firm}} {{responsible}} for the device, EMP Pad Limited, said it {{did not agree with}} his claim [...] "in any way, shape or form", and that they had not paid him in relation to it. While EMP Pad Limited said it did not pay Edmonds to promote the product, the company's owner Maria Robertson, previously worked as an assistant to the TV presenter and acknowledged having known Edmonds for 25 years and having worked with him and his daughter. Cancer Research UK produced an article to reassure the public that [...] "the best studies looking at this topic have failed to show a link between emotional stress and an increased risk of cancer" [...] and that [...] "no reliable evidence has ever been produced that Rife machines – or any similar devices producing low-frequency electromagnetic pulses – have any benefit for cancer patients. Nor have organisations that scrutinise new treatments and devices (like the US Food and Drug Authority or the European Medicines Agency) approved any as a therapy for any type of disease". Dr David Grimes, a cancer researcher at Oxford University, told ‘This Morning’: [...] "It’s not just untrue, it’s patronising and victim blaming, cancer is bad luck... the healthiest people in the world get cancer and it’s not because they are negative". Prof. John Gribben, Chair of Medical Oncology at Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is complete gibberish and undermines all the good work everyone does with evidence-based medicine and targeted approaches". Prof. Edzard Ernst, Emeritus Professor at the University Of Exeter said “The reason why most of us put ‘negative energy’ in inverted commas is simple: it is a pure figment of the imagination of fantasists. That would not <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> except that, as we see, some VIPs seem to take this nonsense seriously. The result might be that some desperate patients believe them, and choose the nonsense over the best that real medicine has to offer. And that could hasten deaths.” ...|$|E
