5|$|At {{the end of}} 1877, PedroII paid a {{visit to}} Caxias and ascertained that he could no longer remain in office. The entire cabinet {{resigned}} on 1 January 1878. His health problems had become so troubling that he had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> repeatedly to resign since early 1876. Caxias was not only afflicted by concerns over his declining health, but increasingly felt a sense of alienation. He did not feel he could play a relevant role in politics. He belonged to an older generation who perceived the Emperor (and consequently, the monarchy) as essential for holding the nation together.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{days after}} the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese {{property}} consultant, became the first arguido. Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, Casa Liliana, 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in {{the direction in which}} the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an arguido after a Sunday Mirror journalist told police he had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> {{a lot of questions about}} the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that Kate had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> about him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling. Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). He also moves into Number 24.|$|E

25|$|Robert Entman, {{professor}} of communication at the George Washington University and critic of mainstream media for decades, indicated {{it was a}} very wise tactic from the Pentagon. He mentioned there were more chances for the journalists to make favorable reports whilst in Iraq with British and American soldiers than if they had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> questions in Washington. Entman indicated there is a natural cultural bias of American journalists in favor of military troops of their own country and that journalists do like to satisfy the government upon which they rely for information, as well as the public on whom they depend commercially. Entman also mentioned the high number of retired generals making comments on TV, pointing out these could not be considered independent experts as they were still paid by the government. He claims the British Broadcasting Corporation was much more neutral and informative on cultural and historical background than most American television reports.|$|E
25|$|According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon, it was {{the king}} that first sued for peace with the rebel brothers. Despite his success in retaking Donwun, he was still {{concerned}} about a potential interference by Lan Na. (The marriage alliance between the two states was at a breaking point. His daughter Tala Mi Thiri was never happy at Chiang Mai, and had <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> her father {{to bring her back}} for several years.) The brothers too were interested in an agreement that would preserve their status. The two sides then agreed to a treaty that called for U to recognize the brothers as the rightful viceroys of Martaban and Bassein (Irrawaddy delta) provinces, and to pay them 10 viss (16.33 kg) of gold and ten elephants in exchange for the brothers' recognition of U as their sovereign as well as brokering of an agreement with Lan Na to maintain peace. As the Razadarit Ayedawbon recounts, U realized the absurdity of the overlord paying tribute to the vassals but he ultimately decided to swallow his pride, and agreed to the terms. On the other hand, Byattaba and Laukpya realized that they needed Lan Na's support in order to neutralize Pegu's stronger position. The brothers sent 15 viss (24.49 kg) of gold in total to retain Chiang Mai's support. The king of Lan Na sent back Tala Mi Thiri to Pegu.|$|E

25|$|Besides {{actively}} {{participating in}} the current discussions on evolutionary theory and genetics, Mosterín has also tackled issues like the definition of life itself or the ontology of biological organisms and species. Following in Aristotle’s and Schrödinger’s footsteps, he has <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> the simple question: what is life? He has analyzed the main proposed definitions, based on metabolism, reproduction, thermodynamics, complexity and evolution, and found all of them wanting. It is true that all organisms on Earth share many characteristics, from the encoding of genetic information in DNA to the storage of energy in ATP, but these common features merely reflect the inheritance from a common ancestor that possibly acquired them in a random way. From that point of view, our biology is the parochial science of life on Earth, rather than a universal science of life in general. Such a general biology seems impossible, {{as long as we}} do not detect and come to know other forms of life in the galaxy (if they exist). Concerning the ontological thesis of Michael Ghiselin and David Hull on the individuality of biological species, Mosterín shows that they are neither classes nor individuals in the usual meaning of these words. He tries to extend and make more precise the available conceptual framework of the discussion. Specifically, he shows the formal equivalence of the set-theoretical and the mereological (or part and individual) approach, so that everything that can be said about the classes can be translated into the jargon of individuals, and the other way around. All these concerns converge in his recent philosophy of animality, which combines the ontology of animals as paradigmatic individuals with the insights and results of biological research. This general theory of animals provides a solid foundation for the development of anthropology, conceived as the science of human primates.|$|E

[...] To prepare, Torv sought advice from her fellow star John Noble, as both as a friend and because Noble's character, Walter, had spent the most time with Bell. She took further advice from the show's dialect coach and reviewed footage of Nimoy's previous work, though eventually she decided to jump right into the role. Noble later commented [...] "I think the solutions she came up with – taking the essence of the man, playing with the eyebrows, simulating the voice — were really smart.

500|$|King and AnneMarie Luijendijk, an {{associate}} professor of religion at Princeton University, named the fragment the [...] "Gospel of Jesus's Wife" [...] for reference purposes but have since acknowledged that the name was inflammatory. Asked about her handling of the public disclosure of the fragment, King admitted that she had [...] "...misjudged just how inflammatory that title would turn out to be". According to Tom Bartlett of The Chronicle of Higher Education, [...] "she's <b>been</b> <b>asking</b> around for ideas on a new, less exciting name". They further suggested the text was written by Egyptian Christians before AD 400; it is in the language they believed was used by those people at that time. They considered that the papyrus fragment comes from a codex, rather than a scroll, as text appears on both sides. King has stated that the fragment should not be taken as proof that the historical Jesus got married. Testing has dated the papyrus itself to somewhere between the seventh and ninth centuries, and Professor Christian Askeland of Indiana Wesleyan University has shown that the text is written in Lycopolitan, a Coptic dialect that fell out of use during or prior to the sixth century.|$|E
