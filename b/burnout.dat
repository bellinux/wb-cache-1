5|$|Criterion and EA officially {{announced}} their partnership for <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown in March 2004. The game was showcased at several trade shows throughout the year, including E3. <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles on 8 September 2004 in North America, and 10 September 2004 in Europe. In Japan, the game released on 14 October 2004 {{and was only}} available on the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version of the game included a demo for EA's , which was scheduled to launch a month after <b>Burnout</b> 3. Likewise, the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of Underground 2 included a demo for <b>Burnout</b> 3. On 14 January 2008, the Xbox version of <b>Burnout</b> 3 was re-released as a downloadable emulated package for the Xbox 360 console as part of Microsoft's Xbox Originals scheme.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown, titled <b>Burnout</b> Revenge. Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic {{out of the way and}} into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather than just recreate <b>Burnout</b> 3 again. Ward admitted that later <b>Burnout</b> games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that <b>Burnout</b> 3 did. He considered <b>Burnout</b> 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere in the creative process. Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the <b>Burnout</b> series; their high expectations for <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} on Criterion's proprietary game engine RenderWare. The graphics engine was improved to give between 50–100% faster rendering than in <b>Burnout</b> 2. The increased performance {{allowed them to}} add features like real-time radiosity lighting and better environment mapping effects on vehicles. Programmers at the studio were adamant about making the game run at a frame rate of sixty frames per seconds to offer instant response and feedback while driving fast. Since the crash sequences were slower, the higher frame rate was less considered less critical than the spectacle of the vehicle collisions. They opted to run the game at thirty frames per second during these instances and dramatically {{increased the number of}} particles and debris that were rendered. From an early stage in development, the team wanted to include support for online network play in <b>Burnout</b> 3. They had never explored online play before, so they used <b>Burnout</b> 2 as a test-bed for the feature before integrating it into <b>Burnout</b> 3.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make <b>Burnout</b> 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on <b>Burnout</b> 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for <b>Burnout</b> 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of <b>Burnout</b> 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing and polishing the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the <b>Burnout</b> intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for <b>Burnout</b> 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Criterion Games {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. It is the third instalment in the <b>Burnout</b> series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series {{is the use of}} boost, earned through risky driving, to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in <b>Burnout</b> 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from standard circuit races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied with traffic. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer.|$|E

5|$|<b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown was {{developed}} by Guildford-based video game studio Criterion Games. The studio suffered several setbacks during {{the sequence of events}} that led up to the creation of <b>Burnout</b> 3, including the cancellation of a project, a failed pitch, and a fall out with the game's eventual publisher Electronic Arts (EA). In 2002, Criterion was around 130 people divided into two development teams. One team was working on <b>Burnout</b> 2: Point of Impact, a follow up to <b>Burnout,</b> set to be published by Acclaim Entertainment. The other team had completed the development of the extreme sports game AirBlade for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony had intentions of continuing to collaborate with Criterion on a sequel to AirBlade, however the AirBlade team turned down the offer. Instead, Criterion began talks with EA, who had a proposal for Criterion to create a remake of the 1988 skateboarding video game Skate or Die!. Criterion were keen to work with EA and started development on the project. Following <b>Burnout</b> 2s release, Criterion prepared a pitch to EA Canada about working on a second game with the publisher. Criterion's proposed title was Need For Speed: Split Second, a stunt racing game within EA's Need for Speed series. Meanwhile, the Skate of Die! remake project was thrown into disarray when EA requested changes to the game's design and the creative direction of project shifted away from Criterion's vision. With development staff becoming unhappy and stressed about the project, the studio decided to contact EA and cancel the game. EA was displeased with their decision and {{the relationship between the two}} companies soured, leading to dissolution of the proposed Need for Speed game.|$|E
5|$|GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann {{opened his}} review by calling <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown {{one of the}} best racing games of all time, noting that it stood out among contemporaries in the diverse and {{expanding}} genre. He felt the quality of the game was high enough to recommend it to gamers who were impartial to driving games. Edge magazine regarded <b>Burnout</b> 3 to be Criterion's finest work to date; they thought the studio had demonstrated their proficiency by revising the series structure and dynamic. They were also mindful of how <b>Burnout</b> 3s offered a fun and exhilarating experience while other developers were prioritising realism in their games. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the addition of significant gameplay mechanics had helped craft one of the most addictive racing games ever made. GamesTM awarded it a perfect score; they proclaimed that <b>Burnout</b> 3 was without a doubt the greatest racing game ever made and described playing it as the most fun they had ever had in the genre. GameSpy reviewer Miguel Lopez, who also awarded the game a perfect score, remarked that it was possibly the best arcade racer ever made.|$|E
5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what <b>Burnout</b> 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed these thoughts in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from {{the video game}} press {{becoming one of the}} highest rated racing video games of all time. Critics were enthused by the shift to a more aggressive style of racing game and the addition of gameplay mechanics like Takedowns. The addictive gameplay and visuals were widely praised by reviewers, many of whom ranked <b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown among the best games released on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game went on to win numerous awards including three from the British Academy Games Awards. Retrospective coverage of the game has been highly positive with some publications declaring it as the greatest arcade racer game ever made and the peak of the <b>Burnout</b> series.|$|E
5|$|While Criterion {{had their}} own audio team to create {{original}} music, working with EA gave {{them the opportunity to}} include licensed music in <b>Burnout</b> 3. EA launched an initiative called EA TRAX in 2002 with the intent of including licensed tracks in all their games. <b>Burnout</b> 3s soundtrack featured over forty songs, delivered in a radio station format presented by DJ Stryker from alternative rock station KROQ-FM. Options were added to modify which songs during a race or on the menu screen and the Xbox version supports custom soundtracks.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{evaluation}} of the combustibility of pulverized coals in ironmaking blast furnace pulverized coal injection (PCI) is difficult. A pilot-scale PCI rig {{may be used to}} test the combustion performance of a PCI coal. However, the replication of the conditions in the blowpipe-tuyere-raceway region is complicated and costly. Drop-tube furnaces (DTFs), which have been widely used in coal combustion research, are seen as an alternative to such combustion tests. This study therefore compares coal combustion performances in a DTF and a PCI rig, where the coal is burned at the as-ground size distribution to assess the suitability of a DTF to replace a PCI rig. In addition, this study tries to establish the methodology for ranking the PCI coal combustion performance through coal <b>burnouts</b> produced in the DTF. The measured <b>burnouts</b> from both the DTF and the pilot-scale PCI rig produced a linear relationship against the coal volatile matter (VM) content, although the trend of the DTF <b>burnouts</b> have a steeper slope. The <b>burnouts</b> of the two low-volatile coals (coals 1 and 2) stand outside the band and had significantly higher <b>burnouts</b> in the PCI rig but not in the DTF. This is attributed to higher char fragmentation during combustion in the PCI rig. Overall, the data in this study suggest that cheap lab-scale DTF tests can be a good substitute of expensive tests using a pilot-scale PCI rig for the {{evaluation of}} PCI coals. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

5|$|<b>Burnout</b> 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features standard circuit races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in <b>Burnout</b> 3, unlike previous <b>Burnout</b> games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2010, Mike Portnoy {{announced}} that he would be leaving Dream Theater, citing better relationships in other projects, <b>burnout,</b> and his desire for a break as reasons. Elaborating on the situation for MusicRadar, John Petrucci revealed that, originally, Portnoy did not want to leave the band; he only wanted to take a break. Only after the rest of the band rejected his proposal did Portnoy decide to quit.|$|E
5|$|Ultima Underworld II began {{production}} in April 1992, {{shortly after the}} completion of Ultima Underworld; and it was developed in nine months. The team sought to improve upon the foundation laid by the game's predecessor, particularly by increasing the size and interactivity of the game world. The team reused and improved the first game's engine. Development was impeded by insufficient staffing and extensive playtesting, and the rapid production cycle led to <b>burnout</b> on the team.|$|E
40|$|Combustion in grate {{furnaces}} is {{a common}} method for conversion of biofuels to energy, especially in small-scale heat production. In these furnaces combustion instabilities in the fuel bed are often observed. Here, an inventory is presented of combustion disturbances found in the fuel bed in grate furnaces. The inventory {{was carried out by}} interviewing personnel responsible for operation of ten furnaces and by recording of the fuel bed in eight of them by a portable video camera. Combustion disturbances were experienced in all except one of the furnaces. The most common disturbances were <b>burnouts</b> in the fuel bed and channelling at the bounding furnace walls. These disturbances are affected by practical factors related to the operation of grate furnaces. Those factors are presented together with suggestions for measures to reduce the frequency and magnitude of the disturbances. Digital image analysis was used to detect and quantify the size and movement of local <b>burnouts</b> in the fuel bed in one of the furnaces. The method can be used to find the source of disturbances or to evaluate contra-measures against <b>burnouts...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, a {{combination}} of low recruitment and retention rates across the RAN resulted {{in the number of}} trained submariners falling below 40% of that required.

Other measures introduced around the same time included priority transfer of volunteers for submarine training and rotating submariners between sea and shore assignments to relieve them from continual sea service and prevent <b>burnout.</b> A year later, these measures had increased submariner numbers to 55% of requirements.|$|E
5|$|Pee-wee's Playhouse aired from September 13, 1986, until November 10, 1990.

Reubens had been suffering from <b>burnout</b> from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special. Playhouse garnered 15 Emmy Awards, all of them in the Creative Arts Emmy Award category.|$|E
5|$|Reception {{towards the}} {{introduction}} of Takedowns was highly positive. Reviewers admired the impact that Takedowns had in transforming the boost mechanic and shifting the game's focus to a more aggressive style of driving. GamesTM {{pointed out that the}} hostile behaviour of AI rivals supplemented the system by presenting more opportunities to perform Takedowns, culminating in an intense and dramatic racing experience. Lopez explained that <b>Burnout</b> 3 had intelligently integrated elements of vehicular combat games by introducing Takedowns. Gerstmann commended the game's use of Impact Time and Aftertouch mechanics, which he believed made crashing an entertaining aspect of the game unlike other racers. IGN's Fran Mirabella III was amazed by the crash system; he considered it to be far ahead of anything that had been done before.|$|E
