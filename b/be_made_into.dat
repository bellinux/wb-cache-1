The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at {{the failure of the}} project and the West German government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E

Moe laments his decision to advertise his drink specials in Scientific American magazine, which led to Frink and company coming in.|$|E
5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Saw, a sequel was immediately green-lit. Leigh Whannell and James Wan were busy preparing {{for their next}} film and were unable to write or direct. Bousman wrote a script called The Desperate before Saw was released and {{was looking for a}} producer but many studios rejected it. Hoffman received the script and showed it to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules. It was decided that, with some changes, it could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> Saw II. Whannell became available to provide rewrites of the script. The film was given a larger budget and was shot from May to June 2005 in Toronto.|$|E

50|$|In China, {{the root}} <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a {{medicinal}} tea commonly called lán gēn (Pinyin) (Traditional Chinese 板藍根; Simplified Chinese 板蓝根). Isatis {{is a very}} uncommon plant that <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> tea.|$|R
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> steel (with {{up to about}} 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|An st-{{planar graph}} is a {{connected}} planar graph {{together with a}} bipolar orientation of that graph, an orientation that makes it acyclic with a single source and a single sink, {{both of which are}} required {{to be on the same}} face as each other. Such a graph may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a strongly connected graph by adding one more edge, from the sink back to the source, through the outer face. The dual of this augmented planar graph is itself the augmentation of another st-planar graph.|$|E
5|$|Any {{directed}} graph may <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, {{a set of}} vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also {{be transformed into a}} DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc sets are empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage overgrazing, logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Broke drilled {{his crew}} to an {{extremely}} {{high standard of}} naval gunnery; he regularly had them fire at targets, such as floating barrels. Often these drills would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> competitions to see which gun crew could hit the target and how fast they could do so. He even had his gun crews fire at targets 'blindfold' to good effect; they were only given the bearing to lay their gun on without being allowed to sight the gun on the target themselves. This constituted a very early example of 'director firing'.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the ship would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} {{opened to the public}} by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> semen.|$|R
5|$|In April 2013, Sutton met Kevin Spacey's filmmaker-in-residence Grigorij Richters while rehearsing {{as part of}} {{the drummer}} group for the opening {{ceremony}} of the 2013 UEFA Champions League final at Wembley Stadium. They quickly became friends. Richters and his team began following him around for several months, filming Sutton at home with his family and at several fundraisers. In the summer of 2013 Sutton went on holiday to Ibiza (his last travel) with his close friends. Richters equipped him with several GoPro cameras.

5|$|In the film, James Bond {{is sent to}} Jamaica to {{investigate}} the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of Dr. No, who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch with a radio beam weapon. Although {{the first of the}} Bond books to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a film, Dr. No was not the first of Fleming's novels, Casino Royale being the debut for the character; the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film also introduced the criminal organisation SPECTRE, which would also appear in six subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|The black mineraloid jet, the {{compressed}} remains of {{ancestors of the}} monkey-puzzle tree, {{is found in the}} cliffs and on the moors and has been used since the Bronze Age to make beads. The Romans are known to have mined it in the area. In Victorian times jet was brought to Whitby by pack pony to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> decorative items.

5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E
5|$|The {{script was}} sent to Prince who agreed to voice the {{character}} and sent back a page of notes about what he would be wearing in various scenes. The writers were confused when the notes did not correspond to the script and they discovered that Prince was referring to a script that had been written by someone else. Prince disliked the Simpsons writers' script and demanded the other one <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> an episode, but the writers refused. The episode eventually fell through and never made it past written form. It {{became one of the}} few completed scripts never to be produced.|$|E
5|$|This is a {{dissection}} puzzle {{similar to}} a Tangram, and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the Archimedes Palimpsest. Archimedes calculates {{the areas of the}} 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a square. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square. Dr. Netz calculates that the pieces can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>into</b> a square 17,152 ways. The number of arrangements is 536 when solutions that are equivalent by rotation and reflection have been excluded. The puzzle represents an example of an early problem in combinatorics.|$|E
