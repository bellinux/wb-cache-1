40|$|Background: Kikuchi, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, {{is a rare}} {{inflammatory}} disease that typically affects the cervical lymph nodes. Kikuchi is a benign disorder which most commonly resolved spontaneously over several weeks to months. This disease may mimic lymphoma and is definitely diagnosed by lymph node pathology. Case Report: The case was a 26 -year-old woman with fever, chill, right-sided neck swelling accompanied by lower extremity pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and headache since 10 days ago. On examination, the spleen was palpable about 5 cm below the costal margin. Despite the continuation of antibiotic therapy and persistent fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, leukopenia and elevated ESR, <b>biopsy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> was performed to rule out lymphoma and to establish Kikuchiâ��s disease. After 20 days the patient was discharged from the hospital. Conclusion: In every patient, especially young woman, with prolonged fever and enlarged lymph node, Kikuchi disease {{should be considered in}} the differential diagnosis and consequently the lymph node biopsy is recommended...|$|E
40|$|To {{classify}} {{cases of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma {{in terms of}} expected clinical behaviour and survival, kinetic parameters measured by cytophotometry were assessed in 62 patients between 1978 and 1987. The influence {{of the number of}} cells with increased DNA content (more than 2 N) on survival was evaluated. Analyses were carried out on the small samples obtained by needle aspiration <b>biopsy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> before treatment, using microdensitometry and Feulgen staining. Patients whose lymphomas contained less than 6 % of cells with increased DNA content had a mean survival of 81. 3 months and those whose lymphomas contained 6 % or more of such cells had a mean survival of 18. 5 months. A significant difference in survival using the same criteria was also noticed for patients with both low grade lymphomas and those with intermediate and high grade lymphomas. It is concluded that cytophotometric analysis of lymph node aspirates is of prognostic value in the initial assessment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all cases of FNA <b>biopsy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in which KL was diagnosed or suggested. False positive cases were studied. Cases: of KL diagnosed by histopathology were examined for the false negative rate of FNA diagnosis. RESULTS: Forty-four cases of KL diagnosed or suggested by FNA were found. Five of eight cases were confirmed on lymph node excision. The false positive rate was 37. 5 %. One case was nonspecific reactive changes. Two cases were proven to be tuberculous lymphadenitis by culture. Eight cases of KL diagnosed by lymph node excisional biopsy had prior FNA. Four were diagnosed as or suspected to be KL. The false negative rate was 50 %. CONCLUSION: The overall accuracy of FNA diagnosis of KL was 56. 25 %.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} for localizing lymph nodes before surgical resection and for their histological assessment. Nondestructive high-resolution transcapsule optical imaging of lymph nodes offers the potential for in situ assessment of metastatic involvement, potentially during surgical procedures. Methods: Three-dimensional optical coherence tomography (3 -D OCT) was used for imaging and assessing resected popliteal lymph nodes from a preclinical rat metastatic tumor model over a 9 -day time-course study after tumor induction. The spectral-domain OCT system utilized a center wavelength of 800 nm, provided axial and transverse resolutions of 3 and 12 μm, respectively, and performed imaging at 10, 000 axial scans per second. Results: OCT is capable of providing high-resolution label-free images of intact lymph node microstructure based on intrinsic optical scattering properties with penetration depths of ~ 1 - 2 mm. The results demonstrate that OCT is capable of differentiating normal, reactive, and metastatic lymph nodes based on microstructural changes. The optical scattering and structural changes revealed by OCT from day 3 to day 9 after the injection of tumor cells into the lymphatic system correlate with inflammatory and immunological changes observed in the capsule, precortical regions, follicles, and germination centers found during histopathology. Conclusions: We report {{for the first time a}} longitudinal study of 3 -D transcapsule OCT imaging of intact lymph nodes demonstrating microstructural changes during metastatic infiltration. These results demonstrate the potential of OCT as a technique for intraoperative, real-time in situ 3 -D optical <b>biopsy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> for the intraoperative staging of cance...|$|E
40|$|In non-small-cell lung cancer, {{positive}} {{lymph nodes}} with increased fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake may be missed by mediastinoscopy. Lack of pathological confirmation {{may lead to}} radical, but unnecessary lung surgery. To minimize these false-negative results, the feasibility and potential value of three-dimensional (3 D) FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) movies were investigated to improve targeted lymph node biopsy during mediastinoscopies. PET/CT images were rendered in 3 D volumes with multiplanar reconstructions and maximum intensity projections and reviewed in 3 D 'fly-through' and 'fly-around' movies. These movies were developed and optimized by the Departments of Surgery and Nuclear Medicine. Twenty-two consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer were included, of whom eight were FDG-PET positive for mediastinal lymph nodes. 3 D FDG-PET/CT movies were presented to surgeons before mediastinoscopy. Surgical consequences were investigated, including sensitivity and the negative predictive value of mediastinoscopy. Results were {{compared with those of}} a retrospective study in which 3 D techniques were not used. During mediastinoscopies, the 3 D-PET/CT movies were found to be helpful in the surgical localization of FDG-positive lymph nodes. It led to more confidence in the surgical approach. The sensitivity and negative predictive value were 86 and 94 %, respectively. Although not statistically significant, these results were higher compared with those of the retrospective study (75 and 92 %, respectively). 3 D FDG-PET/CT guidance during mediastinoscopy is feasible. The movies seem to lead to targeted <b>biopsy</b> <b>of</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> They may reduce false-negative mediastinoscopies and improve staging of lung cancer. 3 D FDG-PET/CT {{can be seen as a}} promising tool for further implementation of image-guided surgery...|$|E

She presented with fever, weight loss and tender cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Diagnostic significance <b>of</b> KFD lies in that it may mimic some of the common diagnosis like SLE (Systemic Lupus Erythematosis), Tuberculosis, lymphoma and rarely adenocarcinoma.
