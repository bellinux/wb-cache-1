40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} impact of globalisation on building surveying in Europe. Globalisation {{has resulted in the}} emergence of three large trading blocs or a global economy depending on the view one takes. This has impacted on property in two ways, by creating transnational companies who operate in many countries but require branding of their property, and companies who wish to invest in property markets other than their country of origin. <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyors</b> have professional expertise and knowledge valued in the UK since the 1960 and 1970 s but until recently not recognised in Europe, partly due to poor awareness of Building Surveying (BS) expertise, legal constraints, and practises relating to the employment of professionals. This is changing with the establishment of European Surveying associations and the globalisation of the RICS. The results showed four factors provided the reasons for the globalisation of BS skills. These were that <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyors</b> provided a consistent level of service for their clients. Secondly that English is the language of business. Thirdly, clients perceive Europe as a single trading bloc with a need for technical representation in each investment centre, providing them with a fast, knowledgeable service. Fourthly, clients perceive that UK <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyors</b> know what international, or transnational, investors want. The finding on the current demand for the BS services in Europe is that though demand is large, few <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyors</b> are located in Europe. Secondly, both investors and occupiers require the services of <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyors,</b> and local companies / individuals are beginning to use their professional services. Finally, there is a diverse range of demand for the many BS skills. Five key barriers to the practice of BS skills in Europe emerged from the research. Firstly, there was the problem of limited local legal and technical knowledge possessed by outsiders. Secondly, there are legal barriers to practice in some cases. Thirdly, other professionals can, and do, offer the services of the <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyor.</b> Fourthly, there can be cultural differences between ‘values’ and ‘norms’ required in business that constitute barriers. Finally there can be ‘communication’ problems when the <b>Building</b> <b>Surveyor</b> is not located in the country where the service is required. <br /...|$|R
