50|$|UPC (technically {{refers to}} UPC-A) {{consists}} of 12 numeric digits, that are uniquely {{assigned to each}} trade item. Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning of trade items {{at the point of}} sale, per GS1 specifications. UPC data structures are a component of GTINs and follow the global GS1 specification, which is based on international standards. But some retailers (clothing, furniture) do not use the GS1 system (rather other <b>barcode</b> <b>symbologies</b> or article number systems). On the other hand, some retailers use the EAN/UPC barcode symbology, but without using a GTIN (for products, brands, sold at such retailers only).|$|E

40|$|The DNA barcoding {{technology}} uses {{a standard}} region of DNA sequence for species identification and discovery. At present, "DNA barcode" actually refers to DNA sequences, {{which are not}} amenable to information storage, recognition, and retrieval. Our aim is to identify the best symbology that can represent DNA barcode sequences in practical applications. A comprehensive set of sequences for five DNA barcode markers ITS 2, rbcL, matK, psbA-trnH, and CO 1 {{was used as the}} test data. Fifty-three different types of one-dimensional and ten two-dimensional <b>barcode</b> <b>symbologies</b> were compared based on different criteria, such as coding capacity, compression efficiency, and error detection ability. The quick response (QR) code was found to have the largest coding capacity and relatively high compression ratio. To facilitate the further usage of QR code-based DNA barcodes, a web server was developed and is accessible at [URL] The web server allows users to retrieve the QR code for a species of interests, convert a DNA sequence to and from a QR code, and perform species identification based on local and global sequence similarities. In summary, the first comprehensive evaluation of various <b>barcode</b> <b>symbologies</b> has been carried out. The QR code {{has been found to be}} the most appropriate symbology for DNA barcode sequences. A web server has also been constructed to allow biologists to utilize QR codes in practical DNA barcoding applications...|$|E

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{the near}} future, Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and {{robotics}} of analytical procedures {{will make their}} entry in the laboratory. The first steps in this field have already been made. For both systems, the major objective is to acquire sample data in an accurate, fast and reliable way. This report will describe in what way rapid and efficient data acquisition can be performed. Obviously, barcode technology is the method preferred for a rapid and reliable input of data from samples in a computer system. Before implementing barcode technology in a laboratory, a suitable logisitic organisation has to be chosen. For an analytical laboratory like the Laboratory of Inorganic Chemistry (LAC) and the Laboratory of Organic-analytical Chemistry (LOC), the follow/correlation method would be the method of choice, although the correlation method is preferable for mechanical processes. From a comparison of five different <b>barcode</b> <b>symbologies</b> ("languages"), code 128 seems to be most suitable, because it is compact and it uses a large characterset. The choice of barcode reading facility {{is dependent on the}} type of barcode symbology and the density of the barcode label. A full integration of barcode technology in the laboratory can only be achieved if a profound study is performed on the production/organisation...|$|E
40|$|Barcodes are {{something}} that everybody sees every day; so common {{as to be}} taken for granted and normally unnoticed. Readable, no one reads them. They are used to allow machines to identify a wide variety of non-electronic, real life objects. Barcode is one of the earliest types of what is now called ``Automatic Identification and Data Capture'' (AIDC), meaning ``data was transmitted into whatever system by something other than typing or hand-writing. '' There are 18 technologies, broken down into six categories [...] biometrics, electromagnetic, magnetic, optical, Smart Cards, Touch [...] included in the AIDC concept. Many are used jointly with or as adjuncts to a basic barcode system of some type. All are based on assignment of a unique identifier to the object, usually a number. The uniqueness presumption makes barcode systems very applicable and appropriate to the nuclear information management venue as they inherently comply with the Nuclear Quality Assurance (NQA- 1) requirements. Barcode systems belong to the optical category of AIDC. It is very old in usage as these technologies go, having first been patented in 1949. It astonished me, in researching this paper, to find that there are over 250 types of <b>barcode</b> (<b>symbologies),</b> each with its own specialized attributes, though only a few dozen are in active use. The initial uses were in the early 1950 s and diversity of use is ever increasing as people find new ways to make this versatile old technology work. To what else could it be applied, in the future? This paper attempts to answer this...|$|E

However, at the time, Intermec was contractually obligated to sell Codabar printers only to Monarch Marking Systems.

40|$|Both {{consumer}} market and manufacturing industry makes heavy use of 1 D (linear) barcodes. From helping {{the visually impaired}} to iden-tifying the products to industrial automated industry management, barcodes are the prevalent source of item tracing technology. Be-cause of this ubiquitous use, in recent years, many algorithms have been proposed targeting barcode decoding from high-accessibility devices such as cameras. However, the current methods {{have at least one}} of the two major problems: 1) they are sensitive to blur, perspec-tive/lens distortions, and non-linear deformations, which often occur in practice, 2) they are specifically designed for a specific <b>barcode</b> <b>symbology</b> (such as UPC-A) and cannot be applied to other symbol-ogies. In this paper, we aim to address these problems and present a dynamic Bayesian network in order to robustly model all kinds of linear progressive barcodes. We apply our method on various bar-code datasets and compare the performance with the state-of-the-art. Our experiments show that, as well as being applicable to all pro-gressive barcode types, our method provides competitive results in clean UPC-A datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art in diffi-cult scenarios.
