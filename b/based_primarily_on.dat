The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.|$|E

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{military}} organisation, Napoleon borrowed from previous theorists such as Jacques Antoine Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, and from the reforms of preceding French governments, and then developed much of what was already in place.

5|$|On March 24, Zahorchak's {{proposal}} for district wide reform {{will be put}} before the Allentown School Board. The plan for reform is <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> financial expectations within the district. While {{the plan calls for}} the hiring of new teachers who will not be full-time and not on district payroll, it also calls for the termination of 300+ teachers. Staff members from each of the Allentown School District's schools will attend the meeting in order to overhaul the plan.|$|E
5|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an {{alphabetic}} {{system of}} phonetic notation <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the Latin alphabet.

5|$|The present borders {{were drawn}} in 2006 {{with the aim}} of decentralising power and {{removing}} associations with the old system and the genocide. The previous structure of twelve provinces associated with the largest cities was replaced with five provinces <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> geography. These are Northern Province, Southern Province, Eastern Province, Western Province, and the Municipality of Kigali in the centre.|$|E
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a death row inmate from Chicago. His conviction for murder was <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
5|$|Dixon was {{primarily}} hired {{to tone down}} much of the campiness inherent in the stage musical. The 2007 film's script is <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the stage musical rather than the 1988 film, so several changes already made to the plot for the stage version remain in this version. These include dropping several characters from the 1988 version (such as Arvin Hodgepile (the role Mr. Spritzer fills), Velma's husband Franklin, Corny's assistant Tammy, the beatniks, et al.), removing the Tilted Acres amusement park from the story, and placing Velma {{in charge of the}} station where The Corny Collins Show is filmed.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, Massachusetts {{became a}} {{national}} leader in the American Industrial Revolution, with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes, and factories around Springfield producing tools, paper, and textiles. The economy transformed from one <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> agriculture to an industrial one, initially making use of water-power and later the steam engine to power factories. Canals and railroads were used for transporting raw materials and finished goods. At first, the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms, and later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada.|$|E

5|$|In the 2008-2009 year, 1,001 {{students}} {{were enrolled in}} Dougherty. Admission is <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the location of students' residency, although birth date documentation and immunization records are also required from new students. The school opened in 2007 with 570 students, fitting the initial prediction of between 450 and 600 students. 95 of these students had transferred to Dougherty from another school in the district, {{and the majority of}} the freshmen came from Windemere Ranch Middle School. The school started with only ninth grade freshmen and tenth grade sophomores in 2007, and in each successive school year another grade was added until the standard ninth to twelfth grade range was reached in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary tax for the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Basing</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> the precolonial Benin Kingdom evidence, Bondarenko has {{elaborated}} {{the conception}} of [...] "megacommunity" [...] as {{a specific type of}} the non-state supercomplex society, integration of a supercomplex (exceeding the complex chiefdom level) society on community (and hence non-state) basis being its main distinctive feature. He has contributed to the studies of the state origins and nature by dealing with such aspects of the problematics as the dynamics of kinship and territoriality as principles of socio-political organization, transformations in ideology, and others.|$|R

5|$|It remains likely, however, {{that it was}} {{constructed}} by Gundulf, <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> {{the history of the}} land holdings during the period. After the founding of the abbey, which Gundulf granted some of his lands around West Malling, St Leonard's became the administrative centre of Gundulf's remaining estates, before also being given to the nuns a few years later, shortly after his death in 1108. In practice, probably only Gundulf would therefore have had the time or motivation to build such a keep during this period.|$|E

Olver stated that he believes that the United States should seek out a political solution in cooperation with the states neighboring Iraq, such as Iran and Syria, rather than pursuing a strategy <b>based</b> <b>primarily</b> <b>on</b> military means in order to create a stable and democratic Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan High Speed Rail (abbreviated THSR or HSR) is a {{high-speed}} rail line that runs approximately , {{along the west}} coast of Taiwan, from the national capital Taipei to the southern city of Kaohsiung.
