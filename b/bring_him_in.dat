5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top deck of a bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team is {{alerted to}} an {{incident}} at a quarantine site, where the amber encasing {{the site has}} been cut into and a body has been removed. They identify the missing body as Joshua Rose, a former bank robber. Joshua had previously caught Fringe Division's attention as he used a molecular destabilization device to break into banks, triggering quarantine-level events. Colonel Broyles is privately cautioned by Walternate that those trapped in amber are still alive, a fact {{he does not want}} to be made public for fear of their outcry. Broyles relays this to his team, requesting they find Rose and <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as quickly as possible.|$|E
25|$|Reimer had {{experienced}} the visits to Baltimore as traumatic rather than therapeutic, and when Money started pressuring {{the family to}} <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for surgery during which a vagina would be constructed, the family discontinued the follow-up visits. From 22 months into his teenaged years, Reimer urinated through a hole that surgeons had placed in the abdomen. Estrogen was given during adolescence to induce breast development.|$|E

25|$|Reimer had {{experienced}} the visits to Baltimore as traumatic, and when Money started pressuring {{the family to}} <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for surgery during which a vagina would be constructed, the family discontinued the follow-up visits. From 22 months into his teenaged years, Reimer urinated through a hole that surgeons had placed in the abdomen. Estrogen was given during adolescence to induce breast development. Having no contact with the family once the visits were discontinued, John Money published nothing further about the case.|$|E
25|$|The Spurs own the NBA {{rights to}} the players listed in the table below. The typical pattern is to allow the player to develop in leagues outside the USA. The player is free to {{negotiate}} contracts in other leagues and is not obligated {{to play in the}} NBA. Sometimes, a player's overseas contract may have an expensive buyout clause that would discourage the Spurs from seeking to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b> The Spurs have had past success in finding foreign talent; some examples of this success include the selections of second rounder Manu Ginóbili (57th overall in 1999) and first rounder Tony Parker (28th overall in 2001), who both went on to become All-Stars.|$|E
25|$|He quickly {{began to}} make his mark in the fashion industry, with Alice Pollock's {{exclusive}} boutique Quorum featuring his designs in 1966. Clark had been introduced to Pollock at his RCA show by Quorum's backer {{at the behest of}} Hockney and so taken with the young designer was she that she immediately decided to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as co designer for Quorum. Ossie presented a collection of white and cream chiffon garments that sold fast. Pollock wanted Clark's clothes to have a more organic feel and so commissioned Celia Birtwell to produce special textiles for the next collection. In this way, one of fashions most famous collaborations was born: with Ossie Clark designing clothes and Celia Birtwell designing prints.|$|E

500|$|Mulder {{blames the}} Smoking Man for his mother's condition. When he learns about the {{statement}} given by [...] "Smith", Mulder {{goes to the}} SSA to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for questioning. [...] "Smith" [...] initially complies but flees into a crowd, shapeshifting into someone else. The impostor—a bounty hunter—arrives at Smith's cell to kill him, finding it empty. Mulder visits Teena at the hospital, but encounters the Smoking Man. Mulder threatens the Smoking Man with a gun, {{but he says that}} Teena met with him about the whereabouts of his sister, Samantha. In the parking garage, Mulder is confronted by X, who demands the alien stiletto. When Mulder refuses to hand it over, the two grapple to a stalemate.|$|E
500|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} by Yasunori Mitsuda, {{who had previously}} worked with Takahashi on the score of Xenogears. Mitsuda worked as both composer and orchestrator. Mitsuda was almost unable to collaborate on the project due to a tight schedule, but {{they were able to}} <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b> As opposed to most RPG scores at the time, Mitsuda collaborated with Takahashi to create tracks for specific scenes in the game rather than a smaller number of repeating tracks. Due to the game's religious references, the score incorporated Gregorian chants. The score was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Multiple soundtrack albums were released, first from DigiCube and later through Mitsuda's own label Sleigh Bells. A single was released for the game's theme song [...] "Kokoro".|$|E
500|$|Eric Johnson {{auditioned for}} {{the roles of}} Lex and Clark, before finally being cast as Whitney Fordman. When the {{producers}} called him in for a third audition, Johnson informed them that if they wanted him then they would <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for a screen-test. After the screen-test, Johnson was cast and spent only one day filming his scenes for the pilot. The producers, along with Johnson, wanted to portray Whitney as {{more than just the}} [...] "stereotypical jock" [...] that he could have easily become, {{in an effort to make}} sure Lana did not look stupid for going out with him. Whitney was given multiple storylines in season one in an effort to get audiences to view the character in a more pleasant light, but Kristin Kreuk feels that it was all for naught, as the audience only sees him through Clark's eyes.|$|E

500|$|Hughes joined Port Vale the {{day after}} {{securing}} his exit from Notts County, as the BBC reported that [...] "promotion-chasing boss Micky Adams wants to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to add impetus to a Vale attack who have occasionally misfired this term". He signed a contract to keep him at Vale Park {{until the end of}} the 2012–13 season, at which point his contract would be extended by 12 months if the [...] "Valiants" [...] were promoted. He marked his debut against the [...] "Gills" [...] with the winning goal that sent Vale to the top of the table. Being partnered with the country's leading goalscorer Tom Pope allowed Hughes space in front of goal vacated by opposition defenders attempting to double up on Pope. Hughes scored his first hat-trick for the [...] "Valiants" [...] in a 7–1 home victory over Burton Albion on 5 April, with two of his goals coming from the penalty spot as he took over from Jennison Myrie-Williams as the club's penalty taker. This performance won him a place on the League Two team of the week. Vale were promoted at the end of the season, with Hughes scoring ten goals in his 18 games, ensuring his contract was extended until summer 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Lou Holtz left Notre Dame {{after the}} 1996 season {{and walked away}} from a {{lifetime}} contract for undisclosed reasons. [...] In 1996, {{two members of the}} Minnesota Vikings's ownership board, Wheelock Whitney and Jaye Dyer, reportedly contacted Holtz. They wanted to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to replace Dennis Green. Of the rumors surrounding the reasons for Holtz's retirement, one of them was the possible Vikings head coaching position.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 February 1861, {{on orders}} to {{retrieve}} the child at all costs, Bascom went to [...] Apache Pass to seek out Cochise, son-in-law of Mangas Coloradas. Cochise said he didn't have the child but thought he knew who did and if given ten days could <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b> [...] Bascom had the Apaches surrounded, informing Cochise they would be held as hostages until the child was returned. Cochise escaped and captured his own hostages to offer in exchange, but Bascom refused. A series of violent retaliatory actions followed from each side before the Chiricahua Apaches eventually declared war.|$|E

2500|$|A theory {{popular in}} the years {{immediately}} following Ringo's death named [...] "Buckskin" [...] Frank Leslie as his killer. [...] Leslie apparently did tell a guard at the Yuma prison, where he was serving time for killing his wife, that he had shot Ringo. [...] While many believed his story, others thought he was simply claiming credit for it to curry favor with Earp's inner circle, or for whatever notoriety it might <b>bring</b> <b>him.</b> <b>In</b> a popular but unsubstantiated story, Billy Claiborne's last words, after losing a gunfight to Leslie in November 1882, were, [...] "Frank Leslie killed John Ringo. I saw him do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Weeks {{became a}} bouncer at a popular {{neighborhood}} bar called Triple O's Lounge, owned by Kevin O'Neil. This {{was a frequent}} hangout of the Winter Hill Gang, an Irish-American crime family which was then headed by James J. [...] "Whitey" [...] Bulger. It was here that Weeks first met Bulger, as well as Bulger's Italian-American partner Stephen Flemmi. [...] Beginning in 1978, Weeks began working for Bulger part-time as muscle and a personal driver. Impressed by Weeks' knack for making money and genuinely liking him, Bulger decided to <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> closer than any other associate. Meanwhile, Weeks turned to running a loansharking business on the side.|$|E
2500|$|One {{event that}} {{affected}} `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment {{of his father}} when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit Bahá'u'lláh who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the Síyáh-Chál. He described how [...] "I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In {{the middle of the}} stairway, {{all of a sudden we}} heard His …voice: 'Do not <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> here', and so they took me back".|$|E

50|$|Sam is murdered before {{either the}} police or Collison get to him. Collison {{suspects}} Hoffmeyer of the murder, so Bob <b>brings</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> for questioning. There is no proof {{that he is the}} killer, and he denies having anything to do with either of the two murders.|$|R
2500|$|Early in 1938, Tytla {{animated}} Yen Sid, the old magician in [...] "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," [...] {{which would}} eventually become a segment in Fantasia (1940). However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had {{a pretty good idea of}} what he wanted to do and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E
2500|$|Carrie oversees a {{prisoner}} exchange: Saul for five Taliban members. When Saul comes into view, however, Carrie sees {{a young boy}} behind him wearing a suicide vest. Carrie goes herself to retrieve Saul, and persuades him to let the exchange go forward and come with her. As {{they go back to}} the U.S. Embassy, their car is hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Marines pull Carrie and Saul from the wreckage, and take them back the embassy, which has been invaded by Haqqani's forces. The White House orders U.S. forces out of Pakistan and relieves Carrie of her command. [...] When Quinn kidnaps Farhad Ghazi (Tamer Burjaq), the ISI agent who kidnapped Saul, Carrie asks Lockhart to let her stay in Islamabad so she can <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in.</b> She finds Quinn and pleads with him to leave the country, but he refuses and escapes. She later stops him from assassinating Haqqani, and sees that Haqqani has Adal in his entourage. Meanwhile, she receives a phone call from Maggie, who tells her that their father has died. Carrie finds some solace in talking to Frannie, and decides to be a better mother to her.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{some aspects of}} the play are unique to Holinshed. For example, in the opening scene, as word arrives in England of the {{rebellion}} in France, Exeter says to his fellow peers, [...] "Remember, Lords, your oaths to Henry sworn:/Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,/Or <b>bring</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> obedience to your yoke" [...] (1.1.162–164). Only in Holinshed is it reported that on his deathbed, Henry V elicited vows from Bedford, Gloucester and Exeter that they would never willingly surrender France, and would never allow the Dauphin to become king. Another piece of information unique to Holinshed is seen when Charles compares Joan to the Old Testament prophetess Deborah (1.2.105). According to Judges 4 and 5, Deborah masterminded Barak's surprise victory against the Canaanite army led by Sisera, which had suppressed the Israelites for over twenty years. No such comparison is found in Hall. Another piece of information unique to Holinshed occurs when the Master Gunner mentions that the English have taken control of some of the suburbs of Orléans (1.4.2). Holinshed reports that the English captured several of the suburbs {{on the other side of}} the Loire, something not found in Hall.|$|E
50|$|The {{universal}} call to holiness {{is rooted}} in baptism, and the Paschal Mystery, which configures a person to Jesus Christ who is truly God and truly man, thus uniting a person with the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity, <b>bringing</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> communion with intra-trinitarian life.|$|R

50|$|In Purity <b>in</b> Death, Roarke <b>brings</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> as a {{technical}} assistant due to his very good computer and programming skills.
