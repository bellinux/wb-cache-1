50|$|Captain Cat, the <b>blind</b> <b>sea</b> captain, is tormented in {{his dreams}} by his drowned shipmates, who long to live again and enjoy {{the pleasures of the}} world. Mog Edwards and Myfanwy Price dream of each other; Mr. Waldo dreams of his {{childhood}} and his failed marriages; Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard dreams of her deceased husbands. Almost all of the characters in the play are introduced as the audience witnesses a moment of their dreams.|$|R

50|$|Barney's Barrier Reef is a British {{documentary}} program {{launched by}} the CBBC in 2009, presented by Barney Harwood and Gemma Hunt. The structure of the program shows the links between animals from the Great Barrier Reef. It involves at least 10 to 12 animals each episode. Barney used an animal as a 'little cheat' as described by Gemma, because it was Humans. Barney's Barrier Reef mostly involves fish since the Great Barrier Reef is in an ocean. Land animals are hardly used in this series, but then they are mostly used in the proceeding series: Barney's Latin America, although some fish, like the <b>blind</b> <b>sea</b> shrimp, are featured. Barney's Barrier Reef featured 20 episodes.|$|R

[...] The world where wise men live at ease [...] Fades from our unregretful eyes, [...] And <b>blind</b> across uncharted <b>seas</b> [...] We stagger on our enterprise." ...|$|R
6000|$|POLE (sitting). This is {{the loveliest}} day that ever smiled On England. All her breath should, incenselike, Rise {{to the heavens}} in {{grateful}} praise of Him Who now recalls her to His ancient fold. Lo! once again God to this realm hath given A token of His more especial Grace; For as this people were the first of all The islands call'd into the dawning church Out of the dead, deep night of heathendom, So now are these the first whom God hath given Grace to repent and sorrow for their schism; And if your penitence be not mockery, Oh how the blessed angels who rejoice Over one saved do triumph at this hour In the reborn salvation of a land So noble. [...] [A pause. [...] For ourselves we do protest That our commission is to heal, not harm; We come not to condemn, but reconcile; We come not to compel, but call again; We come not to destroy, but edify; Nor yet to question things already done; These are forgiven--matters of the past-- And range with jetsam and with offal thrown Into the <b>blind</b> <b>sea</b> of forgetfulness. [...] [A pause. Ye have reversed the attainder laid on us By him who sack'd the house of God; and we, Amplier than any field on our poor earth Can render thanks in fruit for being sown, Do here and now repay you sixty-fold, A hundred, yea, a thousand thousand-fold, With heaven for earth.|$|R

50|$|Walcott's epic book-length poem Omeros was {{published}} in 1990 to critical acclaim. The poem very loosely echoes and references Homer {{and some of his}} major characters from The Iliad. Some of the poem's major characters include the island fishermen Achille and Hector, the retired English officer Major Plunkett and his wife Maud, the housemaid Helen, the <b>blind</b> man Seven <b>Seas</b> (who symbolically represents Homer), and the author himself.|$|R
50|$|However, Popoff, who {{has in the}} {{meantime}} gone mad from the prospect of getting shot for his supposed failure with Paj Mub, smashes the sub's navigation instruments when he is left unattended, leaving the sailors <b>blind</b> in the <b>sea.</b> The sub runs aground, nose in the air, at the shore of a tropical island. Thinking that the sub is trapped underwater, the desperate Axis leaders decide to have themselves shot to the surface via the torpedo tubes. The film ends with Benson and Spense beholding Hitler, Suki Yaki and Mussolini being stuck headfirst in the island beach's sands, with their feet treading empty air.|$|R

Although the main narrative of the poem takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, Walcott also includes scenes from Brookline, Massachusetts (where Walcott was living and teaching {{at the time of the}} poem's composition) and the character Achille imagines a voyage from Africa onto a slave ship that's headed for the Americas; also, in Book Five of the poem, Walcott narrates some of his travel experiences in a variety of cities around the world, including Lisbon, London, Dublin, Rome, and Toronto.|$|R

This is no more open water than Trafalgal Square is a common; the free levels begin at Ushant; but none the less Dick could feel the healing of the sea at work upon him already. A boisterous little cross-swell swung the steamer disrespectfully by the nose; and one wave breaking far aft spattered the quarterdeck and the pile of new deck-chairs. He heard the foam fall with the clash of broken glass, was stung in the face by a cupful, and sniffing luxuriously, felt his way to the smoking-room by the wheel. There a strong b reeze found him, blew his cap off and left him bareheaded in the doorway, and the smoking-room steward, understanding that he was a voyager of experience, said that the weather would be stiff in the chops off the Channel and more than half a gale in the Bay. These things fell as they were foretold, and Dick enjoyed himself to the utmost. It is allowable and even necessary at sea to lay firm hold upon tables, stanchions, and ropes in moving from place to place. On land the man who feels with his hands is patently <b>blind.</b> At <b>sea</b> even a <b>blind</b> man who is not sea-sick can jest with the doctor over the weakness of his fellows. Dick told the doctor many tales--and these are coin of more value than silver if properly handled--smoked with him till unholy hours of the night, and so won his short-lived regard that he promised Dick a few hours of his time when they came to Port Said.|$|R
60|$|It {{was written}} that there, {{in the nursery}} of our {{navigating}} ancestors, I should learn {{to walk in the}} ways of my craft and grow in the love of the <b>sea,</b> <b>blind</b> as young love often is, but absorbing and disinterested as all true love must be. I demanded nothing from it--not even adventure. In this I showed, perhaps, more intuitive wisdom than high self-denial. No adventure ever came to one for the asking. He who starts on a deliberate quest of adventure goes forth but to gather dead-sea fruit, unless, indeed, he be beloved of the gods and great amongst heroes, like that most excellent cavalier Don Quixote de la Mancha. By us ordinary mortals of a mediocre animus that is only too anxious to pass by wicked giants for so many honest windmills, adventures are entertained like visiting angels. They come upon our complacency unawares. As unbidden guests are apt to do, they often come at inconvenient times. And we are glad to let them go unrecognised, without any acknowledgment of so high a favour. After many years, on looking back from the middle turn of life's way at the events of the past, which, like a friendly crowd, seem to gaze sadly after us hastening towards the Cimmerian shore, we may see here and there, in the gray throng, some figure glowing with a faint radiance, as though it had caught all the light of our already crepuscular sky. And by this glow we may recognise the faces of our true adventures, of the once unbidden guests entertained unawares in our young days.|$|R
