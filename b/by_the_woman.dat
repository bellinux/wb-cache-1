5|$|A {{trail of}} {{peculiar}} footprints shows the path trodden <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> on her pattens to avoid putting her good {{shoes in the}} snow and filth of the street. A small object hangs at her side, interpreted variously as a nutcracker or a pair of scissors {{in the form of a}} skeleton or a miniature portrait, hinting, perhaps, at a romantic disappointment. Although clearly a portrait in the painting, the object is indistinct in the prints from the engraving. Other parts of the scene are clearer in the print, however: in the background, a quack is selling his cureall medicine, and while in the painting the advertising board is little more than a transparent outline, in the print, Dr. Rock's name can be discerned inscribed on the board below the royal crest which suggests his medicine is produced by royal appointment. The salesman may be Rock himself. Hogarth's opinion of Rock is made clear in the penultimate plate of A Harlot's Progress where he is seen arguing over treatments with Dr Misaubin while Moll Hackabout dies unattended in the corner.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of {{the five}} {{traditional}} senses as allegory became a popular subject for seventeenth-century artists, especially among Dutch and Flemish Baroque painters. A typical example is Gérard de Lairesse's Allegory of the Five Senses (1668), in which each of the figures in the main group alludes to a sense: Sight is the reclining boy with a convex mirror, hearing is the cupid-like boy with a triangle, smell {{is represented by the}} girl with flowers, taste is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> with the fruit, and touch is represented <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> holding the bird.|$|E

25|$|A legend, {{originating}} from 12th century chronicles, tells how {{when he first}} fled to the Somerset Levels, Alfred was given shelter by a peasant woman who, unaware of his identity, left him to watch some wheaten cakes she had left cooking on the fire.

25|$|According to rabbinic literature, God via the Torah {{commands}} Jews {{to observe}} (refrain from forbidden activity) and remember (with words, thoughts, and actions) Shabbat, {{and these two}} actions are symbolized by the customary two Shabbat candles. Candles are lit usually <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> of the house (or else {{by a man who}} lives alone). Some families light more candles, sometimes in accordance with the number of children.|$|E

25|$|The Court {{ruled in}} Hermesmann v.

It also ruled that a mother's potential culpability under the criminal statutes was of no relevance in determining the father's child support liability.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, a {{young woman}} (Perkins) shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that {{it appeared to be}} perfectly healthy. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> accompanies them.|$|E

25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} known associations between the media and suicide arose from Goethe's novel Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Sorrows of Young Werther). Soon after its publication in 1774, young men began to mimic the main character by dressing in yellow pants and blue jackets. In the novel, Werther shoots himself with a pistol after he is rejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he loves, and shortly after its publication {{there were reports of}} young men using the same method to kill themselves in an act of hopelessness.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> herself, or by using pregnancy tests. However, an important condition with serious health implications {{that is quite}} common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some non-pregnant women {{have a very strong}} belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a false pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Kimuna et al. have {{published}} domestic violence trends in India, {{based on the}} 2005-2006 India National Family Health Survey-III (NFHS-III) data on the 69,484 ever-married women ages 15 to 49 from all regions of India. They report 31% of respondents had experienced minor to major form of physical violence in the 12 {{months prior to the}} survey, while the domestic sexual violence prevalence rate ever experienced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> was about 8%. Women who lived in cities, had higher household wealth, were Christian and educated had significantly lower risk of physical and sexual domestic violence. In contrast, wives of men who drank alcohol had significantly higher risks of experiencing both physical and sexual violence.|$|E
25|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have stated that}} the superiority of a husband over his wife is relative, and the obedience of the wife is also restrictive. The Quran advises men {{that if they are}} certain of a rebellious attitude <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman,</b> they should first admonish her, then refuse to share beds, and finally beat ("darab") her, according to Qur'an 4:34. (Today most Islamic scholars agree that it be without leaving a mark and not on the face). This refers to serious breaches of behaviour such as being promiscuous according to renowned 20th-century scholar Muhammad Hamidullah which is not expected from a dutiful wife, and not for simple disobedience to the husband. In explaining this, Ibn Abbas gives an example of striking with a toothstick.|$|E
25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> would be killed and broken down by acids in her stomach and proteins in the small intestine. The breakdown products are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E

500|$|The entire {{score for}} La Strada {{was written by}} Nino Rota after {{principal}} photography was completed. The main theme is a wistful tune that appears first as a melody played by the Fool on a kit violin and later by Gelsomina on her trumpet. Its last cue in the penultimate scene is sung <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who tells Zampanò the fate of Gelsomina after he abandoned her. This {{is one of three}} primary themes that are introduced during the titles at the beginning of La Strada and that recur regularly throughout the film. To these are added a fourth recurring theme that appears in the very first sequence, after Gelsomina meets Zampanò, and is often interrupted or silenced in his presence, occurring less and less frequently and at increasingly lower volumes as the film progresses. Claudia Gorbman has commented on the use of these themes, which she deems true leitmotifs, each of which is not simply an illustrative or redundant identifying tag, but [...] "a true signifier that accumulates and communicates meaning not explicit in the images or dialogue".|$|E
