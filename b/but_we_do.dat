We never learn {{anything}} about her husband, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know that she hates alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them {{by the events of}} Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E

[...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E

500|$|The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{has stated}} that {{according}} to their mission managers and orbit determination experts, the Cassini spacecraft is not experiencing unexplained deviations in its orbit around Saturn. William Folkner, a planetary scientist at JPL stated, [...] "An undiscovered planet outside the orbit of Neptune, 10 times the mass of Earth, would affect the orbit of Saturn, not Cassini ... This could produce a signature in the measurements of Cassini while in orbit about Saturn if the planet {{was close enough to}} the Sun. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not see any unexplained signature above the level of the measurement noise in Cassini data taken from 2004 to 2016." [...] Observations of Saturn's orbit neither prove nor disprove that Planet Nine exists. Rather, they suggest that Planet Nine could not be in certain sections of its proposed orbit because its gravity would cause a noticeable effect on Saturn's position, inconsistent with actual observations.|$|E
500|$|Cultura Profética {{has been}} {{described}} as roots reggae. The group has often made use of the moog synthesizer, an instrument commonly used in traditional reggae but is generally rare in contemporary reggae. Despite primarily performing reggae music, the group incorporates various other rhythms into its compositions, including those of Caribbean genres such as salsa. The song [...] "Reggae Rústico" [...] from Ideas Nuevas includes an extended soneo, an improvised call-and-response section common in the salsa genre, at its closing, calling for unity in reggae music. Additionally, the band's music features a strong emphasis on improvisation and polyrhythmic patterns. Rodríguez notes that [...] "We've developed what I think is our own genre. We don't consider ourselves a pop act <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> make popular music {{in the sense that we}} are supported by many people. People have finally understood what we do." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard observed elements of jazz in the single [...] "La Complicidad," [...] additionally describing it as [...] "more mellow rock than reggae." ...|$|E

After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged {{the possibility that}} placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show {{in the wake of}} his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: [...] "It is our hope through airing this show that people will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in Iron Man 2 should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, [...] "there was never any doubt" [...] the film would be dedicated to him.|$|E

500|$|Following Chelsea's victory, player-manager Vialli was {{satisfied}} with his club's performance, commending the substitution of Zola by assistant manager Graham Rix: [...] "He decided he had a feeling and he was right". Vialli also praised Zola, but felt that the honours had to be shared by all the players including Vialli himself, {{who took part in}} the match: [...] "It was a great first touch – he put the ball in the net and we won the cup. But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed. I am still the player-manager and I have to be one next season. We are very happy to win, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not want to stop here. We want to keep improving and next season we will start trying to win the Premier League, which is our aim now." ...|$|E

James Montgomery of MTV News called it [...] "a clothing-optional video that's raising eyebrows (and temperatures) worldwide. Though [...] there's nothing {{really all that}} shocking about the clip ... except maybe for its honesty." [...] Megan Vick of Billboard was positive on the video, saying that, [...] "We can't be entirely sure what Robyn {{was trying to say}} with this treatment, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> know that this video is hot – and intriguing." [...] Robbie Daw of music website Idolator compared it to a scene from The X-Files. He concluded by saying that [...] "This is hardcore, indeed." [...] Amber Katz of MTV Buzzworthy said that Robyn looks [...] "cherubic and futuristic , as if she belongs on the set of “Caprica”." [...] Katz compared Robyn's outfit to Rebecca Horn's [...] "Overflowing Blood Machine". DJ Ron Slomowicz of About.com called the video [...] "creepy and confusing" [...] and said, [...] "Overall, it is a scintillating if not entirely clear video." ...|$|E
500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not want to be aggressors." ...|$|E

500|$|MLSE {{partnered with}} Rogers Communications in 2005 to bid {{to host a}} regular season National Football League game in Toronto. [...] On January 30, 2008 it was {{announced}} that Rogers and Larry Tanenbaum, chairman of MLSE, had reached an agreement with the Buffalo Bills to host an annual regular-season and three exhibition NFL games over five seasons at Toronto's Rogers Centre beginning in 2008, with the games branded the Bills Toronto Series. At the time MLSE was considering bringing a NFL team to Toronto permanently and building them a new stadium, but abandoned the idea when they concluded that the project would not generate sufficient financial return to justify the significant cost of the project. Subsequently, MLSE president Tim Leiweke said on a NFL team in Toronto: [...] "We can't own a team (per NFL rules), <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> have more expertise on how to build (stadiums) than anyone... MLSE can play a role." [...] It has been reported that MLSE is interested in building and managing the proposed NFL stadium, which it has already begun designing. [...] In 2013 MLSE minority owner Tanenbaum and board member Edward Rogers III partnered with musician Jon Bon Jovi to purchase an NFL team. [...] Following the death of Bills' owner Ralph Wilson in 2014 the group submitted an offer to purchase the franchise, with speculation that they would move the team to Toronto when their lease permitted it, but were outbid by the Pegulas.|$|E
