5|$|A {{few days}} after Noether's death her friends and {{associates}} at <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{dozens of}} newly {{unemployed}} professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their {{colleagues in the}} United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions, <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College in the United States and Somerville College at the University of Oxford in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.|$|E

5000|$|Tyng {{moved to}} Philadelphia and {{landed a job}} at Louis Kahn's {{architectural}} practice, Stonorov and Kahn, in 1945. Her fascination with complex geometrical shapes had a strong influence on several projects, most notably on the five cubes that comprise the Trenton Bath House and the triangular ceiling of Yale Art Gallery. [...] Tyng also says that the concept for Kahn's famous [...] "City Tower" [...] design was largely her invention, though when the model was included in a show at the Museum of Modern Art, Kahn left her name off of the credit label at first.

25|$|Photographs {{from before}} Garrett {{moved into the}} Deanery in 1904, and after de Forest's redecoration {{of the house in}} 1894–1896, show only a {{fraction}} of the known pieces by de Forest in <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr's</b> collection from the Deanery. The absence of the furniture in these photographs, in addition to shipping labels still attached to several pieces indicating Garrett as the sender and the Deanery as the final destination, support the idea that the majority of the de Forest furniture was originally from Garrett's Baltimore home. Furthermore, if the furniture was from this earlier period, then it is likely that it was produced in de Forest's workshop in Ahmedabad, India. The swing-settee, which was later installed in the Dorothy Vernon room, is one of the most recognizable pieces of de Forest to have come from Garrett's Baltimore home.|$|R
2500|$|Previously {{named after}} <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr's</b> first Dean and second president, College Hall {{was used as}} the primary campus library until 1970, when Mariam Coffin Canaday Library opened.

Carey Thomas played a large part in its construction. Today, it is a space for performances, readings, lectures, and public gatherings. College Hall encloses a large open courtyard called [...] "The Cloisters", which is the site of the College's traditional Lantern Night ceremony. [...] The cremated remains of M.

5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision {{did not become}} operative until {{there were at least}} 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the first}} Universities to elect trustees by direct election. (Harvard was probably the first to shift to direct election of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 he {{was ordained}} into the Church of the Eternal Source, a Kemetic Pagan group, but moved on again in 1977, when {{he founded the}} Minoan Brotherhood as a Wiccan {{tradition}} for gay and bisexual men. Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in the subject at <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with the scholastic demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E

2500|$|Named for <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr’s</b> late {{professor}} of Classical Archaeology, the Rhys Carpenter Library {{was designed by}} Henry Myerberg of New York and opened in 1997. [...] The space {{is connected to the}} rear of the M. Carey Thomas Library. The entrance is a four-story atrium.

The building also contains a large lecture hall and several seminar rooms.|$|R
5|$|The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry {{movements}} {{were some of}} Millett's principal causes. Her books were motivated by her activism, such as woman's rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are The Politics of Cruelty (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and Mother Millett (2001), a book about {{her relationship with her}} mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono's Courage Award for the Arts, and was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{the age of}} 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the Québec resort of La Malbaie, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited {{only a few weeks}} before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, {{and at the end of}} August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the Manhattan law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived pneumonia in February 1905, taking months to recover.|$|E
5|$|That year, H.D. {{attended}} <b>Bryn</b> <b>Mawr</b> College {{to study}} Greek literature, but left after only three terms due to poor grades and the excuse of poor health. While at the college, she met poets Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams. Her first published writings, stories for children, {{were published in}} The Comrade, a Philadelphia Presbyterian Church paper, between 1909 and 1913, mostly under the name Edith Gray. In 1907, she became engaged to Pound. Her father disapproved of Pound, {{and by the time}} Pound left for Europe in 1908, the engagement had been called off. Around this time, H.D. started a relationship with a young female art student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Frances Josepha Gregg. After spending part of 1910 living in Greenwich Village, she sailed to Europe with Gregg and Gregg's mother in 1911. In Europe, H.D. began a more serious career as a writer. Her relationship with Gregg cooled, and she met a writing enthusiast named Brigit Patmore with whom she became involved in an affair. Patmore introduced H.D. to another poet, Richard Aldington.|$|E
