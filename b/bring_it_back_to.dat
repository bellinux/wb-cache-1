5|$|The game also {{provides}} a co-operative mode where two players may play through the game's campaign together via split-screen, system link, or through the Xbox Live online service. In co-operative, the missions are slightly altered to suit both players. For instance, some doors may require two players to open them. Additionally, in certain missions, the second player can occasionally start {{far away from the}} main player and takes over an allied character that was AI-controlled in the single player campaign. The respawn procedure is also altered substantially, as if one player dies, the other has to find and revive the partner's corpse to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> life.|$|E
5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E
5|$|However, 70000 {{had been}} {{purchased}} privately from British Railways by the Britannia Locomotive Group, therefore {{ensuring that the}} doyen of the class was to survive into the preservation era. Subsequently, utilised on mainline railtours, the locomotive was out of use in the late 1990s, requiring work to <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> steam; it was eventually sold to Pete Waterman and stored at Crewe. After a spell in storage on the Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk, 70013 {{was moved to the}} Great Central Railway (preserved), following an ownership dispute between Bressingham and the National Railway Museum. The locomotive returned to steam in May 2008 on the Great Central Railway after the readers of Steam Railway magazine contributed towards its overhaul. In July 2008 it appeared in WCRC's Open Weekend at Steamtown, Carnforth. August saw the locomotive return to the main line. Its first turn was the 1T57 'Fifteen Guinea Special' re-run from Manchester to Carlisle, 40 years after it performed the same duty in 1968. As a result, both preserved members of the class have operated on the mainline in preservation.|$|E

5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for {{residents of the}} ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property they no longer controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E

Supervising architect Richard Brennan of New Canaan, Connecticut relied on the original drawings to guide the restoration. The auditorium's stage was extended 10 feet (3 m) to accommodate the needs of contemporary theatrical productions, and the basement was remodeled to serve as offices for some minort town offices and community organizations, and town court. No other changes were made at that time.|$|E

However, Galactus had taken an oath to only revive those worlds destroyed by the Blight. An enraged Silver Surfer then turned against his master, destroying those who worshiped him and attempting to kill Galactus himself in order to steal the knowledge of world restoration. This led to the destruction of Earth, the coming of the Exiles, the deaths of the Shi'ar Imperial Elite Guard, and inevitably the Surfer's own destruction at the claws of a cosmically empowered Sabretooth.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} of Domokos and Várkonyi has curved edges and resembles a sphere with a squashed top. In the top figure, it rests in its stable equilibrium. Its unstable equilibrium position is obtained by rotating the figure 180° about a horizontal axis. Theoretically, it will rest there, but the smallest perturbation will <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the stable point. The mathematical gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its flatness and thinness are minimal, {{and this is}} the only type of nondegenerate object with this property. Domokos and Várkonyi are interested to find a polyhedral solution with the surface consisting of a minimal number of flat planes. Therefore, they offer a prize to anyone who finds such solution, which amounts to $10,000 divided by the number of planes in the solution. Obviously, one can approximate their curvilinear gömböc with a finite number of discrete surfaces, however, their estimate is it will take thousands of planes to achieve that. They hope, by offering this prize, to stimulate finding a radically different solution from their own.|$|E
25|$|An {{elliptical}} orbit calculated by Sekanina and Chodas in 2012 indicates that Comet Lovejoy is {{a fragment of}} an unrecorded sungrazer that reached perihelion around 1329. The fragmentation history suggested by these authors is that a parent sungrazer, likely the comet observed in 467CE, split near the Sun due to tidal forces during its pass. The principal fragmentor a non-tidally fragmented portion of itreturned as the Great Comet of 1106, but a secondary fragment was imparted a longer orbital period and returned about 1329. This secondary also split at perihelion and its principal fragment will return around 2200, likely as a cluster of further fragments. A secondary fragment of this event left on a shorter period that theoretically should <b>bring</b> <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the inner solar system}} {{during the early years of}} the 21st century. At some point after perihelion, this secondary fragment broke apart due to non-tidal forces and one of the resulting fragments became Comet Lovejoy. Other similar fragments may also exist and might return as sungrazers in the near future.|$|E
