On live air, Krusty begins interviewing audience members, and Ralph takes the opportunity to declare that Lisa is {{the love of his}} life and that he intends to marry her in the future. Angry, Lisa snaps, stating that she had never liked him and that the only reason she gave him a Valentine was <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> else would. Later at home, Bart takes the moment to replay that scene to Lisa in which Ralph is humiliated and deeply hurt. Lisa soon feels guilty and regrets her actions in hurting Ralph's feelings.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} losing the British Commonwealth Championship, Devitt signed a {{contract}} with New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in March 2006. In April 2006, he made his NJPW debut against El Samurai, using the ring name Prince Devitt. Devitt later stated in an interview with PowerSlam Mag that New Japan renamed him Prince Devitt <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> Japanese could pronounce his actual name. He was originally going to be called King David, until people started questioning why the 24-year-old would be a king already. Eventually, Simon Inoki came up with the name Prince Devitt, which Devitt himself also preferred. In May 2006, New Japan started holding brandexclusive events, and Devitt was assigned to the Wrestle Land brand, debuting under a mask as the second Pegasus Kid, which led to comparisons between Devitt and the original Pegasus Kid, Chris Benoit.|$|E

I hope it's not happening, <b>because</b> <b>nobody's</b> called me! If it does, I hope they do call."

25|$|In November 1977, RCD Mallorca {{became the}} first club in Spanish soccer in which the players {{enclosed}} themselves in the locker room, demanding payment of their salaries.

25|$|Other {{images of}} despair and madness fill the scene: a lunatic cavorts {{in the street}} beating himself {{over the head with}} a pair of bellows while holding a baby impaled on a spike—the dead child's frantic mother rushes from the house {{screaming}} in horror; a barber has taken his own life in the dilapidated attic of his barber-shop, ruined <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> can afford a haircut or shave; on the steps, below the woman who has let her baby fall, a skeletal pamphlet-seller rests, perhaps dead of starvation, as the unsold moralising pamphlet on the evils of gin-drinking, The Downfall of Mrs Gin, slips from his basket. An ex-soldier, he has pawned most of his clothes to buy the gin in his basket, next to the pamphlet that denounces it. Next to him sits a black dog, a symbol of despair and depression. Outside the distiller a fight has broken out, and a crazed cripple raises his crutch to strike his blind compatriot.|$|E

25|$|The British central government's {{policy of}} {{cultural}} suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade {{the wearing of}} kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 {{and in the early}} 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing {{was an integral part of}} the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself.|$|E

Kyle suggests he could sing the [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] song as a non-religious substitute, but his suggestion is rejected <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> else believes in Mr. Hankey, a living and talking [...] "Christmas poo".

500|$|Simpson {{noted that}} despite these {{critical}} reviews, {{within the field}} of British folkloristics Murray's theories were permitted [...] "to pass unapproved but unchallenged, either out of politeness or <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> was really interested enough to research the topic". As evidence, she noted that no substantial research articles on the subject of witchcraft were published in Folklore between Murray's in 1917 and Rossell Hope Robbins' in 1963. She also highlighted that when regional studies of British folklore were published in this period by folklorists like Theo Brown, Ruth Tongue, or Enid Porter, none adopted the Murrayite framework for interpreting witchcraft beliefs, thus evidencing her claim that Murray's theories were widely ignored by scholars of folkloristics.|$|E
500|$|Although Viceroy Cisneros {{attempted}} {{to conceal the}} news of the Spanish defeat, the rumor had already spread throughout Buenos Aires. Most of the population was uneasy; there was high activity at the barracks and in the Plaza, and most shops were closed.

People who sympathized with the absolutist government were harassed, but the fights were of little consequence <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> was allowed to take muskets or swords out of the barracks.|$|E

So did Buster Keaton, so did Andy." [...] Carl Reiner {{recalled}} his distinction in the comedy world: Did Andy influence comedy? No. <b>Because</b> <b>nobody's</b> doing what he did. Jim Carrey was influenced—not to do what Andy did, but to follow his own drummer. I think Andy did that for a lot of people. Follow your own drumbeat. You didn't have to go up there and say 'take my wife, please.' You could do anything that struck you as entertaining. It gave people freedom to be themselves." [...] Reiner also said of Kaufman: [...] "Nobody can see past the edges, where the character begins and he ends.|$|R
500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide whether you want to play against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E
500|$|Due to Duchovny's contract, he {{was only}} {{available}} for shooting on certain days. Spotnitz commented on the irony of [...] "paying all this money to get [...] services for a limited time" [...] only to have him {{spend most of the}} episode [...] "in a hospital bed, semi-dead". He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the [...] "most satisfying use of the actor or character". Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people. For instance, the scene of Mulder's exhumation was filmed with a double who wore a mask of Duchovny's face. Head make-up artist Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later said [...] "It was brilliant, <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> knew that." [...] For the shots of the stunt double as well as Duchovny later in the episode, she used egg whites and a facial mask to give Mulder's skin a [...] "really cool, old, dried-up cracked skin effect." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews were {{initially}} mixed, but have since {{become much more}} positive.

The review ended with the assertion that the [...] "principals have some growing to do." [...] Modern reviews are more positive, however. Allmusic declares [...] "this is Grand Guignol pop—epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it's appealing because of all of this." [...] They acknowledge that Steinman is [...] "a composer without peer, simply <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> else wanted to make mini-epics like this." [...] Rundgren's production is applauded, as is the wit in the music and lyrics.

500|$|Jason {{has been}} {{referenced}} or parodied in other films. In the film Scream, directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore's character is being stalked by a killer who calls {{her on her}} home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is [...] "name the killer in Friday the 13th." [...] She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until Part 2. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked this question in a bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, Cursed, a wax sculpture of Jason, from Jason Goes to Hell, {{can be seen in}} a wax museum. [...] In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial [...] "The '80s Called".|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what we heard from doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if they really wanted to.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} and {{promotion}} of They Liked You Better When You Were Dead, the band were approached by their management about whom they wanted to produce their debut full-length album. They requested Colin Richardson; initially sceptical about their chances, Richardson agreed to collaborate after he listened to their demos. Fightstar entered studios in west London and Surrey with Richardson in October 2005. Richardson, who had previously produced albums for Funeral for a Friend, Machine Head and Fear Factory, was meticulous during pre-production and took five days to tune the drums. When recording began, he called the band [...] "very focused" [...] and {{said that there was}} a [...] "real buzz <b>because</b> <b>nobody</b> knows what to expect." [...] Grand Unification is a loose concept album, influenced by and based on the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series. With lyrics loosely based on the personal experiences of Charlie Simpson and Alex Westaway, its underlying concept revolves around two people who experience the last few days of their lives {{before the end of the}} world.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} the new vigor in the police {{department}} was felt in many other ways. There was a tenement-house law regarding buildings which were unfit for human habitations.

5000|$|Snoop Dogg {{announced}} plans {{for the release of}} a film, and soundtrack alongside Wiz Khalifa back in January, with the release of the song [...] "That Good", originally intended to be the soundtrack's lead single.

[...] "I'm a fan of it, separate myself from making it, I'm a huge fan of it. Can't wait." [...] As far as the musical vibe of the soundtrack, Snoop described it, [...] "It's something to relax you and get you through the day; it's some real good music. The music is quality, I don't even have no title for it, as far as what kinda music is it, it's centric, it's ...," [...] Dogg said searching for the right words before his partner-in-rhyme lent a hand.
