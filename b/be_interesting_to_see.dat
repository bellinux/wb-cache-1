Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what unfolded between them.|$|E

[...] A central part of the show's premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network's insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.|$|E

[...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer.

[...] He felt that Tom Quinn's exit was his favourite moment in the first two episodes, and that Adam is [...] "just [...] cold" [...] as Tom. He also praised the character development, stating [...] "character development is excellent in this season. Danny receives great moments as he is brought into the spotlight from his feelings for Zoe to his conflicted feelings about things he does in the name of Queen and Country, but Danny doesn't break and let his emotions become a crutch like Tom did (when Tom wanted a sleeper agent not to the job MI-5 wanted the sleeper to do)."

[...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate.

[...] In 2004, Shore and executive producers Katie Jacobs and Paul Attanasio pitched House to Fox as a medical detective showa hospital whodunit where the doctors would be the sleuths looking for the source of symptoms. The ideas behind House's character were added after Fox bought the show. Shore wrote the pilot with a vivid memory of a doctor's visit: he once had to wait two weeks to get a doctor's appointment for a sore hip, by which point his pain had disappeared. Nevertheless, Shore stated that the doctors were [...] "incredibly polite". Shore later stated that, as he wrote the pilot, {{he fell in love with}} a character who, as a doctor, would actually ask the question [...] "Why am I wasting your time?".|$|E

O'Reilly described Naomi as having a [...] "good heart", {{but when it came to}} getting what she wants, some of her actions were [...] "questionable". She also said Naomi was good at turning a situation to her advantage, and likened her to a cat, as she enjoys the [...] "finer things in life". The actress continued, [...] "On top of all that, she is her mother's daughter. She has the Canning straight up, strength and vulgarity that her genes and upbringing have given her in spades. She's quirky but sophisticated, and at times petulant and silly. All in all, she is very, very fun to play." [...] O'Reilly did not think Naomi was bad, but she was spoilt and always tried to get her own way. However, underneath the surface, she was kind and caring. When asked whether viewers would like Naomi, O'Reilly believed that she could turn out to be a [...] "character everyone loves to hate".|$|E
500|$|In February 2006, {{four months}} before the release of Superman Returns, Warner Bros. {{announced}} a summer 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer returning as director. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were expected to reprise their roles, however, {{with the release of}} Superman Returns in July 2006, Warner Bros. was hesitant on moving forward with development. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film, but that it [...] "should have done $500million worldwide.

I don't know what constitutes under-performing these days..." [...] Filming was supposed to start in March 2008; no screenplay was ever written, but Singer would have titled it Man of Steel, with an interest in Darkseid as the main villain. Singer stressed {{that it would have been}} more action-packed than Superman Returns. while writer Michael Dougherty was interested in using Brainiac. [...] "In my mind, if the Kryptonians really were a space-faring race... it would only make sense that there would've been colonies and off-planet missions... other Kryptonians making their way to Earth seemed like a pretty big one.

500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we knew we were going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie {{entered the}} show as the estranged wife of [...] "one of the most iconic {{characters}} in soap history", Den Watts, and was deliberately presented as [...] "very different to the first Mrs. Watts." [...] When EastEnders began in 1985 viewers had watched Den's affairs and manipulation gradually take their toll on his wife, Angie, who was unable {{to compete in the}} games he played. Chrissie was intended to be a contrast to her predecessor; where Angie turned to alcohol, Chrissie was more Den's [...] "equal" [...] and could be just as devious and calculating, with Oberman observing how [...] "Angie was all knee-jerk reaction, but Chrissie is more of a plotter and schemer – just like Den." [...] Comparing Den's two wives, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie's much cooler than Angie. Her motto is, 'revenge is a dish best served cold'. She's tougher than Angie and she can hold it together much better." [...] Indeed, according to Oberman, producers deliberately wanted to take Den's second marriage down a different path to his first; whereas the relationship between Den and Angie had been likened to Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, that between Den and Chrissie was modelled on Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. Like Den, Chrissie had an acerbic tongue and their relationship was marked by verbal fencing in the manner of Hepburn and Tracy: [...] "What's great is that they've written Den an equal", Oberman noted, [...] "It'll <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their little sparring matches." [...] The attraction was intended to be mutual, unlike Den's one-sided marriage to Angie. Trying to win Chrissie around into giving their marriage another try, Den declared: [...] "I know we've got a great relationship even when we're tearing lumps out of each other, you give as good as you get and that's the sort of marriage I've always wanted".
