5|$|Woods {{has spent}} the most {{consecutive}} and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings. He {{is one of five}} players (along with Gene Sarazen, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so. Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Go Man Go {{went on to}} sire two All American Futurity {{winners and}} seven Champion Quarter Running Horses. He was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame, as were two of his offspring. His daughters also produced, or were the mothers of, a number of race winners, including the Hall of Fame members Kaweah Bar and Rocket Wrangler. The director of racing for the AQHA once compared his impact on Quarter Horse racing and breeding to that of Man o' War in Thoroughbred racing, or that of human athletes such as <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> and Babe Ruth.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the Second World War meant the Ryder Cup was not contested again until 1947 at Portland Golf Club. The United States {{dominated}} the match in wet conditions, as Great Britain scored one point in an 11–1 defeat. The 1949 match was closer than the previous contest. Great Britain went into the final day with a 3–1 lead, but {{they were unable to}} secure the three and a half points they needed to win and lost 7–5. The 1951 contest at Pinehurst Resort, was again won by the United States. Such was the dominance in their 9½–2½ victory, that only two of the twelve matches reached the 18th hole. Before the 1953 contest Great Britain were given a boost when American <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> decided not to participate. He had won three of the four men's major golf championships during the year and his absence gave them optimism. However, they were unable to beat the United States; mistakes {{at the end of their}} singles matches by Peter Alliss and Bernard Hunt cost Great Britain as they lost 6½–5½. Despite recording their best points total in matches held in the United States, Great Britain were again defeated in 1955. The United States won 8–4 to extend their winning streak to 21 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, he {{sold the}} company to American Machine and Foundry (AMF), but stayed on as {{chairman}} of the board for several more years. AMF <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> golf clubs were sold continuously from 1960 to 1985 when AMF was bought by Minstar who sold The <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> company in 1988 to Cosmo World, who owned the club manufacturer until 1992, when it was sold to another independent investor, Bill Goodwin.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> Award {{is given}} by Friends of Golf and the Golf Coaches Association of America to the best college golf player since 1990.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Trust Open and Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, both {{identified}} with <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> although the Colonial is more closely {{identified with}} {{him since he}} won that tournament five times.|$|E
25|$|Callaway Golf also markets {{products}} {{under the}} Odyssey putter brand, acquired in 1997, {{as well as}} Strata and <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> golf brands picked up following the bankruptcy of Spalding's former golf division in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> Award {{is given}} {{annually}} by the Golf Writers Association of America to a golfer who has stayed active in golf despite a physical handicap or serious illness. The first winner was Babe Zaharias.|$|E
25|$|He was {{inducted}} into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. In 1976, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> was voted the Bob Jones Award, the highest honor given by the United States Golf Association in recognition of distinguished sportsmanship in golf.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{to have been}} among the greatest ball strikers ever to have played golf. Although he had a formidable record as a tournament winner, it is this aspect of Hogan which mostly underpins his modern reputation.|$|E
25|$|Hy Peskin, a staff {{photographer}} for Sports Illustrated, took an iconic photo of <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> playing a 1-iron {{shot to the}} green at the 72nd hole of the 1950 U.S. Open. It was ranked by Sports Illustrated {{as one of the}} greatest sports photographs of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|All of the totals {{above are}} {{stand-alone}} records {{with the exception}} of the longest streak of consecutive cuts made in majors at 39 which was equaled by Tiger Woods (1996–2006) and the longest streak of top-10s in majors which is held by <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> with 18 between 1948 and 1956.|$|E
25|$|Goodwin {{moved the}} company out of Fort Worth, and a union shop, to Virginia {{so it would}} be close to his home of {{operations}} for other AMF brands and, incidentally, a non-union shop in an effort to return the company to profitability. Goodwin sold to Spalding in 1997, closing the sale in January 1998. Spalding returned manufacturing to Hogan's Fort Worth, Texas roots before eventually including the company's assets in a bankruptcy sale of Spalding's Topflite division to Callaway in 2004. Callaway now owns the rights to the <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> brand. After over a half century and numerous ownership changes, the <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> line was discontinued by Callaway in 2008. In May 2014, Terry Koehler of Eldolon Brands approached Perry Ellis International and got the rights to use Ben Hogan's name for a line of golf clubs.|$|E
25|$|William <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> (August 13, 1912 – July 25, 1997) was an American {{professional}} golfer, {{generally considered}} one of the greatest players {{in the history of the}} game. Born within six months of two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century, Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{was ranked}} as the fifth {{greatest}} golfer {{of all time}} by Golf Digest magazine in 2000. On this list, Jack Nicklaus was first, Nelson's longtime rivals <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> and Sam Snead were second and third respectively, and Bobby Jones was fourth. A 2009 Sports Illustrated panel ranked him seventh on its list of all-time greatest golfers, behind Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Jones, Hogan, Snead, and Arnold Palmer.|$|E
25|$|Spieth, age 21, {{became the}} {{youngest}} U.S. Open champion in 92 years, since Bobby Jones in 1923. Also the reigning Masters champion, Spieth is the youngest to win the Masters and U.S. Open in the same year, passing Tiger Woods, who won both in 2002 at age 26. Others to win the first two majors of the year were Craig Wood (1941), <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> (1951, 1953), Arnold Palmer (1960), and Jack Nicklaus (1972).|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Miami-based textile company Supreme International {{purchased}} the Perry Ellis brand from Salant, a licensee of Perry Ellis that acquired it from Manhattan Industries in 1986. Supreme renamed itself Perry Ellis International {{and the company}} became traded on the NASDAQ under PERY. Perry Ellis International also owns and licenses other notable fashion brands, such as Original Penguin by Munsingwear, Cubavera, C California, Rafaella, Laundry by Shelli Segal, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> Jantzen, Nike Swim and Callaway, among others.|$|E
25|$|Palmer is also {{credited}} by {{many for}} securing {{the status of}} The Open Championship (British Open) among U.S. players. Before <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> won that championship in 1953, few American professionals had traveled to play in The Open, due to its extensive travel requirements, relatively small purse, and the style of its links courses (radically different from most American courses). Palmer wanted to emulate the feats of his predecessors Bobby Jones, Sam Snead and Hogan in his quest to become a leading American golfer.|$|E
25|$|In {{a career}} that spanned more than six decades, he won 62 PGA Tour titles from 1955 to 1973, placing him at that time behind only Sam Snead and <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> and still fifth on the Tour's all-time victory list. He {{collected}} seven major titles in a six-plus-year domination, from the 1958 Masters to the 1964 Masters. He also won the PGA Tour Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998, and in 1974 {{was one of the}} 13 original inductees into the World Golf Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|After winning two {{majors in}} a row heading into the 2006 U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Mickelson was bidding to join <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three {{consecutive}} majors (not necessarily in the same calendar year). Mickelson was the joint-leader going into the final round, but {{he was part of}} a wild finish to the tournament, in which he made major mistakes on the final hole and ended up in a tie for second place at +6 (286), one shot behind Australian winner Geoff Ogilvy.|$|E
25|$|Jones's four {{titles in}} the U.S. Open remain tied for the most ever in that championship, along with Willie Anderson, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> and Jack Nicklaus. His four second-place {{finishes}} in the U.S. Open place him second all-time with Sam Snead and Nicklaus. Phil Mickelson holds the dubious record with six (1999, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013) second-place finishes. His five {{titles in the}} U.S. Amateur are a record. Jones was ranked as the fourth greatest golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine in 2000. Nicklaus was first, Hogan second, and Snead third. Jones was ranked as the third greatest golfer of all time in a major survey published by Golf Magazine, September 2009. Nicklaus was ranked first, with Tiger Woods second, Hogan fourth, and Snead fifth.|$|E
25|$|The first post-World War II {{winner was}} the American Sam Snead, in 1946. In 1947, Northern Ireland's Fred Daly was victorious. While {{there have been}} many English and Scottish champions, Daly was the only winner from Ireland until the 2007 victory by Pádraig Harrington. There has never been a Welsh champion. In the early postwar years The Open was {{dominated}} by golfers from the Commonwealth, with South African Bobby Locke and Australian Peter Thomson winning the Claret Jug in eight of the 11 championships from 1948 and 1958 between them. During this period, The Open often had a schedule conflict with the match-play PGA Championship, which meant that <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> the best American golfer at this time, competed in The Open just once, in 1953 at Carnoustie, a tournament he won.|$|E
25|$|The golf {{team has}} won one team {{national}} title (1998) and has produced two individual national champions (Warren Schutte in 1991 and Ryan Moore in 2004), {{as well as}} eight conference championships (Big West: 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996; Mountain West: 2000, 2002, 2016, 2017), 21 consecutive NCAA berths, four NCAA West Regional titles, six conference individual titles, 21 All-Americans (39 times), three NCAA Regional medalists, two National Coach of the Year awards, one <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> Award winner, one Jack Nicklaus Award winner, one Haskins Award winner, one Golfstat Award winner, one National Freshman of the Year, 10 Conference MVPs and two Conference Freshman of the Year winners. The golf program has turned out numerous PGA Tour pros, including Ryan Moore, Chad Campbell, Chris Riley, Adam Scott, Charley Hoffman, Bill Lunde and Andres Gonzales.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Nicklaus {{also won}} The Open Championship at Muirfield in Scotland under {{difficult}} weather conditions, using his driver just 17 times, because of very heavy rough. This {{was the only}} major {{he had failed to}} win up to that point. This win made him the youngest player, age 26 (his fifth year on Tour), and the only one after Gene Sarazen, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> and Gary Player (until Tiger Woods at age 24 in 2000, also during his fifth year on Tour) to win all four major championships, now known as the Career Slam. Nicklaus eventually accomplished the double career slam in 1971 and the triple career slam in 1978, winning all four majors two and three times, respectively. Nicklaus was part of another title for the U.S. in the World Cup in Japan. Nicklaus concluded 1966 playing 22 official worldwide events, with four victories, four runners-up, 14 top-5 finishes, 16 top-10 finishes, and zero missed cuts.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980 PGA Championship, Nicklaus set {{another record}} {{in winning the}} {{championship}} by seven shots over Andy Bean at the Oak Hill Country Club, largely due to exceptional putting. Nicklaus shot an even-par 70 {{in the first round}} followed by three successive rounds in the 60s over the difficult course, and was the only player to break par for the 72 holes. For the week, the field averaged 74.60 strokes while Nicklaus averaged 68.50. This was Nicklaus' fifth and final victory in the PGA Championship, which elevated him to record-holder for the most wins in the stroke-play era, and which tied him with Walter Hagen for the most wins overall, since Hagen's victories were all during the match-play era. Nicklaus' seven-shot winning margin remained the largest for the stroke-play version of the championship until Rory's McIroy's 2012 victory. This victory also made Nicklaus the only player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 and <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> in 1948 to win the U.S. Open and PGA Championship the same year (subsequently equaled by Tiger Woods in 2000).|$|E
25|$|At the 1960 U.S. Open, Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, {{finishing}} {{in second}} place two strokes behind Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> who later remarked {{that he had just}} played 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.|$|E
25|$|Woods's major {{championship}} streak was seriously threatened at the 2000 PGA Championship, when Bob May went head-to-head with Woods on Sunday at Valhalla Golf Club. However, Woods played the last twelve holes of regulation seven under par, {{and won a}} three-hole aggregate playoff over May with a birdie on the first hole and pars on the next two. He joined <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> (1953) as the only other player to win three professional majors in one season. Three weeks later, he won his third straight start on Tour at the Bell Canadian Open, becoming only the second man after Lee Trevino in 1971 to win the Triple Crown of Golf (U.S., British, and Canadian Opens) in one year. By the end of Woods' 2000 campaign, he had won three consecutive majors, nine PGA Tour events, and had set or tied 27 Tour records. Of the twenty events he entered, he {{finished in the top}} three fourteen times. His adjusted scoring average of 67.79 and his actual scoring average of 68.17 were the lowest in PGA Tour history, besting his own record of 68.43 in 1999 and Byron Nelson's average of 68.33 in 1945. He was named the 2000 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, becoming the first athlete to be honored twice, a feat that was matched by LeBron James in 2016. Woods was ranked as the twelfth best golfer of all time by Golf Digest magazine just four years after he turned professional.|$|E
500|$|<b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> won in {{a playoff}} against Lloyd Mangrum and George Fazio.|$|E
500|$|Three players {{share the}} record for most runner-up {{finishes}} with four: <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> (1942, 1946, 1954, 1955), Tom Weiskopf (1969, 1972, 1974, 1975), Jack Nicklaus (1964, 1971, 1977, 1981) ...|$|E
500|$|The Champions' Dinner is {{held each}} year on the Tuesday evening {{preceding}} Thursday's first round. The dinner was first held in 1952, hosted by defending champion <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> to honor the past champions of the tournament. At that time 15 tournaments had been played, {{and the number of}} past champions was 11. Officially known as the [...] "Masters Club", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.|$|E
500|$|The first {{winner of}} the Masters Tournament was Horton Smith in 1934, and he {{repeated}} in 1936. The player with the most Masters victories is Jack Nicklaus, who won six times between 1963 and 1986. Arnold Palmer and Tiger Woods have each won four, and Jimmy Demaret, Gary Player, Sam Snead, Nick Faldo, and Phil Mickelson have three titles to their name. Player was the tournament's first overseas winner with his first victory in 1961. [...] Two-time champions include Byron Nelson, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan,</b> Tom Watson, Seve Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Ben Crenshaw, José María Olazábal, and Bubba Watson.|$|E
500|$|Willie Anderson, Bobby Jones, <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> and Jack Nicklaus {{hold the}} record for the most U.S. Open {{victories}}, with four victories each. Anderson holds {{the record for}} most consecutive wins with three (1903–05). Hale Irwin is the oldest winner of the U.S. Open: he was [...] old when he won in 1990. The youngest winner of the U.S. Open is John McDermott who was [...] old when he won in 1911. Rory McIlroy holds {{the record for the}} lowest aggregate score in 2011 at 268. Rory McIlroy and Brooks Koepka share the record for the lowest score in relation to par with their winning scores of -16.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the team}} was at first left up to Brown, who {{rejected}} calls {{for it to be}} christened the Browns. McBride then held a contest to name the team in May 1945; [...] "Cleveland Panthers" [...] was the winning choice, but Brown rejected it because it was the name of an earlier failed football team. [...] "That old Panthers team failed", Brown said. [...] "I want no part of that name." [...] In August, McBride gave in to popular demand and christened the team the Browns, despite Paul Brown's objections. With the roster fixed and the team's name chosen, Brown set out to build a dynasty. [...] "I want to be what the New York Yankees are in baseball or <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> is in golf", he said.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Woods {{recorded}} {{six consecutive}} wins, the longest winning streak since <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> {{did it in}} 1948. One of these was the 2000 U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called [...] "the greatest performance in golf history," [...] in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000. At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam. At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.|$|E
500|$|Go Man Go was {{inducted}} into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 1990. A further honor was the naming of a stakes race after him, the Grade I Go Man Go Handicap run in September at Los Alamitos. Walt Wiggins, a racing commentator and author, said of Go Man Go: [...] "He was a brilliant speedhorse, some say the fastest ever. He was wild and reckless, a rogue at first, and often a clown who seldom saw the uniqueness of his talents or the seriousness of his commission. He had intrinsic greatness and couldn't care less." [...] Dan Essary, who was Director of Racing for the AQHA for many years, described Go Man Go's impact on the Quarter Horse breed as [...] "He was to Quarter Horse racing what Babe Ruth was to baseball, what <b>Ben</b> <b>Hogan</b> was to Golf and what Man o'War was to Thoroughbred racing. Horses may have run faster and horses have earned more money, but the fame of Go Man Go lingers." ...|$|E
