Here, three flume runs were {{used to examine the}} influence of sediment grain size and transport rate on the characteristics of hydraulic-jump <b>unit</b> <b>bars.</b> In one of these runs six hydraulic-jump <b>unit</b> <b>bars</b> formed a hydraulic-jump bar complex. In another, the same sediment was supplied more quickly and only two <b>unit</b> <b>bars</b> formed. In the third run with the same sediment supply rate, but different grain size, only one large <b>unit</b> <b>bar</b> formed. All <b>unit</b> <b>bars</b> developed in a similar way but their size and internal architecture differed; they all resulted from a reduction in sediment transport capacity at the transition from supercritical flow to subcritical flow in the hydraulic jump. After initial onset of sedimentation and <b>unit</b> <b>bar</b> formation, generation of subsequent <b>unit</b> <b>bars</b> may be: (i) related to small changes in sediment flux; and (ii) independent of changes in the hydraulic jump. Continued sedimentation caused changes from oscillating to weak hydraulic jumps and hydraulic-jump <b>unit</b> <b>bars</b> formed in both circumstances. The flow of water and suspended sediment becomes shallower over the lee of the bar complex. This leads to flow acceleration and a return to supercritical flow conditions. In turn, a chain of such features can form and generate a chute and pool bed morphology. There is an inherent upper size limit to a hydraulic-jump bar complex due to the changing flow conditions over the growing deposit as the water above it becomes shallower.

40|$|Bismuth {{chalcogenides}} {{are quite}} interesting {{due to their}} potential as useful thermoelectric materials. 1 - 4 Recently, many new ternary and quaternary compounds have been discovered that possess promising thermoelectric property. 5, 6 Furthermore, fundamental interest in these compounds is growing due to their structural diversity they exhibit. For example, the compounds of a general formula of ABi 3 Q 5 (A=K, Rb, Cs; Q=S, Se, Te) 7 - 11 {{are known to have}} six different structure types. The polymorphism is made possible by subtle changes in the edge-sharing modes between the infinite BiQ 6 (Q=S, Se) octahedral chains found in the frameworks. Various edge-sharing modes between the octahedral chains can form many types of building units, resulting in a large number of new bismuth chalcogenide frameworks. This is because each BiQ 6 octahedron in one chain has maximum 10 edges available for edge-sharing with others in the neighboring chains. If all the 10 edges are shared with ten other BiQ 6 octahedra in six neighboring chains, then NaCl-type structure is formed. If fewer edges of an octahedron are to be shared, there are many possible ways of edge-sharing modes to be imagined. For example, (1 × 3) 12 building <b>bar</b> <b>units,</b> formed by sharing edges of BiQ 6 octahedra between three chains, are found in α-RbBi 3 Se 5. 9 (2 × 3) building <b>bar</b> <b>units,</b> formed by the two (1 × 3) building <b>bar</b> <b>units,</b> are found in α-RbBi 3 Se 5, 9 γ-RbBi 3 S 5, 9 γ-RbBi 3 Se 5, 9 CsBi 3 S 5, 10 K 2 Bi 6. 33 S 10, 13 and K 2 Bi 8 S 13. 13 Further-more, (1 × 2) building <b>bar</b> <b>units</b> in Bi 2 S 3, 14 (2 × 2) units in α-RbBi 3 S 5, 11 (1 × 4) units in CsBi 3 Se 5, 9 and even (1 × 8) units in KBi 3 S 57, 8 are found.

Unfortunately, many of our existing tools/variables are unsuitable for this task {{because they do not}} work across multiple scales or with changing discharges. Asymmetry is one variable {{that can be used to}} either include or exclude variations in flow stage and that can be assessed across multiple scales. Existing asymmetry indices, however, are limited in scope and largely focus on only cross-sectional form. This study examines three existing asymmetry indices in the cross-stream and downstream planes (for cross-sections and riffle or pools, respectively) and develops nine new asymmetry indices that incorporate vertical, cross-stream and downstream asymmetry for bed elements (e. g. riffle crests, pool troughs, riffle entrance slope), bedforms (pools or riffles) and <b>bar</b> <b>units</b> (pool-riffle sequences) to investigate the utility of asymmetry as a measure of morphologic structure and diversity in fluvial systems.

The delta has a flattened lobate form with a peripheral strandplain of elongate lagoons and tidal flats separated by beach spits and low beach ridges. Three major stratigraphic components form the Gascoyne delta: basal sheet, deltaic sequence, and plain sequence. The basal sheet is a thin transgressive unit deposited uring the Holocene sea-level rise. Offshore it is shelly quartz sand with a relict, shallow-water sandflat fauna. Inshore it contains ediment admixed from contemporary seagrass communities oroverlying units. The deltaic sequence is a regressive t rrige-nous wedge overlying the basal sheet. It consists of the <b>bar</b> <b>unit,</b> the delta bay unit, and the strandplain sheet. The <b>bar</b> <b>unit</b> is an upward-coarsening sand body being deposited on the distributary mouth bars and the shoreface; it grades laterally into the delta bay unit, a muddy sand body accumulating in the protected embayment to the south of the delta.

40|$|Complexity and {{diversity}} are typically assessed by determining {{the variety of}} geomorphic structures within a river (e. g., benches, bars, islands, riffles, etc.) or its external variability. An alternative approach {{is to examine the}} variety of forms within a specific geomorphic structure (e. g., the variety of riffle morphologies along a river) or its internal variability. Although both of these approaches have merit, in systems containing {{only a small number of}} unique geomorphic structures, considering external variability alone may underestimate morphologic diversity and complexity. One way to assess internal variability is through the use of asymmetry. Asymmetry is a measure of how unbalanced a feature is (in terms of either its form or process) and in geomorphic terms, implies a tendency towards irregularity and complexity.

In Run 1, a hydraulic jump was formed in sediment-free water over the solid plane sloping flume floor. Ultrasonic Doppler velocity profilers recorded the flow structure within the hydraulic jump in fine detail. Run 2 had identical initial flow conditions and a near-steady addition of sand, which formed beds with two distinct characteristics: a laterally extensive, basal, wedge-shaped massive sand bed overlain by cross-laminated sand beds. Each cross-laminated bed recorded the initiation and growth of a single surface feature, here defined as a hydraulic-jump <b>unit</b> <b>bar.</b> A small massive sand mound formed on the flume floor and grew upstream and downstream without migrating to form a <b>unit</b> <b>bar.</b> In the upstream portion of the <b>unit</b> <b>bar,</b> sand finer than the bulk load formed a set of laminae dipping upstream.

40|$|Gravel-bed braided rivers are {{characterized}} by shallow, branching flow across low relief, complex and mobile bed topography. These conditions present a major challenge {{for the application of}} higher dimensional hydraulic models, the predictions of which are nevertheless vital to inform flood risk and ecosystem management. This paper demonstrates how high-resolution topographic survey and hydraulic monitoring at a density commensurate with model discretization can be used to advance hydrodynamic simulations in braided rivers. Specifically, we detail applications of the shallow water model, Delft 3 d, to the Rees River, New Zealand, at two nested scales: a 300 m braid <b>bar</b> <b>unit</b> and a 2. 5 km reach. In each case, terrestrial laser scanning was used to parameterize the topographic boundary condition at hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy. Dense observations of depth and velocity acquired from a mobile acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp), along with low-altitude aerial photography, were then used to create a data-rich framework for model calibration and testing at a range of discharges. Calibration focused on the estimation of spatially uniform roughness and horizontal eddy viscosity, ?H, through comparison of predictions with distributed hydraulic data. Results revealed strong sensitivity to ?H, which influenced cross-channel velocity and localization of high shear zones. The high resolution bed topography partially accounts for form resistance and the recovered roughness was found to scale by 1. 2 - 1. 4 D 84 grain diameter. Model performance was good for a range of flows, with minimal bias and tight error distributions, suggesting acceptable predictions can be achieved with spatially uniform roughness and ?H. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

Planning for {{a nuclear}} {{accident}} While nuclear power {{is important to the}} energy needs of the nation, it also presents a unique set of hazards that planners must be ready for.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore how geomorphic complexity and the diversity of morphologic structure differ between natural and channelised (planed and straightened) reaches of the Embarras River, USA. This study incorporates both traditional geomorphic indicators (e. g., width, depth, velocity, etc.) and the asymmetry of the river's cross-sections, bedforms (e. g., pools and riffles) and <b>bar</b> <b>units</b> (e. g., pool-riffle sequences). The results reveal considerable differences between the complexity and diversity of form within the two study reaches with the natural reach having a much more complex and diverse geomorphic character than the channelised reach. This complexity and diversity in geomorphic character is most clearly detected using a combination of traditional geomorphic indicators and asymmetry parameters rather than the more traditional geomorphic indicators alone. The advantage of asymmetry as an indicator lies in its ability to discriminate the internal variability of morphologic structures at multiple scales (e. g., bed elements, bedforms and <b>bar</b> <b>units)</b> which means it is not limited to considering parameters in a single dimension that may not have been significantly altered by channelisation whereas the more traditional indicators are suitable for identifying changes in overall channel dimensions...|$|R

The soil water potential measurement, expressed in <b>bars</b> <b>units,</b> is related to the energy status of the soil water. Tensiometer and electrical resistance sensors are some examples of soil sensors {{that can be used to}} gather water potential measurements. This method provides a more realistic measurement of the actual plant water stress and, therefore, has a significant value for irrigation purposes. On the other hand, the soil water content measurement provides an effective measurement of the portion of water in the soil sample. This aspect has a direct relation with the dielectric properties of the soil [6] and, consequently, impacts the underground wireless communication behavior [3 – 5, 7].|$|R
50|$|The meander {{wavelength}} or alternate bar {{sequence is}} considered the primary ecological and morphological unit of meandering alluvial rivers. The meander wavelength is composed of two alternating <b>bar</b> <b>units,</b> each with a pool scoured out from a cutbank, an aggradational lobe or point bar, and a riffle that connects the pool and point bar. In an idealized channel, the meander wavelength is around 10 to 11 channel widths. This equates to pools (and riffles and point bars) being separated {{by an average of}} 5 to 6 channel widths. The radius of curvature of a meander bend describes the tightness of a meander arc, and is measured by the radius of a circle that fits the meander arc. The radius of curvature is between 2 and 3 times the channel width.|$|R
