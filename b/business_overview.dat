Many traditional indicators of performance {{that have been used}} by the companies could not provide such support. Economic value added as an innovative approach to the measurement of business performance gives us a more realistic overview about {{the current state of the}} company. Taking into account the cost of equity and the possibility of execution of numerous accounting modifications represent significant innovations regarding to other concepts.

The implementation of Australia’s National Competition Policy (NCP) provided important underpinnings to recent economic growth.

40|$|Yelp online reviews are {{invaluable}} {{source of}} information for users to choose where to visit or what to eat among numerous available options. But due to overwhelming number of reviews, {{it is almost impossible}} for users to go through all reviews and find the information they are looking for. To provide a <b>business</b> <b>overview,</b> one solution is to give the business a 1 - 5 star(s). This rating can be subjective and biased toward users personality. In this paper, we predict a business rating based on user-generated reviews texts alone. This not only provides an overview of plentiful long review texts but also cancels out subjectivity. Selecting the restaurant category from Yelp Dataset Challenge, we use a combination of three feature generation methods as well as four machine learning models to find the best prediction result. Our approach is to create bag of words from the top frequent words in all raw text reviews, or top frequent words/adjectives from results of Part-of-Speech analysis. Our results show Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0. 6 for the combination of Linear Regression with either of the top frequent words from raw data or top frequent adjectives after Part-of-Speech (POS).

40|$|This {{fact sheet}} {{identifies}} and describes 10 major {{trends in the}} retail trade sector. Details and statistics for the following trends are discussed; the growth of e-commerce, kids in the retail market, building customer knowledge files, the American mall in decline, challenging the category killer, precision shopping, entertaining the customer, globalization of retail trade, smart cards, and the general decline in retail sales growth. Social and economic trends can define the environment local main street merchants operate. Often, major trends require adjustment in operating philosophy and strategy. Currently, many communities are in a planning process to produce ideas for downtown development and revitalization. Recent studies provided for these communities have analyzed sales tax trends and consumer shopping patterns. One such city had an additional request—an overview of retail trends facing downtown merchants and business people. This fact sheet provides a discussion of major trends impacting small businesses in the retail trade sector. Current publications, national reports and journals, and recent Internet articles were collected to provide ideas for the report. Ten significant trends were identified and are discussed on the following pages. It is hoped that this information will be useful to local groups, such as coalitions of retailers and economic development groups, and to other individuals concerned with the growth potential for retail <b>business.</b> <b>Overview</b> of Trends There are many trends and circumstances that can impact the potential for retail trade development. The following are 10 trends that stand out in recent literature. 1. E-Commerce. By 2005, the Internet will account for 25 percent of durable goods and merchandise sales. 2. Kids in Retail Trade.

40|$|I grew up {{participating}} in the theatrical performing arts {{since the age of}} three. Since then, I have been in, on average, at least one production a year for eighteen years. I attribute much of my success to the life lessons I learned growing as up a “theatre kid. ” Theatre is a great creative outlet for individuals to grow into their best selves in a diverse atmosphere where each person’s uniqueness is celebrated. From my experience, and the experience of others around me, I have found that theatre helps individuals build self-esteem, confidence, and happiness. Although there are so many advantages to {{participating in}} theatre, it is underappreciated by society. This is represented by many school programs cutting the budgets of arts education. In the state of Rhode Island, theatre programs are currently scarce and expensive. For my project, I explored the entrepreneurial effort of starting my own children’s theatre company called “Play Time Theater. ” This project has two main components: theory and application. The theory component is a comprehensive <b>business</b> <b>overview</b> that brings together and explains the various dimension of running a business. These dimensions include marketing, business law, human resources, and entrepreneurship. As a company, Play Time Theater offers creative writing and acting classes that teach the fundamentals of theatre education as well as basic creative writing and story-telling techniques. The company’s goal is to create a safe and inclusive atmosphere where children can grow. The application component is executing my theatre class in the local community. For this project, I taught my acting class at a local YMCA. It is important to apply the theory component of the project to be able to observe how the business actually operates. This project was extremely beneficial as it provided me the opportunity to apply the knowledge learned in my general business administration major in an actual business setting. The experience has furnished me insights I would not have learned in a classroom setting and I feel it has better prepared me for my future...|$|E

The emerging post-industrial society can be characterised by the dominance of service industry, more leisure time of the population, higher disposable income and more conscious consumers.

New customers of tourism and hospitality industry are not only more affluent – so less price conscious – and more quality orientated but they are also seeking activity, participation, fantasy, and experience.

Concept of Integrated Business Planning (IBP) [...] constituting the latest development stage of well-known Sales and Operations Planning (S&OP) [...] is proposed as the right response on how to master the challenges of globalized economy in this field.

40|$|All organizations, {{both private}} and public, must improve their {{business}} practices to survive in today's volatile and highly competitive marketplace. This thesis <b>overviews</b> <b>business</b> process reengineering principles, and examines four methodologies for its accomplishment. Based on existing approaches, the thesis develops a new reengineering procedure, called the Workflow Reengineering Methodology. This methodology uses workflow automation as an enabler for efficiently and effectively conducting reengineering. The proposed methodology consists of five phases and 32 component steps with associated data collection forms. The thesis also includes {{a case study of}} the application of a portion of the methodology using workflow data gathered from the Port Hueneme Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. The methodology and its data collection forms significantly streamlined the capture of process data, and facilitated the generation and analysis of workflow design alternatives. The proposed Workflow Reengineering Methodology promises to be a methodology that can be used with supporting workflow automation to improve an organization's business processes. (AN) U. S. Navy (U.

A low barrier to entry and the ease with which competitors copy services undermines differentiation. Retailers consolidate to capture economies of scale causing further homogenization of service. The Internet has exacerbated these conditions by lowering informational barriers for both customers and businesses alike. Competitors become locked in a death spiral of Bertrand price competition with the spoils going to the victor in a war of attrition. CRM is as old as commerce itself, but until recently, mass production and mass marketing have dominated most corporate strategies.
