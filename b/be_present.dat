5|$|Bulk lead {{exposed to}} moist air forms a {{protective}} layer of varying composition. Lead carbonate {{is a common}} constituent; the sulfate or chloride may also <b>be</b> <b>present</b> in urban or maritime settings. This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air. Finely powdered lead, as with many metals, is pyrophoric, and burns with a bluish-white flame.|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{health effects}} from {{volcanic}} ash fall are possible, as exposure to free crystalline silica {{is known to}} cause silicosis. Minerals associated with this include quartz, cristobalite and tridymite, which may all <b>be</b> <b>present</b> in volcanic ash. These minerals are described as ‘free’ silica as the SiO2 is not attached to another element {{to create a new}} mineral. However, magmas containing less than 58% SiO2 are thought to be unlikely to contain crystalline silica.|$|E
5|$|Clement {{worked to}} {{decrease}} the influence of Spanish cardinals in the College of Cardinals. He created five French cardinals, and the Italian cardinals he created were considered neutral.
