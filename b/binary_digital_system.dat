A major challenge facing MVL is the enormous size of the functional search space.

40|$|Much {{has been}} said in the {{literature}} regarding the problem of establishing symbol synchronization in <b>binary</b> baseband <b>digital</b> communication <b>systems.</b> By comparison, the literature contains little information relating to the extraction of symbol sync from multilevel baseband data. With the recent interest in multilevel amplitude-shift keying (MASK) and quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK) as signaling techniques for multilevel <b>digital</b> communications <b>systems,</b> the problem of providing symbol synchronization in the receivers of such systems becomes paramount. This paper presents a technique for extracting symbol sync from a MASK or QASK signal which has been transmitted over an infinite-bandwidth white Gaussian noise channel.

Molecular communication is considered {{to be one of the}} most promising approaches for the end-to-end communication between nanoscale devices. In this paper, both an optimal and a suboptimal receiver detection scheme are proposed for a diffusionbased <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> communication <b>system</b> in the presence of ISI. The transmission of binary information is accomplished by using On-Off Keying (OOK) with only one molecule. The proposed system can serve as the theoretical basis for end-toend communication in molecular nanonetworks where molecules of different types are used by different nanoscale devices. The effect of channel memory resulting from the residual molecule diffusion from previous transmissions is treated analytically in the formulation of the detection schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed detection schemes can maximize the mutual information over a practical range of the parameter of signaling interval without a priori information. A channel capacity of 1 bit per channel utilization during a signaling interval can be ultimately achieved by extending the duration of the signaling interval, even with infinite channel memory.

Though still at an early stage, there have been growing interests and research efforts dedicated to this communication technology. It has been identified that diffusion-based communications {{is one of the most}} promising approaches for end-to-end communication between nanoscale devices in the near future. In this paper, the design of a <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> communication <b>system</b> is proposed based on particle diffusion. Stochastic signaling through On-Off Keying (OOK) for random particle emission and a diffusion channel with memory is considered. The diffusion is considered in the cases of one, two, and three dimensions. The receiver detection problem is formulated by using an information-theoretic approach. The optimal decision threshold for the receiver detection is derived through mutual information maximization for two cases, namely, when the a priori probability of bit transmission is fixed and known to the receiver and when this probability is unknown to the receiver. Numerical results indicate that in the case of diffusion in one or two dimensions, the information of a priori probability plays a key role in optimizing the system performance, while it does not when considering the diffusion in three dimensions.

Our models are meshes of 2 D shapes represented by 2 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images, and meshes of the surface of 3 D shapes represented by 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. More specifically, this thesis contains the following two contributions: ^ First, we give an algorithm for converting constrained triangular meshes of polygonal domains into constrained and strictly convex quadrilateral meshes of the same domain. Our algorithm has linear time in the number of triangles of the input triangular mesh, produces a bounded number of quadrilaterals, offers better bounds than similar algorithms that also produce strictly convex quadrilateral meshes of bounded size, and tends to preserve the grading of the input triangular mesh. We also present examples to demonstrate that our algorithm can be successfully used to create quadrilateral meshes from 2 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images of anatomical shapes, such as the human brain. ^ Second, we provide a new algorithm for generating simplicial surface meshes that approximate the boundary of 3 D shapes represented by 3 D <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> images. Our algorithm is based on a simplified version of one of two known algorithms for generating provably good quality simplicial approximations of smooth, implicit surfaces.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an earlier}} paper written for a {{different}} readership [Computers and Graphics 13 (2) (1989) 159 – 166] the first author defined a digital fundamental group—an analog, for <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures, of the fundamental group. In general {{the definition of the}} digital fundamental group involves continuous deformation. But an alternative, discrete, definition of the digital fundamental group was proposed for the strongly normal digital picture spaces defined in the same paper. The above-mentioned paper also defined a “continuous analog” C(P) for each <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> picture P on such a DPS (DPS=digital picture space). C(P) is a polyhedron constructed by “filling in the gaps” between black points (1 's) of the <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> picture P in a specific way. Other kinds of continuous analog had previously been used by the first two authors. In seeking the simplest and most efficient algorithms for performing image processing operations, researchers have considered many different combinations of grids and adjacency relations. Almost all of those combinations are isomorphic to special cases of the concept of a strongly normal DPS. The main contribution of the present paper is a proof that the digital fundamental groups of <b>binary</b> <b>digital</b> pictures on a strongly normal DPS are naturally isomorphic to the fundamental groups of the digital pictures' continuous analogs. We use this result to establish that on a strongly normal DPS the discrete and continuous definitions of the digital fundamental group are equivalent, up to a natural group isomorphism. We also show that many topological results which hold in the Euclidean plane or Euclidean 3 -space have analogs that hold in every strongly normal DPS. Our results suggest that a strongly normal DPS is a suitable domain for studying topology-related image processing operations such as thinning, border tracking and contour filling. The definitions of digital fundamental group, strongly normal DPS and continuous analog are included in this paper so as to make it self-contained...|$|R
