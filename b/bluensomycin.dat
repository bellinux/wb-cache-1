50|$|Streptomyces bluensis is a {{bacterium}} species from the genus of Streptomyces which produces <b>bluensomycin.</b>|$|E
40|$|Of 100 natural {{isolates}} of drug-resistant enteric bacteria, 51 were {{resistant to}} spectinomycin (Spc) and 46 contained transferable R factors mediating Spc resistance. All SpcR R factors mediated streptomycin and <b>bluensomycin</b> resistance and were fi+ type. Extracts of R-SpcR strains adenylated Spc, dihydrospectinomycin, actinamine, streptomycin, and <b>bluensomycin</b> in vitro {{in the presence}} of adenosine triphosphate and Mg++. Results of genetic and biochemical studies support the hypothesis that these reactions are mediated by a single enzyme...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bluensomycin</b> (glebomycin) is an aminocyclitol {{antibiotic}} that differs structurally from dihydrostreptomycin {{in having}} bluensidine (1 D- 1 -O-carbamoyl- 3 -guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol) rather than streptidine (1, 3 -diguanidino- 1, 3 -dideoxy-scyllo-inositol) as its aminocyclitol moiety. Extracts of the <b>bluensomycin</b> producer Streptomyces hygroscopicus form glebosus ATCC 14607 (S. glebosus) {{were found to}} have aminodeoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity but to lack 1 D- 1 -guanidino- 3 -amino- 1, 3 -dideoxy-scyllo-inositol kinase activity, showing {{for the first time that}} these two reactions in streptomycin producers must be catalyzed by different enzymes. S. glebosus extracts therefore possess the same five enzymes required for synthesis of guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol from myo-inositol that are found in streptomycin producers but lack the next three of the four enzymes found in streptomycin producers that are required to synthesize the second guanidino group of streptidine-P. In place of a second guanidino group, S. glebosus extracts were found to catalyze a Mg 2 (+) -dependent carbamoylation of guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol to form bluensidine, followed by a phosphorylation to form bluensidine-P. The novel carbamoyl-P:guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol O-carbamoyltransferase and ATP:bluensidine phosphotransferase activities were not detected in streptomycin producers or in S. glebosus during its early rapid growth phase. Free bluensidine appears to be a normal intermediate in <b>bluensomycin</b> biosynthesis, in contrast to the case of streptomycin biosynthesis; in the latter, although exogenous streptidine can enter the pathway via streptidine-P, free streptidine is not an intermediate in the endogenous biosynthetic pathway. Comparison of the streptomycin and <b>bluensomycin</b> biosynthetic pathways provides a unique opportunity to evaluate those proposed mechanisms for the evolutionary acquisition of new biosynthetic capabilities that involve gene duplication and subsequent mutational changes in one member of the pair. In this model, there are at least five pairs of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions that can be analyzed for homology at both the protein and DNA levels, including two putative pairs of inositol kinases detected in this study...|$|E
40|$|As {{pathogens}} {{continue to}} evade therapeutical drugs, {{a better understanding}} of the mode of action of antibiotics continues to have high importance. A growing body of evidence points to RNA as a crucial target for antibacterial and antiviral drugs. For example, the aminocyclitol antibiotic streptomycin interacts with the 16 S ribosomal RNA and, in addition, inhibits group I intron splicing. To understand the mode of binding of streptomycin to RNA, we isolated small, streptomycin-binding RNA aptamers via in vitro selection. In addition, <b>bluensomycin,</b> a streptomycin analogue that does not inhibit splicing, was used in a counter-selection to obtain RNAs that bind streptomycin with high affinity and specificity. Although an RNA from the normal selection (motif 2) bound both antibiotics, an RNA from the counter-selection (motif 1) discriminated between streptomycin and <b>bluensomycin</b> by four orders of magnitude. The binding site of streptomycin on the RNAs was determined via chemical probing with dimethylsulfate and kethoxal. The minimal size required for drug binding was a 46 - and a 41 -mer RNA for motifs 1 and 2, respectively. Using Pb 2 + cleavage in the presence and absence of streptomycin, a conformational change spanning the entire mapped sequence length of motif 1 was observed only when both streptomycin and Mg 2 + were present. Both RNAs require Mg 2 + for binding streptomycin...|$|E
40|$|Of six {{antibiotics}} investigated, streptovaricin C had {{the most}} marked chemotherapeutic effect on Mycobacterium kansasii infections in mice. By the intraperitoneal route this antibiotic caused elimination of the pathogens from all organs. Kanamycin eliminated the pathogens from the lungs of all animals and from the spleens and livers of most of them. <b>Bluensomycin</b> also removed the pathogens from the lungs of all animals, and spectinomycin and lincomycin, from the lungs {{of the majority of}} the animals. The three latter antibiotics lowered the bacterial counts in liver and spleen. Streptovaricin C also decreased the bacterial counts in brain, spleen, and liver of mice inoculated intracerebrally with M. kansasii. In one experiment it completely eliminated this pathogen from the spleen and almost completely from the liver. The effect of streptovaricin C on the cerebral infection was more marked than that of streptovaricin complex. Respiratory and cerebral infections of mice with M. avium, serotypes I and II, were limited by streptovaricin C, and marked decreases of the bacterial counts in brain, lungs, spleen, and liver were observed...|$|E
40|$|Resistance (R) factor-mediated {{streptomycin}} (Sm) resistance {{differs from}} classical, high-level, chromosome-borne Sm resistance in its dominance over sensitivity {{and in the}} level of its effectiveness (in Escherichia coli ∼ 25 μg/ml versus > 2, 000 μg/ml). In addition, an R factor-containing strain, unlike high-level Sm-resistant bacteria, showed an inoculum effect with respect to its level of Sm resistance. Crude extracts of this strain destroyed the inhibitory activity of Sm and <b>bluensomycin</b> (Blue) on in vitro protein synthesis. The ribosomes from this strain proved to be sensitive to Sm in vitro. The requirements for in vitro inactivation of Sm (and Blue) were determined to be: extract, adenosine triphosphate or deoxyadenosinetriphosphate, and Mg++. Chromatographic techniques with radioisotopes revealed the formation of an inactivated form of Sm containing adenosine (or deoxyadenosine), phosphate, and Sm in equimolar amounts. The adenylate moiety is coupled to the streptobiosamine residue, rather than to the streptidine ring, of the Sm molecule. The adenylating enzyme, which is not induced by Sm, is located in the periplasmic space of the R factor-containing strain...|$|E
40|$|Streptomycin is an aminocyclitol {{glycoside}} antibiotic, which {{interferes with}} prokaryotic protein synthesis by {{interacting with the}} ribosomal RNA. We report here that streptomycin is also able to inhibit self splicing of the group I intron of the thymidylate synthase gene of phage T 4. The inhibition is kinetically competitive with the substrate guanosine. Streptomycin and guanosine have in common a guanidino group, which {{has been shown to}} undergo hydrogen bonds with the ribozyme (Bass & Cech, Biochemistry, 25, 1986, 4473). The inhibitory effect of streptomycin extends to other group I introns, but does not affect group II introns. Mutating the bulged nucleotide in the conserved P 7 secondary structure element of the td intron alters the affinity of the ribozyme for both guanosine and streptomycin. Myomycin, an antibiotic with similar effects on protein synthesis as streptomycin, is also able to inhibit splicing. In contrast, <b>bluensomycin,</b> which is structurally related to streptomycin, but contains only one guanidino group does not inhibit splicing. We discuss these findings in support of an evolutionary model that stresses the antiquity of antibiotics (J. Davies, Molecular Microbiology 4, 1990, 1227) ...|$|E
