5|$|These later castles did {{not always}} have a keep, but {{this may have been}} <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complex design of the castle as a whole drove up costs and the keep was sacrificed to save money. The larger towers {{provided}} space for habitation {{to make up for the}} loss of the donjon. Where keeps did exist, they were no longer square but polygonal or cylindrical. Gateways were more strongly defended, with the entrance to the castle usually between two half-round towers which were connected by a passage above the gateway– although there was great variety in the styles of gateway and entrances– and one or more portcullis.|$|E
25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their baryon content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their baryon content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E
25|$|Other {{aspects to}} be {{considered}} with this idea are the adverse effects on aquatic life of the San Juan River, lakes Managua and Colcibolca, the existing flora and fauna {{in the area that}} would be flooded by a proposed dam in the plan, and the environmental impact of the dam construction {{and all of the other}} related works. There is a conflict in the use of water for this irrigation project <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> area that is irrigated, the less water that is available for power generation and drinking water supply.|$|E

25|$|The despun section's {{instruments}} {{included the}} camera system; the near infrared mapping spectrometer to make multi-spectral images for atmospheric and moon surface chemical analysis; the ultraviolet spectrometer to study gases; and the photopolarimeter-radiometer to measure radiant and reflected energy. The camera system {{was designed to}} obtain images of Jupiter's satellites at resolutions 20 to 1,000 times better than Voyager best, because Galileo flew closer to the planet and its inner moons, and <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> modern CCD sensor in Galileo camera was more sensitive and had a broader color detection band than the vidicons of Voyager.|$|E
25|$|Not all Africanized hives {{display the}} typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders {{a point to}} begin {{breeding}} a gentler stock. Work {{has been done in}} Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee although they also contain African honey bee material. Also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of Africanized bee colonization, this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques. Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized bee is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.|$|E

[...] RTÉ.ie had a similar reaction, writing, [...] "Sure, the did-they-really-just-play-that? double takes arrive by the half-minute on their latest magnum opus (self-titled for extra definitiveness), but chances are you will come away from Dream Theater singing a chorus rather than throwing air guitar/bass/drums/keyboards/violin/conductor's baton shapes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} edition, Kuhn added a {{postscript}} {{in which he}} elaborated his ideas {{on the nature of}} scientific progress.

What if the observer is presented with these theories without any explicit indication of their chronological order? Kuhn anticipates that {{it will be possible to}} reconstruct their chronology on the basis of the theories' scope and content, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> recent a theory is, the better it will be as an instrument for solving the kinds of puzzle that scientists aim to solve. Kuhn remarked: [...] "That is not a relativist's position, and it displays the sense in which I am a convinced believer in scientific progress." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> you look at others the less you see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.|$|E

Gloria Allred, who represents most of the nearly 60 alleged victims, spoke to the gathering via Skype: [...] "I have been to New Jersey, and I'm not aware of any down side since they eliminated the statute (of limitations) for rape and sex assault." [...] Brauchler said he does not want any victim denied a fair hearing because of Colorado's statute, but [...] "I don't have a magic number". Any change would have to be done carefully, he said, <b>because</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> time that passes between an alleged sex assault and prosecution, the harder it is for the accused to defend themselves. Fields noted that Colorado has no statutory limit on murder. [...] "Why have an arbitrary cap for sex assault?" ...|$|E
