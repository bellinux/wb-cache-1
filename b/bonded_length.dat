The difference in <b>bond</b> <b>lengths</b> depends on chirality and radius of achiral tubes.

40|$|Optical fiber strain sensors {{with light}} weight, small {{dimensions}} and immunity to electromagnetic interference {{are widely used}} in structural health monitoring devices. As a sensor, {{it is expected that}} the strains between the optical fiber and host structure are the same. However, due to the shear deformation of the protective coating, the optical fiber strain is different from that of host structure. To improve the measurement accuracy, the strain measured by the optical fiber needs to be modified to reflect the influence of the coating. In this investigation, a theoretical model of the strain transferred from the host material to the optical fiber is developed to evaluate the interaction between the host material and coating. The theoretical predictions are validated with a numerical analysis using the finite element method. Experimental tests are performed to reveal the differential strains between the optical fiber strain sensor and test specimen. The Mach-Zehnder interferometric type fiber-optic sensor is adopted to measure the strain. Experimental results show that the strain measured at the optical fiber is lower than the true strain in the test specimen. The percentage of strain in the test specimen actually transferred to the optical fiber is dependent on the <b>bonded</b> <b>length</b> of the optical fiber and the protective coating.

40|$|The {{results of}} single-lap shear tests, {{conducted}} on specimens with fiber reinforced cemen- titious matrix (FRCM) composite strips bonded to concrete blocks, {{are presented in}} this paper. The FRCM composite was comprised of polyparaphenylene benzobisoxazole (PBO) fibers and polymer-modified cement-based mortar. This study indicates that in PBO FRCM–concrete joints debonding mainly occurs at the matrix–fiber interface. Friction between fiber filaments and between fibers and matrix is observed after the debonding process initiates. The experimental data suggest that a width effect does not exist among the fiber bundles, and an effective bond length can be defined and is approximately 260 mm.
