5000|$|The TM Forum {{conducted}} a <b>benchmark</b> <b>survey</b> in 2008 that concluded average leakage, not including losses due to fraud, was 1% {{of the gross}} revenues for those telcos that took part. [...] The number of participating telcos was relatively small compared to some other surveys, but the survey technique was more demanding than any comparable survey to date. The survey used the most detailed and prescriptive definition of how to calculate leakage of any survey of its type. The definition {{was taken from the}} TM Forum's own standard on how to calculate revenue assurance metrics http://www.tmforum.org/DocumentsRevenue/GB941ARevenueAssurance/33545/article.html. To increase confidence that participants calculated their leakages correctly, the TM Forum's benchmark program independently reviewed the results and corroborated them with representatives of the participating companies. The survey's average of 1% leakage of gross revenue, whilst still significant, is notably lower than many other quoted estimates and reported survey findings about average leakage. This may be because the survey used a very strict definition of leakage. The survey measured only actual under-billed and unbilled amounts discovered by the participants; it excluded other types of leakages such as cost leakages and loss of opportunity leakages, and it excluded projected leakage estimations that are commonly used (i.e., what would have been the amount of leakage, if the leakage would not been discovered by revenue assurance activities). It may also reflect a reduction in bias or exaggeration in reported leakages, or at least the exclusion of guesswork. Respondents were given authoritative instructions on how to quantify leakage based on actual data and were instructed to avoid making suppositions in the absence of such data.|$|E

40|$|Obtaining higher {{response}} rates to surveys {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult. This is happening in both household and establishment surveys. There has been much research focused on exploring the effectiveness of different forms of incentives in household survey, such as cash, gift cards, certificates etc. and the ‘optimum’ amount of the incentive. In practice, {{we have found that}} these incentives are not as effective for establishment surveys as they are for household surveys. We have experimented with a new incentive to boost the response rate of establishment surveys – providing an individual <b>benchmark</b> <b>survey</b> report to each participating establishment. The benchmark report shows how an individual company’s responses compare to the overall responses. To evaluate the effectiveness of this method we first compared the {{response rates}} from establishment surveys with and without benchmark incentive reports.

40|$|Four internationally-renowned universities-Chalmers University of Technology, Linkoping University, Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (USA) -developed a <b>benchmark</b> <b>survey</b> {{that may}} be used by any {{engineering}} school to benchmark curricula for teaching of personal, interpersonal and system building skills. These skills are enumerated in the CDIO Syllabus. Teaching activities were categorized as Introduce, Teach or Utilize, based on intent, time spent, and linkage to learning objectives, assignments and assessment criteria. Interviews were used to collect the data from instructors of the schools' engineering programs. The data was then reduced and analyzed to illuminate patterns of teaching. The results indicate that much effort is expended in covering these topics, but often in an inefficient, uncoordinated and unplanned manner. For example, there are often frequent repetitions of introducing a topic, without ever teaching it. In other instances, students are expected to utilize knowledge without having been taught it. The results of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>survey</b> indicate that a consistent and deliberately designed curriculum in this area could demand no additional resources, yet provide a much more effective education.

40|$|Ever since parks {{have been}} established, {{managers}} {{have sought to}} achieve their effective management {{through the development of}} a professional approach. Part of this professionalism is being able to evaluate the extent to which their parks protect natural and cultural values and deliver benefits to the community. Another part is demonstrating accountability and transparency in park management. Both require the systematic collection of information and reporting on performance. Parks Forum, the peak body for park management agencies, has established a benchmarking survey for use by its members to systematically collect information on their management performance. The Great Parks Network <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Survey</b> was initially developed, tested and implemented in 2007, with the benchmarks covering environmental, economic, social, cultural and management performance. The widely-used IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas management effectiveness evaluation approach, which assesses the context, planning, inputs, processes, outputs and outcomes of park management, guided development of the benchmarking measures. In 2010 a total of 26 member agencies, representing agencies serving city, regional, state and national populations, completed the online Great Parks Network <b>Benchmark</b> <b>Survey.</b> Provided in this report are analyses of the results of both the 2010 and 2007 surveys, with an emphasis on the results from the most recent survey.
