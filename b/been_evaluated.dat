HBO for TBI is controversial with further evidence required to determine if it has a role.|$|E
5|$|The {{tree sparrow}} has a large, {{currently}} unquantified range; its world population is also unknown, but includes an estimated 52–96 million individuals in Europe. Although population trends have not <b>been</b> <b>evaluated,</b> {{the species is}} not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (that is, declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species' conservation status is evaluated {{at the global level}} as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan for}} the {{extension}} to Camberwell was kept alive throughout the 1930s and, in 1940, the permission was used to construct sidings beyond Elephant & Castle. After the Second World War, the plans were revised again, with stations located under Walworth Road and Camberwell Green, and the extension appeared on tube maps in 1949. Rising construction costs caused by difficult ground conditions and restricted funds in the post-war austerity period led the scheme to be cancelled again in 1950. Various proposals have <b>been</b> <b>evaluated</b> since, including an extension to Peckham considered in the early 1970s, but the costs have always out-weighed the benefits.|$|E
