5|$|In May 1967, the Eastern Region {{declared}} independence {{as a state}} {{called the}} Republic of <b>Biafra,</b> {{under the leadership of}} Lt. Colonel Emeka Ojukwu. The Nigerian Civil War began as the official Nigerian government side (predominated by soldiers from the North and West) attacked <b>Biafra</b> (Southeastern) on 6 July 1967 at Garkem. The 30-month war, with a long siege of <b>Biafra</b> and its isolation from trade and supplies, ended in January 1970. Estimates of the number of dead in the former Eastern Region are between 1 and 3 million people, from warfare, disease, and starvation, during the 30-month civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of 1970 saw {{the end of}} the state of <b>Biafra.</b> On 12 January, the military surrendered to Nigeria, and Achebe returned with his family to Ogidi, where their home had been destroyed. He took a job at the University of Nigeria in Nsukka and immersed himself once again in academia. He was unable to accept invitations to other countries, however, because the Nigerian government revoked his passport due to his support for <b>Biafra.</b>|$|E
5|$|In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, {{released}} There Was a Country: A Personal History of <b>Biafra.</b> Publication immediately {{caused a}} stir and re-opened the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War. It {{would prove to be}} the last publication during his lifetime.|$|E
5000|$|Recorded at a {{performance}} in November 2001 on <b>Biafra's</b> Spitfire Tour, the album {{consists of a}} single, 34-minute track discussing <b>Biafra's</b> views on {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001 and subsequent [...] "War on Terror". It was released on April 16, 2002, by <b>Biafra's</b> own Alternative Tentacles label.|$|R

50|$|When <b>Biafra's</b> {{military}} resistance collapsed, Ojukwu fled to Côte d'Ivoire.|$|R
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in <b>Biafra.</b> Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when <b>Biafra,</b> led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations suddenly and openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E
5|$|The plot centres on Bond's {{mission to}} {{the civil war in}} the fictional country of Dahum—a thinly veiled version of <b>Biafra</b> during the Nigerian Civil War—where he meets the local MI6 contact, Efua Blessing Ogilvy-Grant, and a Rhodesian mercenary, Kobus Breed. After being shot by Ogilvy-Grant, Bond tracks both people to Washington on a revenge mission, finally {{establishing}} that Breed is trafficking heroin into the US.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in <b>Biafra</b> worsened {{as the war}} continued. In September 1968, {{the city}} of Aba fell to the Nigerian {{military}} and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged {{with the task of}} drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era. In 1969, the group completed a document entitled The Principles of the Biafran Revolution, later released as The Ahiara Declaration.|$|E
5000|$|Crassocephalum <b>biafrae</b> (Oliv. & Hiern) S. Moore, J. Bot. 50: 211, 1912 ...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{has been}} characterized by increased levels of oxidative stress, hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia which are implicated {{in the development of}} diabetic complications. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of aqueous leaf extract of Senecio <b>biafrae</b> on hyperglycemic and hyperlidemia on alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Twenty five male and female rats weights between 140 - 200 g were used for the study and divided into five groups of five rats in each. Group A were non-diabetic rats, the remaining four groups were induced interperitoneally with 150 mg/kg of alloxan monohydrate. Group B were diabetic control, Group C were metformin treated group, Group D were treated 200 mg/kg of Senecio <b>biafrae</b> aqueous leaf extract while Group E were treated with 400 mg/kg of Senecio <b>biafrae</b> aqueous leaf extract. The experiment period was 15 days, with the determination of their glucose level every two days. At the end of the experimental period blood sample were collected and total cholesterol, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein were assayed. Statistical analyses of the results shows significant reduction in the blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein levels of diabetic rats treated with Senecio <b>biafrae</b> aqueous leaf extract (with highest performance at 400 mg/kg) compared to diabetic control. Also, Senecio <b>biafrae</b> aqueous leaf extract treated diabetic rat’s shows significant increase in HDL levels compared to the diabetic control. Therefore these results suggested that the aqueous leaf extract of Senecio <b>biafrae</b> possess both hypoglyceamic and hypolipideamic effects...|$|R
2500|$|After the Dead Kennedys disbanded, <b>Biafra's</b> {{new songs}} were {{recorded}} with other bands, and he released only spoken word albums as solo projects. These collaborations had less popularity than <b>Biafra's</b> earlier work. However, his song [...] "That's Progress", originally recorded with D.O.A. for the album Last Scream of the Missing Neighbors, received considerable exposure {{when it appeared}} on the album Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1.|$|R
5|$|During a brief {{concert at}} the Tool and Die club in San Francisco, Dead Kennedys {{frontman}} and Alternative Tentacles overseer Jello <b>Biafra</b> witnessed their performance and became a fervent fan. <b>Biafra</b> invited the group to open for Dead Kennedys and T.S.O.L. at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles, and soon made an offer that would launch their recording career; {{if they could get}} someone to lend them studio time, Alternative Tentacles would reimburse the studio when the album was complete. The band then returned to San Antonio to record at BOSS Studios (a.k.a. Bob O'Neill's Sound Studios, a.k.a. the Boss). However, the Mathews brothers did not enter the studio with Haynes and Leary; the two had quit following a physical altercation between Scott Mathews and Haynes. The bass position was taken over by Bill Jolly, who would play on Butthole Surfers' next two releases, and a number of drummers participated. The last of these, King Coffey (born Jeffrey Coffey), is still with the band to this day.|$|E
5|$|In August 2008, {{during the}} Democratic National Convention in Denver, Rage headlined the free Tent State Music Festival to End the War. The band was {{supported}} by Flobots, State Radio, Jello <b>Biafra,</b> and Wayne Kramer. Following the concert, the band, following uniformed veterans from Iraq Veterans Against the War, led the 8,000 attendees to the Denver Coliseum on a 6-mile march to Invesco Field, host of the DNC. After a 4-hour stand-off with police, Obama's campaign agreed to meet with members of Iraq Veterans Against the War and hear their demands.|$|E
5|$|Thayil {{joined forces}} with former Dead Kennedys singer Jello <b>Biafra,</b> former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Gina Mainwal for one show, {{performing}} as The No WTO Combo during the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle on December 1, 1999. Thayil contributed guitar tracks to Steve Fisk's 2001 album, 999 Levels of Undo, as well as Dave Grohl's 2004 side-project album, Probot. In 2006, Thayil played guitar on the album Altar, the collaboration between the bands Sunn O))) and Boris.|$|E

5|$|When {{the region}} of <b>Biafra</b> broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E
5|$|Ramones {{concerts and}} {{recordings}} influenced many musicians {{central to the}} development of California punk as well, including Greg Ginn of Black Flag, Jello <b>Biafra</b> of the Dead Kennedys, Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Mike Ness of Social Distortion, Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion, and members of the Descendents. Canada's first major punk scenes—in Toronto and in British Columbia's Victoria and Vancouver—were also heavily influenced by the Ramones. In the late 1970s, many bands emerged with musical styles deeply indebted to the band's. There were the Lurkers from England, the Undertones from Ireland, Teenage Head from Canada, and the Zeros and the Dickies from southern California. The seminal hardcore band Bad Brains took its name from a Ramones song. The Riverdales emulated the sound of the Ramones throughout their career. Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong named his son Joey in homage to Joey Ramone, and drummer Tré Cool named his daughter Ramona.|$|E

25|$|Biafra's {{attempt to}} leave Nigeria {{resulted}} in the Nigerian Civil War. The state was formally recognised by Gabon, Haiti, Ivory Coast, Tanzania and Zambia. Other nations, which did not give official recognition but provided support and assistance to <b>Biafra,</b> included Israel, France, Spain, Portugal, Norway, Rhodesia, South Africa and the Vatican City. <b>Biafra</b> also received aid from non-state actors, including Joint Church Aid, Holy Ghost Fathers of Ireland, Caritas International, MarkPress and U.S. Catholic Relief Services. As at 2017, a new struggle for Biafran independence is being championed by the Indigenous People of <b>Biafra</b> (IPOB) led by Nnamdi Kanu and his London-based colleagues from where they run Radio <b>Biafra</b> and <b>Biafra</b> Television. The movement has grown rapidly {{that it has a}} following of many Igbo people at home and abroad. IPOB and its sister organizations, among which are Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of <b>Biafra</b> (MASSOB)'s have accused the Nigerian Army and the police of extrajudicial killings of their members.|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the nutritional composition of three traditional vegetables in Iree, Osun State. The leafy vegetables used were Cnidoscolus chayamansa (iyana ipaja), Solanium nodiflorum (Ogumo), and Senecio <b>biafrae</b> (worowo). The vegetables were washed in potable water to remove unwanted matters and were analyzed for proximate and mineral All analyses were carried out in three replicates and the data were evaluated for significant differences in their means with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) (p 0. 05). Cnidoscolus chayamansa had higher protein content (5. 91 %) and carbohydrate content (8. 88 %) {{but there was no}} significant difference (p > 0. 05) in the crude fibre value and that of Senecio <b>biafrae.</b> Senecio <b>biafrae</b> had higher moisture content (89 %) while Solanium nodiflorum had higher ash and fat content which were significantly different (p 0. 05) from the other vegetables. Cnidoscolus chayamansa had higher values in all the mineral contents determined and these were significantly different (p 0. 05) from other vegetable. There were no significant difference (p > 0. 05) in potassium, calcium and iron contents of Solanium nodiflorum and Senecio <b>biafrae.</b> The three vegetables are good sources of nutrients which could be consumed for normal growth...|$|R
