500|$|Crossing Bay-Abi {{on these}} {{imported}} Polish mares proved particularly successful for Varian. , the Varian ranch bred nine generations of horses descended from these foundation mares, and stood six successive generations of stallions descended from Bay Abi. The cross produced, among other champions, Varian's successor to Bay-Abi, the 1969 colt Bay el Bey (Bay Abi × Naganka), who was U.S. Reserve National Champion stallion twice, 1977 Canadian National Champion stallion, and a regional champion in English pleasure. At the time, the Arabian industry had {{little interest in}} western disciplines, so Varian competed with her horses in English riding classes. Of Bay el Bey, she commented, [...] "He could easily have been an open reining horse, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> him into an English pleasure horse because he could do it, he was so athletic." [...] Her English champions also included Bay el Bey's full brother, Mikado, a gray stallion who was a champion park horse.|$|E

Beyoncé could immediately connect to the topic as she had also experienced the same things in the record industry when people advised her about {{the sound of her}} music. For the music of [...] "Ghost", Boots created a beat from [...] a [...] "dreamlike, hypnotic place" [...] working with guitars and building layers inspired by the work of musician Aphex Twin. Boots said, [...] " [...] works like that are more floaty, more without than within, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> mine grounded in that thumping beat, so you can't get out of that feeling." [...] He also elaborated about its concept, [...] "It's like that song is leading you by the hand, but you're blindfolded and you don't know where you're going. You're scared and you're not sure what to expect from it, but as the album unfolds, we take the blindfold off and you realize it's a surprise party for you." ...|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

[...] Van Gogh depicts Adeline, rather than a photographic resemblance, with [...] "impassioned aspects" [...] of contemporary life through the [...] "modern taste for color." [...] Van Gogh wrote to his brother: “Last week I did a portrait of a girl about sixteen, in blue against a blue background, the daughter of the people with whom I am staying.

2500|$|In November 2004, {{an unknown}} entity calling himself [...] "Steev Mike" [...] – a {{pseudonym}} Andrew W.K. had used for himself on {{several of his}} releases – launched a number of websites accusing W.K. of fraud and not being behind his own career. After W.K.'s official website was hacked, apparently by the same entity, W.K. attempted to address the confusion in a public statement in which he wrote, [...] "PLEASE DON'T BELIEVE STEEV MIKE. I USED TO CALL MYSELF STEEV MIKE A LONG TIME AGO AND IT'S NOTHING NOW. Someone is trying to confuse you and make me look bad." [...] In May 2009, W.K. discussed the accusations {{in an interview with}} British magazine Front, in which he stated that [...] "the nature of how we presented my initial offerings caused some confusion, even though I tried to make it as straightforward as possible," [...] and: [...] "Different people I've worked with and different parts of my back story have gotten twisted and changed. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> the music on my albums – I had a lot of help from incredible people, but not the kind of help that some people think."

2500|$|Monty, {{who left}} the series in 1986, {{returned}} in 1991 with the hope she would again raise the ratings of the show. She brought Geary back to General Hospital that same year as Luke's look-alike cousin, Bill Eckert. The actor had refused {{to return to the}} show as Luke without Laura. The unpopularity of the Bill Eckert character led to ABC's firing Monty, killing off Bill, and bringing Luke and Laura back, played by Geary and Francis. Upon their return, the actors took more control of the writing for their characters. Geary, along with a writer friend, Irene Suver, developed the story for Luke and Laura's return. Geary's contract allowed him to rewrite his dialogue at his discretion. Francis and Geary were also known for fighting over story direction with executive producer Wendy Riche and the show's writers. The departure of head writer Richard Culliton days after a tense meeting with Geary caused rumors to circulate that the actor threatened to quit if Culliton were not fired. [...] "The meeting did not go well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> no ultimatums and there was certainly no violence," [...] Geary said. [...] "I really don't know if I {{had anything to do with}} his departure, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I did." [...] Francis supported Geary in what they considered to be standing up for the [...] "integrity" [...] of their characters and protecting the [...] "Spencer franchise." [...] "Sometimes people think we're difficult because of that, but we're only difficult because we want to live up to the high standards we've set," [...] Francis said. [...] "I actually like it when Tony gets out of line... He can go to horrid places I can't." ...|$|E
