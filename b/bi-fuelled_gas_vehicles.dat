40|$|In Europe natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> play a minor role. A {{decisive reason}} for this is the {{dependence}} of most European countries from gas imports. Except for Italy, there is no tradition to use natural gas as fuel. In addition, {{there is a lack of}} infrastructure (e. g. fuelling stations). In contrast to Europe, in Latin American and Asian countries natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> are widespread. Some countries foster natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> because they have own gas resources. Many countries must reduce the high air pollution in big cities. Environmental reasons are the main motive for the use of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> in Europe. In last years, high oil prices stimulated the use of natural gas as fuel. European governments have developed incentives (e. g. tax reductions) to foster natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, the focus is on hybrid technology and the electric car, which, however, need further technical improvement. In contrast, the use of natural gas in conventional engines is technically mature. Additional gas imports can be avoided by further improvements of energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy. In sum, the market penetration of natural gas as fuel should be promoted in Europe. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> Environment CO 2...|$|R

In this report for the U. S. Department of Energy's Clean Cities Program - a public-private partnership that advances the energy, economic, and environmental security of the U.

40|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have the}} {{prospects}} of making substantial contributions to transportation needs. The adoption of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> could lead to impacts on energy and environmental systems. An analysis of the main factors and trends that affect adoption of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as vehicle costs, infrastructure costs, and fuel economics was performed. The fuel cost analysis showed that assuming production and distribution at scale, liquefied natural gas (LNG) can be competitive as a diesel fuel substitute for heavy duty vehicles in the US, and also in EU and China. A methodology of incorporating heavy duty natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic modelling was developed to investigate the potential adoption and impacts. Modelling variables such as vehicle and infrastructure costs were tested and several scenarios were applied to examine the general equilibrium impacts on natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle</b> adoption and the general equilibrium impacts of resulting natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle</b> adoption. Climate policy scenarios were also developed and tested. In the base case scenario, results showed significant adoption of LNG trucks (Class 8) in the US, with 10 % penetration of heavy duty trucks by 2020 and up to 100 % by 2040. In China and the EU, adoption was projected to be slower due to higher natural gas prices. In the US, introduction of LNG trucks resulted in moderately higher natural gas prices, slightly lower oil prices, and a small reduction in total GHG emissions, relative to scenarios without LNG truck availability. The development of natural gas fuelled transportation {{is still in its}} infancy and CGE modelling offers a tool that can be applied to test a wide range of assumptions of cost development and relative prices. by Arthur Hong Chun Yip.

40|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{are being}} {{developed}} because of increasing concerns about energy dependence, air quality and emissions, and, more recently, climate change. The major advantage of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> is their lower fuel cost. Several economic and technical factors such as limited range and availability of relevant infrastructure prevent widespread adoption of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles.</b> A model for the financial analysis {{of the possibility of}} compressed natural <b>gas</b> (CNG) <b>vehicles</b> being competitive with gasoline-powered vehicles is offered. The model evaluates the extent to which commuters find adoption of CNG vehicles to be economically viable in the United States. The results indicate that the percentage of commuters who would adopt CNG vehicles is small, even if fueling infrastructure were fully developed and CNG vehicles were widely available for purchase. A larger number of vehicle miles traveled and increased gasoline prices encourage commuters to adopt CNG vehicles, while higher fuel economy and purchase price differentials result in lower adoption rates. In some cases, which vary in accordance with the values of the model’s parameters, commuters purchase a CNG vehicle as their second car and keep a gasoline-powered car as their first...|$|R

40|$|The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is {{responsible}} for planning, operating, and maintaining a highway network consisting of over 18, 500 lane-miles of highway. In recent years the growing uncertainty about oil prices and availability has made long-range transportation planning even more challenging. Rather than relying on trend extrapolation, this study uses market mechanisms {{to shed light on}} key long-range transportation planning assumptions. In particular, this study was conducted to help WSDOT assess the likelihood that natural gas will substitute for petroleum fuels and estimate the impacts that changes in fuel prices will have on natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle</b> demand, fuel consumption, and Greenhouse Gas emissions. The main findings of this project were that there is an unstable price difference per unit of energy between natural gas and oil. This price difference accounts for the relative attractiveness of natural gas as a transportation fuel. Furthermore, an international market for natural gas is emerging due to the international trade in liquefied natural gas. Despite these potential benefits the market has created for the use of natural gas as transportation fuel, our model still predicts that consumers will not adopt natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Due to the low adoption of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles,</b> pollution abatement policies designed around increasing adoption of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles</b> is likely to be very expensive...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{environmental}} pollution and energy crisis {{have become more}} and more serious with the rapid increase in automobile quantity. Therefore, research activities related to alternative energy automobiles are progressing in most countries. The NGV (natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicle)</b> is widely used all over the world as it emits less CO_ 2 (carbon dioxide), NO_X (nitrogen oxide), and PM (particulate matter). Furthermore, it is cheap and reduces human dependence on oil. The global natural gas reserve is about 179 trillion cubic meters, according to the statistical data of 2004. The reserve is predicted to last about 67 years longer than oil, and new gas fields are discovered each year. Those countries which are rich in natural gas and the neighbors of such countries have a large number of natural <b>gas</b> <b>vehicles.</b> When thinking about how to utilize natural gas, geoeconomics should be taken into consideration. For example, according to Hirase (2011), it is more efficient to consume natural gas in countries which produce it, or in neighboring countries connected with a pipeline. This {{is one of the reasons}} for the rapid development of NGV gas producing countries. It is estimated that the production of natural gas will increase rapidly in Sichuan, a province of China． Kanbara (2002) says that natural gas should be used as a main fuel for cars in Sichuan.
