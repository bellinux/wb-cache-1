Eight INL four-cycle diesel-engine buses used to transport INL employees on various routes and six INL Chevrolet Tahoes with gasoline engines are equipped with oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> systems from the puraDYN Corporation. This quarter, three additional buses were equipped with bypass filters from Refined Global Solutions. Oil bypass filters are reported to have an engine oil filtering capability of less than 1 micron. Both the puraDYN and Refined Global Solutions bypass filters have a heating chamber to remove liquid contaminate from the oil. During the quarter, the eleven diesel engine buses traveled 62, 188 miles, and as of January 3, 2005 the buses had accumulated 643, 036 total test miles. Two buses had their engine oil changed this quarter. In one bus, the oil was changed due to its degraded quality as determined by a low total base number (30. 0 Abs/cm). Although {{a total of six}} buses have had their oil changed during the last 26 months, by using the oil bypass filters the buses in the evaluation avoided 48 oil changes, which equates to 1, 680 quarts (420 gallons) of new oil not consumed and 1, 680 quarts of waste oil not generated. Therefore, over 80 % of the oil normally required for oil-changes was not used, and, consequently, the evaluation achieved over 80 % reduction in the amount of waste oil normally generated. The six Tahoe test vehicles traveled 39, 514 miles, and as of January 3, 2005 the Tahoes had accumulated 189, 970 total test miles. The Tahoe filter test is in transition.

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{obfuscation}} has been used more and more by spammers to make spam emails <b>bypass</b> <b>filters.</b> The standard method is to use images that look like text, since typical spam filters are unable to parse such messages; {{this is what is}} used in so-called “rock phishing”. To fight imagebased spam, many spam filters use heuristic rules in which emails containing images are flagged, and since not many legit emails are composed mainly of a big image, this aids in detecting image-based spam. The spammers are thus interested in circumventing these methods. Unicode transliteration is a convenient tool for spammers, since it allows a spammer to create a large number of homomorphic clones of the same looking message; since Unicode contains many characters that are unique but appear very similar, spammers can translate a message’s characters at random to hide black-listed words in an effort to <b>bypass</b> <b>filters.</b> In order to defend against these unicode-obfuscated spam emails, we developed a prototype tool that can be used with SpamAssassin to block spam obfuscated in this way by mapping polymorphic messages to a common, more homogeneous representation. This representation can then be filtered using traditional methods. We demonstrate the ease with which Unicode polymorphism can be used to circumvent spam filters such as SpamAssassin, and then describe a de-obfuscation technique {{that can be used to}} catch messages that have been obfuscated in this fashion...|$|R

Eleven INL fourcycle diesel-engine buses and six INL Chevrolet Tahoes with gasoline engines are equipped with oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> systems. Eight of the buses and the six Tahoes are equipped with oil bypass filters from the puraDYN Corporation; the remaining three buses are equipped with oil bypass filters from Refined Global Solutions. Both the puraDYN and Refined Global Solutions bypass filters have a heating chamber to remove liquid contaminates from the oil. During the January to March 2005 reporting quarter, the eleven diesel engine buses traveled 97, 943 miles. As of March 31, 2005, the buses had accumulated 744, 059 total test miles. During this quarter, four regularly scheduled 12, 000 -mile bus servicings were performed. The full-flow and bypass oil filters were changed and oil analysis samples were taken for the four buses. Bus 73446 had its oil changed due to a low total base number value. Bus 73450 had a major engine failure {{at the beginning of}} the quarter when one of its pushrods and valves were damaged. Buses 73432 and 73433 were removed from the <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> evaluation project and placed into the INL Diesel Engine Idling Wear-Rate Evaluation Test. While a total of nine oil changes on the INL buses occurred during the past 29 months, 53 oil changes have been avoided by using the oil bypass filters. The 53 avoided oil changes equates to 1, 855 quarts (464 gallons) of new oil not consumed and 1, 855 quarts of waste oil not generated. Therefore, over 85 % of the oil normally required for oil-changes was not used, and, consequently, the evaluation achieved a greater than 85 % reduction in the amount of waste oil normally generated by the buses.

As {{of the end of}} June 2004, the eight buses have accumulated 498, 814 miles {{since the beginning of the}} test and 473, 192 miles without an oil change. This represents an avoidance of 39 oil changes, which equates to 1, 374 quarts (343 gallons) of new oil not consumed and, furthermore, 1, 374 quarts of waste oil not generated. One bus had its oil changed due to the degraded quality of the engine oil. Also this quarter, the six Tahoe test vehicles traveled 48, 193 miles; to date, the six Tahoes have accumulated 109, 708 total test miles. The oil for all six of the Tahoes was changed this quarter due to low Total Base Numbers (TBN). The oil used initially in the Tahoe testing was recycled oil; the recycled oil has been replaced with Castrol virgin oil, and the testing was restarted. However, the six Tahoe’s did travel a total of 98, 266 miles on the initial engine oil. This represents an avoidance of 26 oil changes, which equates to 130 quarts (32. 5 gallons) of new oil not consumed and, consequently, 130 quarts of waste oil not generated. Based on the number of oil changes avoided by the test buses and Tahoes to date, the potential engine oil savings if an oil <b>bypass</b> <b>filter</b> system were used was estimated for the INEEL, DOE complex and all Federal fleets of on-road vehicles.

During this quarter, seven regularly scheduled 12, 000 -mile bus service events were performed. Bus 73449 had its oil accidentally changed on 5 / 17 / 05 during servicing. Two buses had mechanical problems which required the oil to be changed: Bus 73446 had an injector failure and Bus 73413 had a broken “dip stick” fitting on the oil pan, both of which introduced contaminants.
