25|$|Transgender people {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression and their assigned sex. Transgender {{is also an}} umbrella term because, in addition to including trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (and who are sometimes specifically termed transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition), it may include genderqueer people (whose identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine, but may, for example, be <b>bigender,</b> pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions include third-gender people as transgender or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender, and infrequently the term is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
500|$|The gender {{identity}} [...] "transgender" [...] has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) {{has been used}} to describe trans men and trans women, while trans* covers all non-cisgender (genderqueer) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, <b>bigender,</b> and trans man and trans woman. Likewise, the term transsexual commonly falls under the umbrella term transgender, but some transsexual people object to this.|$|E
2500|$|Nonbinary individuals, {{or those}} who {{identify}} outside of the male/female gender binary and use labels such as genderqueer, agender, <b>bigender,</b> and genderfluid, perform gender in a unique way. In their rejection of a strictly gendered societal and linguistic binary system, nonbinary folks {{have the freedom to}} choose or adopt a wider variety of linguistic styles, speech patterns, and vocabulary. The very nature of nonbinary identities in modern binary society forces individuals and communities to create vocabulary and redesign language to fit their understanding of gender, especially in English and Romance languages. Neopronouns, pronouns which avoid indexing gender and/or index a nonbinary gender identity, originated in the late 1800s as [...] "thon" [...] and [...] "e" [...] to refer to people without defining gender. Newer pronouns include [...] "ee," [...] "em," [...] "xe," [...] and [...] "ve." [...] Communities, especially online ones, create words to fill non-gendered spaces in the lexicon: [...] "nibling" [...] as a gender-neutral term for niece or nephew, or [...] "datefriend" [...] to replace [...] "boyfriend" [...] and [...] "girlfriend." ...|$|E
50|$|Some Star Trek plots {{introduce}} {{species that}} have sex, gender, or sexual identities {{outside of the}} gender binary and cisnormativity associated with humans. Agendered, monogendered, <b>bigendered,</b> trigendered, and pangendered species, each with unique or uncommon sexual reproductive methods, have been portrayed as having distinctly non-human assignment of reproductive responsibilities.|$|R
25|$|Characters {{have also}} been spoofed in the {{successful}} BBC comedy sketch show, The Real McCoy (1991–1995). EastEnders and its characters were frequently spoofed in the impressionist sketch show Big Impression, starring Alistair McGowan and Ronni Ancona. Big Impression once screened a one-off special, focusing on EastEnders, called Alistair McGowan's <b>BigEnders.</b> The cartoon sketch show 2DTV has also spoofed EastEnders on many occasions.|$|R
40|$|In Sula, Song of Solomon, Tar Baby, Beloved, and Paradise, Toni Morrison creates {{characters}} who cannot be neatly categorized as exclusively male or female. These "psychologically intersexed" characters claim their own agency to demolish male/female, homosexual/heterosexual, White/Black binaries. Morrison's open-ended examination of gender roles leads her readers {{to see the}} "intersectional" forces behind our gender assumptions. Thus, by disrupting white heterosexual patriarchy, Morrison succeeds in her stated quest to "open a wider landscape" in American literature, allowing these <b>bigendered</b> characters the freedom to search for new identities and giving them a new language that more accurately reflects the authentic individuals they are striving to become...|$|R
50|$|There is {{also some}} {{controversy}} {{regarding the use}} of a <b>bigender</b> voice. A person may want to have both a masculine and a feminine voice in their vocal repertoire, possibly to fit with their own <b>bigender</b> identity, or to read as a different gender in different contexts. Many clinicians will not train <b>bigender</b> voice, arguing that it decreases the opportunity for practice, and it may be difficult or even damaging to the vocal folds for the person to switch from one voice to another. However, Davies, Papp and Antoni (2015) reference the ability of actors to use different accents and dialects, and people to learn different languages as a sign that training a <b>bigender</b> voice may be a viable treatment goal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bigender,</b> bi-gender or dual {{gender is}} a gender {{identity}} that includes any two gender identities and behaviors, possibly depending on context. Some <b>bigender</b> individuals express two distinct [...] "female" [...] and [...] "male" [...] personas, feminine and masculine respectively; others {{find that they}} identify as two genders simultaneously. It is recognized by the American Psychological Association (APA) as {{a subset of the}} transgender group. A 1999 survey conducted by the San Francisco Department of Public Health observed that, among the transgender community, less than 3% of those who were assigned male at birth and less than 8% of those who were assigned female at birth identified as <b>bigender.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} largely {{shows that}} bisexuals are {{at greater risk}} for poor mental health compared to heterosexual, gay, and lesbian people. This increased risk has been linked to the 2 ̆ 7 double 2 ̆ 7 discrimination (e. g. biphobia) that bisexuals face from both the heterosexual and gay communities. This study used previously collected data (n= 405) {{to examine the relationship between}} biphobia from these sources and two mental health outcomes: anxiety and posttraumatic stress (PTSD) symptoms. Community identification and involvement, positive bisexual identity, and volunteerism/advocacy/activism were tested as moderators. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the measure used for PTSD symptoms (PCL-C) did not perform well in this sample. Structural equation modelling revealed that biphobia had little impact on anxiety. Volunteerism appeared to be the only significant moderator for people with gender identities other than <b>bigendered</b> with volunteerism related to more anxiety and non-volunteerism associated with less anxiety. More research is needed to clarify these relationships...|$|R
50|$|Genderqueer or non-binary identities, {{which are}} not {{exclusively}} masculine or feminine but instead are agender, androgynous, <b>bigender,</b> pangender, or genderfluid, exist outside of cisnormativity. <b>Bigender</b> and androgynous are overlapping categories; <b>bigender</b> individuals may identify as moving {{between male and female}} roles (genderfluid) or as being both male and female simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly identify as beyond gender or genderless (postgender, agender), between genders (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously exhibiting multiple genders (pangender). Limited forms of androgyny are common (women wearing pants, men wearing earrings) and are not seen as transgender behavior. Androgyne is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex person. Genderqueer identities are independent of sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and Laura K. Case {{studied a}} subset of <b>bigender</b> people who have reported that switches in gender are typically involuntary and occur when the individual would rather remain in the other gender. They named this condition alternating gender incongruity (AGI). There {{is no indication that}} AGI is a common type of bigenderism, and the study did not attempt to study the broader group of <b>bigender</b> people who do not have AGI.|$|E

5000|$|Trans* is an {{umbrella}} term which covers the gender identity spectrum: including (but not limited to) transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit and <b>bigender</b> ...|$|E
50|$|A <b>bigender</b> gender-identity {{has been}} {{described}} as varying over time between two extremes. These periods can be anywhere from a few hours to a few years and there is no limit to the number of times that it may change. A student at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, described the back and forth shift, sayingIdentifying as <b>bigender</b> is typically understood to mean that one identifies as both male and female or moves between a masculine gender expression and feminine gender expression with little middle ground, or both. This is different from identifying as genderfluid, as those who identify as genderfluid may not go back and forth between any fixed gender identities and may experience an entire range or spectrum of identities over time.|$|E
50|$|The pansexual pride flag {{has been}} found on various Internet sites since mid-2010. It has three {{horizontal}} bars that are pink, yellow and blue. The pink band symbolizes women; the blue, men; and the yellow, those of a non-binary gender, such as agender, <b>bigender</b> or genderfluid.|$|E
50|$|Soon afterward, Serano {{moved to}} the San Francisco Bay Area where she met her wife, Dani, in 1998. Around this time, Serano began {{identifying}} as not only a crossdresser but also as transgender and <b>bigender.</b> In 2001, she began medically transitioning and identifying as a trans woman.|$|E
5000|$|Trigenderism is {{considered}} rare; presently, {{there is no}} cohesive community in which trigender individuals can share information, nor {{has there been a}} perceived need to study or address specific issues associated with trigenderism. For the most part, trigender people find their accommodations and needs the same as <b>bigender</b> people. As transgender children have started to get more media attention in the 1990s and 2000s, studies have tried to further understand transgender issues. Some university LGBTQ groups and alliances are increasingly finding their communities more gender fluid as well and less oriented towards traditional labels such as [...] "gay", [...] "bisexual", and [...] "straight". The American Psychological Association and the University of California, San Franscisco both recognize <b>bigender</b> as a subset of the transgender community. In the UK, [...] "polygender" [...] is a common term found on transgender websites, forums, and support groups, {{as well as at the}} Scottish Transgender Alliance.|$|E
5000|$|Pangender is a non-binary gender {{defined as}} being more than one gender. A {{pangender}} person may consider themselves a member of all genders. The prefix pan is Greek and means [...] "all." [...] Pangender {{is a kind of}} third gender, much like <b>bigender,</b> trigender, or genderqueer. Pangender individuals may identify with gender inclusive or gender neutral pronouns instead of gendered ones (such as she/he or her/him).|$|E
5000|$|The gender {{identity}} [...] "transgender" [...] has been recategorized to trans* by some groups, where trans (without the asterisk) {{has been used}} to describe trans men and trans women, while trans* covers all non-cisgender (genderqueer) identities, including transgender, transsexual, transvestite, genderqueer, genderfluid, non-binary, genderfuck, genderless, agender, non-gendered, third gender, two-spirit, <b>bigender,</b> and trans man and trans woman. Likewise, the term transsexual commonly falls under the umbrella term transgender, but some transsexual people object to this.|$|E
5000|$|Rebecca Sugar, {{the creator}} of Steven Universe, {{referred}} to an inquiry on Stevonnie's gender—whether Stevonnie is agender, <b>bigender,</b> or something else—by stating that [...] "Stevonnie is an experience! The living relationship between Steven and Connie." [...] Sugar described Stevonnie as a complex and specific metaphor, that becomes relatable as it takes shape {{in the form of}} a unique character. Besides challenging gender norms, Stevonnie serves as a metaphor for [...] "terrifying firsts in a first relationship," [...] the feeling of hitting puberty, and objectification.|$|E
50|$|Androgynous (also androgyne) is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} descriptive term for people in this category. However, not all persons identify as androgynous. Genderqueer people may identify as either having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; having two or more genders (being <b>bigender,</b> trigender, or pangender); having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); or being third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes {{those who do not}} place a name to their gender.|$|E
5000|$|Gender is {{somewhat}} difficult to measure, {{leading to the}} common belief that sex and gender are the same. Research by Diamond, Milton and Dick Swaab, shows that patterns in gender behavior, thoughts, and feelings can be identified in the brain. Trigender individuals, much like <b>bigender</b> individuals, often {{feel the need to}} [...] "present" [...] themselves as the gender they feel like at the given time. Some days, they may present themselves as members of their birth-assigned sex by wearing clothing associated with that gender, and on others will attempt to pass as a cisgender member of the opposite sex, either to reduce gender dysphoria or simply to be perceived socially as the opposite sex. Sometimes, they will express themselves androgynously to avoid having to deal with complications of living as more than one gender. Some gender bend by consistently expressing more than one gender at a time. <b>Bigender</b> and trigender people must undergo the process of learning to live as female and male culturally if they choose to express other genders. The May 2010 issue of Scientific American Mind focused entirely on the social and biological constructs of gender expression and included a small, four-page article on how studying transsexuals can bring greater insight into this field of study. The learning process of male and female cultural roles includes learning how to walk, talk, interact verbally and non-verbally, think, and behave.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012, Case and Ramachandran {{reported}} {{the results of}} a survey of an atypical subset of <b>bigender</b> individuals who experience involuntary alternation between male and female states. Case and Ramachandran hypothesized that gender alternation may reflect an unusual degree (or depth) of hemispheric switching, and the corresponding suppression of sex appropriate body maps in the parietal cortex. They stated that [...] "we hypothesize that tracking the nasal cycle, rate of binocular rivalry, and other markers of hemispheric switching will reveal a physiological basis for AGI individuals' subjective reports of gender switches...We base our hypotheses on ancient and modern associations between the left and right hemispheres and the male and female genders." ...|$|E
5000|$|Throughout much of {{the twentieth}} century, the term [...] "third sex" [...] was a common {{descriptor}} for homosexuals and gender nonconformists, but after the gay liberation movements of the 1970s and a growing separation of the concepts of sexual orientation and gender identity, the term fell out of favor among LGBT communities and the wider public. With the renewed exploration of gender that feminism, the modern transgender movement and queer theory has fostered, some in the contemporary West have begun to describe themselves as a third sex again. Other modern identities that cover similar ground include pangender, <b>bigender,</b> genderqueer, androgyne, intergender, [...] "other gender" [...] and [...] "differently gendered".|$|E
50|$|The term trans man {{is used as}} a {{short form}} for either {{identity}} (transsexual man and transgender man). This commonly referred to as female-to-male (FTM or F2M). Trans men may identify as transsexual, as transgender, neither, or both. Transgender man is an umbrella term that may include anybody who was assigned female at birth (AFAB), but identifies as male. For instance, some androgynous, <b>bigender,</b> and genderqueer people might identify as transgender. Because transgender is an umbrella term, it can be imprecise and does not always describe specific identities and experiences. Transmasculine is a general, broader term for individuals who were AFAB but identify closer to the masculine (or male) side of the gender spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Transgender {{people are}} people who {{experience}} a mismatch between their gender identity or gender expression, and their assigned sex. Transgender people are sometimes called transsexual if they desire medical assistance to transition from one sex to another. Transgender is also an umbrella term: in addition to including people whose gender identity {{is the opposite of}} their assigned sex (trans men and trans women), it may include people who are not exclusively masculine or feminine (people who are genderqueer (also known as non-binary, e.g. <b>bigender,</b> pangender, genderfluid, or agender). Other definitions of transgender also include people who belong to a third gender, or conceptualize transgender people as a third gender. Infrequently, the term transgender is defined very broadly to include cross-dressers.|$|E
5000|$|According to Case and Ramachandran, these {{findings}} suggest that there is a biological basis of AGI bigenderism and hypothesized that it may correspond to an unusual degree of hemispheric switching, or when dominance switches from one hemisphere to the other during a single behavior, and callosal suppression of sex-appropriate body maps in the parietal cortex and its reciprocal connections with the insula and hypothalamus. They propose that [...] "coordination between shifts in brain connectivity, autonomic response, hormone release, and dynamic representation of body gender might together create the sense of gender alternation experiencing by many <b>bigender</b> individuals." [...] These researchers also disagree with the separation between neurological and psychological conditions and instead predict that alternating gender incongruity is a neuropsychiatric condition, but {{more research is needed to}} confirm this.|$|E
5000|$|In some situations, an {{individual}} may be known but referred {{to using the}} pronoun they. This may occur because the individual's gender is unknown to the speaker, or because the gender is non-binary or genderqueer, so that they regard both masculine and feminine pronouns as inappropriate and thus prefer {{to be referred to}} as they. Several social media applications permit account holders to choose to identify their gender using one of a variety of non-binary or genderqueer options, such as gender fluid, agender, or <b>bigender,</b> and to designate a pronoun, including they/them, which they wish to be used when referring to them. Though [...] "singular they" [...] has long been used with antecedents like everybody or generic persons of unknown gender, this use, which may be chosen by {{an individual}}, is recent.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to trans men and trans women whose binary gender identity {{is the opposite}} of their assigned sex, and who form the core of the transgender umbrella, being included in even the narrowest definitions of it, several other groups are included in broader definitions of the term. These include people whose gender identities are not exclusively masculine or feminine but may, for example, be androgynous, <b>bigender,</b> pangender, or agender—often grouped under the alternative umbrella term genderqueer—and third-gender people (alternatively, some references and some societies conceptualize transgender people as a third gender). Although some references define transgender very broadly to include transvestites / cross-dressers, they are usually excluded, as are transvestic fetishists (because they are considered to be expressing a paraphilia rather than a gender identification) and drag kings and drag queens (who are performers and cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining).|$|E
5000|$|While people self-identify as {{transgender}}, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include transsexual; transvestite or cross-dresser; genderqueer; androgyne; and <b>bigender.</b> Usually {{not included}} are transvestic fetishists (because {{it is considered}} to be a paraphilia rather than gender identification), and drag kings and drag queens, who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen RuPaul talked about society's ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. [...] "A friend of mine recently did the Oprah show about transgender youth", said RuPaul. [...] "It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the American baseball league and the National baseball league, when they are both so similar." ...|$|E
50|$|Thinking {{of woman}} {{as a series}} solves these {{conceptual}} problems. It allows one to meaningfully use the category while avoiding the mistake of falsely essentializing women as a group. An essentialist approach attempts to define woman by common biological characteristics - evidently false when one considers, for instance, transgender, <b>bigender</b> or intersex people, for instance - or by finding commonality in the vast diversity of women's actual lives, clearly not a viable enterprise.A serial conception of woman also disconnects the idea of gender from an individual's personal identity, as it defines gender as a pre-existing set of societal forces that are visited upon each individual; this approach does not make any claims about the way individuals respond to these pressures. Indeed, the conception of gender as seriality derives its strength from precisely {{the fact that it}} does not attempt a comprehensive definition of the individual, but acknowledges that individuals exist within structures that constrain and channel their actions in particular ways.|$|E
5000|$|Many confuse {{bisexuality}} and pansexuality, {{especially when}} it comes to differentiating the flags. Each flag has three horizontal bars and they each hold three different colors. The pansexual flag consists of three colored horizontal bars: pink, yellow, and blue. [...] The blue portion of the flag represents those who identify within the male spectrum (regardless of biological sex), the pink represents those who identify within the female spectrum (regardless of biological sex), and the yellow portion, found in between the blue and pink portions, represents non-binary attraction; such as androgynous, agender, <b>bigender</b> and genderfluid people. The Bisexual Pride Flag also consists of three colored horizontal bars: pink, purple, and blue. [...] The pink portion of the flag represents sexual attraction to the same sex (gay and lesbian), the blue portion of the flag represents sexual attraction to the opposite sex (straight), and the overlapping purple portion of the flag represents sexual attraction to both sexes (bi).|$|E
