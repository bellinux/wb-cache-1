40|$|Barneys Canyon is a sediment-hosted, disseminated {{gold deposit}} located 7 km from the large, gold-rich, Bingham {{porphyry}} copper deposit. Host rocks for gold mineralization are the Permian Park City dolomite and siltstone and the Kirkman-Diamond Creek sandstone. The gold deposit is approximately 430 m long, 370 m wide, up to 90 m thick and contains 8. 5 {{million metric tons}} (t) of reserves averaging 1. 6 g/t gold. Intrusive igneous rocks are conspicuously absent. The gold deposit s located on the northern flank of the northeast-trending Copperton anticline, an overturned <b>box</b> <b>fold.</b> A small east-striking, south-dipping thrust fault, the Barneys Canyon thrust fault, with 200 m displacement, repeats the Park City Formation, and north-south-striking steep normal faults form a graben in which the gold deposit s located. The Barneys Canyon thrust fault predates mineralization a d the Phosphate normal fault postdates mineralization. Alteration of the host rocks is similar to other sediment-hosted, disseminated gold deposits but at lower alteration mineral abundances. Kaolinitc and illitc comprise l ss than 10 percent of the altered rock. Silicifica-tion is minor, barite is rare, and pyrite and marcasite are common, but not abundant. Trace As, Sb, Hg, T 1, and Ba shmv pronounced increase. K/At age determinations onvein illitc from ore grade (1. 5 ppm gold) bedding-plane gougelike material yield Jurassic ages. Fluid inclusion measurements from barite and jasperold show a mean salinity of 1. 7 wt percent NaC 1 equiv and homogenization temperatures of 130 ø to 393 øC with weak modes at 350 and 230 øC, suggesting that two fluids have interacted with rocks at Barneys Canyon. Kaolinitc-bearing assemblages formed below 280 øC. Pressure correction at hydrostatic pressure is 12 øC.

40|$|Four main Late Cretaceous and Tertiary {{phases of}} crustal {{shortening}} and thrust-related deformation are {{recognised in the}} northern Oman Mountains, each phase ending with a regional unconformity throughout the Oman Mountains and the UAE foreland. The earliest is the major thrust emplacement of the Semail Ophiolite, and underlying Haybi, Hawasina and Sumeini duplexes from NE to SW onto the depressed northeastern continental margin of the Arabian Plate during the Cenomanian to Campanian-early Maastrichtian (D 1). A prominent widespread unconformity that places Maastrichtian Qahlah Formation laterite, sandstones and conglomerates and Simsima Formation rudist - Acteonellid gastropod limestones over all underlying allochthonous units is recognised throughout the Oman Mountains. SW-verging folds and thrusts in Triassic to Cretaceous carbonate slope facies rocks exposed in Jabal Sumeini (Sumeini Group and Harnrat Duru Group) have been emplaced over uppermost Cretaceous Juweiza Formation conglomerates {{at the highest level}} of the Aruma. foreland basin. These Sumeini D 1 structures are abruptly truncated by an unconformity, above which are Middle Maastrichtian beds showing up to 95 % 'death assemblage' rudists and gastropods just below the Cretaceous - Tertiary boundary (top of Simsima Formation). A second deformation event (D 2) affected the Simsima Formation and underlying Sumeini Group, Hamrat Duru complex and Semail Ophiolite rocks. This phase shows gentle folding about NW-SE fold axes (e. g. Jabal Rawdah), along a similar trend to the Late Cretaceous D 1 event. This trend is also parallel to a regional set of NW-SE aligned fractures in the UAE foreland. A major angular unconformity occurs beneath the Upper Palaeocene - Eocene shallow-marine limestones (Umm Er Radhuma, Rus and Dammam formations). Many foreland jabals in eastern Abu Dhabi (Jabals Qatar, Malaqet, Mundasa) show gentle post-Eocene folding formed during the third stage of crustal shortening (D 3). The large perichne of Jabal Hafit is a double-plunging, east-verging <b>box</b> <b>fold</b> that formed after deposition of the Oligocene Asmari Formation limestones and Miocene Fars Formation gypsum and clays, the youngest beds affected by the fold.

40|$|The lower Pliocene Andromeda Mound Complex, {{located in}} the eastern Mediterranean Levant Basin, {{comprises}} an unusual series of mounded, deepwater sand deposits that developed on the sea floor due to syndepositional structural growth. Analysis is based on 98 2 D seismic lines, a 2886 km 2 3 D seismic volume, and 1 well log suite penetrating the Andromeda Mound Complex. The Andromeda Mound Complex is composed of fifteen individual or small groups of mounds (A-O) that are confined to the Yafo Sand Member. The fifteen large, mounds are separated into three distinct groups, based on both their internal and external seismic facies. Group 1 mounds (A-H) are structurally the simplest and most easily interpreted. Thickening of the Yafo Sand Member is typically {{the result of a}} single thrust fault or <b>box</b> <b>fold.</b> The mounds of Group 2 (I and J) are larger and more structurally complex than those in Group 1. They are more extensively faulted and also contain growth-related sediments. Group 3 mounds (K-O) are the most difficult to interpret. The internal reflections of those mounds have low continuity and extremely low to high amplitude, in part due to extensive deformation. No definitive internal structural or stratigraphic interpretation was possible for the Group 3 mounds. Several important factors contributed to the formation of the unique Andromeda Mound Complex. These factors include: (a) formation of pre-Messinian pockmarks on the sea-floor; (b) initial deposition of Messinian Evaporites that originally extended farther updip than present-day distribution; (c) deposition of the turbidite sands of the Yafo Sand Member on a low gradient slope overlying the top Messinian Evaporites; (d) uplift during the early Pliocene of the underlying Syrian Arc folds, which created conduits for the vertical migration of undersaturated, low-salinity fluids into the Messinian Evaporites; (e) variable amounts of Messinian Evaporite dissolution within the study area; (f) mass-movement of individual blocks of the Yafo Sand Member along the basal detachment surface into collapse features associated with Messinian Evaporite dissolution; and (g) Messinian Evaporite dissolution resulting {{in the creation of the}} mounded portions of the Yafo Sand Member and overlying sediments...|$|E

40|$|Caractérisation d'une limite hydrogéologique entre deux aquifères contigus au moyen de données géologiques, géochimiques et hydrodynamiques (Aix-les-Bains, France). Cette étude permet au moyen de divers outils (géologie, géochimie, hydrodynamisme) de délimiter deux aquifères contigus: celui des eaux minérales de Raphy Saint Simon (RSS) et celui des eaux thermales des Thermes nationaux d'Aix-les-Bains (TN) et de discuter les {{relations}} entre ces deux aquifères. La réinterprétation des profils de sismique ré flexion et la cartographie géologique ont permis de différencier deux grands types de structure anticlinales: i/ au nord, l'anticlinal possède une structure d'amplitude plus faible et un flanc oriental recoupé par deux failles de rétrochevauchement; ii/ au sud, l'anticlinal est plus large et une écaille tectonique est coincée dans la rampe de chevauchement. La continuité des structures étant impossible entre ces deux compartiments sur une aussi courte distance conduit à positionner un accident d'orientation N 065 oE, la faille de Raphy Saint Simon, entre la terminaison périclinale de la Chambotte et la colline de Tresserve. La signature géochimique (ions majeurs et isotopes) des forages profonds est différente bien qu'ils captent leur eau dans un même horizon géologique carbonaté. En effet, le forage RS 4 présente des concentrations en sulfates supérieures à celles du forage RS 5 (100 mg. L- 1 contre 20 mg. L- 1). La signature isotopique en 34 S des eaux du forage RS 4 (+ 18, 9 ‰ vs CDT) est proche de celles des eaux thermales (+ 31, 5 ‰ vs CDT) tan dis que celle du forage RS 5 (+ 8, 9 ‰ vs CDT) est plus proche de celles des pyrites (- 0, 8 ‰ vs CDT). Cette différence de chimisme impose donc que ces deux forages se situent dans deux compartiments géologiques différents séparés par la faille de Raphy Saint Simon. D'un point de vue hydrodynamique, la présence de cette faille {{permet de}} maintenir une différence de niveaux plus basse de 30 mètres dans le compartiment nord que dans le compartiment sud. Néanmoins, cette faille permet les transferts de pression puisque les variations de débit d'exploitation sont observables d'un compartiment à l'autre. Enfin, des phénomènes propres aux émergences minérales (RSS) permettent de confirmer la présence de deux aquifères à fonctionnement distinct: en profondeur (500 m) le forage RS 5 (bloc nord) enregistre des chutes de niveaux lors d'événements pluvieux tandis que RS 4 (bloc sud) n'en présente pas. En outre, le puits de Raphy Saint Simon (RSSW) (bloc nord) possède une cyclicité en phase avec la pression atmosphérique alors que les émergences thermales des TN (Bloc sud) n'en présentent pas. International audienceAix-les-Bains has three in stallations that use deep water : the Marlioz and Thermes Nationaux spas, to the south, and the Raphy Saint Simon (RSS) mineral water plant, to the north. The spas draw their water exclusively from deep boreholes, whereas the RSS bottling plant has a natural spring (RSS well) and two bore holes (RS 4 and RS 5), {{both of which}} are more than 500 m deep. Al though the spas and mineral water plant are only a few kilometers apart and they catch their waters in the same calcareous layers, their waters have distinct physico-chemical characteristics, suggesting that they are derived from two different but adjoining aquifers. The present study used geological, geochemical and hydrodynamic data {{in order to determine the}} boundary between the thermal water and mineral water aquifers, and to investigate the relation ship between them. Geological mapping and a reinterpretation of seismic profiles produced in the 1970 s for oil exploration were used to investigate the structure of the area between Aix-les-Bains and La Chambotte (8 km north of Aix). This relatively small area was found to contain two very different types of anticlinal structure: a fault-bounded anticline to the north and a <b>box</b> <b>fold</b> to the south. Dip measurements for both anticlines revealed sub-vertical western flanks, less steeply dipping eastern flanks and sub-horizontal central sections. The central section of the northern anticline is much narrower than the central section of the southern anticline. Both anticlines have been thrust over their adjoining synclines; however, the thrust plane is much steeper in the north than it is in the south. As a result, equivalent strata are at a higher altitude to the north of Aix-les-Bains than they are to the south of the city. In addition, the eastern flank of the northern anticline is intersected by two backthrust faults and the southern anticline is affected by a peel thrust. Given the extremely rapid transition from one anticlinal form to another, these two structures cannot be contiguous; however, their juxtaposition can be explained by the presence of a fault oriented N 065 oE. This fault is not visible at outcrop but it must lie between the end of the La Chambotte anticline and the hill at Tresserve. It has been named the Raphy Saint Simon Fault (RSSF). Water samples from wells and springs within a 300 m radius of the RSS well field had identical or similar major ion concentrations to the mineral waters; never the less, two distinct chemical facies were recognized on the basis of differences in magnesium and sulfate concentrations. For example, the sulfate concentrations of water samples from RS 5 and the RSS well were five times lower than those of RS 4 (20 mg. L- 1 vs. 100 mg. L- 1). Differences were also found in the sulfur isotope signatures of samples from the two boreholes, even though both boreholes abstract their waters in the Upper Kimmeridgian limestone. The sulfur isotope signature of RS 5 (8. 9 ‰ vs. CDT) is closer to that of pyrite (- 0. 8 ‰ vs. CDT), whereas the signature of RS 4 (18. 9 ‰ vs. CDT) is closer to that of the thermal water (31. 5 ‰ vs. CDT). These differences in sulfur isotope and major ion concentrations show that the recharge waters for the two boreholes have different sources and that the boreholes must therefore be in different geological blocks separated by the RSSF. Monitoring of the dynamic water levels in the boreholes and the flow rate of the RSS well allowed us to determine the hydrogeological and geological limits. Variations in the water yields of the boreholes in one block were observable in the adjoining block. Although the fault allows the transfer of pressure between the two blocks, it also leads to the water level in the northern block being 30 meters lower than the water level in the southern block. Some phenomena were only observed in the northern, mineral-water block. For example, during rain fall events water levels were seen to drop suddenly in RS 5 but not in RS 4. In addition, we observed cyclical variations in the flow rate of the RSS well, as well as variations related to atmospheric pressure. These phenomena were not observed at the natural thermal water outlets in the southern block. Geological, geochemical and hydrody namic data all indicate the existence of a N 065 oE-trending fault near the RSS well field. This fault marks the boundary between the mineral water aquifer to the north and the thermal water aquifer to the south. It maintains a difference in the water levels of the two aquifers, but allows the transfer of pressure between them...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for studying folding problems from a motion planning perspective. In particular, all folding objects are modeled as tree-like multilink articulated `robots', where fold positions correspond to joints and areas that cannot fold correspond to links. This formulation allows us to apply recent techniques developed in the robotics motion planning community for articulated objects with many degrees of freedom (many links) to folding problems. An important benefit {{of this approach is}} that it not only allows us to study foldability questions, such as, can one object be folded (or unfolded) into another object, but also enables us to study the dynamic folding process itself. The framework proposed here has application in traditional motion planning areas such as automation, teaching through demonstration, animation, and most importantly, presents a different approach to the most profound problem in computational biology: protein struction prediction. Indeed, our preliminary experimental results with traditional paper crafts (e. g., <b>box</b> <b>folding)</b> and a relatively small protein are quite promising...|$|R

Almost all the hilly areas in Denmark were created or affected by glaciotectonic deformations, and the features are included in the mapping of surface near deposits. For the mapping and support of constructing 3 D geological models a classification of architecture of glaciotectonic complexes is suggested. The important elements for classification of architecture are the surfaces. Four orders of surfaces are defined for glaciotectonic complexes: first-order surfaces are décollement surfaces and glaciotectonic unconformities; second-order surfaces are ramps and flats—the thrust faults; third-order surfaces are folded beds—anticlines and synclines; and fourth-order surfaces are small scale folds and faults—kink bands, conjugate faults, <b>box</b> <b>folds,</b> etc. The most important first-order surface is the décollement surface. This surface limits the glaciotectonic complex at its base and controls the extent of glaciotectonic disturbances. Below this surface, ordinary flat lying planar bedding occurs, whereas above the surface a number of structures are present characteristic of second- to fourth-order elements in the glaciotectonic architecture. The other first-order surface is the topographic top of the glaciotectonic complex, which eventually may be replaced by a truncating unconformity...|$|R
