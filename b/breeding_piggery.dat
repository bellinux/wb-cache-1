40|$|Ivermectin {{given in}} a single {{subcutaneous}} dose of 300 μg/kg was tested for safety and efficacy against swine hyperkeratotic scabies in a large <b>breeding</b> <b>piggery.</b> Approximately 15 % {{of the adult population}} was showing severe clinical mange. Skin scrapings were taken from 40 affected animals to provide parasite counts. Eight of 40 animals were used as untreated controls; all test animals were injected subcutaneously on day 0 with Ivermectin. General improvement was noted as early as eight days after treatment. Scratching stopped by day 21 in all treated animals. The results are discussed in regard to a control program for Sarcoptes scabiei infestation in pigs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to attempt a {{sustainable}} eradication of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis infection in a closed pig <b>breeding</b> farm. The <b>piggery</b> was situated north of Berlin and included 1200 sows and 700 young pigs without hog feeding. The whole livestock was treated either by two injections (intramuscular, two weeks interval) of IVOMEC®-S-Injektionslösung or by feeding IVOMEC® Prämix for two weeks treatment with a one week break after 7 days. There was no environmental treatment of the hog house. Naturally infected sows were examined before and after treatment for mange status as follows: investigation of typical dermatitis skin lesions, scratching index, detection of mites in ear cartilages and serologic investigation of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis antibodies in blood and colostral samples. Observation period for treatment control lasted up to 12 months. Direct detection of mange mites was negative after 4 months following treatment. Scratching index decreased immediately after treatment. Skin lesions slowly decreased after treatment and remained at a low level until the end of the observation period. Regarding the serological results in blood and colostral samples individual differences among the sows were found. Positive samples were detectable within six months (blood) and nine months (colostrum) after treatment. After one year the whole livestock showed no symptoms of sarcoptic mange which indicates a successful eradication of Sarcoptes scabiei var. suis using ivermectin as injection and in the feed...|$|R
