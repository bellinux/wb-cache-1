50|$|In nutrient-poor to {{moderately}} nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats {{form out of}} peat mosses, (feathery bogmoss Sphagnum cuspidatum, {{species of}} the complex Sphagnum recurvum s.l.) or brown mosses (Scorpidium scorpioides). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the bog sedge (Carex limosa), (Carex rostrata), <b>beak</b> <b>sedge</b> (Rhynchospora ssp.), Rannoch-rush (Scheuchzeria palustris) and marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (Phragmites australis), bulrushes (Typha ssp.), hop sedge (Carex pseudocyperus) and cowbane (Circuta virosa). Floating mats are habitats for shelly amoeba such as Amphitrema sp. and lake fly larvae.|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{the effects of}} climate change and human activities on the species composition of ombrotrophic (rain-fed) peat bogs by analyzing pollen and macrofossils. We used 14 C AMS wiggle-match dating (1) to obtain a precise chronology. Thermophilous plant species in the microfossil record provide information on climate change (2). Lime (Tilia), Elm (Ulmus), Beech (Fagus), Hornbeam (Carpinus) and Hazel (Corylus) will show a decline or disappear from the pollen record when climate becomes colder. The macrofossil record also provides information about climate, especially about changing effective precipitation. During wet periods the peat moss Sphagnum section cuspidata and White <b>Beak</b> <b>Sedge</b> (Rhynchospora alba) will expand in the bog vegetation, while hummock forming Sphagna and Heather species (Calluna vulgaris and Empetrum nigrum) will dominate during dry periods. Remains of fungi like Cenococcum geophilum also increase during periods of dryness. Local dryness in a bog could also be caused by human activities. Artificial drainage can cause desiccation of the bog surface, and peat growth can even stop and hiatuses may develop. Pollen grains of cereals, e. g., Rye (Secale), and herbs growing on agricultural fields, meadows and road verges reflect human impact in the region, e. g., Mugwort (Artemisia), Sheep's sorrel (Rumex acetosella), Cornflower (Centaurea cyanus) and Plantain (Plantago) (3). Tree plantations are reflected in high percentages of Pine (Pinus) and Spruce (Picea). Increases of spores of fungi feeding on dung might indicate increased animal husbandry. Figure 1 shows a selection of macro and microfossils in a core from Saxnäs Mosse in southern Sweden. Thirty levels within the 50 cm deep peat monolith were radiocarbon dated (4). The layer from 50 to 30 cm depth was formed during the interval from 1170 ± 13 AD to 1648 ± 11 AD. An increase of human impact around 1300 AD is reflected by Artemisia, Plantago and Cerealia. The synchronous appearance of Sphagnum magellanicum in the bog vegetation might well have been caused by an increased input of soil dust (5). Fagus, Corylus, Carpinus, Tilia and Ulmus decline due to a cooling of the climate during the Little Ice Age (LIA). This coincides with rises in delta 14 C which reflect decreases of solar activity (Wolf and Spörer minimum). The layer from 29 to 1 cm depth is much younger and shows negative (after 1950 AD) 14 C ages. We used the atmospheric bomb pulse for precise dating of this interval (6 - 7). Sample depth 29 showed an age of 1959 ± 3 AD. Therefore a time gap of more than 300 years is present between the samples at 30 and 29 cm depth. Climatic conditions cannot explain this hiatus. We found both indicators of wet and dry conditions between 40 and 30 cm depth. This is evidence for secondary decomposition of the bog surface after artificial drainage of the bog. Peat growth started again after 1959 ± 3 AD. The hiatus is a consequence of human activities but the bog vegetation regenerated when artificial drainage stopped...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. -Riparian {{ecosystems}} are sites ofimportant biogeochemical processes {{that affect the}} composition {{and structure of the}} streamside biota as well as aquatic systems. Microbial activity, coupled with the slow diffusion of oxygen in waterlogged riparian soils, causes anaerobic conditions and reduction in reductionoxidation (redox) potential. Redox potentials provide a useful measurement as to the intensity of anaerobic conditions and the degree of chemical transformation in riparian zones. Under anaerobic conditions, biogeochemical cycles differ greatly from the aerobic conditions of surrounding uplands. Different plant species are adapted to survive in varying levels of reduced waterlogged conditions such that different plant communities occupy sites of different redox potential. For example, Kentucky bluegrass Poa pratensis-timothy Phleum pratense communities occurred in areas ofhigh redoxpotential(well drained soils) (570 m V), <b>beaked</b> <b>sedge</b> Carex rostrata in moderate redox potential (- 48 mV), and tall mannagrass Glyceria grandis (- 164 mV) in waterlogged, anaerobic soils. Recent research has shown that low redox potentials resultin denitrification andthat phosphorus immobilization processes occur within intactriparian ecosystems, thereby greatlyinfluencing water quality. The effects of grazing or other anthropogenic disturbances can alter these biogeochemical cycles resulting in drastic alterations in riparian vegetation composition and productivity, aquatic ecosystems, and water quality. Given these importantlinkages to resource productivity, the effect oilanduse activities on biogeochemical cycle...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —I used radio {{transmitters}} {{to determine}} habitat selection and movement patterns of California golden trout Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita in two areas defined by their {{different levels of}} habitat recovery in the Golden Trout Wilderness, California. Study areas were differ-entiated {{by the amount of}} streamside vegetation (low or high coverage of <b>beaked</b> <b>sedge</b> Carex rostrata). Lower amounts of streamside vegetation were typically associated with other signs of degradation caused by cattle, including widened streams, collapsed banks, and reduced bank undercutting. Twenty-nine California golden trout were monitored from 6 July to 14 July 1994 over 192 diel-tracking hours at six study sections in low- and high-sedge areas in Mulkey Meadow. In both low- and high-sedge areas, California golden trout were observed using nine habitat features (undercut bank, willows, collapsed bank, open channel, aquatic vegetation, sedge, boulder, grass, and detrital mats), but they more often selected undercut banks, aquatic vegetation, and sedge and avoided bare and collapsed banks. Home ranges were similar in high-sedge sections (17. 3 m) and low-sedge sections (16. 9 m). Most fish moved little and were found within 5 m of their previously recorded location at both low-sedge and high-sedge sites. Total movement over the tracking period was variable between individual fish, but mean cumulative distances differed and were greater i...|$|E
40|$|Restoration of {{degraded}} riparian plant communities {{must consider}} relationships among water table dynamics, soil texture, and plant species. Water table dynamics, soil texture, and slope were compared among riparian plant communities dominated by: (1) <b>beaked</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex rostrata), (2) Geyer's willow (Salix geyeriana [S. geyerana]), and (3) black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa [Populus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa]) occurring on recent alluvial bars. Six sites in western Montana (USA) were examined for each plant community type. Mean bimonthly fluctuation in water table depth {{did not differ}} among the 3 plant communities (P= 0. 67), but mean depth to water table was greatest (P= 0. 004) in the cottonwood community (62. 8 cm), intermediate for the willow (32. 0 cm) and least for sedge communities (20. 7 cm). Soil texture differed among the 3 plant communities for sand (P= 0. 0004), silt (P= 0. 0002), and clay (P= 0. 003). Cottonwood communities occurred on soils that averaged 78 % sand, whereas sedge and willow sites averaged 47 % sand and 35 % sand, respectively. Silt content was 40 % beneath willow, 35 % beneath sedge and 15 % beneath cottonwood communities. Soils of the willow sites averaged 25 % clay compared with 18 % and 7 % for sedge and cottonwood communities, respectively. Soils beneath all 3 plant communities differed in coarse fragment percentage (P= 0. 01), averaging 46 % in cottonwood, 22 % in willow, and 15 % in sedge sites. No {{differences were found in}} slope among the 3 plant communities, either parallel to the stream (P= 0. 76) or perpendicular to the stream (P= 0. 29). Thus, these plant species exhibit a more narrow affinity for soil texture, coarse fragment content and water table depth than previously reported.

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 Riparian {{communities}} in the southern portion of Malheur National Forest were intensively studied {{with the objective of}} designing an approach for classifying disturbed riparian areas into units of similar potential. Not all riparian community types in this portion of the Blue Mountains were sampled due to time limitations. Some of the major community types sampled included: Baltic rush (Juncus balticus) communities; Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) communities; <b>beaked</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex rostrata) communities; water sedge (Carex aquatilis) communities; mountain alder (Alnus incana) communities; and various willow communities (Salix geyeriana, Salix exigua ssp. exigua, Salix rigida var. mackenziana, and Salix lemmonii). Sites were selected to maximize geographic variation. Piezometers were placed at each site to determine depth to water table. Soil temperature at depths of 15 cm and 50 cm and water table depth were measured semi-weekly. Plant frequency and understory cover by species were determined using 25 cm square plot frames along three 10 m transects in each community sampled. Belt transects were run to determine tree and shrub densities. Tree cover was determined using a hand-held densiometer and the line-intercept method was used for shrub cover. Soils were described and samples were collected from each horizon for laboratory determination of percent organic carbon, soil texture, and reaction (pH). Ordinations of plant communities and plant species were calculated using the DECORANA program for detrended correspondence analysis. The first axis of ordination arranged both species and communities along a moisture gradient. This was verified by correlation analysis as well as through canonical correlation of a species matrix and an environmental matrix.

Survival and vegetative reproduction were evaluated on greenhouse grown plugs of these two sedge species following transplanting within a reconstructed NE Oregon meadow stream. Sedge plugs were planted on two fluvial surfaces along the stream: depositional (point bars) and erosional surfaces (straight) at or below bankfull level. A second study was performed to evaluate the effect of Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) presence on sedge transplant survival and vegetative reproduction. This was performed only on erosional planting locations. Depths to groundwater and soil moisture were also recorded at each planting location. Survival at the end of the first growing season in the first study was the same for both species, but shoot numbers were greater for Carex nebrascensis (98 shoots/m²) compared with Carex utriculata (84 shoots/m²). No differences were observed between shoot numbers by species at the end of the second growing season. Greater shoot numbers also occurred on depositional planting locations (117 and 165 shoots/m²) compared to erosional planting locations (65 and 59 shoots/m²) at the end of the first and second growing seasons. Transplant loss due to scour from high flows was greater at erosional planting locations (48...|$|E
