60|$|Although the {{authority}} of the crown had been exercised with very little restraint during the three preceding reigns, the succession to it, or even the principles of the succession, were but ill ascertained: so that a doubt might justly have arisen, whether the crown was not in a great measure elective. This uncertainty exposed the nation, at the death of every king, to all the calamities of a civil war; but it was a circumstance favorable to the designs of Stephen, Earl of Boulogne, who was son of Stephen, Earl of Blois, by a daughter of the Conqueror. The late king had raised him to great employments, and enriched him by the grant of several lordships. His brother had been made Bishop of Winchester; and by adding to it the place of his chief justiciary, the king gave him an opportunity of becoming one of the richest subjects in Europe, and of extending an unlimited influence over the clergy and the people. Henry trusted, by the promotion of two persons so near him in blood, and so bound by benefits, that he had formed an impenetrable fence about the succession; but he only inspired into Stephen the design of seizing on the crown by bringing him so near it. The opportunity was favorable. The king died abroad; Matilda was absent with her husband; and the Bishop of Winchester, by his universal credit, disposed the churchmen to elect his brother, with the concurrence of the greatest part of the nobility, who forgot their oaths, and vainly hoped that a <b>bad</b> <b>title</b> would necessarily produce a good government. Stephen, in the flower of youth, bold, active, and courageous, full of generosity and a noble affability, that seemed to reproach the state and avarice of the preceding kings, was not wanting to his fortune. He seized immediately the immense treasures of Henry, and by distributing them with a judicious profusion removed all doubts concerning his title to them. He did not spare even the royal demesne, but secured himself a vast number of adherents by involving their guilt and interest in his own. He raised a considerable army of Flemings, in order to strengthen himself against another turn of the same instability which had raised him to the throne; and, in imitation of the measures of the late king, he concluded all by giving a charter of liberties as ample as the people at that time aspired to. This charter contained a renunciation of the forests made by his predecessor, a grant to the ecclesiastics of a jurisdiction over their own vassals, and to the people in general an immunity from unjust tallages and exactions. It is remarkable, that the oath of allegiance taken by the nobility on this occasion was conditional: it was to be observed so long as the king observed the terms of his charter,--a condition which added no real security to the rights of the subject, but which proved a fruitful source of dissension, tumult, and civil violence.|$|E

It was the first of two that MGM attempted with South Pacific stage-star Ezio Pinza.

[...] GamePro commented that [...] "Bubsy offers a muddled mix of good and bad ingredients", citing colorful graphics but jerky animation, good music but raspy sound effects, inconsistent control responsiveness, and fickle collision detection.

5000|$|The ADAV's party {{newspaper}} was called Der Sozialdemokrat ("The Social Democrat"). Marx and Engels {{responded to the}} title [...] "Sozialdemocrat" [...] with distaste, Engels once writing, [...] "But what a title: Sozialdemokrat!...Why don't they simply call it The Proletarian." [...] Marx agreed with Engels that [...] "Sozialdemokrat" [...] was a <b>bad</b> <b>title.</b> Although {{the origins of the}} name [...] "Sozialdemokrat" [...] actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the French political party known as the [...] "Partie Democrat-Socialist" [...] into [...] "Partei der Sozialdemokratie," [...] Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the middle class; he associated the word [...] "Sozialdemokrat" [...] with that party.

[...] Andrew Rennie of NOW noted how throughout the album, Mims borrows styles from fellow contemporaries like Busta Rhymes and Kanye West. Rennie later added that [...] "There {{are a couple of}} moments of idiosyncrasy here, particularly on the title track and [...] "On & On", but Guilts formulaic approach makes it easy to pass on the whole album.

Marge, aping the downtrodden demeanor of Walter's wife Skyler, sits on the couch drinking coffee. She goes into the kitchen to begin baking cupcakes, using food coloring to turn the batter blue and adding frosting and sprinkles in other shades of this color. She places one batch in a silver briefcase, which she gives to Bart before he leaves the house. Homer, dressed in the dark hat and sunglasses Walter dons for his [...] "Heisenberg" [...] persona, sneaks a taste of the batter while Marge is baking and is later woken from a nap by the smell. The scene cuts to a church bake sale, where Marge sells a cupcake to Milhouse as Homer watches from a distance. Back at the Simpson house, Marge runs her earnings through a currency-counting machine, bundles the money, and adds it to a large pile on the dining table. The camera zooms out to reveal a live-action scene (taken from the episode [...] "Hazard Pay") of Walter White and his partner Jesse Pinkman sitting on a couch drinking beer and watching the sequence on a TV.|$|E

The set yielded a surprise sideways hit in the tune 'Storybook Love,' which Knopfler borrowed for his soundtrack to The Princess Bride, but the album received little promotion or airplay. Too <b>bad.</b> The <b>title</b> track and the gorgeous 'Angel Eyes' offer great evidence for DeVille as a unique vocal stylist whose roots lay in the rock & roll of the Doc Pomus generation, and 'Could You Would You,' written by Van Morrison, is one of DeVille's finest cover songs." ...|$|R
