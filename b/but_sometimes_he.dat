5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti or Vaikuntha Vishnu is a four-headed {{aspect of}} the Hindu god Vishnu, mostly found in Kashmir (northern part of the Indian subcontinent). The icon {{represents}} Vishnu as the Supreme Being. He has a human head, a lion head, a boar head and a demonic head. Sometimes, even three-headed aspects of Vishnu where the demonic rear head is dropped are considered to represent Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Though iconographical treatises describe him to eight-armed, he is often depicted with four. Generally, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is shown standing <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> is depicted seated on his vahana (mount) Garuda.|$|E
2500|$|Ralph Edmond Stanley was born, grew up, {{and lived}} in rural Southwest Virginia—"in a little town called McClure {{at a place called}} Big Spraddle, just up the holler" [...] from where he moved in 1936 and lived ever since in Dickenson County. The son of Lee and Lucy Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home. [...] As he says, his [...] "daddy didn't play an instrument, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would sing church music. [...] And I'd hear him sing songs like 'Man of Constant Sorrow,' 'Pretty Polly' and 'Omie Wise.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthew {{has taken}} over his key Christological texts from Mark, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> has changed the stories he found in Mark, giving {{evidence}} of his own concerns. The title Son of David identifies Jesus as the healing and miracle-working Messiah of Israel (it is used exclusively in relation to miracles), and the Jewish messiah is sent to Israel alone. As Son of Man he will return to judge the world, a fact his disciples recognise but of which his enemies are unaware. As Son of God he is named Immanuel (God with us) (...) , God revealing himself through his son, and Jesus proving his sonship through his obedience and example.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sometimes Jimmy's rash, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> keener {{than one}} thinks. Anyhow, he's obstinate {{and we were}} disputing about a {{suggestion}} of his I did not at first approve. I wrote the letters I meant to write. Sit down and take a smoke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, every day. He's back {{always about}} seven. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> good-natured enough when <b>he</b> comes back, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he's</b> very cross. He's best just after dinner. But it's {{so hard to}} get to him then. Lord Alfred is almost always there; and then other people come, and they play cards. I think the city will be best.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Loki {{has been}} {{depicted}} in or {{is referred to}} {{in an array of}} media in modern popular culture. During the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of manners, sometimes strongly at odds. According to Stefan Arvidssen, [...] "the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic fifth columnist among the Nordic Aesir, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> was described as a Nordic Prometheus, a heroic bearer of culture". Famously, Loki appears in Richard Wagner's opera cycle Ring of the Nibelung as Loge (a play on Old Norse loge [...] "fire"). He is depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically Wotan's assistant rather than Donner's), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera Das Rheingold he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera Götterdämmerung Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.|$|E

5000|$|... “His {{quality is}} scoring goals and assisting, but then he’s {{a man that}} can {{participate}} in both phases of team play,” Paunovic said. “He’s very good in all phases of the game. Defensively, he helps the team to recover the ball {{as soon as possible}} in order that we can control the game and create opportunities for our team to win. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> will benefit from team play and he will be just the executor, <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he’s</b> capable of creating his own situations in the game, the opportunities 1v1, and scoring his own goals.” ...|$|R

60|$|Meanwhile William grew {{bigger and}} {{stronger}} and more active, while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer, and trotted after his mother like her shadow.

6000|$|... "He mostly does nothin' <b>but</b> drink. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>he</b> sells little birds; <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> sells penny watches or boot-laces in Cheapside, an' {{turns in}} a little that way, but it all goes to the grog-shop; none of it comes here. Then he has a mill now an' again--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All this," [...] remarked Miss Castro, [...] "is very nice; and the Señor Maxwell, who is muy caballero, <b>but</b> somber <b>sometimes,</b> <b>he</b> is not here. You have my {{permission}} to sit there, and I {{will talk to}} you." ...|$|R
50|$|He has a {{friendly}} personality, even to Sakuma who was antagonized {{by most of}} the members of the agency. He is soft-spoken and caring. <b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> when <b>he</b> is against a hostile enemy, he shows a sadistic side.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> forgets {{himself in}} his winter visit, and sings as other birds do, just because his world is bright; and then, once in a lifetime, a New England bird lover hears him, and remembers; and regrets {{for the rest of}} his life that the grosbeak's {{northern}} country life has made him so shy a visitor.|$|E
60|$|The papa {{had told}} them what ambitious was, and so the {{children}} did not stop him {{when he came to}} that word; <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would stop of his own accord, and then if they could not tell what it meant, he would pretend {{that he was not going}} on; but he always did go on.|$|E
60|$|He {{was not a}} man who worried. He had {{not that}} temperament. <b>But</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> would wonder in rather a vague way whether he was not {{allowing}} life to slip by him a little too placidly. An occasional yearning for something larger would attack him. There seemed to be something in him that made for inaction. His soul was sleepy.|$|E

60|$|Kit, {{with some}} {{hesitation}} {{gave him the}} coin. He had known Macallister spoil a useful watch, and return another bearing the marks of the vice-jaws.

Macallister got {{to work with the}} coin and his big pocket knife, and the headman turned to Kit.|$|E
60|$|Laura {{could picture}} it. The boy's {{reaction}} from his uncle's firm and parsimonious guardianship was natural, and she studied him with fresh curiosity. He was tall but rather loosely built, and his look was apologetic, {{as if he}} had not yet got a man's strength and confidence. One noted the stamp of the cotton mill. As a rule Jimmy was generous and extravagant; <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> was strangely business-like.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is the Rajah," [...] the Doctor said, [...] "the farther man, {{with that}} {{aigrette}} of diamonds in his turban.

60|$|The sedate Indian took special {{pleasure}} in watching the doings {{of his old}} friend.

There was little interchange of thought between those two silent men, but there was much of quiet enjoyment.|$|E
60|$|Though {{there was}} no end to Poky's attentions, not a {{syllable}} did he ever breathe of reward; <b>but</b> <b>sometimes</b> <b>he</b> looked very knowing. At last the day came for sailing, and with it, also, his canoe, loaded down to the gunwale with a sea stock of fruits. Giving him all I could spare from my chest, I went on deck to take my place at the windlass; for the anchor was weighing. Poky followed, and heaved {{with me at the}} same handspike.|$|E
6000|$|The Indian {{said that}} the lichen which we saw hanging from the trees was called chorchorque. We asked him the names of several birds which we heard this morning.
