Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy's sound hardware {{was different from the}} Famicom's, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game's music to resemble that of Square's two preceding Final Fantasy titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms. Despite Game Boy's limited audio capabilities, Uematsu expressed desire to compose music for it again in 2000, though added regarding the notion of a remake [...] "it would be better to have high quality music and graphics, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> {{to make sure that the}} users enjoy the game." ...|$|E

500|$|Arthur Vaughan Williams died {{suddenly}} in February 1875, and his widow took {{the children to}} live in her family home, Leith Hill Place, Wotton, Surrey. The children were {{under the care of}} a nurse, Sara Wager, who instilled in them not only polite manners and good behaviour but also liberal social and philosophical opinions. Such views were consistent with the progressive-minded tradition of both sides of the family. When the young Vaughan Williams asked his mother about Darwin's controversial book On the Origin of Species, she answered, [...] "The Bible says that God made the world in six days. Great Uncle Charles thinks it took longer: <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not worry about it, for it is equally wonderful either way".|$|E
500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it feel now? Empty? Not yet. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to get help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Richard Brody of The New Yorker {{notes the}} film's [...] "Eurocentric art-house self-awareness" [...] and Alvy Singer's [...] "psychoanalytic {{obsession}} in baring his sexual desires and frustrations, romantic disasters, and neurotic inhibitions". Annie Hall {{is viewed as}} the definitive Woody Allen film in displaying neurotic humor. Singer is identified with the stereotypical neurotic Jewish male, and the differences between Alvy and Annie are often related to the perceptions and realities of Jewish identity. Vincent Brook notes that [...] "Alvy dines with the WASP-y Hall family and imagines that they must {{see him as a}} Hasidic Jew, complete with payess (ear locks) and a large black hat." [...] Robert M. Seltzer and Norman J. Cohen highlight the scene in which Annie remarks that Annie's grandmother [...] "hates Jews. She thinks they just make money, but she’s the one. Is she ever, I’m telling you.", revealing the hypocrisy in her grandmother's stereotypical American view of Jews by arguing that [...] "no stigma attaches to the love of money in America". Bernd Herzogenrath also considers Allen's joke, [...] "I would like to <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> the eggs", to the doctor at the end when he suggests putting him in a mental institution, to be a paradox of not only the persona of the urban neurotic Jew but also of the film itself.|$|E

500|$|A {{month after}} the plan's establishment, Public Service Alliance of Canada Prairies Regional Executive Vice-President Marianne Hladun wrote {{an open letter to}} Brad Trost, MP for Saskatoon—Humboldt, saying that, while she {{approved}} of the NAP-CHT, the government was being inconsistent in its treatment of human trafficking because it had recently announced that it would be eliminating four CBSA intelligence officer positions, thereby dismissing four people who were already doing effective anti-human-trafficking work. When it was announced that foreign workers would no longer be issued permits for work in Canada's sex industry, Tim Lambrinos, leader of the Adult Entertainment Association of Canada, said that he might challenge the policy because he believed that [...] "strip clubs are a very safe environment" [...] and that the government was [...] "destroying an industry [...] creating a labour shortage." [...] At Toronto's third annual Walk for Freedom in September 2012, Shae Invidiata criticized the NAP-CHT for allotting only $500,000 to victim services, saying, [...] "I'm very grateful, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> more." [...] Smith also said that the $500,000 allotted to support victims was insufficient. She said that many of these organizations [...] "still struggle to provide basic care for victims of human trafficking" [...] and {{that there should be a}} [...] "considerable increase in support from the federal and provincial governments for these organizations." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{team could}} only manage a draw against Chelsea on 8 September 2001, {{in a game}} {{described}} by The Guardian writer David Lacey as one where [...] "the teams simply battered away at each other until one cracked." [...] Henry scored the winning goal away to newly promoted outfit Fulham; the 3–1 victory moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the league for the first time in the campaign. Against Bolton Wanderers, Arsenal was held to a 1–1 draw after Jeffers' goal was cancelled out by Michael Ricketts. A win at Derby County, where Henry scored two goals was followed by an identical scoreline against Southampton at the new St. Mary's Stadium. At home to Blackburn Rovers, midfielder Keith Gillespie gave the visitors the lead, before Pirès equalised and Bergkamp put Arsenal in front. A mistake by Lauren presented David Dunn the chance to shoot [...] "from 25 yards" [...] and score. Henry's controlled effort looked to have been the winner for Arsenal, until a pass by Tugay caused goalkeeper Wright to [...] "race out of his goal" [...] – the loose ball was collected by Dunn who shot into the empty net. Although Wenger was disappointed with the manner of the defeat, he saw some encouragement: [...] "What's positive for everyone is that Manchester United are dropping points as well. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to rectify the fact we concede goals at home." [...] October ended with a draw against Sunderland, where notably former Arsenal player Stefan Schwarz equalised for the home side and Patrick Vieira missed a penalty.|$|E
