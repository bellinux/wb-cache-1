40|$|Several {{investigators}} {{have described the}} altered sleep patterns in Down's syndrome subjects. The most relevant findings have been a reduction in percentage of REM sleep, a prolonged latency to the first REM episode, an increase in undifferentiated sleep, and a reduced ratio of the oculomotor frequencies. Because it is of interest to identify new drugs able to increase the percentage of REM sleep in mentally retarded subjects, we studied the effects of <b>butoctamide</b> hydrogen succinate (BAHS) on nocturnal sleep in eight young institutionalized Down's syndrome subjects. BAHS produced {{a significant increase in}} the percentage of REM sleep as well as a decrease in undifferentiated sleep and latency to the first RE...|$|E
40|$|Mentally retarded {{children}} {{present a}} reduction in percentage of REM sleep and of oculomotor frequencies. These sleep patterns are probably relevant for their cognitive activities. The effects of <b>butoctamide</b> hydrogen succinate and intensive learning sessions on the night sleep of five Down's syndrome patients was studied by the authors. They found an increase in percentage of REM sleep after pharmacological treatment {{and an increase in}} oculomotor frequencies after learning sessions. The authors' hypotheses of REM sleep as a neurophysiological indicator of cerebral "plasticity" and of oculomotor frequencies as an indicator of "organization" abilities are discussed in this article. Pedagogical implications and therapeutical perspectives are also outlined...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} <b>butoctamide</b> {{hydrogen}} succinate (BAHS) and nitrazepam on sleep were studied in 12 healthy male subjects. The subjects were divided into three groups consisting of 4 subjects who were given BAHS 600 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg, and BAHS 600 mg+nitrazepam 5 mg, respectively. Polygraphic recordings were made for 8 consecutive nights from each subject. Placebo was given on the first 3 nights and the last 2 nights, and drug was administered on the fourth, fifth, and sixth nights. Before falling asleep and after arising the next morning, the subjects were requested to fill out subjective assessments for sleep. The polysomnogarams were evaluated by computerized automatic analysis using the interval histogram method. The first night was excluded from the data analysis because of the first night effect. BAHS increased REM sleep and decreased stage 2 significantly; however, it did not affect to stage 1, 3 and 4. Nitrazepam produced {{a significant increase in}} total sleep time and stage 2 but a decrease in stage 1, SWS and REM. BAHS together with nitrazepam increased total sleep time, but altered a few parameters. These results suggest that BAHS and nitrazepam might be used for different varieties of insomnia, because the effects of BAHS on sleep are different from those of nitrazepam...|$|E
40|$|<b>Butoctamide</b> {{hydrogen}} succinate (BAHS) {{has been proved}} to increase REM sleep in patients with reduced REM sleep. Following previous experiments {{on the effects of}} BAHS on nocturnal sleep of mentally retarded (MR) subjects, a polygraphic study was conducted on 20 MR subjects (age 8 - 14 years) to verify the effects of BAHS, 1) after long-term administration and 2) in different etiologies of MR. Subjects were divided into two balanced groups receiving placebo or 400 mg BAHS before sleep for a 6 -month period. Basal sleep did not differ substantially in the two groups, both presenting reduced REM sleep. Low amounts of REM sleep were partially reversed by BAHS administration, which caused {{a significant increase in the}} REM sleep stage. Post-treatment sleep modifications found in the experimental group were not observed in the control group. BAHS produced its effects on REM sleep immediately after the first administration of the drug, but they became more apparent after long-term treatment. Our findings indicate that long-term administration of BAHS at low dosage maintains its effects on REM sleep of mentally retarded children, causing modifications similar to those previously obtained with single administration at higher dosages in cats, in healthy young and elderly volunteers and in Down's syndrome children. In addition, our observations demonstrate the effectiveness of BAHS on REM sleep, when utilized in mental retardation of etiologies other than Down's syndrome...|$|E
