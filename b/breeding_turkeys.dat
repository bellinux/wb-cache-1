Although the source of infection is not yet known, the outbreak was controlled, and the virus was eliminated from the birds. Influenza A pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus is a novel highly transmissible agent that contains a unique combination of gene segments from different swine lineages (1); it has circulated in humans since April 2009 (2). First detected in North America, the virus was disseminated worldwide {{in just a few}} weeks, prompting the World Health Organization to raise its global health alert to the pandemic stage (2, 3). By December 2009, a total of 14 countries had reported that the pandemic strain was infecting swine, generating concern about the role of other susceptible species in the viral epidemiology. Fortunately, only a mild respiratory disease developed in the ill swine, and outbreaks were controlled with biosafety measures, avoiding dissemination to humans and animals (4).

40|$|In {{the period}} from 2003 to 2008 we {{conducted}} a research on avian chlamydiosis in Bosnia and Herzegovina on {{a great number of}} domestic and wild birds from different localities. Diagnostic material from the wild birds was provided by the hunting societies during the hunting season while material from the domestic poultry was taken indiscriminately. Chicken samples are taken from the facilities for intensive production, namely parent flocks. Turkey samples are taken from the individual households keeping and <b>breeding</b> <b>turkey</b> on extensive basis (half – open type of breeding). Pigeon samples are provided from the central parts of Sarajevo where the pigeons live in a close contact with people. Also, pigeon samples are provided from around the town's bakery and a farm for intensive poultry breeding because the pigeons are considered a potential source of infection for other birds, primarily domestic ones, and also for the people. We also took samples of the breeding pheasants from a pheasant farm in Orašje, which is oriented toward breeding and releasing pheasants into their natural habitat, but also breeding for the needs of hunting industry. Samples from the wild/hunting birds (ducks and wild pheasants) were provided in the proximity of watercourses as their residence, and where the hunting is of a greater extent. To obtain valid diagnostic results we have used multiple diagnostic methods and tests: bacteriological examination to exclude cross reactions, IIF (indirect immunofluorescence) to confirm antibodies in the blood serum, ELISA (immunoesay) and EIA (quick immunoessay) to detect antigen, and conventional PCR and rRT – PCR to detect antigen as sensitive and sophisticated diagnostics methods.

40|$|ABSTRACT The poultry {{industry}} {{has made significant}} advances in growth rate, feed efficiency, and breast mus-cle yield through intensive <b>breeding</b> of <b>turkeys.</b> How-ever, a meat quality problem known as pale, soft, exu-dative (PSE) meat presents the industry with a major challenge during periods of stress, such as the onset of a prolonged heat wave.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Turkey is {{not only}} the main apricot (Prunus armeniaca) {{producer}} and exporter in the world, but it also has a wide variety of apricot germplasms, owing to its close proximity to the centers of apricot origin. However, {{there is little or no}} genetic information on many apricot cultivars that are extensively cultivated in Turkey. We examined the genetic relatedness of 25 Turkish and four exotic apricot cultivars using SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers that were either previously developed for apricot, or for peach (P. persica), a close relative of apricot. Allele diversity (with an average allele number of 6. 37) at the SSR loci and the heterozygosity rates (with an average Ho value of 0. 648) of these cultivars were found to be higher than in previous studies that used the same loci for apricot. This fact might be attributed to the analysis of different numbers of accessions in the different studies. No correlations were found between the genetic relatedness and the geographical distributions of these cultivars. The data reported here will assist in the prevention of confusions in the apricot propagation and <b>breeding</b> in <b>Turkey.</b> The findings can also be directly compared with other studies that used the same SSR markers on apricot...|$|R

These indigenous breeds are more resistant to disease and parasites while also being able to survive even unfavourable environments and to maintain their productivity.
