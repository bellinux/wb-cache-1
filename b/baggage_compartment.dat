5|$|The {{upper body}} had a <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> {{separating}} the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|Unique to this {{adaptation}} of the story, Marceau finds additional clues such as a crate full of living accommodations in the security vault of the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> {{and a picture of}} Michel's family, despite the fact that Poirot's nephew radios that the man has none. After explaining the second solution, Poirot reveals that Michel is not who he appears, but is in fact Robert Perkinson, Cassetti's criminal partner. Perkinson confirms this to the shock of the other passengers and reveals that Cassetti kept Daisy Armstrong at his house, but Cassetti gunned down Perkinson's daughter, Teresa, whom he mistook for Daisy.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through snowdrift unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E

25|$|The {{first six}} {{aircraft}} produced were designated Series 1, {{indicating that they}} were prototype aircraft. The initial production run consisted of Series 100 aircraft, serial numbers seven to 115 inclusive. In 1968, Series 200 production began with serial number 116. Changes made {{at the beginning of}} Series 200 production included improving the STOL performance, adding a longer nose that was equipped with a larger <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> (except for aircraft fitted with floats), and fitting a larger door to the rear <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> All Series 1, 100, and 200 aircraft and their variants (110, 210) were fitted with the 550-shaft-horsepower PT6A-20 engines.|$|E
25|$|Each {{combination}} coach {{had a small}} iron safe in the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> Though $200,000,000 in {{gold was}} hauled out of Nevada County by the NCNGRR during its operation, there was never an attempted robbery.|$|E

50|$|Between 2004 and 2008 Alstom rebuilt some 2nd class {{cars with}} <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> into new B5uxh cab-cars. Most of the {{vehicles}} were still in service in 2008.|$|R
2500|$|Additional {{types of}} these cars were developed, {{all with the}} same overall length, body shape, and {{characteristic}} round end windows {{often referred to as}} porthole or owl-eyed windows and large roof-level headlights. The passenger-baggage combination cars (52 seats) were designated MPB54. In 1911, baggage cars with 62ft. <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> were added and designated MB62. In 1913, baggage-mail cars with the same dimensions were added and designated MBM62. In 1914, passenger-baggage combination cars with longer <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> and 40 seats were added and designated MPB54B. [...] In 1915, passenger-baggage-mail combination cars with 24 seats were added and designated MPBM54.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{inquiries}} were made concerning a military {{version of the}} Mini-IMP, skinned with Kevlar, armed with two 7.62-millimeter machine guns, and with room in the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> for a considerable quantity of ammunition. Nothing came of the proposal.|$|E
25|$|Another {{company offers}} a {{modification}} {{for the entire}} King Air line that entails reworking and extending the entire nose to house a <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> {{as well as the}} avionics normally found in the noses of King Air aircraft; while another offers winglets, {{similar to those of the}} B300, for 200 series and other 300 series King Airs.|$|E
25|$|The CHUBy CUBy was {{the third}} homebuilt replica of a Piper product from parts {{supplier}} Wag-Aero. The PA-14 line was a popular aircraft for Alaska floatplane operations, the CHUBy CUBy was put to market to allow new examples to be built. The aircraft has an optional large opening to the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> similar to the Piper HE-1 ambulance style door.|$|E
50|$|The {{forward section}} of the {{otherwise}} all-wood fuselage is made of fiberglass. The single-wheel main landing gear is fixed. The formed one-piece canopy is side-mounted. The fuselage can be equipped with radios and oxygen system. There are two <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments.</b> Water ballast is not available.|$|R
50|$|As the FO's {{fleet of}} rolling stock was {{obsolete}} in the 1960s and winter season traffic was strongly increasing, the FO urgently needed more powerful locomotives. The company opted for efficient multiple unit power cars with <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> {{that could be}} used freely on the whole network.|$|R
50|$|The {{class is}} so named under the Swiss {{locomotive}} and railcar classification system. According to that system, ABDeh 4/10 denotes an electric railcar with first class, second class and <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> {{and a total}} of ten axles, four of which are drive axles fitted with cogwheels for rack rail operation.|$|R
25|$|B200 {{configured}} as {{a regional}} airliner, with room for two crew and 13 passengers, fitted with two overwing emergency exits instead of the standard model's single overwing exit and an optional 455 lb (206 kg) belly cargo pod; a nose <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> provided by relocating avionics from the nose to elsewhere in the aircraft. A total of 14 were built in 1989 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|In April 1955, Univair {{sold the}} Ercoupe type {{certificate}} to the Forney Aircraft Company of Fort Collins, Colorado, which {{later became the}} Fornaire Aircraft Company. The aircraft produced differed from the 415-G in its engine/propeller combination they were upgraded to a C-90 engine, revised engine cowling, larger <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment,</b> and aluminum-covered wing panels. The F-1A model had three axis controls and bucket seats. Production began in 1958 and ended in 1959.|$|E
25|$|The AC-35 had {{side-by-side}} seating {{with a small}} <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> The fuselage was {{a combination}} of steel tube in front, and wood construction in the tail with fabric covering overall. The engine was rear mounted with a shaft driven forward propeller. The vehicle had three equal size wheels (two in front, one in the rear). The rear wheel was shaft driven from the engine and the front wheels provided steering.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{conventionally}} configured low-wing cantilever monoplane with tailwheel undercarriage. The {{main undercarriage}} units retracted into the engine nacelles. Construction was wooden throughout, with wooden skinning everywhere but the forward and upper fuselage sections, which were skinned in metal. As usually configured, the cabin seated six passengers with <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> fore and aft, and a toilet aft.|$|R
40|$|The {{most common}} type of injury {{suffered}} by people at work are back injuries. This paper summarises the opinions of one hundred and fifty six baggage handlers from ten airlines and two ground handling companies worldwide, regarding their perceptions on the causes and prevention of baggage handler back injuries. Handling and stacking baggage within narrow body aircraft <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> were considered by most to be the highest risk tasks. Transferring baggage from the baggage trailer directly into the aircraft, pushing and pulling loaded trailers, and pushing loaded containers inside wide body aircraft when the aircraft systems are unserviceable were also high risk tasks cited by many baggage handlers. Among the solutions identified were the need for redesign of some aircraft <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> and ground handling equipment, and provision of mechanical assistance devices, both within the aircraft and in baggage sorting rooms at airports. The need for improved training of baggage handlers in the area of manual handling was also identified...|$|R
5000|$|From 1987 Eyges {{specialized}} in playing a Tucker F. Barrett solid-body electric cello. He commented that, {{in addition to}} being able to produce a variety of colours from the instrument, it had two advantages over an acoustic cello: [...] "volume, because playing an acoustic instrument with a fierce drummer just doesn't make it; and transportability, since I can safely put it in the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> of planes and trains." ...|$|R
25|$|Cosmonaut trainer. This was a salon VIP {{aircraft}} {{modified to}} train cosmonauts {{to fly the}} Buran reusable spacecraft, the Soviet equivalent of the US Space Shuttle. The Tu-154 was used because the Buran required a steep descent, and the Tu-154 was capable of replicating that. The cabin featured trainee workstations, {{one of which was}} the same as the Buran's flightdeck. The forward <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> was converted into a camera bay, because the aircraft was also used to train cosmonauts in observation and photographic techniques.|$|E
25|$|Gulf Air Flight 771 was {{a flight}} from Karachi, Pakistan, to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. On 23 September 1983, while the Boeing 737-2P6 was on {{approach}} to Abu Dhabi International Airport, a bomb exploded in the <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b> The plane crashed in the desert near Mina Jebel Ali between Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the UAE. All five crew members and 107 passengers died. Most of the dead were Pakistani nationals, many returning to jobs in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain after spending the Eid al Adha holiday with their families in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the mixed}} {{success of the}} earlier Monospar family of aircraft, the company {{designed}} a ten-seat light transport, the ST-18 (later named Croydon). Due to the longer-span wing, {{it was not a}} cantilever monospar wing but had to be fitted with bracing struts. The ST-18 was a low-wing monoplane, with a conventional tail unit and tailwheel landing gear, and hydraulically retractable main gear. It was powered by two Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior radial engines mounted on the wing leading edges. It had a crew of three, and a cabin for ten passengers, a toilet and <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The model designations {{used for}} Classics {{consisted}} of two letters followed {{by a series of}} five numbers then another letter. The only versions built were the TC40-102A, TC40-102N and the TA60-102N. All were equipped with an automatic transmission. (Some TC40-102As with no center exits have been erroneously identified as SC40-102As, but a true Suburban version would have had all forward-facing seats, no center exit, a lowered center aisle and underfloor <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments.)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{the testing of}} an automatic aircraft disinsection system permanently installed on a commercial DC- 6 B passenger aircraft. An air-compressor forces ambient cabin air, partially saturated with dichlorvos vapour at a set concentration, through the cabin, cockpit and <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments</b> of the aircraft for 30 minutes. Insecticide concentrations and insect mortality were observed in post-overhaul check flights, and insect mortality and passenger reactions were observed on scheduled flights between Miami, Florida, and Nassau, Bahamas...|$|R
5000|$|Maine Central's first {{wholly owned}} {{diesel-electric}} locomotive was an Ingersoll Rand [...] railcar built as demonstrator OE-600 in 1933. The {{rear of the}} railcar included railway post office and <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments.</b> The railcar became Maine Central number 901 in 1935; and pulled a coach or two over the eastern division between Bangor, Maine and Vanceboro, Maine until 1947. It then spent two years pulling Rumford Branch passenger trains before conversion to unpowered maintenance of way tool car number 950.|$|R
25|$|The {{hull of the}} Seastar {{features}} complex angling and shaping, as {{the result}} of extensive water tank testing. Pilots exit and enter the Seastar through a single door on the left-hand side of the aircraft from the sponson, and passengers board via a separate hatch located aft of the wing, also stepping from the sponson. This approach enables the aircraft to close to a relatively short distance from docks or boats for boarding purposes. The cabin can house up to 12 passengers, in addition to the crew in high-density seating, or can alternatively accommodate six-nine passengers in more spacious configurations; an aft <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> is also present.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{equipment}} can be equipped, dependent on operator choice and role; these include an external hoist, dual cargo hook, dual flight controls, <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment</b> extension, snow skis, windshield wipers, rotor brake, multi-band radios, active noise reduction headsets, soundproofing, oxygen systems, loud speakers, search lights, retractable landing light, emergency floatation equipment, reinforced windshield, wire strike protection system, rappelling kit, fire fighting belly tank, and a forward looking infrared (FLIR) camera. Three fuel tanks, located behind the rear {{seats in the}} cabin, are installed as standard; up to two additional optional tanks can be fitted {{for a total of}} five, providing a flight endurance of nearly six hours.|$|E
25|$|The two C.A.15Cs were {{all-metal}} aircraft {{apart from}} the fabric-covered wings and tail surfaces. The fuselage, cabin and empennage were the same in both versions. The tailplane was braced and the fin and rudder rather angular and flat-topped, the rudder horn-balanced. Because the Air Ministry envisaged the aircraft going to Imperial Airways after the trials, the cabins were fully fitted out for ten passengers, with two compartments containing six and four seats placed singly {{on either side of}} a central aisle. Warm air heating was fed from the engines. Between the enclosed cockpit for the two crew and the passenger cabins was a <b>baggage</b> <b>compartment.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1985 to 1997 Daewoo Bus {{built the}} BH115, a bus {{originally}} styled {{in a manner}} similar to the RTS. Despite Daewoo catalogs allegedly claiming it to be an export version of the RTS, its body structure is completely different, boasting underfloor <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments,</b> and sporting no modular construction. This bus is frequently assumed to be a foreign variant of an RTS, but apart from appearance, it shares nothing with it. The BH115 was later restyled to distance itself visually from the RTS.|$|R
50|$|Ex-military PV-1 Venturas from Canada and South Africa were {{converted}} by Howard Aero in San Antonio, Texas in the 1950s and 1960s as high-speed executive transports. The earliest conversions, called Super Venturas, incorporated a 48 in (122 cm) fuselage stretch, extra fuel tankage, large picture windows, luxury interiors, and weapons bays transformed into <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments.</b> The landing gear was swapped for the heavier-duty units from the PV-2. Later conversions, of which eighteen were {{completed in the}} 1960s, were called Howard 350s.|$|R
50|$|The B&O {{had been}} using RDCs in local Baltimore - Washington, D.C., {{commuter}} service since 1950. Pleased with their reliability and lower operating costs compared to heavyweight passenger trains drawn by steam locomotives, the B&O decided in 1955 to replace its money-losing Washingtonian steam train with RDCs, ordering four RDC-1s with reclining coach seats and two RDC-2s with <b>baggage</b> <b>compartments.</b> The RDC-equipped Daylight Speedliner entered service on October 28, 1956, and reduced the railroad's operating expenses by almost half, compared to the Washingtonian train it replaced.|$|R
