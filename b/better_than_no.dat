A 2015 Cochrane review found that for acute low back pain massage therapy was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> {{treatment}} for pain only in the short-term. There was no effect for improving function. For chronic low back pain massage therapy was no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> treatment for both pain and function, though only in the short-term. The overall quality of the evidence was low and the authors conclude that massage therapy is generally not an effective treatment for low back pain.|$|E

Many horses can still be successful in a less-strenuous career. Light exercise is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> exercise at all, and a change of career may prolong the horse's useful life.|$|E

25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't {{as much of a}} {{drawback}} as might be expected - and it is far <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{alcoholic}} hepatitis has a poor prognosis and is notoriously difficult to treat. Without any treatment, 20-50% of patients may die within a month, but evidence shows treatment may extend life beyond one month (i.e., reduce short-term mortality). Available treatment options include pentoxifylline (PTX), {{which is a}} nonspecific TNF inhibitor, corticosteroids, such as prednisone or prednisolone (CS), corticosteroids with N-acetylcysteine (CS with NAC), and corticosteroids with pentoxifylline (CS with PTX). Data suggest that CS alone or CS with NAC are most effective at reducing short-term mortality. Unfortunately, corticosteroids are contraindicated in some patients, such as those who have active gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, kidney failure, or pancreatitis. In these cases PTX may be considered {{on a case by}} case basis in lieu of CS; some evidence shows PTX is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> treatment at all and may be comparable to CS while other data show no evidence of benefit over placebo. Unfortunately, there are currently no drug treatments that decrease these patients’ risk of dying in the longer term, at 3–12 months and beyond.|$|E

Elbridge Gerry wrote the most popular Anti-Federalist tract, [...] "Hon. Mr. Gerry's Objections", which went through 46 printings; the essay particularly focused {{on the lack of}} a bill of rights in the proposed constitution. Many were concerned that a strong national government was a threat to individual rights and that the president would become a king. Jefferson wrote to Madison advocating a Bill of Rights: [...] "Half a loaf is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> bread. If we cannot secure all our rights, let us secure what we can."

500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} intended for a rock opera Townshend {{had been working}} on, Lifehouse, which was a multi-media exercise based on his followings of the Indian religious avatar Meher Baba, showing how spiritual enlightenment could be obtained via a combination of band and audience. The song was written {{for the end of}} the opera, after the main character, Bobby, is killed and the [...] "universal chord" [...] is sounded. The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other. Townshend described the song as one [...] "that screams defiance at those who feel any cause is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> cause". He later said that the song was not strictly anti-revolution despite the lyric [...] "We'll be fighting in the streets", but stressed that revolution could be unpredictable, adding, [...] "Don't expect to see what you expect to see. Expect nothing and you might gain everything." [...] Bassist John Entwistle later said that the song showed Townshend [...] "saying things that really mattered to him, and saying them for the first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|There was {{unrest and}} {{factional}} discord in Rome. In the Life of Pompey Plutarch {{wrote that the}} plebeian tribune Lucilius proposed to elect Pompey dictator. Cato opposed this. Lucilius came close to losing his tribunate. [...] Despite all this, two consuls {{for the next year}} (53 BC) were elected as usual. In 53 BC three candidates stood for the consulship for 52 BC. Besides resorting to bribery, they promoted factional violence, which Plutarch saw as a civil war. There were renewed and stronger calls for a dictator. However, in the Live of Cato, Plutarch did not mention any calls for a dictator and instead he wrote that there were calls for Pompey to preside over the elections. Cato opposed this. In both versions the violence between the three factions continued and the elections could not be held. The optimates favoured entrusting Pompey with restoring order. Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the former enemy of the triumvirate, proposed in the senate that Pompey should be elected as sole consul. Cato changed his mind and supported this on the ground that any government was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>no</b> government. Pompey asked him to become his adviser and associate in governance. Cato replied that he would do so in a private capacity.|$|E
