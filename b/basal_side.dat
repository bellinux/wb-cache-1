Methods: Using the combination of hollow fiber membrane (HFM) -based low-molecular weight protein enrichment and two-dimensional image converted analysis of liquid chromatography andmass spectrometry (2 DICAL),we compared the plasmaproteome of 22 colorectal cancer patientswith those of 21 healthy controls. An identified biomarker candidate was then validated in two larger cohorts [validation- 1 (n 210) and validation- 2 (n 113) ] using a high-density reverse-phase protein microarray. Results: Froma total of 53, 009 mass peaks,we identified 103 with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0. 80 or higher that could distinguish cancer patients from healthy controls. A peak that increased in colorectal cancer patients, with an AUC of 0. 81 and P value of 0. 0004 (Mann–WhitneyU test), was identified as a product of the PLIN 2 gene [also known as perilipin- 2, adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), or adipophilin]. An increase in plasma adipophilin was consistently observed in colorectal cancer patients, including those with stage I or stage II disease (P< 0. 0001,Welch’s t test). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that adipophilin is expressed primarily in the <b>basal</b> <b>sides</b> of colorectal cancer cells forming polarized tubular structures, and that it is absent from adjacent normal intestinal mucosae. Conclusions:Adipophilin is a plasmabiomarker potentially useful for the detection of early-stage colorectal cancer.

Gentamicin (400 µg/ml for 72 hr) did not alter cell viability, but significantly reduced cell growth and favored the formation of myeloid bodies.

Chloroquine (50 to 100 µm) and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl, 30 mM), two lysosomotropic amines known to stimulate the secretion of lysosomal enzymes in fibroblasts and macrophages, also stimulated secreted NAG in PKSV-PCT cells. However, the effect of chloroquine was less marked in PKSV-PCT cells than in cultured mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts.
