6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, uncle;" [...] and, {{instead of looking}} up into his face, she turned her eyes down on the green lawn <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You have torn my summer's work to flinders," [...] she said, sullenly, {{looking down}} at a bit of {{charcoal}} she was grinding into the rug <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Heh! Walk her round. Break, ah {{break it}} out o' that! [...] Break our {{starboard}} bower out, apeak, awash, and clear. [...] Port--port she casts, with the harbour-roil <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot,</b> [...] And that's the last o' bottom {{we shall see}} this year! ...|$|R
6000|$|Heh! Walk her round. Break, ah {{break it}} out o' that! [...] Break our starboard-bower out, apeak, awash, and clear. [...] Port -- port she casts, with the harbour-mud <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot,</b> [...] And that's the last o' bottom {{we shall see}} this year! [...] Well, ah fare you well, for we've got to take her out again -- [...] Take her out in ballast, riding light and cargo-free. [...] And it's time to clear and quit [...] When the hawser grips the bitt, [...] So we'll pay you with the foresheet and a promise from the sea! ...|$|R
6000|$|Arter {{that she}} treated {{me as if}} I was the dirt <b>beneath</b> <b>’er</b> <b>feet.</b> She never spoke to me, but used to speak against me to other people. She was always talking {{to them about the}} [...] "sleeping-sickness" [...] and things o’ that kind. She said night-watchmen always made ’er think of it somehow, but she didn’t know why, and she couldn’t tell you if you was to ask her. The only thing I was thankful for was that I wasn’t ’er husband. She stuck to ’im like his shadow, and I began to think at last it was a pity she ’adn’t got some thing to be jealous about and {{something}} to occupy her mind with instead o’ me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'All that was, {{seemed as}} if it had been not; [...] 385 And all the gazer's mind was strewn <b>beneath</b> <b>Her</b> <b>feet</b> like embers; and she, thought by thought, ...|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} the shadows of stately trees and the {{outlines}} of rolling hills; <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> was soft turf, but otherwise the subdued {{light of the moon}} disclosed nothing clearly.|$|E
60|$|She was, however, {{conscious}} {{that there was}} something <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> which forced her, if she was to sit comfortably, rather close against her companion; and it seemed expedient to point it out.|$|E
60|$|Next morning, {{when she}} got up, the lady placed a gold seal ring on her finger, strung a little golden box on a ribbon, and placed it round her neck; then she called the old man, and, forcing back her tears, took leave of Elsa. The girl tried to speak, {{but before she could}} sob out her thanks the old man had touched her softly on the head three times with his silver staff. In an instant Elsa knew that she was turning into a bird: wings sprang from <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> arms; <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> were the feet of eagles, with long claws; her nose curved itself into a sharp beak, and {{feathers}} covered her body. Then she soared high in the air, and floated up towards the clouds, as if she had really been hatched an eagle.|$|R
6000|$|After {{leaving the}} men, {{and with a}} {{knowledge}} that the remaining leagues of the trail were solitary, Norcross grew fearful. [...] "The fall of a horse, an accident to that brave girl, {{and we would be}} helpless," [...] he thought. [...] "I wish Nash had returned with us." [...] Once his blood chilled with horror as he watched his guide striking out across the marge of a grassy lake. This meadow, as he divined, was really a carpet of sod floating above a bottomless pool of muck, for it shook <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> horse's <b>feet.</b>|$|R
60|$|Some weeks {{had passed}} since Ingleby took over Tomlinson's claim, when one {{lowering}} evening Grace Coulthurst pulled up her cayuse pony {{in the depths of}} the Green River valley. Leaden cloud had veiled the peaks since early morning, and now the pines were wailing dolefully beneath a bitter breeze. A little dust of snow, fine and dry as flour, whirled about her, and the trail was hard as adamant <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> pony's <b>feet.</b> The beast pricked its ears and stamped impatiently, for it had been bred in the wilderness and knew what was coming.|$|R
6000|$|Peace charm'd {{the street}} <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> [...] And Honor charm'd the air; [...] And all astir looked kind on her, [...] And called her good as fair-- [...] For all God ever gave to her [...] She kept with chary care.|$|E
6000|$|And then {{my heart}} stood still, {{for he had}} slipped and was {{struggling}} in deep water <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> What a gaze {{was that he was}} turning up to her--not frightened, but so longing, so desperate; and hers how triumphant, and how happy! ...|$|E
60|$|The Pellago Tavern was a {{transformed}} dwelling house. The {{pillars of}} the porch were aslant, and the rain-warped boards snapped <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She hesitatingly opened the door. The hallway was dark and musty. A sound like a moan filtered down the unlighted stairs.|$|E
60|$|The {{road that}} he was {{following}} led across some public gardens beneath an avenue of trees, which, of course, {{at this time of}} the year, were leafless. This avenue was lighted here and there, and beneath one of the gas lamps Godfrey wheeled round to see Madame Riennes advancing on him out of the gloom. Her stout form padded forward noiselessly, except for the occasional crackle of a dead and frosted leaf <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> She wore a thick cloak of some sort with a black hood that framed her large, white face, making her look like a monk of the Inquisition as depicted in various old prints. Beneath the blackness of this hood and above the rigid line of the set mouth, stared two prominent and glowing eyes, in which the gaslight was reflected. They reminded Godfrey of those of a stalking cat in a dark room. Indeed, from the moment that he caught sight of them he felt like the mouse cowering in a corner, or like a bird in a tree fascinated by the snake that writhes towards it along the bough.|$|R
60|$|Ten or a dozen cotton {{petticoats}} {{are tied}} round that slim waist of hers, no {{two of a}} like colour, and as she twists and twirls in Andor's arms the petticoats fly out, till {{she looks like a}} huge flower of many hues with superposed corollas, blue, green, pink and yellow, <b>beneath</b> which <b>her</b> small <b>feet</b> shod in boots of brilliant leather look like two crimson stamens.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ending of}} Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew, {{particularly}} {{the question of}} whether Katharine is actually 'tamed' or not is frequently debated. Garrick's play provides a narrower interpretation than Shakespeare's ambiguous ending. There is no wager. Instead, Catharine makes her speech to Bianca, though without the offer to put <b>her</b> hand <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>foot.</b> <b>Her</b> reasons for women's subordination, namely that their [...] "soft and weak and smooth" [...] bodies are unsuited for life outside the home, are omitted, as are her assertions that [...] "my mind hath been as big as one of yours, / My heart as great, my reason haply more, / To bandy word for word and frown for frown; but now I see our lances are but straws/ Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare" [...] (V.II.174-178).|$|R
60|$|Betty had {{a feeling}} that the ground was being cut from <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> She had {{expected}} to have to explain who she was and why she had come, and behold, both were unnecessary. It was uncanny. And then the obvious explanation occurred to her.|$|E
60|$|The princess rode {{up without}} seeing {{anything}} to frighten her, when a sudden {{puff of smoke}} and flame from <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> caused her to look down, {{and there was the}} horrible creature twisted and writhing, its twelve heads reared up as if to seize her between them.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes the saucy leaves would {{kiss her}} cheeks, [...] And he must kiss their wanton kiss away; [...] To die <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> the wood-flower seeks, [...] The quivering aspen feels a fine dismay, [...] And many a scented blossom on the spray [...] In odorous sighs its passionate longing speaks.|$|E
60|$|She wandered {{back to her}} rock-pools; {{they were}} bright and docile; they did not fling her about {{in a game of}} terror. She bent over {{watching}} the anemone's fleshy petals shrink from the touch of her shadow, and she laughed to think they should be so needlessly fearful. The flowing tide trickled noiselessly among the rocks, widening and deepening insidiously her little pools. Helena retreated towards a large cave round the bend. There the water gurgled under the bladder-wrack of the large stones; the air was cool and clammy. She pursued her way into the gloom, bending, though there was no need, shivering at the coarse feel of the seaweed <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> naked <b>feet.</b> The water came rustling up beneath the fucus as she crept along on the big stones; it returned with a quiet gurgle which made her shudder, though even that was not disagreeable. It needed, for all that, more courage than was easy to summon before she could step off her stone into the black pool that confronted her. It was festooned thick with weeds that slid under <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> like snakes. She scrambled hastily upwards towards the outlet.|$|R
5000|$|... 1888, a {{monument}} honoring Attucks {{and the other}} victims of the Boston Massacre was erected on Boston Common. It is over 25 feet high and about 10 feet wide. The [...] "bas-relief" [...] (raised portion {{on the face of}} the main part of the monument) portrays the Boston Massacre, with Attucks lying in the foreground. Under the scene is the date, March 5, 1770. Above the bas-relief stands a female figure, Free America, holding the broken chain of oppression in <b>her</b> right hand. <b>Beneath</b> <b>her</b> right <b>foot,</b> she crushes the royal crown of England. At the left of the figure, is an eagle. Thirteen stars are cut into one of the faces of the monument. Beneath these stars in raised letters are the names of the five men who were killed that day: Crispus Attucks, Samuel Gray, James Caldwell, Samuel Maverick, and Patrick Carr. Some men died a day later.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{travelling}} we {{had arranged}} for her a sidesaddle {{very much like a}} chair, with a board swung <b>beneath</b> to rest <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> on. And the first day she rode without uttering a word, and hardly for one moment turning her eyes away from the little girl, whom she held on her knees. At our first camp I saw her during the night walking about, rocking the child in her arms and gazing down at it {{by the light of the}} moon. After we had started on our second day's march she asked me how soon we should come to the first village of the inhabited country.|$|R
60|$|She {{started to}} her feet, but the unwonted strain upon her nerves and frail {{body had been}} greater than she knew. She made a step forward, felt the room whirl round her and then seem to {{collapse}} <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> and, clutching at her chair, sank back into it, fainting.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{came down}} the hill like a runaway steam-engine. It was tremendously exciting, this blind rush through the dark; she felt she would never stop. But the ground grew level <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> her speed insensibly slackened, and {{suddenly}} she was caught by an extended arm and brought to an abrupt halt.|$|E
6000|$|... 252. I spoke {{just now}} {{only of the}} ill-shaped body of this figure of Fortune, or Pleasure. <b>Beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> is an {{elaborate}} landscape. It is all drawn out of Dürer's head;--he would look at bones or tendons carefully, or at the leaf details of foreground;--but at the breadth and loveliness of real landscape, never.|$|E
60|$|She {{glanced at}} herself, and now, {{for the first}} time, he noticed that she wore a dress <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> red cloak, {{and that there were}} {{slippers}} on <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> which had been bare.|$|R
50|$|I {{met her at}} the Mallow FairWhere lovers {{sport and}} play.I watched <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> move lightlyWhile the piper droned away;She san a song so lilting there,Her hands <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> shawl.Now Kitty Bawn O'Brien's gone to far off Montreal.|$|R
60|$|Now she {{was within}} ten {{feet of the}} two unsuspecting little playfellows--carefully she drew <b>her</b> hind <b>feet</b> well up <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> body, the great muscles rolling under the {{beautiful}} skin.|$|R
60|$|And Death laughed, {{and took}} up a black stone, and threw it into the forest, {{and out of a}} thicket of wild hemlock came Fever in a robe of flame. She passed through the multitude, and touched them, and each man that she touched died. The grass {{withered}} <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> as she walked.|$|E
60|$|After {{wandering}} {{here and}} there for a time without result she had started {{to return to the}} entrance of this labyrinth when her ears for the first time caught a sound--a peculiar grinding, thumping sound that came from <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> seemingly, and was of so unusual a character that she was puzzled to explain its cause.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I dust to be trampled <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> <b>feet?</b> Am I a {{dog that}} she can't throw me a word?" [...] Her arms were {{stretched}} out, and she was making this inquiry as to her own canine qualities as I re-entered the room, and remembered that Ethel had never once addressed a single word to Mrs. Mackenzie {{in the course of}} her visit.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{full-length}} bronze female figures, {{one on each}} side, flank the pedestal's base. Each {{figure is}} seated and wears classical robes. [...] "Justice", the figure on the proper left, has long, braided hair. Her proper left arm is raised to shoulder height; she holds a sword in her proper right hand. The figure of [...] "History", on the proper right, holds a tablet on her lap with her proper left hand and a writing tool in her proper right hand. Her hair is knotted {{at the back of}} her head. A book rests <b>beneath</b> <b>her</b> proper right <b>foot.</b> The allegorical figures would be approximately [...] tall, if standing. The pedestal rests on a three-stepped platform. It is executed in Baveno granite from quarries at Lake Maggiore, Italy, and was chosen for its structural excellence and color. The granite used in the monument was the first of its kind to be imported into the United States.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never while I live!' {{answered}} the princess, and, {{not knowing where}} it would be safest, placed it under <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> In an instant she felt herself rising from the ground, with the fan always <b>beneath</b> <b>her,</b> and while Grimace was too much blinded by her fury to notice what was going on the princess was quickly soaring out of her reach.|$|R
60|$|Oak {{looked up}} at her. She had not spoken since he left the barn. The soft and continual shimmer of the dying {{lightning}} showed a marble face high against the black sky of the opposite quarter. Bathsheba was sitting almost on {{the apex of the}} stack, <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> gathered up <b>beneath</b> <b>her,</b> and resting on the top round of the ladder.|$|R
