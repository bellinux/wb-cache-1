The research work is part of NEES small group project entitled "International Hybrid Simulation of Tomorrow's <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames.</b> " In the experimental phase, {{a total of four}} full-scale, one-bay, two-story conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens with different bracing member section shapes and gusset plate-to-beam connection details were designed and tested at the NEES@Berkeley Laboratory. Three <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimens were tested quasi-statically using the same predefined loading protocol to investigate the inelastic cyclic behavior of code-compliant <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> at both the global and local level. The last <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen was nearly identical to one of those tested quasi-statically. However, it was tested using hybrid simulation techniques to examine the sensitivity of inelastic behavior on loading sequence and to relate the behavior observed to different levels of seismic hazard. Computer models of the test specimens were developed using two different computer software programs. In the software framework OpenSees fiber-based line elements were used to simulate global buckling of members and yielding and low-cycle fatigue failure at sections. The LS-DYNA analysis program was also used to model individual struts and the test specimens using shell elements with adaptive meshing and element erosion features. This program provided enhanced ability to simulate section local buckling, strain concentrations and crack development. The numerical results were compared with test results to assess and refine and the ability of the models to predict <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior. A series of OpenSees numerical cyclic component simulations were then conducted using the validated modeling approach. Two hundred and forty pin-ended struts with square hollow structural section shape were simulated under cyclic loading to examine the effect of width-to-thickness ratios and member slenderness ratios on the deformation capacity and energy dissipation characteristics of brace members. The concept of a hybrid system, consisting of a vertical elastic truss or strong-back, and a <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> that responds inelastically, is proposed herein to mitigate the tendency of weak-story mechanisms to form in conventional steel <b>braced</b> <b>frames.</b> A simple design strategy about member sizing of the proposed Strong-Back System is provided in this study. To assess the ability of the new Strong-Back System to perform well under seismic loading, a series of inelastic analyses were performed considering three six-story hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>bracing</b> elements, and three six-story conventional <b>brace</b> <b>frames</b> having different <b>brace</b> configurations. Monotonic and cyclic quasi-static inelastic analyses and inelastic time history analyses were carried out. The <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> system behavior, <b>bracing</b> member force-displacement hysteresis loops, and system residual drifts were the primary response quantities examined. These indicated that the new hybrid system was able to achieve its design goals. Experimental results show for the same loading history that the <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> specimen using round hollow structural sections as brace members has the largest deformation capacity among the three types of bracing elements studied. Beams connected to gusset plates at the column formed plastic hinges adjacent to the gusset plate. The gusset plates tend to amplify the rotation demands at these locations and stress concentrations tended to result in early fractures of the plastic hinges that form. To remedy this problem, pinned connection details used in the last two specimens; these proved to prevent failures at these locations under both quasi-static and pseudo-dynamic tests. Failure modes observed near the column to base plate connections in all of the specimens suggest the need for further study. Both OpenSees and LS-DYNA models developed in this study predict the global <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> behavior with acceptable accuracy. In both models, low-cycle fatigue damage models were needed to achieve an acceptable level of fidelity. Shell element models were able to predict local behavior and the mode of failures with greater but not perfect confidence. OpenSees analysis results show that the proposed hybrid <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> would perform better than conventional <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> and that the story deformations are more uniform.

In this study, in order to evaluate behaviors of "Concentrically Steel Braced Frames" types defined in TEC- 2007 under lateral loads, dimensional analysis of Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> designed with different scales and dimensions was conducted, the results were controlled according to TEC- 2007, and after conducting static pushover analysis, behavior and load capacity of the Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> and hinges sequence of the elements constituting the Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> were tested. Concentrically Steel <b>Braced</b> <b>Frames</b> that were tested analytically consist of 2 storey and one bay, and are formed as two groups with the scales 1 / 2 and 1 / 3.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{challenge for}} the structural engineer in designing earthquake-resistant structures is to design buildings with both adequate ductility and sufficient stiffness. Traditional lateral force resisting systems such as the moment resisting frame and the concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> are both conventional structural schemes that have been implemented for many years, but result in only mediocre performance levels. The lacking stiffness of a moment resisting frame {{as well as the}} limited ductility of a concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> gave impetus for engineers to direct significant research efforts into the development of new lateral resisting systems that embody a more stable hysteretic behavior, adequate ductility, control of damage, and energy dissipating capacity. Fortunately, several recent developments have allowed engineers to move one step closer to designing more efficient earthquake-resistant structures. "High-performance braces," as this thesis calls them, are new and improved bracing systems that combine the economy and stiffness of a concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frame</b> with the ductility and energy dissipating capacity of a moment resisting frame. This thesis analyzes and evaluates three different types of high-performance braces: (i) the buckling-restrained <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> (ii) the self-centering energy dissipating <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> and (iii) the hybrid <b>brace</b> <b>frame,</b> with regards to their structural performance and economy. The primary goal of the thesis is to provide useful insights into the current developments of high-performance braces for practicing engineers in the hope that such systems can be more widely adopted and utilized in the contemporary design of earthquake-resistant structures.

In the past few decades, research on CBFs has primarily focused on improving seismic detailing requirements for new construction. <b>Braced</b> <b>frames</b> designed prior to 1988, termed non-seismic concentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> (NCBFs), had much less stringent design requirements the consequences of which include high variability in the beam-to-connection detail, an inability to develop the yield capacity of the brace, and unknown controlling failure modes. Evaluation and retrofit of existing NCBF systems can be challenging in part {{due to the lack of}} experimental research evaluating the variety of connection details and deficiencies present in existing NCBF infrastructure. As part of a large NSF supported effort to provide guidance on the seismic evaluation and retrofit of NCBFs, five NCBF frames focusing on bolted beam-to-column connections were designed and tested at the University of Washington Structural Research Laboratory. The results are compared to the results of nine previous NCBF tests using measured response parameters and observed performance. It was found that the brace type along with the continuity, flexibility, and deficiencies of the connection could dramatically impact the deformation capacity, failure mode, and yielding hierarchy observed in an NCBF.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Braced</b> <b>frames</b> {{are often}} used to resist lateral {{earthquake}} loads in steel buildings, but braces can interfere with architectural features. Eccentrically <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> (EBFs) will accommodate windows, doors, and halls, but have performance limitations when link-to-column connections are required. An alternative to EBFs may be buckling-restrained <b>braced</b> <b>frames</b> with eccentric configurations (BRBF-Es). This paper introduces the concept of BRBF-Es and highlights design considerations. An analytical study was conducted that compares the performance and economy of BRBF-Es with EBFs. Results from non-linear time history analyses indicate that BRBF-Es will have greater residual drifts than comparable EBFs, but are less susceptible to failures at link-to-column connections. BRBF-Es require more steel than EBFs, but savings in design, fabrication, and erection may offset higher material costs. DOI: 10. 1061 /(ASCE) ST. 1943 - 541...|$|R
