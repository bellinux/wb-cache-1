40|$|Boundary shape {{optimization}} is {{a technique}} to search for an optimal shape by modifying the boundary of a device with a pre-specified topology. We consider boundary shape optimization of acoustic horns in loudspeakers and brass wind instruments. A horn is an interfacial device, situated between a source, such as a waveguide or a transducer, and surrounding space. Horns are used to control both the transmission properties from the source and the spatial power distribution in the far-field (directivity patterns). Transmission and directivity properties of a horn {{are sensitive to the}} shape of the horn flare. By changing the horn flare we design transmission efficient horns. However, it is difficult to achieve both controllability of directivity patterns and high transmission efficiency by using only changes in the horn flare. Therefore we use simultaneous shape and so-called topology optimization to design a horn/acoustic-lens combination to achieve high transmission efficiency and even directivity. We also design transmission efficient interfacial devices without imposing an upper constraint on the mouth diameter. The results demonstrate that {{there appears to be a}} natural limit on the optimal mouth diameter. We optimize <b>brass-wind</b> <b>instruments</b> with respect to its intonation properties.
