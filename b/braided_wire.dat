2500|$|The {{earliest}} cemeteries of {{the second}} phase of the [...] "Bijelo Brdo culture" [...] yielded coins minted during the reign of Stephen I. Thereafter only coins struck for Hungarian monarchs were deposited in 11th-century graves. The growing number of graves with deposited coins coincided with the gradual disappearance of featuring items of the [...] "steppe burial horizon". Some [...] "Bijelo Brdo" [...] cemeteries did not yield any [...] "steppe" [...] artefacts; instead, twisted or <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> rings and other artefacts copying Byzantine style were put into the graves. Around 1100, a new burial horizon appeared in the Banat Mountains and along the Danube, with graves arranged in rows, yielding artefacts imported from the Byzantine Empire or inspired by Byzantine style. Lock rings with S-shaped ends and other featuring [...] "Bijelo Brdo" [...] artefacts were also found in the same cemeteries. The deceased were buried with folded arms; their graves contained no weapons or food offerings. This [...] "second South Danubian horizon" [...] may represent either the development of a new fashion (influenced by contemporaneous Byzantine style), or the arrival of a new population.|$|E

50|$|A <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> is {{composed}} {{of a number of}} small strands of wire braided together. Similar to stranded wires, braided wires are better conductors than solid wires. Braided wires do not break easily when flexed. Braided wires are often suitable as an electromagnetic shield in noise-reduction cables.|$|E

40|$|New {{implants}} for vascular therapy like flow diverters {{are made}} of tiny <b>braided</b> <b>wires.</b> The radio opacity of these wires is poor, which makes assessment of implant expansion and exact positioning difficult. Additional markers only allow the estimation of the current device position, but they also induce artefacts that impair the assessment during the intervention and in follow-up examination. A new strategy to increase implant visibility is the <b>braiding</b> of composite <b>wires</b> with a radiopaque core along the whole implant. This paper shows some useful combinations of these new wires on a phantom study with five vascular implants...|$|R

The crest of the bird consists of the typical Zenú semi-filigree. Regular filigree is <b>braided</b> <b>wire,</b> but the Zenú cast theirs.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} damage to the thin tethers from micrometeoroids, the tethers would be formed from multiple strands, 25-50 micrometers in diameter, welded together at regular intervals. Thus, even if one wire was severed, a conducting path along {{the full length of}} the <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> would remain in place. The feasibility of using ultrasonic welding was demonstrated at the University of Helsinki in January 2013.|$|E
5000|$|RG-58/U {{is a type}} of {{coaxial cable}} often used for {{low-power}} signal and RF connections. The cable has a characteristic impedance of either 50 or 52 Ω. [...] "RG" [...] was originally a unit indicator for bulk RF cable in the U.S. military's Joint Electronics Type Designation System. There are several versions covering the differences in core material (solid or <b>braided</b> <b>wire)</b> and shield (70% to 95% coverage).|$|E
50|$|In the end, Theodor Kläs, who {{was born}} in Neroth in 1802, showed his fellow villagers a way out of neediness. He had travelled, and on his many {{journeys}} he had learnt to work in wire and wooden wares. He taught people to <b>braid</b> <b>wire,</b> and they began making, for the most part, mousetraps and rat traps, which pedlars from Neroth sold everywhere. This {{was the beginning of a}} wireworking industry that persisted into the years following the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|At {{the authors}} 2 ̆ 7 institution, needle {{localization}} of breast lesions with a <b>braided</b> hook <b>wire</b> involves the wire being cut 1 - 2 cm {{from the point}} of entry before dissection, to avoid contamination of the sterile field with the nonsterile portion of wire. During dissection, the wire is brought through the skin into the area of dissection. In one patient, fragments of wire filaments were left within the breast. <b>Braided</b> hook <b>wires</b> must be cut cleanly, the cut surface should be wiped before dissection, and the surgical area should be cleansed before closure...|$|R
50|$|Pneumatic {{artificial}} muscles (PAMs) operate {{by filling}} a pneumatic bladder with pressurized air. Upon applying gas {{pressure to the}} bladder, isotropic volume expansion occurs, but is confined by <b>braided</b> <b>wires</b> that encircle the bladder, translating the volume expansion to a linear contraction along the axis of the actuator. PAMs can be classified by their operation and design; namely, PAMs feature pneumatic or hydraulic operation, overpressure or underpressure operation, braided/netted or embedded membranes and stretching membranes or rearranging membranes. Among {{the most commonly used}} PAMs today is a cylindrically braided muscle known as the McKibben Muscle, which was first developed by J. L. McKibben in the 1950s.|$|R

50|$|Tightwire-walkers {{typically}} {{perform in}} very thin and flexible, leather-soled slippers {{with a full}} length suede or leather sole to protect the feet from abrasions and bruises while still allowing the foot to curve around the wire. Though very infrequent in performance, amateur, hobbyist, or inexperienced funambulists will often walk barefoot so that the wire can be grasped between the big and second toe. This is more often done when using a rope, as the softer and silkier fibres are less taxing on the bare foot than the harder and more abrasive <b>braided</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|A type {{of cable}} called litz wire (from the German Litzendraht, <b>braided</b> <b>wire)</b> {{is used to}} {{mitigate}} the skin effect for frequencies of a few kilohertz to about one megahertz. It consists {{of a number of}} insulated wire strands woven together in a carefully designed pattern, so that the overall magnetic field acts equally on all the wires and causes the total current to be distributed equally among them. With the skin effect having little effect on each of the thin strands, the bundle does not suffer the same increase in AC resistance that a solid conductor of the same cross-sectional area would due to the skin effect.|$|E
50|$|If {{the board}} is to be {{manually}} routed, needed for unusual routing instructions, twisted pairs and four-wire magnetic <b>braids,</b> the <b>wire</b> sizes are reworked into standard sizes. This permits an assembly technician to pick wires from bins of standard-length prestripped wire.|$|R
30|$|Fixed mandibular {{retainers}} {{were first}} introduced in 1970 s [14] {{and serve as}} a vital component of orthodontic treatment. The first generation of retainers consisted of a large diameter stainless steel round wire bonded only to the lingual side of the canines [15]. Later on, Zachrisson introduced the use of coaxial or <b>braided</b> <b>wires</b> in small diameter bonded to all mandibular anterior teeth [16],[17], and most recently, fiber-reinforced composites found their way into orthodontics [18]. One of the main advantages of fiber-reinforced resin composites is their biocompatibility which is of great importance, especially in patients who are allergic to nickel component of stainless steel wires [19]. Another advantage is the esthetics, since no metal wire is present in the structure of fiber-reinforced composites [20]. In addition, it has been claimed that these retainers create a rigid splint which might contribute to a limited physiological tooth movement [21]–[23]. Furthermore, unless a precise fit is provided between the wire and lingual surfaces of the mandibular anterior teeth, a slight relapse in incisor irregularity might be expected [15].|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. Mat. S. E. thesis. January 2016. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisor: Russell Holmes. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); iii, 29 pages. Driveshafts used in atherectomy medical devices are often comprised of coiled or <b>braided</b> metal <b>wires.</b> These constructions {{are designed to}} tolerate delivery through tortuous vessels and can endure high speed rotation used during activation of the atherectomy treatment. This research investigated polymer driveshaft designs, which were comprised of polymer inner and outer layers, and coiled or <b>braided</b> stainless steel <b>wires.</b> The polymer driveshaft materials included polyimide, nylon 12, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Mechanical testing of polymer driveshafts was conducted to determine material response in bending, tension, compression, and torsion. The polymer driveshaft test results were then compared with current coiled metal wire driveshaft constructions. The investigation identified polymer driveshaft options that could feasibly work in an atherectomy application...|$|R
50|$|Since {{this style}} of dagger was usually made en suite with a cup-hilted rapier, the {{decoration}} of the knuckleguard tended to reflect that of the cup of the rapier. The edges of the guard are usually turned over toward the outside, possibly to trap {{the point of the}} opponent's blade and prevent it from slipping into the defender's hand. The quillons are normally cylindrical with knobbed tips, and in many instances are decorated with spiral fluting. The pommel is normally decorated to match the quillons and made to resemble the pommel of its matching rapier, while the grip is usually made of wood and wrapped with twisted and <b>braided</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Shielded housings. A {{conductive}} {{metal housing}} {{will act as}} an interference shield. In order to access the components, such a housing is typically made in sections (such as a box and lid); an RF gasket may be used at the joints {{to reduce the amount}} of interference that leaks through the joint. RF gaskets come in various types. A plain metal gasket may be either <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> or a flat strip slotted to create many springy [...] "fingers". Where a waterproof seal is required, a flexible elastomeric base may be impregnated with chopped metal fibers dispersed into the interior or long metal fibers covering the surface or both.|$|E

50|$|Lear Radio Laboratories was {{the source}} of an early step to {{miniaturization}} in electronics. Tuning coils in the radio frequency stage of a set were rather large and Lear knew how to reduce their size by using Litz <b>wire.</b> <b>Wire</b> <b>braided</b> from many fine strands has a large surface area giving it high conductivity at radio frequency. Lear borrowed $5,000 from his friend Algot Olson to make machines to wrap the strands, <b>braid</b> the <b>wire,</b> and wind the coils. The industry was set up in the basement of his mother’s old house on 65th street, and done with assistance of Don Mitchell, a railroad electrician. Lear called the company Radio Coil and Wire Corporation. They took an order of 50,000 coils from Eugene F. McDonald of Zenith Electronics when they demonstrated them. These small coils were one-quarter the size of coils with solid wire.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{conventional}} coaxial cables use <b>braided</b> copper <b>wire</b> {{forming the}} shield. This allows the cable to be flexible, {{but it also}} means there are gaps in the shield layer, and the inner dimension of the shield varies slightly because the braid cannot be flat. Sometimes the braid is silver-plated. For better shield performance, some cables have a double-layer shield. The shield might be just two braids, but it is more common now to have a thin foil shield covered by a <b>wire</b> <b>braid.</b> Some cables may invest in more than two shield layers, such as [...] "quad-shield", which uses four alternating layers of foil and braid. Other shield designs sacrifice flexibility for better performance; some shields are a solid metal tube. Those cables cannot be bent sharply, as the shield will kink, causing losses in the cable. When a foil shield is used a small wire conductor incorporated into the foil makes soldering the shield termination easier.|$|R

5000|$|... "First {{introduced}} by Akali Naina Singh Nihang, this {{example of the}} towering turban bristles with miniature blades {{and a series of}} war quoits made from brightly polished, razor-sharp steel. The totemic gajgah bound at the front is secured with braided steel wire (tora) and the blue turban cloth; this is meant to cover the stem, leaving only the topmost double-edged dagger or bhagauti and multiple crescents visible. Literally 'grappler of elephants', the gajgah is thought to have been worn in ancient times as an emblem of distinction by powerful warriors, like Bhim of the epic Mahabharat fame, who were capable of single-handedly defeating war elephants. The gajgah is also intimately connected with Shiv's trident, an instrument of both destruction and grace. Its series of crescents climb towards the mountain like peak out of which emerges the flag (farla), representing the Khalsa's battle standard. To achieve this effect, an under-turban (keski) was twisted around the long hair and carefully wound to give the peaked appearance with the end forming the farla. To provide thickness and support at the base a second turban was tied. Quoits and <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> secured everything in place.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} model of anti-twist <b>braided</b> <b>wire</b> rope structure {{is the basis}} for studying the mechanical problems of wire rope. According to the forming principle of anti-twist wire rope, the structure and dimensional characteristics of wire rope are analyzed.

40|$|In I 894 Leonard Gigli {{described}} a simple device for cutting bones. The instru-ment {{consisted of a}} single steel wire, the surface {{of which had been}} roughened, and two handles which were attached {{to the ends of the}} wire allowing to-and-fro move-ments. Since that time, the apparatus has been modified, using <b>braided</b> <b>wires</b> with corrugations and has become known as the Gigli saw. Because of its simplicity and reliability, the Gigli saw has become very popular as a bone-cutting instrument. The main difficulty in its use is in passing the device around the bone which is to be cut. At least two instruments have been designed to help effect this passage 2, 3 We have modified a stethoscope earpiece in such a way as to make a very suit-able guide for passage of the Gigli saw (Fig. 1). A transverse bar is welded onto the end of the single earpiece of the stethoscope to allow control of the apparatus. A semisharp trocar is machined to screw on the tip of the earpiece to allow passage through soft tissue. After passage is accomplished, the trocar is removed. The Gigli saw is then inserted through the guide, and the guide is removed. This permits divi-sion of the bone from within outwards under full control.
