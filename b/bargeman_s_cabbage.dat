40|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{have been designed}} to address food insecurity problems in the U. S., particularly promoting increased consumption of vegetables. However, if the demand for vegetables increases, little is known regarding the impacts of increased demand on the structure of vegetable supply chain. A related relevant question is: if the current supply cannot meet the increase in demand, what are the optimal locations and seasons to expand vegetable production? To address these questions, we develop a transshipment model of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>cabbage</b> sector {{to assess the impact of}} closing the gap between current and recommended vegetable intake in the Northeastern region on supply chain structure and costs. We find that the current supply can only meet 40 % of increased demand in the Northeastern U. S. In addition, our model suggests that expanding cabbage production to close the intake gap of cabbage consumption leads to de-localization of the supply chain. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R

Outer green leaves of York cabbage were extracted with 60 % methanol, ethanol or acetone. Antibacterial activities of vacuum dried crude extracts were estimated against a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative food spoilage and food pathogenic bacteria. The crude extracts showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activities but 60 % methanol extract exhibited the highest antibacterial effect. Complete growth inhibition for Listeria monocyto-genes was achieved with an extract concentration of 1. 4 %, whereas a two-fold concentration was required to achieve a reduction of 75 % and 64 % for Salmonella abony and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. For Enterococcus faecalis methanolic extract showed a weak inhibition only (31 %). The lower concentrations of methanolic extract from York cabbage prolonged the lag phase and reduced both the exponential growth rate and final population densities of the culture.

40|$|Production and {{processing}} of head cabbage {{has a significant}} economic importance for New York State agriculture. New York produces about one-fourth of the total U. <b>S.</b> head <b>cabbage</b> output, with 79 percent destined to the fresh market. In the U. S., New York {{is the number one}} producer of fresh head cabbage (with a market share of 22 percent) and is number two, after Wisconsin, in the production of sauerkraut, with a market share of 39 percent (Lucier and Lin, 2002). During the past decade (1991 to 2001), production of fresh head cabbage and sauerkraut in New York State increased 61 percent and 23 percent, respectively. During the same period, per capita consumption of fresh cabbage increased from 8. 2 pounds to 8. 8 pounds (an increase of 7. 3 percent), while consumption of sauerkraut stayed stable at around 1. 3 pounds (a decrease of between 2. 2 to 2. 3 pounds from the 1960 s to? 70 s levels (USDA, 2004). The consumption trends of fresh head cabbage and sauerkraut clearly reflect today?s consumers? food preferences, which are strongly determined by an increasing desire and interest in both fresher and more complex and exciting food products. The incorporation of fresh cabbage to bagged salads is thought to be a major contributing factor to the observed increase in consumption of fresh head cabbage.

S. market is not that different from the sauerkraut made a hundred years ago and is appreciated mostly by older consumers and little by younger consumers...|$|R
40|$|Aerated compost teas (ACTs) are organic {{products}} obtained by forced aeration of composts suspended in liquid phase. These products may be biological control tools alternative to synthetic fungicides, because ACTs contain antagonistic microorganisms. In this study, soilborne disease suppressive ability of seven water ACTs, extracted from five horticultural residue-based composts, from an animal waste anaerobic solid digestate {{and from a}} commercial municipal waste compost, was assessed using in vitro and in vivo systems. All the ACTs inhibited in vitro growth of Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia minor, Sclerotium rolfsii and Botrytis cinerea. Filter or thermal sterilization eliminated in vitro suppression, suggesting that microorganisms play key roles in pathogen inhibition. Drenching applications of raw ACTs have potential to reduced disease symptoms caused by R. solani on savoy <b>cabbage,</b> <b>S.</b> minor on lettuce and S. rolfsii on pepper, improved the biomass production and did not show any sign of phytotoxicity.

40|$|A {{systematic}} survey {{to explore the}} natural occurrence of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) was done in Nepal. In 276 soil samples collected, 29 (10. 50 %) were positive for EPN. Based on their morphology, morphometrics and molecular features seven isolates were identified as Heterorhabditis indica. Among the 22 steinernematids, seven isolates were identified as one of four described species (Steinernema abbasi, S. cholashanense, S. feltiae and S. siamkayai); 15 isolates were grouped in five different undescribed species. Steinernema sp. A {{is a member of}} the ‘glaseri’ clade. Infective juveniles (IJ) of this species have an average length of 832 (690 - 950) µm and following lateral field pattern: 2, 6, 7, 8, 3, 2. Steinernema sp. B and Steinernema sp. C are the members of the ‘carpocapsae’ clade. The IJ of these species have a body length of 479 (424 - 513) µm and 415 (393 - 450) µm, respectively.

Insect mortality from the nematode species and isolates was modulated by temperature. Maximum mortality (100 %) was recorded for A. rapae L 2 from S. riobrave at 30 °C, 95. 8 % from S. feltiae, and 91. 7 % from S. feltiae 27 at 25 °C and 75. 7 % from S. carpocapsae at 30 °C. Mortality of A. rapae L 2 increased with contact time to nematode. Mortality of 76 % and 78 % was achieved for S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae, respectively, after 12 -hour exposure. Susceptibility of A. rapae, P. xylostella, and T. ni larvae to entomopathogenic nematodes increased with larval age development. The addition of adjuvants - Corn Oil (0. 9 %, 1. 8 %, 3. 6 %), Leafshield (3. 0 %, 6. 0 %, 12. 0 %), Seaweed (0. 1 %) and Agral (0. 05 %) - significantly increased the density and survival rate of <b>S.</b> carpocapsae on <b>cabbage</b> leaves compared to water only.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{toxicity}} of seven of Allylisothiocyanate (AITC) formulations, AITC pure and in mixture with cypermethrin and chlorpyrifos, was evaluated using spray application and fumigation method against the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), the small cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae (L.) and the tobacco cut worm, Spodoptera litura Fabr. Approach: Response varied according to insect species, specific formulation and AITC application rates. Results: Fumigant {{toxicity of}} the oil based on 9 h exposure was evaluated against the three insect larvae, the diamond back moth, P. xylostella larvae were more susceptible followed by tobacco cut worm, <b>S.</b> litura and <b>cabbage</b> white, P. rapae larvae. To P. xylostella larvae, LC 50 value was 1. 5 µL L - 1 air, S. litura larvae (LC 50, 1. 8 µL L - 1 air) and P. rapae larvae (LC 50, 2. 0 µL L - 1 air). These three insect larvae were killed after 9 h exposure to a dose of 4. 3 µL L - 1 air {{of the oil}}, showed no significance difference with that of phosphine (40 µg L - 1 air) a recommended dose. On the other hand, on the spray application bioassays, mortality data counted 72 h after treatment, the P. rapae larvae were most susceptible to AITC formulations followed by S. litura larvae and P. xylostella larvae. LC 50 values, to P. xylostella larvae, HJ(A) and HJ(B) were the most potent toxicant (33 mg L - 1) and (46 mg L - 1) respectively, while the least toxic was HJ(C) (556 mg L - 1). To S. litura larvae, HJ(B) and HJ(A) were the most efficient (10 mg L - 1) and (22 mg L - 1) respectively, while HJ(D) (LC 50, 385 mg L - 1) {{was found to be}} the least toxic. The both of HJ (B) and HJ (C) had similar insecticidal activity (LC 50, 8 mg L - 1) to Pieris rapae larvae followed by HD (B) (LC 50, 22 mg L - 1) and HD (A) (LC 50, 82 mg L - 1). Conclusion/Recommendations: It was concluded that the AITC oil showed promise findings and may be a good alternative to old fumigant phosphine.

40|$|Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium are {{important}} enteric food-borne pathogens {{that are known}} to inhabit the gastrointestinal tract of ruminant animals. Decline in soil fertility and exorbitant costs of mineral fertilisers have stimulated the utilization of cattle manure as a fertiliser in fresh vegetable production by small-holder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. In most cases farmers apply the manure directly into the soil without pre-treatment {{in order to save}} time and avoid costs associated with composting. This practice, coupled with inadvertent entry and deposition of faecal matter in crop field by communally grazing cattle can potentially lead to pre-harvest contamination of vegetables with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium. The design of cost-effective strategies to enable safe use of cattle manure in fresh vegetable production under small-holder agricultural system in Sub-Saharan Africa is currently constrained by lack of sufficient knowledge on the behaviour of manure-borne pathogenic organisms in manure-amended soil and in the soil-plant ecosystem under tropical field conditions. The general objective of this thesis was to establish the fate of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium in manure and manure-amended soil and to evaluate the risk of vegetable contamination with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium when cultivated on soils amended with untreated bovine manure under tropical climatic conditions. This was achieved through a series of experiments performed in the laboratory and under field conditions in the Central Agro-Ecological Zone of Uganda (CAEZ) using cabbage as a model crop. A culture-based method to monitor CFU number of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium in a complex microbial community in agricultural fields was developed and validated. The method is based on the use of spontaneous mutants to rifampicin of non-pathogenic variants of E. coli O 157 :H 7 (ATCC 43888) and S. Typhimurium (LT 2) combined with CFU counting on selective media containing rifampicin. Validation experiments using gfp and ds-red labelled derivatives of the rifampicin-resistant mutants (Rifr) in a non-sterile manure-amended soil matrix demonstrated that the culture method was effective in the selection and recovery of the test strains without any detectable interference from background contaminants both in the short and in the long term. This culture-based detection method was used in subsequent experiments. The effect of moisture condition and inoculum density on survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr in manure and manure-amended soil was investigated by means of pot experiments in the screen house and in the field. Inoculum levels of 4 and 7 log CFU/g were challenged at two moisture conditions: (i) periodic addition of water to maintain the matrices at high moisture level (above 80 % RH), and (ii) matrices left to field or screen house conditions. Results showed that maintaining the matrices at high moisture level promoted persistence of the 7 log CFU/g inocula and enhanced the decline of the 4 log CFU/g inocula in the screen house, but moisture condition did not affect survival of the organisms in the field. The two enteric bacteria survived longer in manure-amended soil than in manure. In the screen house, the 7 log CFU/g E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr survived for 49 - 77 and 63 - 98 days while the 4 log CFU/g E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr persisted for 21 - 28 and 35 - 42 days, respectively. In the field, the 7 log CFU/g E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr persisted for 63 - 84 and 77 - 98 days while the 4 log CFU/g E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr survived for 21 and 35 - 42 days, respectively. Survival kinetics of the 7 log CFU/g inocula in all matrices displayed complex patterns corresponding to the Double Weibull model, except for S. Typhimurium-Rifr in manure samples that experienced exclusive field conditions that followed the classical long-linear model. The times for CFU number of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr to reach the detection limit (ttd) of the plate count method (2 log CFU/g) according to the identified models were consistent with the observed values. However, the weekly sampling interval used for microbial analysis in this experiment did not provide sufficient data points above the detection limit of the plating method (2 log CFU/g) to enable modelling of the survivor curves of the 4 log CFU/g inocula. Due to this limitation, sampling frequency for the 4 log CFU/g inocula was increased in subsequent studies. During the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr in manure and manure-amended soil under field and screen house conditions, temperature in the matrices fluctuated in the range of 16 to 42 &# 176;C. We hypothesised that the observed survival times were due to the cumulative effect of the stress that the organisms experienced at various temperatures within the 16 - 42 &# 176;C continuum. Based on this hypothesis, we postulated that decline rates obtained at various isothermal conditions within 16 - 42 &# 176;C can be used to develop models for predicting survival under dynamic conditions in the field and in the screen house. S. Typhimurium-Rifr was selected as a model organism and used in subsequent isothermal experiments performed with 7 log CFU/g inoculum in manure and manure-amended soil at 16, 25, 37 and 42 &# 176;C. The decline rates obtained at various temperatures were used to develop secondary models that were subsequently used to re-construct the decline rate of the organism under dynamic conditions in the field and in the screen house. The re-constructed field and screen house decline rates were used to generate CFU number as a function of time and used to predict the ttd. The predicted ttd of S. Typhimurium-Rifr in manure and in manure-amended soil in the field was 63 - 68 and 62 days, and 65 and 61 days in the screen house, respectively. At the predicted ttd points the observed CFU numbers of S. Typhimurium-Rifr in manure and in manure-amended soil were around 2. 2 and 3 log CFU/g, respectively, both under screen house and field conditions, which is a rather to very accurate model prediction, as the model uses only the following pieces of information: (i) level of starting population, (ii) survival kinetics obtained under isothermal conditions and (iii) the registered real temperature data. The risk of vegetable contamination following incorporation of non-composted cattle manure into the soil during cultivation was evaluated in the field using pot experiments. We specifically investigated the effect of time of manure amendment to soil during crop cultivation on surface contamination and internalisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and <b>S.</b> Typhimurium-Rifr in <b>cabbage</b> leaf tissues at harvest (120 days post-transplantation). Fresh bovine manure inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr were incorporated at the point of transplantation, 56 or 105 days post-transplantation into the soil to achieve initial inoculum concentrations of 4 or 7 log CFU/g. The persistence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr in the soil when added at 4 log CFU/g was limited; only inocula applied 105 days post-transplantation were still present at harvest and were associated with 18 / 18 plants examined for leaf contamination being positive for both E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr at harvest. However, leaf-surface sterilisation with 1 % AgNO 3 showed that the organisms were not internalised in cabbage leaf tissues. At 7 log CFU/g inoculum level, E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr survived in the soil throughout cultivation period. All the plants (18 / 18) examined for leaf contamination were positive for E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr at harvest irrespective of time of manure application. The incidence of <b>S.</b> Typhimurium-Rifr on <b>cabbage</b> leaves at harvest was 18 / 18, 17 / 18 and 18 / 18 plants for manure applied at the point of transplantation, 56 and 105 days post-transplantation, respectively. Leaf-surface sterilisation with 1 % AgNO 3 showed that only plants (18 / 18) cultivated on soil amended with contaminated manure at the point of transplantation had internalised E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr at harvest. In the case of 4 log CFU/g inoculum, the Double Weibull model provided adequate description of the survivor curves. At 7 log CFU/g inoculum, survival curves were described by the Double Weibull model and the log-linear function that incorporates a shoulder parameter. In situations where CFU fell below the detection limit of the plate count method, the ttd values according to the Double Weibull model were similar to observed values. It was apparent that inocula added to the soil at the point of transplantation persisted longer in soil around roots of cabbage plants than earlier observed in manure-amended bulk soil in the field. This observation suggested the possibility of a rhizosphere effect. Therefore, field experiments were performed to compare survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr in the rhizosphere of cabbage plants and in bulk soil at inoculum densities of 4 and 7 log CFU/g. Results showed that the rhizosphere of cabbage plants had no effect on survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr when introduced into the soil at 4 log CFU/g and all the plants (6 / 6) examined for leaf contamination were negative for E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr at harvest. However, at 7 log CFU/g inoculum density, E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr survived in bulk soil for a maximum of 80 and 96 days, respectively, but remained culturable in the cabbage rhizosphere up to the time of harvest, thus confirming that the rhizosphere of cabbage plants enhances persistence at high inoculum density. In all situations, the Double Weibull model provided adequate description of the survival curves. The ttd values according to the model were consistent with observed values. Microbiological analysis of cabbage leaves showed that cultivation of cabbage on growth matrix spiked with 7 log CFU/g inoculum resulted in E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and S. Typhimurium-Rifr contamination on vegetable leaves throughout the cultivation period. Leaf surface sterilisation with 1 % AgNO 3 indicated that the organisms were present superficially and in protected locations on the leaves. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated that under tropical field conditions, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium can persist in manure-amended soil for up to 4 and 6 weeks at low inoculum density, and for up to 12 and 14 weeks at high inoculum density, respectively. In the case of S. Typhimurium-Rifr, survival time (ttd) of the organism was 71 - 84 % determined by the temperature that the organism experienced in the matrices. Results of plant contamination experiments indicated that the risk of vegetable contamination at harvest and hence consumer safety might become eminent when manure contains high inoculum density irrespective of time of manure application or at low inoculum density when manure is incorporated into the soil near harvest. In addition, leaf surface sterilisation with 1 % AgNO 3 showed that internalisation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 -Rifr and <b>S.</b> Typhimurium-Rifr in <b>cabbage</b> leaf tissues was possible only when manure containing high inoculum density was introduced into the soil at the point of transplantation and was associated with enhanced persistence of the organisms in the rhizosphere. The knowledge acquired in this study forms a bench mark for further investigation into the behaviour of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Typhimurium in manure, manure-amended soil and soil-plant ecosystem under tropical field conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{potential}} impact of conventional chemical pesticides on human health and on the environment, governments worldwide are developing policies to reduce the use of these pesticides. Instruments like the EU directive 91 / 414 /EEC, have resulted in the withdrawal of many active ingredients from the market. Furthermore, the new EU directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides states that non-chemical methods should be given priority wherever possible. To improve the sustainability of agriculture and to avoid resistance development against the receding number of active ingredients remaining on the market, biological alternatives for conventional chemical pesticides are much sought after and even urgently needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are one of those alternatives. They are used for the biological control of an increasing number of insect pests. These bio-insecticides are exceptionally safe for farmers, farm workers, for consumers and for the environment. However, they may have lower efficacy than conventional chemical pesticides. Nonetheless, EPN are equivalent to or even better than conventional chemical insecticides in controlling a number of commercially important pests (e. g., against black vine weevil, citrus root weevil, cranberry girdler, hunting billbug and western corn rootworm). Poor efficacy against other pests can be the result of inappropriate application methods, the use of poor quality products or suboptimal application conditions. This work focused on optimizing the application of EPN in field vegetables. The general aim of this work was to test and, where possible, to improve the control potential of EPN against three difficult to reach pests, described in detail in chapter 1, viz. : the leaf-bound cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) in cauliflower, the soil-bound cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) in cauliflower and the cryptic onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) in leek. Depending on the target pest, the experiments described in chapters 2 to 5 examined the effect of (1) adding adjuvants to the spray suspension, (2) altering the application rate of the EPN and (3) adapting the application technique and/or (4) the timing of the application(s). Chapter 2 focused on improving the formulation and application of EPN on leaves using laboratory tests with special attention to one specific pest: the cabbage moth. Suitable adjuvants for EPN spray applications were selected based on the absence of toxic or immobilizing effects on two EPN species: Steinernema feltiae and S. carpocapsae. The selected humectants and dispersants were further screened for their effects on the sedimentation of these EPN species in a tank suspension. Next, the effect of three suitable surfactants and a humectant and the effect of nozzle size on the deposition of S. carpocapsae on hydrophobic cauliflower leaves was investigated. Subsequently, a laboratory experiment verified whether brewer’s yeast extract can be used as an attractant for the cabbage moth larvae, and whether it improves the mortality caused by EPN to cabbage moth larvae. Finally, the effect of the most suitable surfactant and humectant, selected from the deposition test, on the longevity and on the infectivity of S. carpocapsae, is presented. These experiments have shown that all selected alcohol ethoxylates (Synperonic 91 / 5, Synperonic 91 / 6, Synperonic 10 / 6 and Atplus 245) and the selected alkylpolysaccharide (AL- 2575) immobilized both S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae when mixed in the spray suspension. Xanthan gum remains the best sedimentation-retarding agent. An ISO 02 standard flat fan nozzle can clog when spraying S. carpocapsae. An ISO 04 standard flat fan nozzle provides a higher relative deposition of different S. carpocapsae-adjuvant suspensions on cauliflower leaves than the bigger ISO 08 standard flat fan nozzle. Three spreading agents (Silwet L- 77, SB Plant Invigorator and Addit) roughly doubled the relative EPN deposition with both the ISO 04 and the ISO 08 nozzle when added to the EPN suspension. Addition of xanthan gum did not significantly increase deposition any further. Addition of yeast extract to a foliar spray containing S. carpocapsae significantly increased mortality of the cabbage moth and decreased the amount of leaf damage caused by these caterpillars. And finally, it was shown that adding Addit and xanthan gum to a spray suspension containing S. carpocapsae prolongs the survival of EPN on leaves, and that these adjuvants can cause mortality in larvae of Galleria mellonella. It was however deemed unlikely, and proven in a field test (chapter 3), that Addit and xanthan gum at the used concentrations, would {{have a significant effect on}} insect plagues in field conditions. The field experiments described in chapter 3 implemented the results of chapter 2 and aimed to optimize the control of <b>cabbage</b> moth with <b>S.</b> carpocapsae. A spray application tools test, was performed to select a spray application technique that leads to a maximum of spray coverage on specific parts of the cauliflower plant. The targeted spraying areas were: (1) the central part of the plant, where the cabbage moth larvae can cause direct economic damage to the cauliflower head, and (2) the underside of the leaves, where the young larvae hide during the day and feed during the night. The test showed that two spray boom configurations with vertical extensions in the crop covered the lower side of the outer leaves very well, while also securing statistically equal coverage of the underside of the centre leaves, when compared to all other configurations. Therefore, one of these configurations, a spray boom configuration with TeeJet TP 80 04 EVS nozzles mounted on the horizontal spray boom and TeeJet UB 85 04 nozzles mounted 38 cm long vertical extensions, was selected for the field trial with S. carpocapsae. An adjuvant trial, determined whether S. carpocapsae, applied in the field with this technique, could effectively reduce the cabbage moth numbers in a cauliflower crop and/or the damage to this crop. It also tested if these parameters could be further reduced by adding yeast extract and/or Addit and xanthan gum to the tank suspension. An application rate trial and an application technique trial, were set up (1) to test the effect of different application rates of EPN on cabbage moth control and (2) to confirm if the application technique selected in the spray application tools test was indeed better suited than a standard broadcast spray application, for controlling the cabbage moth. In the adjuvant trial, the numbers of damaged cabbage heads clearly demonstrate a protective effect of spraying with a suspension of S. carpocapsae, when combined with Addit and xanthan gum. It was noticeable that Bt applications outperformed all other treatments, although the difference was not always significant. Based on these results, EPN might provide an extra control option against the cabbage moth, if the efficacy of EPN treatments can be further enhanced. Similar to the adjuvant trial, the numbers of cabbage moth larvae were highly variable between individual plants in both the application rate trial and the application technique trial, making it difficult to distinguish statistical differences between the mean number of caterpillars per plant. However, leaf damage measurements and the number of infected plants proved to be much less variable and thus much more reliable than counting numbers of caterpillars for assessing control by S. carpocapsae and Bt treatments in both trials. Only the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom effectively stopped damage development caused by the cabbage moth. Furthermore, the plots that received Bt with the adapted spray boom were the only plots that contained significantly less infected plants than the control plots. The protection against sunlight on the underside of leaves, together with better placement of the Bt spray may explain the better control of the Bt applications with the adapted spray boom compared with the regular spray boom. This chapter shows that there is much room for improvement in the foliar application of EPN against cabbage moth. Control results were probably largely dependent on the temperature. More cold-tolerant species, strains or breeding products of EPN should be searched for, so that they can be used against the cabbage moth, before any conclusions can be drawn on the optimal application rate of the EPN. The deposition measurements in all trials suffered from high variability. This was most probably caused by the plant architecture of cauliflower: due to the overlap of leaves, some areas of the plant are difficult to spray. This variability is a major concern for biocontrol agents like Bt and EPN, since areas that are not sprayed, are not protected against the targeted pest. When a low temperature active EPN species/strain/breeding product, efficacious against the cabbage moth, becomes available, then EPN applications might be fitted into biological control schemes to prevent development of resistance of cabbage moth against Bt. This is of major importance, since cabbage moth already seems to possess some innate resistance against Bt products. Chapter 4 presents three field tests with applications of IJ of <b>S.</b> feltiae against <b>cabbage</b> root fly in cauliflower. These tests focused on finding an optimal application rate (200, 000 IJ/plant vs. 50, 000 IJ/plant), a suitable application technique (plant tray spraying vs. drench application) and a good timing of the application (application at planting vs. application one week after planting vs. application two weeks after planting, with or without one or two follow-up treatment(s)). The results demonstrated that a plant tray spray with S. feltiae is superior to a drench application in controlling cabbage root fly in cauliflower. Plant tray sprayings with S. feltiae can reduce the percentage of dead plants compared with the non-treated control. The lack of an application rate-effect relationship suggests that it might be possible to further reduce the applied rate of S. feltiae without causing a significant reduction in control. Numbers of cabbage maggots around the plant roots can be temporarily reduced by plant tray sprays with a rate of 200, 000 IJ S. feltiae per cauliflower plant. Mortality results of bait tests with wax moth larvae on soil samples taken from around the cauliflower plants, showed that IJ of S. feltiae, applied as a plant tray spray, take one to two weeks to spread into the soil around the roots of cauliflower. These bait tests also showed that the most effective period of IJ of S. feltiae in the soil is limited up to five weeks, which warrants a follow-up treatment. Further research should examine whether the application rate of IJ of S. feltiae in a plant tray spray can be lowered, while maintaining a good control, and whether a follow-up application of S. feltiae, applied three to five weeks after planting with a better suited technique (e. g., injection), would further improve control of cabbage root fly. Chapter 5 presents two field trials in leek set up to determine and, if possible, to improve the effect of spray applications with S. feltiae against onion thrips in leek. The first trial was carried out on an organic farm and focused on selecting a suitable spray application technique and on testing the effect of an attractant on thrips control. The second trial focused on incorporating spray applications of EPN in a conventional insecticide scheme, and on the effect of mixing the surfactant Addit in the spray suspension on the control of onion thrips. The results show that the selected commercial strain of S. feltiae was not effective against the foliar inhabiting life stages of onion thrips in leek. Mixing a thrips attractant in the spray suspension and spraying with adapted spray equipment (band application and row application) did not improve the efficacy. Compared with the traditional spray boom technique, the row application technique ensured a more even EPN deposition on both the upper side and underside of both old and new leek leaves. This technique offers good potential for improving the applications of fungicides and of contact insecticides in leek. The general discussion in chapter 6 links the obtained results, and suggests directions for future research. The described experimental work with EPN against the cabbage moth, cabbage root fly and onion thrips showed that significant control of the first two pests is certainly possible in outdoor vegetables, but it also showed that there’s still a long way to go before EPN will be applied commercially against these pests in outdoor vegetables. Efficient control of insect pests with EPN requires a perfect match between several factors: the EPN species/strain/breeding product, the pest, the crop, the application (in terms of technique, formulation and application rate) and the environmental conditions. Matching these factors requires the screening and breeding of much more EPN species/strains for different properties (e. g., pathogenicity, temperature tolerance, mobility, drought resistance). In the short term, research on EPN applications against greenhouse pests seems to be the most promising area of research in temperate climates. Only when the prices for EPN drop due to more widespread adoption and when new EPN species/strains/breeding products and application techniques become available, will outdoor applications of EPN become commercially viable. Because pest control with EPN is obviously not a one-size fits-all solution, farmers will need appropriate knowledge to obtain successful pest control with EPN. Moreover, the upcoming EU obligation for farmers to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) methods to protect their crops will further increase the demand for knowledge on IPM methods. Governmental, NGO and corporate advisory networks will need to be strengthened in order to fulfil this demand and to keep European crops healthy...|$|R
