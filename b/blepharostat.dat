40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and describe the}} precautions involved in the technique of intravitreal injection of antiangiogenic drugs adopted by the ophthalmologists {{who are members of}} the Brazilian Society of Retina and Vitreous (SBRV). Methods: A questionnaire containing 22 questions related to precautions taken before, during, and after intravitreal injection was sent electronically to 920 members of SBRV between November 15, 2013 and April 31, 2014. Results: 352 responses (38 %) were obtained. There was a predominance of men (76 %) from the southwest region of Brazil (51 %). The professional experience varied between 6 and 15 years after medical specialization (50 %). Most professionals (76 %) performed an average of 1 to 10 intravitreal injections a week, and 88 % of the procedures were performed in the operating room using povidone iodine (99 %), sterile gloves, and <b>blepharostat</b> (94 %). For inducing topical anesthesia, usage of anesthetic eye drops was the most used technique (65 %). Ranibizumab (Lucentis&# 174;) was the most common drug (55 %), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was the most treated disease (57 %). Regarding the complications treated, 6 % of the ophthalmologists had treated at least one case of retinal detachment, 20 % had treated cases of endophthalmitis, 9 % had treated cases of vitreous hemorrhage, and 12 % had encountered cases of crystalline lens touch. Conclusion: Intravitreal injection is a procedure routinely performed by retina specialists and has a low incidence of complications. Performing the procedure in the operating room using an aseptic technique was preferred by most of the respondents. Ranibizumab was the most used drug, and AMD was the most treated disease...|$|E
