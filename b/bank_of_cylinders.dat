25|$|Two-row designs {{began to}} appear in large numbers during the 1930s, when {{aircraft}} size and weight grew to the point where single-row engines of the required power were simply too large to be practical. Two-row designs often had cooling problems with the rear <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> but a variety of baffles and fins were introduced that largely eliminated these problems. The downside was a relatively large frontal area that had to be left open to provide enough airflow, which increased drag. This led to significant arguments in the industry in the late 1930s about the possibility of using radials for high-speed aircraft like modern fighters.|$|E
500|$|In addition, an {{exhaust system}} to reduce noise levels to below those from ejector {{exhausts}} was devised for the North Star/Argonaut. This [...] "cross-over" [...] system took the exhaust {{flow from the}} inboard <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> up-and-over the engine before discharging the exhaust stream on the outboard side of the UPP nacelle. As a result, sound levels were reduced by between 5 and 8 decibels. The modified exhaust also conferred an increase in horsepower over the unmodified system of , resulting in a 5 knot improvement in true air speed. Still-air range of the aircraft was also improved by around 4 per cent. The modified engine was designated the [...] "TMO" [...] and the modified exhaust system was supplied as kit that could be installed on existing engines either by the operator or by Rolls-Royce.|$|E
2500|$|A 6-cylinder {{version of}} the Liberty L-12, nicknamed the [...] "Liberty Six", {{consisted}} of a single <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> with the resulting engine bearing a strong external resemblance to both the Mercedes D.III and BMW III straight-six German aviation engines of World War I.|$|E

2500|$|Power {{came from}} an enlarged, 2.9L (2936 cc) [...] version of the GTO's IHI twin {{turbocharged}} V8 developing a 478bhp, according to Ferrari. Most experts today agree the number was well over 500 bhp. The F40 did without a catalytic converter until 1990 when US regulations made them a requirement for emissions control reasons. The flanking exhaust pipes guide exhaust gases from each <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> while the central pipe guides gases released from the wastegate of the turbochargers. Engines with catalytic converters bear F120D code.|$|E
2500|$|The {{engine is}} a uniflow design with four poppet-type exhaust valves in the {{cylinder}} head. For maintenance, a power assembly, {{consisting of a}} cylinder head, cylinder liner, piston, piston carrier, and piston rod, can be individually and relatively easily and quickly replaced. The block is made from flat, formed and rolled structural steel members and steel forgings welded into a single structure (a [...] "weldment"). Blocks may, therefore, be easily repaired, if required, using conventional shop tools. Each <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> has an overhead camshaft which operates the exhaust valves and the unit injectors.|$|E
2500|$|The Wib 12 and the Wib 121 (the {{first and}} second prototypes) were both flown {{for the first time}} in May 1926. [...] The latter was about 8% faster in a climb to 4,000 m (13,125ft) than the heavier Wib 8. The third aircraft, the Wib 122 was built for Vickers aircraft, with whom Wibault shared patents and {{collaborative}} designs. [...] They fitted it with a [...] W-12 Napier Lion XI engine and knew it as the Vickers Type 127. To avoid the central <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> the Vickers guns were moved from the fuselage top to the sides. Its test programme was interrupted by continual engine overheating problems.|$|E

2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford friction shock absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by push rods running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. [...] All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. [...] The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces for inlet and exhaust manifolds and push rods. [...] The exhaust stubs were vertical, each <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> feeding its own horizontal pipe. The inlet stubs entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. [...] Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. [...] Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. [...] The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. [...] These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. [...] The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. [...] The crankshafts of the D and F types had five ball race bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output thrust bearing was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. [...] The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. [...] The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. [...] The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter thrust bearing to be used.|$|E

50|$|In aviation, {{an inline}} engine is a {{reciprocating}} engine with <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> one behind another, rather than rows <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> with each <b>bank</b> having any number <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> but rarely more than six.|$|R
5000|$|Three <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{sharing a}} common crankshaft, a {{configuration}} {{also known as}} broad arrow configuration due to its shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark.|$|R
50|$|V:Engines {{with two}} <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{with less than}} 180° between them driving a common crankshaft, {{typically}} arranged upright or inverted (e.g. upright Liberty L-12, inverted Argus As 410).|$|R
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} some J-family engine models is Honda's Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system. The system uses VCM {{to turn off}} one <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> under light loads, turning the V6 into a straight-3. Some {{versions}} Variable Cylinder Management system were able to turn off one <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> or one cylinder on opposing banks, allowing for three-cylinder use under light loads or four-cylinder use under medium loads.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the cylinders is also unusual. The V4 has the rear <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> paired closely together, with the big ends of their connecting rods on the inner sides of the crank journals. The forward <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> is conversely set outboard of the rear bank, with the big end journals mounted on the outer sides of the crank journals. This design allows for a much narrower engine at the rear, which makes the bike slimmer where it contacts the rider, and allows an easier reach to the ground from the seat.|$|E
50|$|Opposed piston:Two-stroke engines, {{typically}} compression ignition/Diesel, with {{a single}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> driving two crankshafts where the pistons travel towards each other forming single combustion chambers, (e.g. Jumo 207).|$|E
50|$|H:Engines {{with four}} <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> driving two {{crankshafts}} geared {{to a single}} output, in effect, two Opposed engines coupled together and mounted either horizontally or vertically, (e.g. horizontally Napier Sabre, vertically Napier Dagger).|$|R
50|$|O or Horizontally Opposed: Engines {{with two}} <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{arranged}} at 180° {{to each other}} driving a common crankshaft, almost universally mounted with banks horizontal for aircraft use, or with crankshaft vertical for helicopter use, (e.g. horizontally mounted Continental O-190, vertically mounted Franklin 6ACV-245).|$|R
50|$|The first V4 {{was used}} in the Lambda from 1922 through 1931. It was a 20° narrow-angle {{aluminum}} design. All three engine displacements shared the same long 120 mm stroke, and all were SOHC designs with a single camshaft serving both <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Straight or Inline: Engines with {{a single}} <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> which can be {{arranged}} at any angle but typically upright or inverted, (e.g. upright ADC Cirrus, inverted de Havilland Gipsy Major).|$|E
50|$|If the {{crankshaft}} on one <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> is made {{to rotate}} {{in the opposite direction}} of the crankshaft on the other bank, then the gyroscopic effects of the rotating components would be canceled.|$|E
5000|$|Following his {{previous}} practise Coatalen developed a straight six {{version of the}} Sikhusing a single <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Also intended for airships to be developed after the war, the Sikh II was cancelled when the airships did not materialise.(32.1L / 1,957 in3) ...|$|E
50|$|The narrow-angle {{aluminium}} Lancia V4 {{engine was}} also notable. All three displacements {{shared the same}} long 120 mm stroke, and all were SOHC designs with a single camshaft serving both <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b> First engine had 13° V angle, second 14° and 3rd 13° 40'.|$|R
50|$|Toyota had {{initially}} considered copying the Ford flathead V8 {{because it was}} the most popular engine in Japan at the time. However, the machining <b>of</b> two separate <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> would add too much to the production cost, so the Chevrolet engine was copied instead.|$|R

50|$|The 'Airdisco' was {{developed}} from the French Renault 70 hp aero engine by Frank Halford of the Aircraft Disposal Company, the main difference being the use of aluminium cylinder heads. Halford later used one <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> to create the Cirrus engine.|$|E
50|$|The V-1710 has 12 {{cylinders}} with a bore {{and stroke}} of 5.5 by 6 in in 60° V-format, for 1710.6 cuin L total displacement, with a compression ratio of 6.65:1. The valvetrain has single overhead camshafts per <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders</b> and four valves per cylinder.|$|E

50|$|There are rumours that Watson {{acquired}} {{his first}} aircraft's engine from celebrated Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos Dumont. This was a four-cylinder horizontally opposed engine manufactured in small numbers by Dutheil Chalmers & Cie, Paris, France, of unusual layout; the propeller was mounted between two horizontally opposed <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{are opened}} {{by means of}} a {{camshaft}} which revolves at half the crankshaft speed. This can be either chain, gear or toothed belt driven from the crankshaft, and can be located in the crankcase (where it may serve one or more <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> <b>cylinders)</b> or in the cylinder head.|$|R
