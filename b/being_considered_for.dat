5000|$|With {{the many}} {{benefits}} {{that are associated}} with groups tests, {{it is important to consider}} some of the downfalls also associated with group tests. First, while these test scores can give some predictive aspects to secondary school achievement, college success, or graduate school success, these scores need to be considered with other factors in mind. Kaplan and Saccuzzo suggested to [...] "be especially careful in using these tests for prediction, except for predicting relatively limited factors over a brief time" [...] (p. 308).

5|$|Marvel Comics {{writers and}} chief editors Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas wrote an X-Men {{screenplay}} in 1984 when Orion Pictures held an option {{on the film}} rights, but development stalled when Orion began facing financial troubles. Throughout 1989 and 1990, Stan Lee and Chris Claremont were in discussions with Carolco Pictures for an X-Men film adaptation, with James Cameron as producer and Kathryn Bigelow directing. A story treatment was written by Bigelow, with Bob Hoskins <b>being</b> <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> Wolverine and Angela Bassett <b>being</b> <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> the role of Storm. The deal fell apart when Stan Lee piqued Cameron's interest on a Spider-Man film, Carolco going bankrupt, and the film rights reverting to Marvel. In December 1992, Marvel discussed selling the property to Columbia Pictures to no avail.
