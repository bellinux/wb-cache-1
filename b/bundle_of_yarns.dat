50|$|In ikat the resist {{is formed}} by binding {{individual}} <b>yarns</b> or <b>bundles</b> <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> {{with a tight}} wrapping applied in the desired pattern. The yarns are then dyed. The bindings may then be altered {{to create a new}} pattern and the yarns dyed again with another colour. This process may be repeated multiple times to produce elaborate, multicolored patterns. When the dyeing is finished all the bindings are removed and the yarns are woven into cloth. In other resist-dyeing techniques such as tie-dye and batik the resist is applied to the woven cloth, whereas in ikat the resist is applied to the yarns before they are woven into cloth. Because the surface design is created in the yarns rather than on the finished cloth, in ikat both fabric faces are patterned.|$|R

40|$|Fundamental {{mechanisms}} of the pultrusion process using commingled <b>yarns</b> <b>of</b> polypropylene matrix and discontinuous flax fiber to produce thermoplastic profiles were investigated in numerical and experimental manners.

40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement of single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns</b> due to unavailability {{of a mass}} <b>of</b> consecutive <b>yarns.</b> While multispectral imaging systems can capture images of single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to single strands <b>of</b> <b>yarns,</b> this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} multispectral {{imaging system}} can directly acquire the reflectance {{of a single}} strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> that is impossible for traditional spectrophotometers. Instead, the spectrophotometric reflectance <b>of</b> a <b>yarn</b> winding, which is constituted by yarns wound on a background card, {{is regarded as the}} yarn reflectance in textile. While multispectral imaging systems and spectrophotometers can be separately used to acquire the reflectance of a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> and corresponding yarn winding, the quantitative relationship between them is not yet known. In this paper, the relationship is established based on models that describe the spectral response of a spectrophotometer to a yarn winding and that of a multispectral imaging system to a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn.</b> The reflectance matching function from a single strand <b>of</b> <b>yarn</b> to corresponding yarn winding is derived to be a second degree polynomial function, which coefficients are the solutions of a constrained nonlinear optimization problem.
