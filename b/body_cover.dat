As she writes in her doctoral dissertation, [...] "language of comfort and language of desire are completely absent from discussions about women's dress in Orthodox Judaism".

The <b>body</b> <b>cover</b> is usually light brown, similar to the colour of mature hazelnuts. This species is often {{confused}} with another commonly occurring weevil of the same genera - the gland weevil, Curculio glandium, which lives on oaks. Despite overall similarity, the weevils differ in some morphological details. Curculio nucum has broader segments of flagellum and the segments are covered with semi-erect hairs which in C. glandium are adpressed.|$|E

5000|$|Sztokman's linking of Orthodox {{practice}} to radical Islam {{on the issue}} of women's <b>body</b> <b>cover</b> is met with criticism by some Orthodox Jews who claim that these cultures are different. As one commenter wrote: [...] "Sztokman likens Orthodox Judaism to the Taliban, an ethos in which women are kept illiterate and routinely endure physical beatings.What {{do you say to the}} observation that such an incendiary comparison is over the top and borders on hate speech?"Sztokman argues that much of the rabbinic writing on the subject of women's bodies is based on misogynistic ideas about women's proper role in society. In one story about a rabbi allegedly recommending to a girl that she cut her legs rather than submit to her parents' requests that she wear pants, Sztokman writes, [...] "Orthodox Judaism has issues with the female body, to put it mildly. In a culture defined by the degree to which women are kept silent and invisible, pressured to have as many babies and possible while maintaining the home and covering as much flesh as possible," [...] it is not surprising that some rabbis make extreme recommendations regarding women's bodies.|$|E

50|$|The Ferrari 643 was a Formula One car {{designed}} by Steve Nichols and Jean-Claude Migeot and {{was built by}} Scuderia Ferrari {{for use in the}} 1991 Formula One season. Built during May and introduced at the French Grand Prix it initially looked to have potential to run at the front. Alain Prost qualified on the front row and took the lead, and although he was eventually passed by Nigel Mansell in his Renault powered Williams FW14, a second place in the car's first race looked promising. Aside from almost always being on the front part of the grid, {{it was not to be}} however.The chassis of the 643 was a total redesign over the 642 which suffered inconsistent handling issues, and was designed to allow for a more softer suspension travel, as per Prost's request. The car also featured Ferrari's first 'raised nose' design which allowed better airflow underneath the car. The V12 engine was upgraded six major times during 1991, with the final evolution used from Portugal to the end of the season. The chassis itself had two revisions, the first after the French Grand Prix—which saw a relocation of the exhaust exits from underneath the car, and Belgium which saw minor alterations to the <b>body</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Increases in {{socially}} desirable responses in self-reports might {{occur in the}} context of ongoing public education. We examine concordance of trends in two long-term studies monitoring population impact for SunSmart. METHODS: One study employed telephone interviews of Melbourne residents; the other entailed observations at public recreation venues across Melbourne. The studies assessed people's sun protection on identical weekend dates (Nw = 33 dates). Data from five summers between 1992 and 2001 (n ~ 23, 000 individuals) were analysed. A <b>body</b> <b>cover</b> index score was calculated for participants on each date. Outcomes were aggregated separately for Saturdays and Sundays by date and year. Regression analyses tested whether these trends differed by survey method. RESULTS: The pattern of change in <b>body</b> <b>cover</b> over time was similar for both surveys. Self-reported <b>body</b> <b>cover</b> was consistently higher than observed <b>body</b> <b>cover,</b> suggesting that social desirability bias may be present. Regression analyses showed no divergence between self-reported and observed trends in mean <b>body</b> <b>cover,</b> suggesting no evidence of significant increased social desirability bias in self-reporting over time. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that self-report offers a valid means of assessing change in a population's sun protection compliance over time, at least when self-reports are precisely focussed for time and activity context.

30|$|Around the Tauern Window the {{deformed}} sediments of the Alpine <b>Body</b> <b>cover</b> the crystalline crust (Fig.  4 a). Consisting {{mostly of}} limestone, dolomite, marl and clay, the Alpine Body has a far smaller heat conductivity than the underlying crystalline crust and the crystalline Tauern Body. Thus, the heat {{generated in the}} crust and mantle is trapped by the low conductive sediments of the Alpine Body which causes heat storage in the sediments. This effect is known as blanketing effect (Fig.  7 a) and is stronger where the sediments are thicker (as in the Alps and the basin) and weaker where sedimentary thickness is smaller (as {{in the north of}} the model). Such a blanketing effect can also be recognized in the fill of the Molasse Basin, where calcareous and clastic sediments overlie the crystalline crust. This thermal blanketing leads to increasing temperatures from north to south in the Molasse Basin (Figs.  8, 9) and correlates with the increasing thickness of Molasse Sediments from north to south (Fig.  3 c).|$|E
40|$|The USPC is {{a system}} for {{organizing}} all U. S. patent documents and many other technical documents into relatively small collections based on common subject matter. Each subject matter division in the USPC includes a major component called a class and a minor component called a subclass. A class generally delineates one technology from another. Subclasses delineate processes, structural features, and functional features {{of the subject matter}} encompassed within the scope of a class. Every class has a unique alphanumeric identifier, as do most subclasses. A class/subclass pair of identifiers uniquely identifies a subclass within a class (for example, the identifier ― 2 / 456 ‖ represents Class 2, Apparel, subclass 456, <b>Body</b> <b>cover).</b> This unique identifier is called a classification symbol, or simply a classification, or USPC classification, to distinguish it from classifications of other patent classification schemes. A subclass represents the smallest division of subject matter in the USPC under which documents may be collected. A collection of documents is defined as a set of documents sharing a common classification. A classification assigned to a document associates the document to th...|$|E
