2500|$|If Swift {{hoped that}} the Tale of a Tub would win him a living, {{he would have been}} disappointed. [...] Swift himself {{believed}} that the <b>book</b> <b>cost</b> him any chance of high position within the church. [...] It is most likely, though, that Swift was not seeking a clerical position with the Tale. [...] Instead, it was probably meant to establish him as a literary and political figure and to strike out a set of positions that would win the notice of influential men. [...] This it did. [...] As a consequence of this work, and his activity in Church causes, Swift became a familiar of Robert Harley, future Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, the future Viscount Bolingbroke. When the Tories gained the government in 1710, Swift was rewarded for his work. By 1713–14, however, the Tory government had fallen, and Swift was made Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin—an appointment he considered an exile.|$|E

6000|$|I {{spent my}} {{days at the}} British Museum and must, I think, have been delicate, for I {{remember}} often putting off hour after hour consulting some necessary book because I shrank from lifting the heavy volumes of the catalogue; and yet to save money for my afternoon coffee and roll I often walked the whole way home to Bedford Park. I was compiling, {{for a series of}} shilling books, an anthology of Irish fairy-stories and, for an American publisher, a two-volume selection from the Irish novelists that would be somewhat dearer. I was not well paid, for each <b>book</b> <b>cost</b> me more than three months' reading; and I was paid for the first some twelve pounds ("O, Mr. E.," [...] said publisher to editor, [...] "you must never again pay so much!") and for the second twenty, but I did not think myself badly paid, for I had chosen the work for my own purposes.|$|E
6000|$|Up to {{this point}} George Eliot had {{confined}} herself to English country life, but now she suddenly abandoned the scenes and {{the people with whom}} she was most familiar in order to write an historical novel. It was in 1860, while traveling in Italy, that she formed [...] "the great project" [...] of Romola,--a mingling of fiction and moral philosophy, against the background of the mighty Renaissance movement. In this she was writing of things of which she had no personal knowledge, and the <b>book</b> <b>cost</b> her many months of hard and depressing labor. She said herself that she was a young woman when she began the work, and an old woman when she finished it. Romola (1862-- 1863) was not successful with the public, and the same may be said of Felix Holt the Radical (1866) and The Spanish Gypsy (1868). The last-named work {{was the result of the}} author's ambition to write a dramatic poem which should duplicate the lesson of Romola; and for the purpose of gathering material she visited Spain, which she had decided upon as the scene of her poetical effort. With the publication of Middlemarch (1871-1872) George Eliot came back again into popular favor, though this work is less spontaneous, and more labored and pedantic, than her earlier novels. The fault of too much analysis and moralizing was even more conspicuous in Daniei Deronda (1876), which she regarded as her greatest book. Her life during all this time was singularly uneventful, and the chief milestones along the road mark the publication of her successive novels.|$|E
60|$|And if {{additional}} spur were needed, the Babu supplied it. After a huge meal at Kalka, {{he spoke}} uninterruptedly. Was Kim going to school? Then he, an M A of Calcutta University, {{would explain the}} advantages of education. There were marks {{to be gained by}} due attention to Latin and Wordsworth's Excursion (all this was Greek to Kim). French, too was vital, and the best was to be picked up in Chandernagore a few miles from Calcutta. Also a man might go far, as he himself had done, by strict attention to plays called Lear and Julius Caesar, both much in demand by examiners. Lear was not so full of historical allusions as Julius Caesar; the <b>book</b> <b>cost</b> four annas, but could be bought second-hand in Bow Bazar for two. Still more important than Wordsworth, or the eminent authors, Burke and Hare, was the art and science of mensuration. A boy who had passed his examination in these branches--for which, by the way, there were no cram-books--could, by merely marching over a country with a compass and a level and a straight eye, carry away a picture of that country which might be sold for large sums in coined silver. But as it was occasionally inexpedient to carry about measuring-chains a boy would do well to know the precise length of his own foot-pace, so that when he was deprived of what Hurree Chunder called adventitious aids' he might still tread his distances. To keep count of thousands of paces, Hurree Chunder's experience had shown him nothing more valuable than a rosary of eighty-one or a hundred and eight beads, for 'it was divisible and sub-divisible into many multiples and sub-multiples'. Through the volleying drifts of English, Kim caught the general trend of the talk, and it interested him very much. Here was a new craft that a man could tuck away in his head and by the look of the large wide world unfolding itself before him, it seemed that the more a man knew the better for him.|$|E

6000|$|Among princes and popes it is {{pleasant}} to meet one man of letters, and he {{the greatest of}} the great age, who was a bibliophile. The enemies and rivals of Moliere--De Vise, De Villiers, and the rest-- are always reproaching him--with his love of bouquins. There is some difference of opinion among philologists about the derivation of bouquin, but all book-hunters {{know the meaning of}} the word. The bouquin is the [...] "small, rare volume, black with tarnished gold," [...] which lies among the wares of the stall-keeper, patient in rain and dust, till the hunter comes who can appreciate the quarry. We like to think of Moliere lounging through the narrow streets in the evening, returning, perhaps, from some noble house where he has been reading the proscribed 'Tartuffe,' or giving an imitation of the rival actors at the Hotel Bourgogne. Absent as the contemplateur is, a dingy book-stall wakens him from his reverie. His lace ruffles are soiled in a moment with the learned dust of ancient volumes. Perhaps he picks up the only work out of all his library that is known to exist,--un ravissant petit Elzevir, 'De Imperio Magni Mogolis' (Lugd. Bat. 1651). On the title-page of this tiny volume, one of the minute series of 'Republics' which the Elzevirs published, the poet has written his rare signature, [...] "J. B. P. Moliere," [...] with the price the <b>book</b> <b>cost</b> him, [...] "1 livre, 10 sols." [...] "Il n'est pas de bouquin qui s'echappe de ses mains," [...] says the author of 'La Guerre Comique,' the last of the pamphlets which flew about during the great literary quarrel about [...] "L'Ecole des Femmes." [...] Thanks to M. Soulie the catalogue of Moliere's library has been found, though the books themselves have passed out of view. There are about three hundred and fifty volumes in the inventory, but Moliere's widow may have omitted as valueless (it is the foible of her sex) many rusty bouquins, now worth far more than their weight in gold. Moliere owned no fewer than two hundred and forty volumes of French and Italian comedies. From these he took what suited him wherever he found it. He had plenty of classics, histories, philosophic treatises, the essays of Montaigne, a Plutarch, and a Bible.|$|E
