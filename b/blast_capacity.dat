As part of this study, a total of 8 high-strength concrete beams, built with and without steel fibres, and reinforced with high strength ASTM A 1035 bars are tested under simulated blast loading using the University of Ottawa shock-tube, with an additional 3 companion beams tested under quasi-static loading. The variables considered in this study include: concrete type, fibre content, steel reinforcement ratio and steel reinforcement type. The behaviour of the beams with high-strength steel bars is compared to a companion set of beams reinforced with conventional steel reinforcement. The criteria {{used to evaluate the}} blast performance of the beams includes: overall <b>blast</b> <b>capacity,</b> maximum and residual displacements, secondary fragmentation and crack control. The dynamic results show that high strength concrete beams reinforced with high-strength steel are able to resist higher blast loads and reduce displacements when compared to companion beams with conventional steel reinforcement. The results also demonstrate that the addition of steel fibres is effective in controlling crack formation, minimizing secondary blast fragments, reducing displacements and further increasing overall <b>blast</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, the use of high-strength steel and high-strength concrete also shows potential for brittle failures under extreme blast pressures.

The analytical research program aims at predicting the response of the test beams using dynamic inelastic single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analysis and includes a sensitivity analysis examining the effect of various modelling parameters on the response predictions.

With respect to complexity, limitations, and high costs of experimental tests, analytical studies and software modeling can be good alternatives. Accordingly, in this paper, the behavior of 6 different models of normal and strengthened RC columns under blast loading was evaluated using ABAQUS.

40|$|Synopsis: This {{research}} program was initiated {{to examine the}} feasibility of assessing the blast-resistant capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) slabs using the displacement based design (DBD) method. In order to achieve this objective, five RC slabs were tested under real blast loads in the out-of-plane direction. One of the slabs {{was used as the}} control unit to establish a baseline for comparison in terms of performance for the other four slabs, which were strengthened with fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) and steel fiber reinforced polymer (SRP). The explosive charge weight and stand-off distance required to impose a given damage level were predicted by the DBD method. Test results showed that the blast loads were effectively estimated and the damage levels observed from the field tests correlated well with the predicted levels. In addition, test results corroborated that the blast-resistant capacity of RC slabs can be effectively increased by strengthening using FRP composites. The main conclusion that can be drawn from these tests using improvised explosive devices (IDE) is that RC slabs retrofitted on both sides have a higher <b>blast</b> resistance <b>capacity</b> than those slabs retrofitted only on one side.

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} {{adequate}} guidelines available for FRP retrofitting RC structures against static and seismic loads. However, {{there is still}} limited information on retrofitting RC structures against short-duration dynamic loading effects such as blast loading. Due to the increasing threat of terrorism in recent years, retrofitting of RC structures against blast loading {{is of paramount importance}} in structural engineering. In this paper, a dynamic model that is based on single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) approach is developed for the analysis of the response of retrofitted fixed end supported RC slabs subjected to blast loads. A previously validated layered capacity analysis method is used to determine the yielded and ultimate <b>blast</b> resistant <b>capacity</b> of a cross-section of a RC slab which allows varying strain rates with time along the depth of the member. The corresponding deflections are determined by plastic hinge analysis. To simplify the calculation process, a tri-linear resistance-deflection function which consists of elastic, elasto-plastic and plastic region for fixed end supported RC slabs is converted to an equivalent bilinear function. This developed model can adequately predict the retrofitted members’ response to blast loading. It is then is used to conduct a parametric study to optimise the retrofitting of RC slabs subjected to blast loading by varying the quantity, material type and technique of retrofitting.

40|$|Personnel injury {{from flying}} glass {{produced}} during an explosion accident can represent a significant hazard, often {{in excess of}} hazards due to airblast, primary fragments, building collapse, and secondary fragments. The permissible overpressure in Inhabited Building Distance (IBD) from a Potential Explosion Site (PES) is 1. 2 psi. This pressure is sufficient to cause failure of most windows in conventional construction. Failure of these windows can produce hazardous glass shards which can cause serious injury. A research program was initiated {{to address this issue}} and develop cost effective methods for mitigating the hazards.

40|$|Previous {{events have}} {{demonstrated}} the vulnerability of reinforced concrete infrastructure to blast loading. In buildings, ground-story columns are key structural components, and their failure can lead to extensive damages which can cause progressive collapse. To prevent such disasters, the steel reinforcement in such columns must be properly detailed to ensure sufficient strength and ductility. The use of modern concrete materials such ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is one potential solution to improve the blast performance of columns. UHPC shows high compressive strength, high tensile resistance and superior toughness, properties which make it ideal {{for use in the}} blast-resistant design of columns. The combined use of UHPC and high-performance steels can potentially be used to further enhance the blast resistance of columns. This thesis presents an experimental and analytical study which investigated the use of high-performance materials to increase the <b>blast</b> <b>capacity</b> and ductility of reinforced concrete columns. As part of the experimental study, a total of seventeen columns were tested under simulated blast loading using the University of Ottawa Shock-Tube. Parameters investigated included the effect of concrete type (NSC and UHPC), steel reinforcement type (normal-strength, high-strength or highly ductile), longitudinal reinforcement ratio, seismic detailing and fiber properties. The test program included two control specimens built with normal-strength concrete, five specimens built with UHPC in combination with high-strength steel, and ten columns built with highly ductile stainless steel reinforcement. Each column was subjected to a series of increasing blast pressures until failure. The performance of the columns is investigated by comparing the displacements, impulse capacity and secondary fragmentation resistance of the columns. The results show that using high-performance steels increases the blast performance of UHPC columns. The use of sufficient amounts of high-strength steel in combination with UHPC led to important increases in column <b>blast</b> <b>capacity.</b> The use of ductile stainless steel reinforcement allowed for important enhancements in column ductility, with an ability to prevent rupture of tension steel reinforcement. The study also shows that increasing the longitudinal reinforcement ratio is an effective means of increasing the blast resistance of UHPC columns The thesis also presents an extensive analytical study which aimed at predicting the response of the test columns using dynamic inelastic, single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) analysis. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to examine the effect of various modelling parameters on the analytical predictions. Overall, it was shown that SDOF analysis could be used to predict the blast response of UHPC columns with reasonable accuracy. To further corroborate the results from the experimental study, the thesis also presents an analytical parametric study examining the blast performance of larger-scale columns.

40|$|Structural blast {{analysis}} is usually done with two load levels for different design stages; the Strength Level Blast, SLB, and the Ductility Level Blast, DLB. Strength Level Blast is the lower magnitude overpressure (with a higher {{frequency of occurrence}} and lower consequence) and Ductility Level Blast is the higher magnitude overpressure (with a lower frequency of occurrence and significant consequence). The objective of this thesis {{was to try to}} find an estimated relationship between the linear elastic analysis using Strength Level Blast pressure, and nonlinear plastic analysis using Ductility Level Blast pressure by making an analogy to the procedures of seismic design of structures. For that, four hypothetical methods were introduced and examined to find the one that can provide a better estimated relationship. Furthermore, four SBM topside modules with 22 blast directions were analyzed. Firstly, linear elastic analyses, by means of redundancy analysis, were performed to find the Strength Level Blast capacities. Secondly, nonlinear plastic analyses, by means of static pushover analysis, were performed to obtain the pushover curves. Subsequently, several important parameters that were required for finding the Ductility Level Blast capacities were obtained from the pushover curves, namely, ultimate limit capacities and their respective displacements, the reserve strength ratios and the ductility ratios. In the next stage, the four proposed methods were tested by means of introducing four hypothetical methods each with a different reserve capacity factor, Cr; next, the Strength Level Blast capacities were scaled with these factors to obtain the Ductility Level Blast pressures. These four methods were Displacement Ratios Method, a comparison of ISO 19902 for Earthquake Assessment of Fixed Offshore Platforms for Blast Assessments, the Energy Equivalence Method and the Behavior Parameters’ Method. 9 ̆ 5 Displacement Ratios’ Method assumes the Cr value {{to be based on the}} ratio of the ultimate deflection of the structure to its deflection under the Strength Level Blast pressure. Thus, this method assumes that the structure will continue to behave linearly up until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached, which in turn will be the Ductility Level <b>Blast</b> <b>capacity</b> of the structure. 9 ̆ 5 The method described by ISO 19902 for earthquake assessment of fixed offshore platforms assumes the Cr value to be based on the two scaling parameters; the first parameter was the same as the previous method, and the second parameter takes into account the energy absorbed by the structure after the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached. 9 ̆ 5 The Energy Equivalence Method, the Cr value was obtained by comparing the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached with the energy that would be absorbed if the structure was assumed to behave linearly until the Ductility Level <b>Blast</b> <b>capacity</b> was reached. 9 ̆ 5 The Behavior Parameters’ Method the Cr value was also obtained by equating the energy absorbed by the structure until the ultimate capacity has been reached; however, this method simplifies the area under the graph into two sections; first section in the elastic region, the second section in the nonlinear plastic region until the ultimate capacity of the structure has been reached. Next, this energy was expressed in terms of the Reserve Strength Ratios and Ductility Ratios. In this method the structure was also assumed to be behaving linearly until the Ductility Level <b>Blast</b> <b>capacity</b> has been reached. Finally, after finding the Ductility Level Blast pressures for every module and direction, the Cr values were arranged based on the direction of loading to longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions, for the small and large modules, in order to find which method had the least scatter for the Cr value. The most desirable results, with the least deviations, were obtained were from the Energy Equivalence Method. In addition, the obtained Ductility Level Blast pressures were compared with the nonlinear dynamic capacities for every module and direction. The main criteria in this comparison was having the calculated pressure less than the calculated dynamic capacities. It was observed that the Energy Equivalence Method gave the most suitable results in this comparison as well. The minimum value of Cr from the Energy Equivalence Method that were concluded were 4. 0, 4. 0 and 3. 6 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the large modules respectively; also, 5. 2, 4. 3 and 4. 3 for the longitudinal, transverse and diagonal directions of the small modules respectively.

Using a Lewis rat model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show here that contrary to the expectations of this concept, T-cell blasts do not efficiently enter the CNS and are not required to prepare the BBB for immune-cell recruitment. Instead, intravenously transferred T-cell <b>blasts</b> gain the <b>capacity</b> to enter the CNS after residing transiently within the lung tissues. Inside the lung tissues, they move along and within the airways to bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues and lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes before they enter the blood circulation from where they reach the CNS. Effector T cells transferred directly into the airways showed a similar migratory pattern and retained their full pathogenicity. On their way the T cells fundamentally reprogrammed their gene-expression profile, characterized by downregulation of their activation program and upregulation of cellular locomotion molecules together with chemokine and adhesion receptors. The adhesion receptors include ninjurin 1, which participates in T-cell intravascular crawling on cerebral blood vessels. We detected that the lung constitutes a niche not only for activated T cells but also for resting myelin-reactive memory T cells. After local stimulation in the lung, these cells strongly proliferate and, after assuming migratory properties, enter the CNS and induce paralytic disease.

The ability of 10 A 1 -MuLV to use both PiT 1 and PiT 2 receptors has been implicated in its induction of blast cell leukemia. Here we show that restricting receptor usage of 10 A 1 -MuLV to PiT 2 results in loss of <b>blast</b> cell transformation <b>capacity.</b> However, the pathogenicity was unaltered when the env gene is exchanged with Moloney MuLV, which uses the Cat 1 receptor.

Furthermore, an NB-tropic variant of 10 A 1 was unable to induce blast cell leukemia in C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which are also resistant to F-MuLV transformation.

30|$|Coke is {{produced}} by heating finely crushed coal charge in air tight coke ovens. The coal charge mostly consists of blends of different coking coals {{and in some cases}} also partially briquetted charge coal. After carbonization, the coke is pushed from the ovens and quenched with water/inert gas (dry quenching). This hard and porous carbonaceous product acts mainly as a source of reductant for the reduction of iron ore, provides thermal energy and provides a permeable support for the burden materials in the blast furnace. Although coke is expensive, it is still indispensable for the production of liquid iron through Blast Furnace (BF) route. The Major functions of coke in BF are to provide heat for different endothermic reactions inside the BF and for melting of slag and metal, reducing gases required for the reduction of iron oxides, support and permeable bed during counter current flow of materials and gases in BF. Coke is the only solid material in the furnace that supports the iron bearing burden and provides a permeable bed necessary for slag and metal to pass down into the hearth and for hot gases to pass upwards in BF. Of the above mentioned three roles of BF coke, the first two can be substituted by oil, gas, plastics and non-coking coals. These are injected through tuyeres to generate heat and reducing gases. Such a substitution brings reduction in coke rates for the blast furnace (coke rate is the weight of coke required to produce one tonne of hot metal). However, there is no other satisfactory material available, which can replace, fully or partially, metallurgical coke as a permeable support of blast furnace charge materials (burden). Over the last few decades, coke quality requirements have become more stringent due to development of large <b>capacity</b> <b>blast</b> furnaces (>[*] 3500  m 3) and high pulverized coal injection (PCI)/coal dust injection (CDI) rates.|$|R

Therefore, the vulnerability and residual capacity assessment of buildings to deliberately exploded bombs is important to provide mitigation strategies to protect the buildings' occupants and the property. Explosive loads and their effects on a building have therefore attracted significant attention in the recent past.

They are blast load determination, numerical modelling with FEM techniques, material performance under high strain rate and non-linear dynamic structural analysis. The response and damage of a RC framed building for different blast load scenarios were investigated. The blast influence region for a two dimensional RC frame was investigated for different load conditions and identified the critical region for each loading case. Two types of design methods are recommended for RC columns to provide superior residual capacities. They are RC columns detailing with multi-layer steel reinforcement cages and a composite columns including a central structural steel core. These are to provide post blast gravity load resisting capacity compared to typical RC column against a catastrophic collapse. Overall, this research broadens the current knowledge of <b>blast</b> and residual <b>capacity</b> analysis of RC framed structures and recommends methods to evaluate and mitigate blast impact on key elements of multi-storey buildings...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} and experimental {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the blast resistance and mitigation behaviors of structural materials. Understanding the failure mechanisms in these materials will lead to an optimal design of light weight structures capable of withstanding blast loadings. This improved blast mitigation property is extremely important in protecting many commercial, naval, aerospace and defense structures. ^ A controlled study has been performed to understand fracture and damage in glass panels subjected to air blast. A shock tube apparatus has been utilized to obtain the controlled blast loading. Five different panels, namely plain glass, sandwiched glass, wired glass, tempered glass and sandwiched glass with film on both the faces {{are used in the}} experiments. Fully clamped boundary conditions are applied to replicate the actual loading conditions in windows. Real-time measurements of the pressure pulses affecting the panels are recorded. A post-mortem study of the specimens was also performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the materials to withstand these shock loads. The real time full-field in-plane strain and out-of-plane deformation data on the back face of the glass panel is obtained using 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique. The experimental results show that the sandwich glass with two layers of glass joined with a Polyvinyl butyral (PVB) interlayer and protective film on both the front and back face maintains structural integrity and out performs the other four types of glass tested. ^ Experimental and numerical studies were conducted to understand the effect of plate curvature on blast response of aluminum panels. A shock tube apparatus was utilized to impart controlled shock loading to aluminum 2024 -T 3 panels having three different radii of curvatures: infinity (panel A), 304. 8 mm (panel B), and 111. 76 mm (panel C). Panels with dimensions of 203. 2 mm x 203. 2 mm x 2 mm were held with mixed boundary conditions before applying the shock loading. A 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique coupled with high speed photography was used to obtain out-of-plane deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strain on the back face of the panels. Macroscopic postmortem analysis was performed to compare the yielding and plastic deformation in the three panels. The results showed that panel C had the least plastic deformation and yielding as compared to the other panels. A dynamic computational simulation that incorporates the fluid-structure interaction was also conducted to evaluate the panel response. The computational study utilized the Dynamic System Mechanics Analysis Simulation (DYSMAS) software. The model consisted of the shock tube wall, the aluminum plate, and the air (both internal and external) to the tube walls. The numerical results were compared to the experimental data. The comparison between the experimental results and the numerical simulation showed a high level of correlation using the Russell error measure. ^ Experimental studies were conducted to understand the effect of plate curvature on the blast response of 32 layered carbon fiber epoxy panels. A shock tube apparatus was utilized to impart controlled shock loading on carbon fiber panels having three different radii of curvatures; infinite (panel A), 305 mm (panel B), and 112 mm (panel C). These panels with dimensions of 203 mm x 203 mm x 2 mm were held under clamped boundary conditions during the shock loading. A 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique coupled with high speed photography was used to obtain out-of-plane deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strain on the back face of the panels. There were two types of failure mechanism observed in all the three panels: fiber breakage and inter-layer delamination. The fiber breakage was induced from on the face exposed to the shock loading (front face) and continued to the interior. Delamination occurred on the side of the specimen as well as on the front face. Macroscopic postmortem analysis and DIC results showed that panel C can mitigate higher intensity (pressure) shock waves without initiation of catastrophic damage in the panel. Panel B could sustain the least shock wave intensity and exhibited catastrophic failure. Panel A exhibited intermediate <b>blast</b> mitigation <b>capacity.</b> ^ Experimental studies were conducted to understand the effect of varying plate thickness on the blast response of doubly curved E-glass/vinyl Ester panels. A shock tube apparatus was utilized to impart controlled shock loading on glass fiber panels having three different thickness: 1. 37 mm (panel A), 2. 54 mm (panel B), and 4. 40 mm (panel C). These panels with an 18. 28 mm radius of curvature were held under clamped boundary conditions during the shock loading. A 3 D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique coupled with high speed photography was used to obtain out-of-plane deflection and velocity, as well as in-plane strain on the back face of the panels. There were two types of failure mechanism observed in all the three panels: fiber breakage and inter-layer delamination. Macroscopic postmortem analysis and DIC results showed that panel C can mitigate higher intensity (pressure) shock waves without initiation of catastrophic damage in the panel. Panel A could sustain the least shock wave intensity and exhibited catastrophic failure. ...|$|R
