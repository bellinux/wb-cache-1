5|$|Both {{teams had}} to pass through five rounds <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the final. They both entered in the third {{qualifying}} round and won their respective groups <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the knockout stage, where matches were contested over two legs, with a match at each team's home ground. Milan's victories varied from close affairs to comfortable victories. They defeated Celtic by a single goal over two legs, while they beat Manchester United 5–3 on aggregate in the semi-final. Liverpool's matches were mainly all close affairs; they beat defending champions Barcelona on the away goals rule in the first knockout round and beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in the semi-finals, although they did record a 4–0 aggregate win over PSV Eindhoven in the quarter-finals.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} plates {{were included in}} The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was not without its disadvantages. On one occasion during World War I, enemy action meant that expensive plates had to be sent from London three times <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Bombay safely.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Marschall {{organized}} {{a mission to}} seize Harstad in early June 1940; Admiral Hipper, the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, and four destroyers were tasked with the operation. The ships departed on 4 June, and while en route, Admiral Hipper encountered and sank the empty troopship Orama on 9 June. <b>Before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Harstad, the Germans learned that the Allies had already abandoned the port. Marschall's squadron was then tasked with intercepting an Allied convoy that {{was reported to be}} in the area. The ships failed to find the convoy, and returned to Trondheim to refuel.|$|E

5|$|Both the Do 17s and Ju 88s of the III./KG 76 {{encountered}} flak as {{they crossed}} Dover. The Do 17s were escorted by ZG 26 while III./JG 51 led by Hannes Trautloft escorted the Ju 88s. The German bombers had flown east of Canterbury and thereby avoided the main concentration of fighters on the Canterbury-Margate line. At 13:01 they passed over Ashford and had a clear 65km (40 mile) run <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Biggin Hill and its four defending squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Computer models {{suggest that}} {{collisions}} of cometary debris during the formation period play {{a far greater}} role than was previously thought. According to these models, the number of collisions early in the Solar System's history {{was so great that}} most comets were destroyed <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the Oort cloud. Therefore, the current cumulative mass of the Oort cloud is far less than was once suspected. The estimated mass of the cloud is {{only a small part of}} the 50–100 Earth masses of ejected material.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> their targets.|$|E

5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed. Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming {{noted that the}} checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death, saving time. Official Xbox Magazine's Taylor Cocke, however, noted that the checkpoints save players' point progress, meaning that players would have to start the level over if their performance wasn't good enough <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Jagdgeschwader 27 and IV./Jagdgeschwader 54 (JG 27 and JG 54) {{targeted}} Melsbroek airfield. On 31 December, JG 27 {{could only}} muster the following operational pilots and aircraft: 22 (22) from I., 19 (13) from II., 13 (15) from III., and 16 (17) from IV. Gruppe. Geschwaderkommadore Wolfgang Späte had rebuilt IV./JG 54. It had only 21 pilots and 15 of its 23 Fw 190s were operational. Altogether 28 Bf 109s of JG 27 and 15 Fw 190s of JG 54 took off. Seven fighters were lost to enemy aircraft and friendly AAA fire <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the target.|$|E
5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E

5|$|In early March, No. 6 Commando {{moved with}} the rest of the 1st Commando Brigade to Venray where they carried out rehearsals for Operation Plunder, the {{crossing}} of the Rhine. Over the course of two weeks training was undertaken at a creek near Wansum and on 23 March 1945 the assault took place, with the objective being the capture of the town of Wesel. No. 6 Commando went across in the second wave on board storm-boats crewed by engineers. They came under fire almost immediately and as a result of this, and several mechanical failures, a number of boats were sunk <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the landing site at Grav Islet, where the lead unit, No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando had established a bridgehead. Ultimately the majority of the commandos made it to the form up point and No. 6 Commando passed through the marines' positions to lead the advance into the town from the north-east, marking the route as they went with white tape. Over the course of the next two days the commandos took control of the town and repelled a number of German counterattacks, before Wesel finally fell late on 25 March.|$|E
