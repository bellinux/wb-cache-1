40|$|It is well {{established}} that copper sulfide is formed due to reaction of sulfur with copper conductors in transformers and reactors. However, {{there is very little}} experimental evidence to demonstrate copper sulfide diffusion into <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper.</b> Diffusion experiments have been carried out on three samples of kraft paper having different thickness. Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy has been used to investigate the possibilities of copper sulfide diffusion into <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper.</b> This study has demonstrated that copper sulfide can diffuse into the <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper</b> leading to either increase or decrease in free volume of paper. The reasons for changes in free volume of paper due to copper sulfide deposits are explained. The consequences of copper sulfide diffusion on PD, voltage-current characteristics under ac and volume resistivity are discussed. Electric field simulation has been used to explain the effects of Cu ions and copper sulfide formation on electric stress distribution across paper...|$|R

30|$|The Nordic {{companies}} have been examined somewhat marginally {{from the point of}} view of the SECA-directive, and how it will affect the cost-efficiency of the industry. The continuously diminishing paper demand in Europe together with emission regulations in the shipping industry implemented by the European Parliament can bring out severe challenges for the Finnish paper producers in the near future. Additional paper machine and mill closures can be expected; they are done in order to be able to balance the supply-demand equilibrium. The large global paper companies are answering to these challenges by relocating <b>bulk</b> <b>paper</b> production from the periphery closer to the markets. This study revealed that there is clearly a need to make profound feasibility studies and academic research about the upcoming environmental decisions and their impacts on the economy and environment.|$|R

50|$|With the use {{of larger}} ships and containerisation, the {{importance}} of the upstream port declined rapidly from the mid-1960s. The enclosed docks further up river declined and closed progressively between the end of the 1960s and the early 1980s. Trade at privately owned wharves on the open river continued for longer, for example with container handling at the Victoria Deep Water Terminal on the Greenwich Peninsula into the 1990s, and <b>bulk</b> <b>paper</b> import at Convoy's Wharf in Deptford until 2000. The wider port continued to be a major centre for trade and industry, with oil and gas terminals at Coryton, Shell Haven and Canvey in Essex and the Isle of Grain in Kent.

40|$|INGENIERIE+SAD:MPEA new {{composite}} paper with high photocatalytic performance {{has been successfully}} manufactured by introducing titania-anchored porous silica into cellulose fibres. The silica particles with an average size of 700 nm were synthesized via CaCO 3 templating and further employed as support to grow titania nanoparticles (5. 2 nm) by sal-gel synthesis with variable weight ratios. The photocatalytic materials have been characterized using various techniques including BET, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM and TEM + EDX + ED microscopies. The composite TiO 2 /SiO 2 particles have been further introduced in <b>bulk</b> <b>paper</b> to generate highly active photocatalytic TiO 2 -loaded papers. The activity of the papers has been demonstrated in the room-temperature degradation of ethanol (50 - 200 ppm) under UV irradiation, showing a comparable activity to that of commercial TiO 2 -coated papers. The effect of the main textural variables during papermaking on the photocatalytic performance are discussed in detail. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{experiment}} studied {{effects of}} paper on the height and glossiness of UV ink-jet 3 D printing. The results showed that there all existed penetrations between the 1 st ink layer and three kinds of paper, the bigger the roughness and <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper</b> were, the larger the penetration was, and penetration between the 1 st ink and paper was obviously larger than that between two ink layers. Penetration between two ink layers was stable, almost not affected by paper. The bigger the roughness and <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper</b> were, the smaller the glossiness of ink layer was. There appeared directional ink strips on ink layer on three kinds of paper, beginning from the 3 rd ink layer, there also appeared ink pits on ink layer on paper whose roughness and bulk were the biggest, which showed printer precision was also an important factor for the glossiness, apart from paper. Thus, the tight and smooth paper should be selected in UV ink-jet 3 D printing. Before printing, pretreatment {{should be done to}} exclude the influence of the 1 st ink layer and the ink strips...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{cationic}} modified cellulose fibrils obtained by reacting the cellulose fibrils with 2, 3 -epoxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride (EPTMAC). The {{physical and chemical}} properties of unmodified cellulose fibrils (UMCF) and cationic modified cellulose fibrils (CMCF) were characterized by SEM, FTIR, degree of substitution, colloid titration, zeta potential, and thermogravimetric analysis. The experimental results showed that, after cationization, surface charge density and zeta potential reversed, thermal stability decreased, and new functional groups appeared, while the surface morphology did not show much difference from the UMCF. With the addition of three kinds of additives (UMCF, CMCF, and cationic starch (CS)) to BCTMP, the addition of UMCF and CMCF had little effect on zeta potential, while the addition of CS changed zeta potential obviously. With the increasing of additive amount, the <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper</b> sheets added CMCF did not change obviously, while the <b>bulk</b> of <b>paper</b> sheets added UMCF and CS decreased rapidly. With regard to physical strength, all the three kinds of additives could improve the tensile index and tear index; the tensile index of paper sheets added CS was higher than that of added UMCF and CMCF, while the tear index of paper sheets added CMCF was the highest among the three additives...|$|R
