5|$|Pre-Trial Chamber II {{ruled that}} there were {{reasonable}} grounds to be believe that William Ruto and Henry Kosgey were criminally responsible as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes outlined in counts 1, 2 and 4, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Joshua Sang it ruled that his involvement was not essential to the commission of the crimes and so only ruled {{that there were}} grounds to believe he otherwise contributed to the crimes. The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3. In the case of Kenyatta, Muthaura and Ali the Chamber ruled that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Uhuru Kenyatta and Francis Muthaura were guilty as indirect co-perpetrators of the crimes of which they were accused <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Mohammed Ali, the Chamber ruled that his contribution was not essential to the commission of the crimes {{and so he was}} charged with having otherwise contributed.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} fixed to a leaf {{with a special}} glue which hardens rapidly. As it hardens it contracts, {{deforming}} {{the shape of the}} egg. This glue is easily seen surrounding the base of every egg forming a meniscus. The nature of the glue has been little researched <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Pieris brassicae, it begins as a pale yellow granular secretion containing acidophilic proteins. This is viscous and darkens when exposed to air, becoming a water-insoluble, rubbery material which soon sets solid. Butterflies in the genus Agathymus do not fix their eggs to a leaf, instead the newly laid eggs fall {{to the base of the}} plant.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual dimorphism is typical for ground squirrels, kangaroo rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual dimorphism exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual dimorphism can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual dimorphism occurs in alpine populations, possibly {{because of the lack}} of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E

5|$|CMLL has {{declared}} the championship vacant on two separate occasions, {{which meant that}} there was no champion for a period of time. Sometimes, a championship is vacated due to an injury to the reigning champion, or when a champion stoped working for the promotion, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, there was a storyline reason behind it being declared vacant the first time. In late 2013 the light heavyweight champion Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to become the next champion. The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Bodiam Castle was landscaped {{when the}} castle was built, {{to increase its}} aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam {{as one of the}} best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle's walls, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it the equal of the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.|$|E

25|$|A {{comprehensive}} list {{of differences}} between the American and British editions of the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon web site.

Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance.|$|E
25|$|There {{was another}} {{similarity}} between the two ports. As discussed, the shogunate ultimately opened the port of Kobe, rather than that of Hyōgo as was suggested by the Ansei Treaties. The port at Yokohama, similarly, was opened at the then-destitute Yokohama-mura rather than the bustling Kanagawa-juku. In Hyōgo's case the change caused little incident, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> Kanagawa the shogunate proceeded with preparations to open the port at Yokohama over the strong objections of the foreign powers. In the end, the foreign powers ratified the opening of Yokohama when {{the depth of the}} water there proved it a geographically superior location for a port compared to Kanagawa.|$|E

25|$|One sample {{preparation}} issue with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is possible matrix effects {{due to the}} presence of background molecules. These matrix effects have been shown to decrease the signal in methods such as PI and ESI by amounts as much as 60% depending on the sample being analyzed. The matrix effect can also cause an increase in signal, producing false positive results. This can be corrected by purifying the sample as much as possible before LC is performed, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> analyzing environmental samples where everything in the sample is of concern, {{sample preparation}} may not be the ideal solution to fix the problem.

25|$|The {{means by}} which the Anglo-Saxons marshaled forces to defend against marauders also left them {{vulnerable}} to the Vikings.

The king could call up the national militia to defend the kingdom <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the Viking hit-and-run raids, problems with communication, and raising supplies meant that the national militia could not be mustered quickly enough. It was only after the raids were underway that a call went out to landowners to gather their men for battle. Large regions could be devastated before the fyrd could assemble and arrive. And although the landowners were obliged to the king to supply these men when called, during the attacks in 878 many of them opportunistically abandoned their king and collaborated with Guthrum.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, {{the quantum}} well’s {{behavior}} can be represented by the particle in a finite well model. Two boundary conditions must be selected.

Often, the second boundary condition is chosen to be the derivative of the wave function must be continuous across the boundary, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> the quantum well the masses are different {{on either side of}} the boundary. Instead, the second boundary condition is chosen to conserve particle flux as, which is consistent with experiment. The solution to the finite well particle in a box must be solved numerically, resulting in wave functions that are sine functions inside the quantum well and exponentially decaying functions in the barriers. This quantization of the energy levels of the electrons allows a quantum well laser to emit light more efficiently than conventional semiconductor lasers.|$|E

30|$|The {{proof of}} Theorem 3.5 follows lines {{similar to the}} proof of Theorem 2.5.

In this study, for solving this problem, ANN is applied for estimating responses, not the SN ratios or MSDs of responses.
