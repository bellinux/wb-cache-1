The contact was unequal, as Moroccan Arabic has not <b>borrowed</b> as much from Berber languages, though Berber has contributed to Moroccan and Algerian Arabics' very reduced vowel systems.|$|E

Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their <b>borrowed</b> shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

50|$|However {{banks will}} not lend {{infinite}} amount money {{unless they are}} philanthropists. They will only lend reasonable amount money {{so that they could}} receive back from the students without too much risk. If banks are willing to lend $6,000,000 to the student, then, it is said that students face the natural <b>borrowing</b> limit, because they are allowed to <b>borrow</b> exactly up to the amount which they earn for their lifetime. If students are only allowed to <b>borrow</b> less than $6,000,000, then it is said that they face a <b>borrowing</b> limit tighter than the natural <b>borrowing</b> limit.One caveat is that the concept natural <b>borrowing</b> limit does not depend on what amount of money that law students <b>borrow.</b> In this example, they will not <b>borrow</b> more than $200,000, but, {{as long as they are}} allowed to <b>borrow</b> $6,000,000, then it is enough to say students are in the natural <b>borrowing</b> limit world.|$|R
40|$|In the past, foreign <b>borrowing</b> by {{developing}} countries was comprised {{almost entirely of}} government <b>borrowing.</b> Recently, private firms and individuals in developing countries <b>borrow</b> substantially from foreign lenders. It {{is not clear whether}} the observed increase in private sector <b>borrowing</b> leads to overborrowing and frequent defaults by governments in developing countries. In this paper, we develop a tractable quantitative model in which private agents decide how much to <b>borrow</b> but the government decides whether to default. The model with decentralized <b>borrowing</b> increases aggregate credit costs and sovereign default risk, and reduces aggregate welfare, relative to a model with centralized <b>borrowing.</b> Private agents do not internalize the effect of their <b>borrowing</b> on economy-wide credit costs and thus would like to <b>borrow</b> more than the socially efficient level. Depending on the severity of default penalties, decentralized <b>borrowing</b> may lead to either {{too much or too little}} debt in equilibrium. The introduction of decentralized <b>borrowing</b> substantially improves the model’s empirical fit in terms of matching observed debt levels and default rates...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how net income, non－performing loans, and operational fixed－assets of main bank {{are associated with}} the agency costs of <b>borrowing</b> firms.
