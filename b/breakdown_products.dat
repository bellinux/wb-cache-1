5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is a {{condition}} in which damaged skeletal muscle breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include muscle pains, weakness, vomiting, and confusion. There may be tea-colored urine or an irregular heartbeat. Some of the muscle <b>breakdown</b> <b>products,</b> such as the protein myoglobin, are harmful to the kidneys and may lead to kidney failure.|$|E
5|$|Nitric oxide's rapid {{reaction}} {{with water}} in animals results in production of its metabolite nitrite. Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay {{is caused by}} the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.|$|E
25|$|Cell <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> {{cannot be}} reused, and are {{therefore}} degraded. This gives rise to increased uric acid, a purine breakdown product.|$|E

25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on suspended particles, leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
25|$|A small {{proportion}} of patients report attacks of abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing and pain during swallowing, as well as erectile dysfunction in men; this occurs mainly when the breakdown of red blood cells is rapid, and is attributable to spasm of smooth muscle due to depletion of nitric oxide by red cell <b>breakdown</b> <b>products.</b>|$|E

40|$|Adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP) and adenylyl 5 '-(beta, gamma-methylene) -diphosphonate (AMP-PCP) both {{contracted}} the guinea-pig urinary bladder, but {{the response to}} AMP-PCP was much greater. We synthesized the enantiomer of AMP-PCP, L-adenylyl 5 '-(beta, gamma-methylene) -diphosphonate (L-AMP-PCP), and tested it on the guinea-pig bladder. L-AMP-PCP {{contracted the}} guinea-pig bladder, and was more potent than AMP-PCP and much more potent than ATP. The potential <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of L-AMP-PCP, L-adenosine, unlike adenosine (the <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of AMP-PCP), did not inhibit contractions of the guinea-pig bladder. ATP and its enantiomer L-adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (L-ATP) were rapidly degraded by the muscle, and AMP-PCP was also degraded, but more slowly. L-AMP-PCP, however, was completely resistant to degradation. L-AMP-PCP {{would appear to be}} a useful ATP analogue, as it is potent and resistant to degradation, and its potential <b>breakdown</b> <b>product,</b> L-adenosine, is inactive...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{obtained}} for the presence in vivo of alpha 2 D-globulin, a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of serum β 1 C-globulin, in patients with acute and persistent hypocomplementemic glomerulonephritis. The protein has been identified by immunoelectrophoretic analysis, and the amounts present have been determined by direct measurement of specific antigenic determinants present on alpha 2 D. β 1 A-Globulin, another <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of β 1 C-globulin, may also be present in vivo in severely hypocomplementemic patients, but its levels are much {{lower than those of}} alpha 2 D-globulin...|$|R
25|$|Bilirubin is {{excreted}} in bile and urine, {{and elevated}} levels may indicate certain diseases. It {{is responsible for}} the yellow color of bruises and the yellow discoloration in jaundice. Its subsequent <b>breakdown</b> <b>products,</b> such as stercobilin, cause the brown color of faeces. A different breakdown product, urobilin, is the main component of the straw-yellow color in urine.|$|E
25|$|A {{panel of}} experts {{set up by the}} European Food Safety Authority {{concluded}} in 2013 that aspartame is safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. As of 2017 evidence does not support a long-term benefit for weight loss or in diabetes. Because its <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> include phenylalanine, people with the genetic condition phenylketonuria (PKU) must be aware of this as an additional source.|$|E
25|$|Two {{molecules}} of dALA are then combined by porphobilinogen synthase to give porphobilinogen (PBG), which contains a pyrrole ring. Four PBGs are then combined through deamination into hydroxymethyl bilane (HMB), which is hydrolysed {{to form the}} circular tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III. This molecule undergoes a number of further modifications. Intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances, but, in humans, the main end-product protoporphyrin IX is combined with iron to form heme. Bile pigments are the <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> of heme.|$|E
50|$|Chlorendic acid, or 1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachlorobicyclo2.2.1-hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid, is a {{chlorinated}} hydrocarbon {{used in the}} synthesis of some flame retardants and polymers. It is a common <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of several organochlorine insecticides.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} use as rocket fuel, UDMH is a {{nitrogen}} source in metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} thin-film deposition. UDMH is a contaminant, metabolite, and <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of daminozide.|$|R

25|$|Aspartame {{is rapidly}} hydrolyzed {{in the small}} intestines. Even with {{ingestion}} of very high doses of aspartame (over 200mg/kg), no aspartame {{is found in the}} blood due to the rapid breakdown. Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including aspartic acid, phenylalanine, methanol, in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass and further <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> including formaldehyde and formic acid. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartame. In some fruit juices, higher concentrations of methanol can be found than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.|$|E
25|$|One major {{industrial}} application involves use of activated carbon {{in the metal}} finishing field. It is very widely employed for purification of electroplating solutions. For example, it is a main purification technique for removing organic impurities from bright nickel plating solutions. A variety of organic chemicals are added to plating solutions for improving their deposit qualities and for enhancing properties like brightness, smoothness, ductility, etc. Due to passage of direct current and electrolytic reactions of anodic oxidation and cathodic reduction, organic additives generate unwanted <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> in solution. Their excessive build up can adversely affect the plating quality and physical properties of deposited metal. Activated carbon treatment removes such impurities and restores plating performance to the desired level.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem with}} using a {{specific}} collagen type II biomarker from {{the breakdown of}} articular cartilage is {{that the amount of}} cartilage is reduced (worn away) over time with progression of the disease so a patient can eventually have very advanced osteoarthritis with none of this biomarker detectable in their urine. Another problem with a systemic biomarker is that a patient can have osteoarthritis in multiple joints at different stages of disease at the same time, so the biomarker source cannot be determined. Some other collagen <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> in the synovial fluid correlated with each other after acute injuries (a known cause of secondary osteoarthritis) but did not correlate with the severity of the injury.|$|E
5000|$|Creatinine ( [...] or from κρέας) is a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of {{creatine}} phosphate in muscle, and {{is usually}} produced at a fairly constant rate by the body (depending on muscle mass).|$|R
50|$|Malaoxon (Liromat, Malation oxon, Malthon oxon) is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula C10H19O7PS. More specifically, it is a phosphorothioate. It is a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of, and more toxic than, malathion.|$|R
50|$|Uremic fetor is a urine-like odor on {{the breath}} of persons with uremia. The odor occurs from the smell of ammonia, which is created in the saliva as a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of urea.|$|R
25|$|Oral sex alone cannot {{result in}} {{pregnancy}} and heterosexual couples may perform oral sex as their method of contraception. For conception to take place, sperm from the penis must enter the uterus and fallopian tubes and fertilize the female's egg. In humans, {{there is no}} connection between the gastrointestinal system and the reproductive system, and sperm ingested by the woman would be killed and broken down by acids in her stomach and proteins in the small intestine. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> are then absorbed as a negligible quantity of nutrients. However, {{there is a potential}} risk of pregnancy if semen comes in contact with the vaginal area in some way, such as semen in the ejaculate finding its way onto fingers, hands, or other body parts, which then comes in contact with the vaginal area.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern: mutated {{copies of the}} gene GCDH must be provided by both parents to cause glutaric acidemia type 1. The GCDH gene encodes the enzyme glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. This enzyme is involved in degrading the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan. Mutations in the GCDH gene prevent production of the enzyme or result {{in the production of}} a defective enzyme with very low residual activity, or an enzyme with relatively high residual activity but still phenotypic consequences. This enzyme deficiency allows glutaric acid, 3-hydroxyglutaric acid and (to a lesser extent) glutaconic acid to build up to abnormal levels, especially at times when the body is under stress. These intermediate <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> are particularly prone to affect the basal ganglia, causing many of the signs and symptoms of glutaric acidemia type 1.|$|E
25|$|However, during {{onset of}} osteoarthritis, the {{collagen}} matrix becomes more disorganized {{and there is}} a decrease in proteoglycan content within cartilage. The breakdown of collagen fibers results in a net increase in water content. This increase occurs because whilst there is an overall loss of proteoglycans (and thus a decreased osmotic pull), it is outweighed by a loss of collagen. Without the protective effects of the proteoglycans, the collagen fibers of the cartilage can become susceptible to degradation and thus exacerbate the degeneration. Inflammation of the synovium (joint cavity lining) and the surrounding joint capsule can also occur, though often mild (compared to the synovial inflammation that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis). This can happen as <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> from the cartilage are released into the synovial space, and the cells lining the joint attempt to remove them.|$|E
50|$|However, the <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> desnitro-imidacloprid, {{which is}} formed in a mammal's body during {{metabolism}} {{as well as}} in environmental breakdown, has a charged nitrogen and shows high affinity to mammalian nAChRs. Desnitro-imidacloprid is quite toxic to mice.|$|R
50|$|In {{chemical}} terms, bilins are linear {{arrangements of}} four pyrrole rings (tetrapyrroles). In human metabolism, bilirubin is a <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of heme. Hydroxymethyl bilane {{is a major}} anabolic product, from the biosynthetic reaction of porphobilinogen (PBG) and uroporphyrinogen I synthase (known as porphobilinogen deaminase).|$|R
50|$|A {{deficiency}} of either proline oxidase or pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase {{results in a}} buildup of proline in the body. A {{deficiency of}} the latter enzyme leads {{to higher levels of}} proline and a buildup of the intermediate <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> pyrroline-5-carboxylate, causing the signs and symptoms of hyperprolinemia type II.|$|R
500|$|The {{thyroid gland}} and every cell that uses thyroid hormone use selenium, {{which is a}} {{cofactor}} for the {{three of the four}} known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine. (Only the deiodinase, iodotyrosine deiodinase, which works on the last <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> of thyroid hormone, does not use selenium.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{compound}} {{thought to}} be responsible for the toxicity of raw L.torminosus is the pungent-tasting [...] velleral present at a concentration of 0.16mg/g mushroom. Velleral is a breakdown product of stearyl-velutinal. Broken lactifers—specialized hyphal cells that produce the mushroom's latex—leak the precursor chemicals whose <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> act as the defensive agents toxic to humans, effectively deterring certain vertebrates that might consume the mushroom. The lactarane-type sesquiterpene lactone 15-hydroxyblenninA is one of several sesquiterpenes produced by the species. Other lactaranes are found in various Lactarius species, such as blenninA in L.deliciosus and L.blennius, and lactarorufinN in Lactarius rufus. Fungal sesquiterpenes are commonly produced as toxins to defend against predation, and as a result some have chemical properties that may have applications in medicinal chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>breakdown</b> <b>products</b> of {{tetracyclines}} are toxic and {{can cause}} Fanconi syndrome, a potentially fatal disease affecting proximal tubular function in the nephrons of the kidney.

50|$|The main <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of {{chlorothalonil}} is 4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichloroisophthalonitrile (SDS-3701). It {{has been}} shown to be 30 times more acutely toxic than chlorothalonil and more persistent in the environment. Laboratory experiments have shown it can thin the eggshells of birds, but no evidence supports this happening in the environment.|$|R
40|$|Synthesis of prostanoids in Crohn's {{disease was}} {{investigated}} using rectal biopsy specimens maintained in organ culture. As with ulcerative colitis increased synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E 2 was observed when the mucosa was inflamed, compared with uninflamed mucosa in Crohn's disease, and with control biopsy specimens. In contrast with ulcerative colitis differences from control specimens were observed {{even in the}} absence of inflammation. There was a raised synthesis of thromboxane (Tx) B 2 (stable <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of TxA 2); concentrations of 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha (stable <b>breakdown</b> <b>product</b> of prostacyclin) were unchanged and hence the ratio of 6 -keto PGF 1 alpha/TxB 2 was reduced.
