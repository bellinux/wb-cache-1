25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed {{they were afraid of}} the lifeboat <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> the weight, others suggested it was because the crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and children first. Additionally, doors and hatches were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E

Copsey praised Kesha for not <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> the harsh {{scrutiny}} she has been subject to over {{the length of her}} career, citing her boozy antics and processed vocals as areas that have been criticized. He wrote, [...] "we've never disputed that she carries it all off in a fashion that's frank, fearless and unashamedly fun." [...] The song's chorus was highlighted in the review, with Copsey calling it [...] "her poppermost effort to date" [...] that contained [...] "bouncy Dr Luke beats and her usual bubblegum melodies".|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{problems}} with her answer, {{she went on to}} win the competition and was crowned Binibining Pilipinas World. The criteria for judging the winner of the pageant allotted 80 percent to physical beauty, leaving just 20 percent to be divided evenly between personality and intelligence. Bediones later defended San Miguel, saying [...] "I admire her for not <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> the pressure and for being as blatantly honest as possible". However, he also added, [...] "No matter how badly she may have performed in the Q, she couldn't have lost much considering she had a huge headstart in the scores". Winning the title made her the official designated Philippine delegate to the Miss World 2008 pageant, which was scheduled to be held later that year in Kiev, Ukraine (the venue was later moved to Johannesburg, South Africa due to the conflict between Georgia and Russia).|$|E
500|$|After {{watching}} {{footage of}} whale movement, Conti {{determined that the}} models could be simplified by making {{the front of the}} whale entirely rigid, relying on the tail and fins for movement. Conti showed footage of the operation of a [...] prototype to Paramount executives, who according to Conti, [...] "loved it... It really knocked them out." [...] With Paramount's approval, ILM hired marine author, conservationist and illustrator Pieter Folkens to sculpt a realistic whale exterior. ILM decided on a finished model size of —the size prevented delicate components like the tail from <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> stress—and fitted it with mechanics and radio equipment required for control and operation. To prevent water from ruining the whale's electronics, the modelmakers sealed every individual mechanical component rather than attempting to waterproof the entire whale. Balloons and lead weights were added to achieve the proper balance and buoyancy. The finished models were put in the swimming pool of Serra High School in San Mateo, California, for two weeks of shooting; the operation of the whales required four handlers and divers with video cameras to help set up the shots. Accurately controlling the whales was difficult because of the murky water—ILM added diatomaceous earth to the water to match realistic ocean visibility. For a few shots, such as the whales' breaching the water {{towards the end of the}} film, the creatures were represented by life-size animatronics shot at Paramount.|$|E

2500|$|The {{restrictions}} on these pesticides, although mandated {{on the premise}} of child safety, were not received unanimously well by groups outside the EPA. Both agriculture representatives and environmentalists sounded off after the EPA made its decisions. “Chemical Business News” published an article suggesting that the idea that pesticides pose special dangers for children was actually an alarmist issue not based in science. [...] Agriculture lobbies claimed that the banning of organophosphates would cause the agriculture industry an annual loss of $1.8 billion. Environmentalists argued that the EPA was <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> the pressure of these lobbies and needed to uphold the legal safety standard mandated in the FQPA. [...] In response the EPA published a report saying that they stood by their decisions and the 10 fold safety increase was both conservative and prudent and was only applicable under special circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|The Pratt truss was {{patented}} in 1844 by two Boston railway engineers, Caleb Pratt {{and his son}} Thomas Willis Pratt. [...] The design uses vertical {{members for}} compression and diagonal members to respond to tension. The Pratt truss design remained popular as bridge designers switched from wood to iron, and from iron to steel. [...] This continued popularity of the Pratt truss is {{probably due to the}} fact that the configuration of the members means that longer diagonal members are only in tension for gravity load effects. [...] This allows these members to be used more efficiently, as slenderness effects related to <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> compression loads [...] (which are compounded by the length of the member) will typically not control the design. [...] Therefore, for given planar truss with a fixed depth, the Pratt configuration is usually the most efficient under static, vertical loading.|$|E

It is a theme that keeps reverberating sweetly, and hauntingly, throughout Pet Sounds." [...] Carl said: [...] "The disappointment {{and the loss of}} innocence that everyone had to go through when they grow up and find everything's not Hollywood are the recurrent themes on that album." [...] Critics Richard Goldstein and Nik Cohn noted incongruity between the album's music and lyrics, where the latter suggested the work to be [...] "sad songs about happiness" [...] while also celebrating loneliness and heartache. In the opinion of Perone, it is the next track, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", which features the first expression of introspective themes that pervade the rest of the album.|$|E

[...] Filmmaker David Lynch said that, while he liked Malick's previous works, The Tree of Life [...] "was not his cup of tea".

2500|$|Federal {{and state}} {{legislation}} seeking to remove funding for Berkeley was not dropped {{and is currently}} still pending. Senator DeMint said after the council's actions: [...] "It's a national embarrassment that these officials refuse to apologize to our troops {{and their families and}} continue to support actions against military recruitment." [...] On the Senate floor, California US Senator Barbara Boxer argued against DeMint's amendment, and said that other state and local governments pass resolutions and measures that Congress doesn't agree with, without getting their funding for earmarks removed. Because of Democratic control of the legislatures and fear of voter backlash, it is unlikely that either measure will pass. The group supporting Marine recruiting, Move America Forward, sent 3 tons of candy, cookies, hot cocoa, coffee and beef jerky to troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Code Pink continued its protests outside the recruiting center. Code Pink cofounder Medea Benjamin said of the council's decision: [...] "We are really proud of the Berkeley City Council for not <b>buckling</b> <b>under</b> intense pressure from the pro-war 'swift-boaters." ...|$|E
