5000|$|... 1808 - John Heathcoat {{patented}} the <b>bobbin</b> <b>net</b> {{machine in}} Loughborough ...|$|E
50|$|John Heathcoat (1783-1861), {{inventor}} and industrialist, {{operated a}} textile mill in Hathern (where, in 1808-9, he invented the <b>bobbin</b> <b>net</b> machine, for weaving a lace-like hexagonal net), before moving his business first to Loughborough, {{and later to}} Tiverton, Devon.|$|E
5000|$|William Felkin (1795-1874), a {{manufacturer}} and {{historian of the}} lace and hosiery industries who had been mayor of Nottingham in 1851-52, said of him:He had little early education, but afterwards read much. He possessed an extraordinary memory, and delighted in the histories of manufactures and commerce. He knew most {{of the laws of}} his own country and France regulating these matters. His first employment was in the stocking frame, then in point net, and afterwards in <b>bobbin</b> <b>net,</b> and he knew many of those who had improved those classes of machines. A recent writer places him amongst the [...] "worthies of Nottingham". Others differed from this, for which his dogmatism and warm temperament may account.|$|E
5000|$|Blonde lace {{was made}} in Caen from 1744, in parts of Flanders, in Barcelona, and, in small quantities, in the east Midlands of England from about 1806. [...] It didn't suffer when other lacemakers were reduced {{to the brink of}} ruin in 1821 to 1832 by the {{introduction}} of machine-made <b>bobbin</b> <b>net.</b> In fact, the demand for blonde actually increased, and Caen exported great quantities, by smuggling, to England. It was one of the earliest laces to be copied by machine- in 1833 the traverse warp machine (invented in 1811) made it for a full season, and it was sold without saying it was machine-made, at handmade prices, with no one the wiser. By 1840 blonde lace was out of favor.|$|E
50|$|The {{trade of}} making lace by hand was a {{well-established}} cottage {{industry in the}} East Midlands by the late 16th century, and the earliest record of it in Helmdon dates from 1718. Makers around Towcester and Buckingham {{had a reputation for}} the finest lace, and although mechanised competition began with Heathcoat's <b>bobbin</b> <b>net</b> machine in 1808, quality lace-making by hand thrived for several more decades. Helmdon had lace-making schools that taught girls the trade from an early age. Lace-making in the parish peaked {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when the 1851 Census recorded that 94 women and girls — more than 30% of all Helmdon's female inhabitants — worked in the trade, and the youngest workers were under 10 years old. Thereafter mechanical lace-making did reduce the market for hand-made lace. The 1891 Census recorded only six women in Helmdon employed in the trade, and only one of those was aged under 40.|$|E
