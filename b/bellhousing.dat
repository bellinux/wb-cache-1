2500|$|The 1971 {{and older}} blocks use a [...] "small" [...] bell housing bolt pattern that is {{exclusive}} to AMC and small Nash sixes. In 1972 the bell housing bolt pattern {{was changed to}} match the AMC V8's - its final use was in 2006 when the 4.0 was phased out. Four bolts on the cylinder block are matched to the transmission <b>bellhousing</b> where an adapter plate serves both as a dust cover - two additional bolt holes on the transmission <b>bellhousing</b> used on the AMC V8 are used to secure the dust cover. The 1971 258 uses the [...] "small" [...] pattern, the only year 258 to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Partway {{through this}} year and in limited quantities, a new 427 {{replaced}} the 406 for racing applications. It was intended to meet NHRA and NASCAR 7-liter maximum engine size rules. This engine was rated at a [...] with 2 x 4 barrel Holley carburetors and a solid lifter camshaft. Ford also made available aluminum cylinder heads as a dealer option. The 1963½ was still overweight, however. To be competitive in drag racing Ford produced 212 (around 170 from Ford Norfolk, about 20 from Ford Los Angeles) lightweight versions of the [...] "R" [...] code 427, in the Galaxie 500 Sport Special Tudor Fastback. Available only in Corinthian White with red vinyl interior, and with a list price of about US$4,200 (when a base Ford 300 went for US$2,324, and XL Fastback was US$3,268), these cars came stock with Borg-Warner T-10 four-speed, 4.11:1 rear axle, heavy-duty suspension and brakes, and were fitted with a fiberglass hood (a flat piece at first, late in 1963 the popular blister hood also used on the Thunderbolt), trunk, front fenders, and fender aprons, as well as aluminum bumpers and mounting brackets, transmission cases, and <b>bellhousing.</b> Hood springs, heater, trunk lining and mat, spare wheel and tire (and mounting bracket), trunk lid torsion bar, jack, lug wrench, one horn (of the stock two), armrests, rear ashtrays, courtesy lights, and dome light were removed to reduce weight. The first 20 cars had functional fiberglass doors, which shaved these were deleted because of Ford's concern for safety if used on the highway. The cars had all sound-deadening material removed, lightweight seats and floormats, and no options. They were not factory equipped with cold-air induction, as the Thunderbolt would be. In addition, they were built on the -lighter Ford 300 chassis, originally intended for a smaller-displacement V8. In all, the 427s were [...] lighter than before ( [...] with the fiberglass doors).|$|E

5000|$|Unlike the 351C, {{almost all}} 400 blocks used the large <b>bellhousing</b> bolt pattern {{used by the}} 385 family {{big-block}} and were typically equipped with the higher torque-capacity C6 transmission. There were {{a small number of}} 400 block castings produced in 1973 with the dual <b>bellhousing</b> patterns. It had the large <b>bellhousing</b> and the small <b>bellhousing</b> bolt pattern used by the Windsor V8 family and the 351C, though it was not necessarily drilled for both. These particular blocks have been dubbed the [...] "400 FMX" [...] by enthusiasts, though were never officially referenced as such by Ford. Most 400's also had unique engine mount bolt pattern but these 400 FMX blocks had provisions for both 351C-style and 400/351M engine mounts. For 1972, the compression was reduced through the use of dished pistons. The compression reduced again for 1973 and a new timing set retarded the camshaft timing 6° to aid with reducing emissions. [...] Changes to the cylinder heads for 1975 to add the Thermactor emission system caused the exhaust port to be more restrictive than the earlier 1971-74 heads. The 400 was retuned by Ford in 1975 to use unleaded gasoline with the addition of catalytic converters to the exhaust system.|$|E

This engine {{is not to be}} confused with the Chevrolet 153. Early Iron Dukes had a Chevrolet V8 <b>bellhousing</b> (also shared with its third generation inline six) instead of the Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac <b>bellhousing</b> bolt pattern until the early 1980s when the later versions were installed in FWD applications where the 2.8L <b>bellhousing</b> bolt pattern was phased in.
