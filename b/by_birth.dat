5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> in Canada or <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent resident who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E

5|$|A monarch is {{the head}} of a monarchy, a form of {{government}} in which a state or polity is ruled by an individual who normally rules for life or until abdication, and typically inherits the throne <b>by</b> <b>birth.</b> Monarchs may be autocrats (as in all absolute monarchies) or may be ceremonial figureheads, exercising only limited or no reserve powers at all, with actual authority vested in a legislature and/or executive cabinet (as in many constitutional monarchies). In many cases, a monarch will also be linked with a state religion. Most states only have a single monarch at any given time, although a regent may rule when the monarch is a minor, not present, or otherwise incapable of ruling. Cases in which two monarchs rule simultaneously over a single state, as is the current situation in Andorra, are known as coregencies.|$|E

Success depended on finding a strait or passage through the South American land masses, or finding the southern tip of the continent and sailing around it. The South American coast was sighted on 6 December 1519, and Magellan moved cautiously southward, following the coast to reach latitude 49°S on 31 March 1520. Little if anything was known of the coast south of this point, so Magellan decided to wait out the southern winter here, and established the settlement of Puerto San Julian.|$|E

5|$|Deusdedit (died c. 664) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury, the first {{native-born}} holder of the see of Canterbury. <b>By</b> <b>birth</b> an Anglo-Saxon, he became archbishop in 655 {{and held the}} office for more than nine years until his death, probably from plague. Deusdedit's successor as archbishop {{was one of his}} priests at Canterbury. There is some controversy over the exact date of Deusdedit's death, owing to discrepancies in the medieval written work that records his life. Little is known about his episcopate, but he was considered to be a saint after his demise. A saint's life was written after his relics were moved from their original burial place in 1091.|$|E
5|$|Equestrians <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> would {{normally}} begin their military careers at c. 30 years of age. An axillary {{had to do}} 25 years of service before joining the army.

In Hadrian's time, a fourth command was added, for exceptionally able officers, of prefect of an ala milliaria. Like officers senatorial rank, hereditary equestrians held civilian posts before and after their decade of military service, whereas non-hereditary officers tended {{to remain in the}} army, commanding various units in various provinces.

5|$|From {{a survey}} by Devijver of persons whose origin can be determined, it appears that during the 1st century, the large {{majority}} (65%) of auxiliary prefects were of Italian origin. The Italian proportion dropped steadily, to 38% in the 2nd century, and 21% in the 3rd century. From the time of emperor Claudius (r. 41-54) only Roman knights were eligible to hold command of an auxiliary regiment. This status could be obtained either <b>by</b> <b>birth</b> (i.e. if the person {{was the son of}} a hereditary Roman knight; or by attaining the property qualification (100,000 denarii, the equivalent of 400 years' gross salary for an auxiliary alaris); or by military promotion: the latter were the chief centurions of legions (centurio primus pilus) who would normally be elevated to equestrian rank by the emperor after completing their single-year term as primuspilus.|$|E

Nawab Bai brought Mu'azzam back to the Mughal court, where {{he spent the next}} several years under Aurangzeb's supervision. However, Mu'azzam revolted in 1680 on the pretext of protesting Aurangzeb's treatment of Rajput chiefs. Once again, Aurangzeb followed his previous policy to dissuade Mu'azzam with gentleness and then to place him under greater vigilance.|$|E
5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A dalit <b>by</b> <b>birth,</b> his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.|$|E
