5000|$|Sailcloth is woven in two forms: {{balanced}} and unbalanced. The yarns in <b>balanced</b> <b>cloth</b> {{are the same}} diameter and weight in lengthwise (the [...] "warp") and across {{the width of the}} cloth (the [...] "fill"). Unbalanced means a heavier yarn is used in one direction. Most moderns sails are [...] "crosscut", which is an unbalanced technique where the heavier yarns is in the fill. This allows greater loads to radiate up from the clew (back lower corner) along the leech (back edge). This is especially true of mainsails and high aspect jibs.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In cloth {{simulation}} {{based on}} the spring-mass model, algorithm dealing with super-elasticity reduces the simulation efficiency to some extent. Based on the correction algorithm of modifying position and velocity, an improved algorithm is proposed which can improve the efficiency effectively. Meanwhile, for collision detection, a cloth tree updating algorithm is proposed to improve the <b>balance</b> of <b>cloth</b> tree and speed up cloth collision detection efficiency.

Merchants {{sitting in a}} row with hand <b>balance</b> and <b>cloth</b> bags for {{weighing}} merchandise were a common sight in those days. Clay pots were displayed in the market. Bamboo made baskets, large size mats for drying paddy, ladle made out of coconut shells, why you name a thing it {{will be available in}} the weekly market. Yes indeed it was an open market, every item was kept in the open ground ...|$|R

50|$|During {{this period}} the {{majority}} of the Yorkshire population was engaged in small scale farming. A growing number of families were living on the margin of subsistence and some of these families turned to crafts and trade or industrial occupations. By 1300 Yorkshire farmers had reached the present day limits of cultivation on the Pennines. Both lay and monastic landowners exploited the minerals on their estates. There were forges producing iron, and lead was being mined and smelted in the northern dales. In the West Riding there were numerous small coal workings.Until the late 12th century the cloth industry was mostly urban, focussed on York and Beverley. By 1300 the towns of Hedon, Masham, Northallerton, Ripon, Selby, Whitby and Yarm were also involved in cloth manufacture. Around this time the <b>balance</b> of <b>cloth</b> manufacturing was changing in favour of the West Riding rural communities where it was a cottage industry and free of the restrictions of town guilds.|$|R
