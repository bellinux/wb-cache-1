EGF shares certain events with Grand Forks, such as the Potato Bowl parade and First Night, a New Year's celebration that's alcohol free. Catfish Days, based on an annual summer catfishing tournament, attracts {{people from all over}} the United States and Canada. It is one of the largest fishing tournaments in the region.|$|E

60|$|May 23.--I breakfasted with Chantrey, and met {{the celebrated}} Coke of Norfolk,[208] a very {{pleasing}} man, {{who gave me}} some account of his plantations. I understand from him that, like every wise man, he planted land that would not let for 5s. per acre, but which now produces £3000 a year in wood. He talked of the trees which he had planted as being so thick that a man could not fathom[209] them. Withers, he said, was never employed save upon one or two small jobs of about twenty acres on which every expense was bestowed {{with a view to}} early growth. So much for Withers. I shall have a rod in pickle for him if worth while.[210] After sitting to Chantrey for the last time, I called on Lady Shelley, P.P.C., and was sorry to find her worse than she had been. Dined with Lady Stafford, where I met the two Lochs, John and James. The former gave me his promise for a cadetship to Allan Cunningham's son; I have a similar promise from Lord Melville, and thus I am in the situation in which I have been at Gladdies Wiel,[211] where I have caught two trouts, one with the fly, the other with the <b>bobber.</b> I have landed both, and so I will now. Mr. Loch also promised me to get out Shortreed as a free mariner. Tom Grenville was at dinner.|$|E

50|$|Some good baits for perch include worms, {{live and}} dead minnows, small {{freshwater}} clams, crickets, and any small lure resembling any of these. Larger perch are often caught on large live minnow on a jighead, especially when fished over weed beds. <b>Bobbers,</b> if used, should be spindle type {{for the least}} resistance when the bait is struck, but small round <b>Bobbers</b> work well too, yet indicate any slight pull of the bait. Raising the rod top is usually more than enough force to set the hook.|$|R

50|$|The term 'chopper' did {{not appear}} in print until the mid-1960s, over 30 years after the bob-job was invented. The chopper is a more stylistically and {{technically}} extreme evolution of the bob-job, which emerged after the highly elaborate, heavily chromed bob-jobs {{which appeared in the}} late 1940s and 1950s. <b>Bobbers</b> are typically built around unmodified frames, while choppers use either highly modified or custom-made frames. Chopper frames are often cut and welded into shape. Thus, <b>bobbers</b> are fairly easy to create from stock motorcycles and are generally hand built.|$|R

50|$|Another {{aspect of}} the {{backlash}} was a return to more traditional styling. <b>Bobbers</b> were again in style. Stock rake machines with a stripped down look, often with flat or primer paints in charcoal grey, flat black, olive drab or brown.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{there were}} choppers, {{there was the}} <b>bobber,</b> meaning a {{motorcycle}} that had been [...] "bobbed," [...] or relieved of excess weight by removing parts, particularly the fenders, {{with the intent of}} making it lighter and thus faster, or at least making it look better in the eyes of a rider seeking a more minimalist ride. [...] An early example of a <b>bobber</b> is the 1940 Indian Sport Scout [...] "Bob-Job" [...] which toured in the 1998 The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition. [...] Indian Scouts and Chiefs of the time came with extravagantly large, heavily valanced fenders, nearly reaching the center of the wheel on the luxurious 1941 Indian Series 441 while racing bikes had tiny fenders or none at all. The large and well-appointed bikes exemplified the [...] "dresser" [...] motorcycle aesthetic and providing a counterpoint to the minimalist <b>bobber,</b> and café racers.|$|E

5000|$|A deely <b>bobber</b> (also deeley <b>bobber</b> or deeley boppers) is {{a novelty}} item of {{headgear}} comprising a headband to which are affixed two springy protrusions resembling the antennae of insects or of stereotypical little green men. These [...] "antennae" [...] may be topped with simple plastic shapes or more elaborate and fanciful decorations, such as mini pom poms or light emitting diodes. The name [...] "deely bobber" [...] is a genericized trademark; other names include deely-boppers, bonce boppers, or space boppers. In June 1982, a New York Times headline called them Martian antennae.|$|E

40|$|We report {{experimental}} {{evidence for the}} formation of chiral <b>bobbers</b> [...] a surface topological spin texture [...] at the surface/interface of FeGe films grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). After establishing the presence of skyrmions in FeGe/Si(111) thin film samples through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and topological Hall effect, we perform magnetization measurements that reveal an inverse relationship between film thickness and the slope of the susceptibility (dX/dH). We present evidence for the evolution as a function of film thickness, L, from a skyrmion phase for L L_D/ 2, where L_D ~ 70 nm is the FeGe pitch length. We show using micromagnetic simulations that chiral <b>bobbers,</b> earlier predicted to be metastable, are in fact the stable ground state in the presence of an additional interfacial Rashba Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).

50|$|The players {{came out}} to warm up, and almost {{immediately}} vanished back up the tunnel. The rioters then set upon the <b>Bobbers</b> Stand, ripping out seats and brandishing them as weapons. A message appeared on the stadium's electronic scoreboard, stating that the match would not start until they returned to their allocated area, but this was ignored; an appeal from Millwall manager George Graham over the ground's loudspeaker also had no effect. It was only when Graham appeared on the sideline that the spectators finally returned to the Kenilworth Stand. Even after this some managed {{to find their way}} into the Main Stand, where isolated fights broke out and more seats were removed. The arrival of police dogs helped to clear the pitch; the match began on time, with many watching from atop the <b>Bobbers</b> Stand after climbing the floodlight pylons.|$|R
