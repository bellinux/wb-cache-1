30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the take-up speed {{affected}} the final shape of the braid. The higher υtu, the lower the <b>braid</b> <b>angle.</b> However, when using only one cylinder to model a multifilament yarn, it appears that α was only slightly affected by the take-up speed. Although the difference in <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between model “E/ 1 ” and the real braid was negligible, the difference in α for the lowest take-up speed was as high as 23.3 ∘. Increasing the number of cylinders from one to three, an improved correlation was seen between the simulations and the experimental results. For the smallest υtu, the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> determined for model “A/ 3 ” was 25.43 ∘. Although the difference in <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between the virtual and the real braid was as high as 13.67 ∘, a noticeable improvement with respect to the previous case was achieved as far as the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> is concerned. Increasing the take-up speed, the difference between the calculated <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> for virtual braids and the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> of a real braid decreased. On the other hand, it must be emphasised that the running time of X/ 3 simulations was more than double the time required to complete the X/ 1 simulations (23 h compared to 51 h). Increasing the number of cylinders used to model a multifilament yarn to seven, the computational time increased to 113 h. Although the use of seven cylinders to model the real yarn did not lead to a significant difference in terms of <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> with respect to the previous X/ 1 and X/ 3 models for high take-up speeds, a better correlation between the simulations and the experimental results was found for small υtu. The difference in the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> between the virtual and the real braid was as low as 7.54 ∘ for υtu= 63 mm/min. The apparent irregular braid shapes for models X/ 7 are due solely to the bad rendering of the prisms shaped around the beam elements (Fig.  8 c).|$|E

40|$|Circular overbraiding of {{composite}} preforms on complex mandrels currently lacks automatic {{generation of}} machine control data. To solve this limitation, an inverse kinematics-based procedure {{was designed and}} implemented for circular braiding machines with optional guide rings, resulting in a take-up speed profile for a given <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> distribution on mandrels with complex 3 D shapes including non-axisymmetric, optionally eccentric cross-sections that can vary in shape and size along an optionally curved mandrel centerline, allowing a curved machine movement. This procedure reduces the problem size, resulting in a short computation time, fit for CAE process chain integration. Numerical control data was generated for a complex mandrel with a specified <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> and a triaxial braid.

The effect of notch size and notch position were investigated. Damage initiation and propagation in notched and unnotched coupons were also examined. Theory developed {{to predict the}} normal stress distribution near an open hole and failure for tape laminated composites was evaluated for its applicability to 2 D triaxial braided textile composite materials. Four different fiber architectures were considered; <b>braid</b> <b>angle,</b> yarn and braider size, percentage of longitudinal yarns and braider angle varied.

S 12 is braids that are made of 0. 12 -mm-diameter stainless steel fibers, PVA/S 12 is S 12 coated with PVA.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The stress {{distribution}} in braided composites is complex even for simple uniaxial loading. The interlacing of the tows creates a complex load path {{that results in}} full three-dimensional (3 D) {{stress distribution}}. The location and magnitude of peak stresses depend on the particular stress component and vary with various braid architecture parameters such as <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> and degree of waviness. Finite element analyzes for different braids were performed and it was seen that the peak stresses in the tow mainly occur at the undulating region and {{along the edges of}} the tow. Stress distribution in braids was compared with those in ‘equivalent laminates’. A considerable volume of the tow (10 – 45 % for the considered range of parameters) had stresses larger than an ‘equivalent lamina’. The severity of stresses in a braid as compared to those in an equivalent lamina depends upon braid geometric parameters. <b>Braid</b> <b>angle</b> changes the stress distribution in the tow considerably. However, most of that effect is due to the orientation of the tows in the þ and directions and can be eliminated by matching the loading on the tow of different braids. The severity of peak stresses seems to be increasing linearly with an increase in waviness ratio. KEY WORDS: textile composites, stress analysis, braids, finite element modeling...|$|E

40|$|Textile {{composites}} can {{be tailored}} to meet specific thermo-mechanical requirements for structural applications. The focus {{of this research is}} on 2 x 2 biaxial braided composites since they have good stiffness and strength properties. Moreover, they have potentially better impact and fatigue resistance than laminated composites. Along with good properties, they have a reduced manufacturing cost because much of the fabrication can be automated. In order to exploit these benefits, thorough understanding of the effect of various factors on their material behavior is necessary. Obtaining effective mechanical properties is the first order of concern in any structural analysis. This work presents an investigation of the effect of various parameters like <b>braid</b> <b>angle,</b> waviness ratio, stacking sequence and material properties on the effective engineering properties of the 2 x 2 braids. To achieve this goal, three dimensional finite element micromechanics models were developed first. Extensive parametric studies were conducted for two material systems: 1).

30|$|From this study, {{it appears}} that {{modelling}} a multifilament yarn with a single cylinder (of solid or beam elements) is not the optimum method {{for the creation of}} virtual braid models. Although computationally cost-efficient, this method led to a large mismatch between the simulation and the experimental outcomes as far as the <b>braid</b> <b>angle</b> and yarn width are concerned. The use of three or more cylinders to model a single thread enhanced the quality of the shaped braid, however at the cost of a higher computational time. Nevertheless, the FE results only partially matched the experimental results. The possible causes of discrepancy between the experimental and FE results are associated with the simple elastic material model used for the yarns, and parameters such as yarn tension, yarn-to-yarn and yarn-to-eyelet coefficient of friction. In order to reduce the computational time when simulating multifilament yarns, the discrete element method (DEM) could be used to create on-the-fly beam elements during the virtual braiding simulation.|$|E
