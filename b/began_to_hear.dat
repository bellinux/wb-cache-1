Thus, in the spring of 1949, the Bird Commission adopted a category formula that set out certain reimbursement percentages for each category of claim, except for unusual circumstances.|$|E

The Africans mostly allied with the royalists and the British, as they understood that if Saint-Domingue's independence were to be led by white slave masters, it would probably mean even harsher treatment and increased injustice for the African population. The plantation owners {{would be free to}} operate slavery as they pleased without the existing minimal accountability to their French peers.|$|E

This was the Abbé Andrew Fournet, the underground pastor of Maillé, who would give Bichier a new direction in her life, answering her longings. The following week she set out at night on a donkey, led by the same former servant, {{to take part in}} the service. After a journey of three hours, they arrived at the site. After the Mass, Fournet <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the confessions of the people. As Bichier approached him, the peasants gave way to her, an aristocrat. Fournet challenged Bichier over her presumption and she let him hear the confessions of the entire congregation, going last just as the sun was rising.|$|E
25|$|When Michel was sixteen, she {{experienced}} a seizure and {{was diagnosed with}} psychosis caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. She soon had depression and was treated at a psychiatric hospital. By {{the time she was}} twenty, she had become intolerant of various religious objects, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> voices. Her condition worsened despite medication, and she became suicidal. Convinced she was possessed, her family appealed to a Catholic priest for an exorcism. While rejected at first, after much hesitation, two priests got permission from the local bishop in 1975. After her death, Michel's parents and the two priests were found guilty of negligent homicide, and were sentenced to six months in jail (reduced to three years of probation), and a fine. The Catholic church changed its position stating she was mentally ill, not possessed. The case has been cited {{as an example of a}} misidentified mental disorder, negligence, abuse and religious hysteria.|$|E
25|$|About an hour long canal {{ride from}} an embarcadero, pier, lies Isla de las Muñecas, or the Island of the Dolls. It is the best-known chinampa, or {{floating}} garden, in Xochimilco. It {{belonged to a}} man named Don Julián Santana Barrera, {{a native of the}} La Asunción neighborhood. Santana Barrera was a loner, who was rarely seen in most of Xochimilco. According to the legend, SantanaBarrera discovered a little girl drowned in mysterious circumstances in the canals. He also found a doll floating nearby and, assuming it belonged to the deceased girl, hung it from a tree as a sign of respect. After this, he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> whispers, footsteps, and anguished wails in the darkness even though his hut—hidden deep inside the woods of Xochimilco—was miles away from civilization. Driven by fear, he spent the next fifty years hanging more and more dolls, some missing body parts, all over the island in an attempt to appease what he believed to be the drowned girl’s spirit.|$|E

Baley suggests that the Mohave had returned to [...] "finish them off", but after finding a large cache of supplies celebrated their windfall, which included Rose's eight-dollar-a-bottle brandy. In Baley's opinion, the newfound spoils were likely the only reason the Mohave didn't follow the fleeing wagon train, now en route to rendezvous with the Baley company at their mountain camp.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he wrote Connotations, Copland {{had come to the}} view that serial {{composition}} was [...] "like looking at a picture from a different point of view" [...] and used it [...] "with the hope that it would freshen and enrich my [...] technique." [...] Part of that changed viewpoint, Copland said, [...] "was that I <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> chords that I wouldn't have heard otherwise. Heretofore, I had been thinking tonally, but this was a new way of moving tones about." [...] Serialism also allowed Copland a synthesis of serial and non-serial practices that had long concerned Copland and he had previously felt impossible to attain. One challenge Copland said he faced while he composed Connotations was [...] "to construct an overall line that had continuity, dramatic force and an inherent unity." [...] He stated that he had faced a similar challenge in his Orchestral Variations (his orchestration of the Piano Variations). He added that while dodecaphonic techniques supplied [...] "the building blocks" [...] for Connotations, it was up to him to supply [...] "the edifice" [...] that these blocks would eventually form.|$|E

In response to one plan, in which prisoners would storm the camp gates and make a run for the forest, where they would connect with partisans, the Rebbe advised, [...] "Until we see that the Nazis are about to exterminate us, it is prohibited for anyone to sacrifice his life and put himself in a situation of certain death. But one must remain vigilant, and as soon as it becomes clear that the Nazis are ready to attack us, we must do everything in our power to rise up against them." [...] The prisoners decided to follow his advice. Some time later, after most of the prisoners had been transported from Warsaw, 500 remaining prisoners did stage a revolt.

2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Judgment Day 2006 {{involved}} Rey Mysterio and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) {{with the two}} battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 5 episode of SmackDown!, after Rey Mysterio expressed his feelings about being World Heavyweight Champion, John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield came out and declared himself the number-one contender. JBL immediately began degrading Mysterio because of his Mexican heritage, saying he was an illegal immigrant and that Mysterio doesn’t deserve to be champion. Mysterio reacted by saying that he'd fight anyone at any time. In turn, JBL announced that Mysterio would face off against Mark Henry later that night. During the match, Mysterio tried to use his quickness to avoid Henry, but was easily countered by Henry's power. Mysterio was able to hit a 619 and a Seated senton, but was defeated when Henry hit the World's Strongest Slam for the pin. The next week on SmackDown!, JBL announced that Mysterio would take on The Great Khali later that night. During the match, Mysterio attempted a springboard dropkick, but it had no effect. Khali then picked up Mysterio and hit a Two-handed chokeslam for the win. On the May 19 episode of SmackDown!, JBL said that Mysterio didn't look so well due to the beatings he endured in past weeks and that he probably didn't even know what day it was. Mysterio answered and told him the day, May 19. Kane, who in recent weeks attacked anyone who said May 19, came out and faced off against Mysterio. Kane dominated most of the match, hitting a variety of power moves. Kane then <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> voices in his head saying May 19, which caused him {{to go into a}} psychotic trance. JBL told [...] him to finish the job, but mistakenly said May 19, causing Kane to attack him. As a result, the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E

[...] It was also said that on another occasion, when he was looking in the mirror, he told Empress Xiao, [...] "I have a good neck, and I'm waiting for someone to sever it." [...] Empress Xiao, surprised and distressed by his comment, asked him why he was saying so, and he responded and smiled, [...] "Honor and wealth and poverty and dishonor, as well as pain and pleasure, all come in cycles. [...] Why be distressed?" [...] Meanwhile, not wanting to return to the turbulent north, he discussed with his officials about moving the capital to Danyang (丹楊, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu). [...] His elite Xiaoguo Army guards, missing their families in the north and realizing that Emperor Yang did not intend to return north, began to desert. [...] Their commanders Sima Dekan (司馬德勘), Yuan Li (元禮), and Pei Qiantong (裴虔通), worried that Emperor Yang would punish them, began considering rebelling and taking the Xiaoguo Army north themselves instead. [...] They associated with a number of other officers and officials, discussing so publicly that even the ladies in waiting <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> about it. [...] When one reported to Empress Xiao, Empress Xiao had her report to Emperor Yang—but Emperor Yang, not wishing to hear about the bad news, beheaded her.

2500|$|In May 1996 López changed ring personas {{once again}} as he became [...] "Black Warrior", a bad guy (called a rudo in Spanish) who teamed with his uncle Blue Panther and other Lagunero workers such as Dr. Wagner Jr.. With the new image came success, as on October 15, Black Warrior {{defeated}} El Dandy to win the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship, his first singles championship. In 1997 Warrior, Panther, and Dr. Wagner Jr. almost won the CMLL World Trios Championship, but lost in the finals of the tournament to crown new champions. Warrior briefly parted with the NWA World Light Heavyweight Title when Shocker beat him in May 1997 but regained it in March 1998. On December 18, 1998, the team of Warrior, Panther, and Wagner, Jr. finally won the CMLL World Trios Championship after several attempts when they defeated Bestia Salvaje, Scorpio Jr., and Zumbido to win the vacant title. The team, billed as Ola Lagunero held the Trios title for over 1,140 days. On March 6, 2000, Black Warrior lost the NWA World Light Heavyweight title to Tarzan Boy after a reign lasting 727 days. In subsequent months Black Warrior <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> cheers, especially because of his high risk [...] "Tope of death" [...] move, a (high speed dive out of the ring).

In the semi-final Warrior faced Black Tiger III and the two did a [...] "double turn" [...] where Black Warrior became a fan favourite (called a técnico in Mexico) while Black Tiger III became a rudo. Warrior won the tournament when he defeated previous year's winner Negro Casas to claim the 2001 [...] "Leyenda de Plata" [...] tropy. In February 2002, Ola Lagunero vacated the trios title when Panther and Wagner kicked Black Warrior out of the group. On March 17, 2002, the new Ola Lagunero (Panther, Dr. Wagner Jr., and Fuerza Guerrera) defeated Warrior, Mr. Niebla, and Antifaz del Norte in a match for the vacant championship. Three months later Warrior, Mr. Niebla, and Atlantis won the CMLL trios title from the new Ola Lagunera. The trio lost the title March 2003 but Warrior regained it on July 9, 2004, with El Canek and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr., beginning a 133-day reign.|$|E
