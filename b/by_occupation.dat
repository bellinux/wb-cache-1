5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes <b>by</b> <b>occupation,</b> they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{conception}} of Tutsi and Hutu as distinct {{ethnic groups in}} no way reflects the pre-colonial relationship between them.

40|$|John Dewey {{lived and}} worked in an {{environment}} where the manual training movement was ever-present. For Dewey his own unique version of manual training is labeled occupations. Nevertheless, over the years what Dewey meant <b>by</b> <b>occupations</b> has been either misinterpreted or ignored for a plethora of reasons. This manual training climate that Dewey was a part of was dominant and Dewey could not and did not ignore it. He did transform it. Later on published sources use Dewey’s notion of occupations and in many cases misinterpret what he meant <b>by</b> <b>occupations</b> as a method. Finally what Dewey actually says about occupations is found in his Early Works and Middle Works. This analysis of what Dewey means <b>by</b> <b>occupations,</b> seeing its complexity, value, and thereby seeing its distinction from vocational education gives clarity to what Dewey believed about occupations but also shows its value for teaching and learning in schools today. Finally, a part of the confusion of Dewey’s notion of occupations may be found in the various ways Dewey employed the term...|$|R

25|$|Ronald Inden, the Indologist, {{agrees that}} there has been no universally {{accepted}} definition. For example, for some early European documenters it was thought to correspond with the endogamous varnas referred to in ancient Indian scripts, and its meaning corresponds in the sense of estates. To later Europeans of the Raj era it was endogamous jatis, rather than varnas, that represented caste, such as the 2378 jatis that colonial administrators classified <b>by</b> <b>occupation</b> in the early 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The answer, he said, would largely {{depend on}} the way in which {{sovereignty}} was said to have been acquired. He observed that although the legal authorities claimed that sovereignty over Australia was acquired <b>by</b> <b>occupation,</b> the country was not vacant, but already occupied; nor had it been conquered or ceded under a treaty. Rather, Judge Willis said, sovereignty was actually acquired under the principle expounded by Vattel in his The Law of Nations, referred to by both the prosecution and the defence, that a 'civilised' people may take possession of territory occupied by 'uncivilised' people, provided they leave for them sufficient land for their sustenance.|$|E

25|$|Muscle {{attachment}} sites (also called entheses) {{have been}} {{thought to be}} impacted {{in the same way}} causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entheseal changes. These changes were widely used to study activity-patterns, but research has shown that processes associated with aging have a greater impact than occupational stresses. It has also been shown that geometric changes to bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ in their underlying cause with the latter poorly affected <b>by</b> <b>occupation.</b> Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations but in general these are also manifestations of the aging process.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} the Helvetic Republic is still very {{controversial}} within Switzerland. It represents {{the first time that}} Switzerland as a unified country existed and a step toward the modern federal state. For the first time the population was defined as Swiss, not as members of a specific canton. For cantons like Vaud, Thurgau and Ticino the Republic was a time of political freedom from other cantons. However the Republic also marked a time of foreign domination and revolution. For the cantons of Bern, Schwyz and Nidwalden {{it was a time of}} military defeat followed <b>by</b> <b>occupation.</b> In 1995 the Federal Parliament chose to not celebrate the 200 year anniversary of the Helvetic Republic, but to allow individual cantons to celebrate if they wished.|$|E
25|$|Westervelt was {{the eldest}} son of Ari and Vrowti Westervelt. Ari Westervelt was a builder <b>by</b> <b>occupation.</b> He built several houses in Franklin Street, New York, and {{constructed}} the South Church in Schraalenburgh in today's Bergenfield borough. Westervelt was born in Tenafly, New Jersey, on January 20, 1800 and was baptized at Schraalenburgh on February 16, being the first child to receive that sacrament {{after the completion of}} the new church. The Westervelts then resided at the old family homestead on Tenafly Road midway between Englewood and Tenafly. When Ari Westervelt was working on improving the riverfront, he moved, together with his infant son, to New York in 1804, to be nearer his work. It was to his father that Jacob Aaron owed his good education. His father died when Westervelt was only 14.|$|E

25|$|Balkenende, a jurist <b>by</b> <b>occupation,</b> {{worked for}} the Dutch Academic Senate and the Christian Democratic Appeal think tank from 1982 until 1998. Balkenende became a {{professor}} of Christian theology at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 1993. He {{was elected to the}} House of Representatives after the Dutch general election of 1998, serving from 19 May 1998 until 22 July 2002. After the then Leader of the Christian Democratic Appeal and Parliamentary leader in the House of Representatives Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stepped down after an internal power struggle between him and then party chair Marnix van Rij, Balkenende was selected to succeed him in both positions, and became the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) for the Dutch general election of 2002. The Christian Democratic Appeal became the surprising winner of the election, gaining 14 seats becoming the largest party in the House of Representatives. This success was in part owed to Balkenende's neutral attitude in the debates with Pim Fortuyn, the eponymous leader of the Pim Fortuyn List party who was assassinated during the national election campaign on 6 May 2002.|$|E
500|$|Rhodesian non-work {{days were}} first defined in 1895, by The Bills of Exchange Regulations passed by Leander Starr Jameson, the second {{administrator}} of the territory appointed by the British South Africa Company.

Shangani Day was replaced as a public holiday <b>by</b> <b>Occupation</b> Day in 1920, but continued to be unofficially marked thereafter. Occupation Day, held on 12 September each year, marked the anniversary of the arrival of the Pioneer Column at Fort Salisbury in 1890, and their raising of the Union Jack on the kopje overlooking the site.

Geographic inequalities in all-cause premature mortality <b>by</b> <b>occupations</b> Background and aims Although we examined the patterns of geographic inequalities in premature mortality for all occupations in the main analysis, the patterns may vary (substantially) according to occupations. Therefore, we examined the occupation-specific geographic inequality in premature mortality for the overall study period. This analysis may further facilitate understanding of the possible pathways of emerging geographic inequalities in Japan. Methods Following the previous report of the Population Census, 1 we summarized the 11 occupations into six groups to increase the statistical power as follows: I. clerical, technical and managerial occupations (i. e., (1) specialist and technical workers, (2) administrative and managerial workers, and (3) clerica...|$|R
