50|$|Beta hairpins were {{originally}} categorized solely {{by the number}} of amino acid residues in their loop sequences, such that they were named one-residue, two-residue, etc. This system, however, is somewhat ambiguous as it {{does not take into account}} whether the residues that signal the end of the hairpin are singly or doubly hydrogen bonded to one another. An improved means of classification has since been proposed by Miner-White and Poet. Beta hairpins are broken into four distinct classes as depicted in the publication's Figure 1. Each class begins with the smallest possible number of loop residues and progressively increases the loop size by removing hydrogen bonds in the beta sheet. The primary hairpin of class 1 is a one-residue loop where the <b>bound</b> <b>residues</b> share two hydrogen bonds. One hydrogen bond is then removed to create a three-residue loop, which is the secondary hairpin of class 1. Singly <b>bound</b> <b>residues</b> are counted in the loop sequence but also signal the end of the loop, thus defining this hairpin as a three-residue loop. This single hydrogen bond is then removed to create the tertiary hairpin; a five-residue loop with doubly <b>bound</b> <b>residues.</b> This pattern continues indefinitely and defines all beta hairpins within the class. Class 2 follows the same pattern beginning with a two-residue loop with terminating residues that share two hydrogen bonds. Class 3 begins with a three-residue, and class 4 with a four-residue. Class 5 does not exist as that primary hairpin is already defined in class 1.|$|E

In anaerobic digester sludge, TBBPA biotransformed rapidly with a 50 % disappearance time (DT 50) of 19 days, though little mineralization (1. 1 %) was observed.

In anaerobic soils, 48. 3 – 100 % of the TBBPA was incorporated into the soils as non-extractable <b>bound</b> <b>residue</b> with < 4 % mineralized.

In anaerobic sediments the DT 50 for TBBPA ranged from 28 to 42 days, whereas in aerobic sediments the DT 50 for TBBPA ranged from 48 to 84 days and depended on the initial dose concentration. Most of the TBBPA in the sediment studies was incorporated as a non-extractable <b>bound</b> <b>residue</b> with little mineralization observed.

This study was conducted at two different concentrations (1 and 10 μg/L) of 14 C-labeled pirimiphos-methyl for 28 days uptake and 14 days depuration according to the OECD 305 test guideline. The BCFss for total radioactive residues in whole fish were 1, 251 and 1, 277 for low and high concentrations, respectively. The BCFk based on the uptake and depuration rate constants were 1, 200 for both low and high concentrations. During the depuration phase, the accumulated test substance was rapidly depurated from fish. Greater than 95 % of the residue at steady-state was depurated after 2 days. Although the measured BCF values were high, pirimiphos-methyl could be evaluated as a low risk from bioaccumulation by aquatic organisms due to the short depuration period and low amount of <b>bound</b> <b>residue</b> (1. 5 %).

It begins by defining <b>bound</b> <b>residues</b> and discussing soil–compound interactions. The application of model compound studies for elucidating specific binding interactions is reviewed along with long-term laboratory and field soil incubation experiments. The use of radiolabelled compounds, isotopically labelled compounds and combinations of both in these experiments are outlined by examples from the literature, along with sequential extraction schemes for releasing <b>bound</b> <b>residues</b> from soil, sediment and humic materials. The importance of spectroscopic methods, and particularly nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for characterising the structure of <b>bound</b> <b>residues</b> in soil and sedimentary humic substances is discussed and illustrated by examples from the literature on the subject. The process of bound residue formation is highly complex and requires further research to establish the mechanisms of bound residue formation and their subsequent environmental and toxicological fate. Much of the uncertainty regarding the elucidation of bound residue formation arises from our poor understanding of the structure of soil and sedimentary organic matter.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the dietary risk {{resulting}} {{from the use of}} pesticides or veterinary drugs the nature of the chemical residues on food commodities needs to be determined. Elucidation {{of the nature of the}} chemical residue is carried out using radiolabelled studies where the radiolabelled xenobiotic is applied or dosed in a manner which reflects use conditions. Food commodities are exhaustively extracted to remove the individual components of the residue. Once extracted the identity and toxicological significance of the components. can be assessed and, where appropriate, analytical methods developed to quantitatively determine the amount of the components in food items. Depending on the characteristics of the components of the residue, the extraction regime may not remove all the chemical residue from the sample matrix. These residues are frequently characterised as being "bound", however the amount and nature of this residue will be highly dependant on the extraction regime used. To provide guidance and standardisation a definition of the term "bound residues" is recommended. This definition builds on a previous IUPAC definition but takes account of the current availability of enzyme systems which effectively solubilise the entire matrix rather than extracting the residue. It is also recommended that where the extraction falls short of the full definition then the residues should be termed as "unextractable" and the conditions of the extraction should also be defined. Where <b>residues</b> are <b>bound</b> the assessment of the dietary risk cannot be directly assessed thus raising issues relating to the significance of the <b>bound</b> <b>residue.</b> The overall toxicological significance of a <b>bound</b> <b>residue</b> will depend primarily on its bioavailability and the level of exposure.
