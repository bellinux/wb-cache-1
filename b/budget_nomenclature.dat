Eddy viscosity, eddy diffusivity (including formulations of the generalized gradient diffusion hypothesis), ‘structure ’ (Bardina and Leonard), mixed and dynamic models are scrutinized. The performance of the models is examined in terms of the main flow variables and also with respect to the ‘internal ’ behavior of the models in terms of the relative contributions to the turbulent kinetic energy <b>budget.</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> B buoyancy term DF diffusion term DP dissipation term ENJ J flux component gLUFr / 2 = Froude number k turbulent / subgrid kinetic energy.

40|$|Departure runway usage is a {{major source}} of delay in the US National Airspace System. Additionally, the current rst-come-rst-served {{paradigm}} for al-locating departure runway usage produces strong incentives to airlines to spend all this delay time on the taxiway, even though this can result in wasted fuel. In this paper, a novel dynamic second-price auction method for allocating runway usage is de-veloped. Analytical and simulated results are ob-tained that suggest the proposed method does not increase total delay, and that almost all delay is spent at the gate (thereby saving fuel). Thou-sands of simulations of a realistic scenario at John F. Kennedy International Airport indicate that this new mechanism oers two benets over the current rst-come- rst-served mechanism. The rst bene-t suggests this mechanism can reduce airline costs (beyond the savings on fuel). The second benet suggests the auction mechanism can generate more equitable spread of delay across airlines by an ap-propriate parametrization over <b>budget</b> constraints. <b>Nomenclature</b> The set of airlines. The set of ights belonging to airline. The set of all ights (i. e., =). The set of aircraft classes. The class of ight. The amount of time since the most recent takeo of aircraft class occurred.
