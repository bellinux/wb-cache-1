5|$|Botha, who {{had been}} asked by the Union's first Governor-General Viscount Gladstone to form a government, began to make {{policies}} and speeches that appeared to Coghlan to <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> South Africans of British origin. The Attorney-General J. B. M. Hertzog interpreted the convention {{in a way that}} Coghlan considered to be to the detriment of English-speakers. Coghlan came to the conclusion in 1910 that Southern Rhodesia's joining the Union was much further off than he had previously thought, though he still saw it as the territory's inevitable destiny, whose timing and terms the local electorate must determine. At this time, he rejected the notion of responsible government—self-government while retaining colonial status—on the grounds that he thought it would take up to two decades to achieve. He was furthermore against the idea of keeping Rhodesia for English-speaking settlers, seeing in that end the same racial discrimination he perceived the Dutch-speakers to be displaying against the British in the Union.|$|E
5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs}} of residents in that GRC.|$|E

25|$|Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute {{would require}} the person subject to a {{potential}} violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined that it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> require challengers of a law to wait until they faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although {{a number of cases}} had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state.|$|E
25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E

25|$|Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King's Birthday Honours, {{having been}} {{passed over for}} the honour in February. He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915. In the summer of 1915 Wilson {{believed}} that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive. He declined French’s offer of a corps command (20 August) claiming it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> divisional commanders who deserved promotion. His efforts {{to be the main}} go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG.|$|E
25|$|A {{legitimate}} expectation does not arise {{when it is}} made ultra vires of the decision-maker's statutory powers, that is, when the decision-maker lacked legal power to make the representation. Courts are reluctant to protect such an expectation that has been created. The rationale is undoubtedly clear and rests on {{the scope of the}} administrative authority's powers. It prevents public authorities from expanding their powers simply by making ultra vires representations. Secondly, allowing public authorities to be bound by their ultra vires representations may potentially prevent them from exercising their statutory powers or duties. Also, allowing a public authority to be bound could <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> third parties who are affected. However, courts may be obliged to protect {{legitimate expectation}}s arising from representations by unauthorized officers of the public body.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

25|$|In 624 Abu Bakr was {{involved}} in the first battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca, known as the Battle of Badr, but did not fight, instead acting as one of the guards of Muhammad's tent. In 625 he participated in the Battle of Uhud which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims. Before the battle begun, Abu Bakr's son Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr, who was still non-Muslim and was fighting {{from the side of the}} Quraysh, came forward and threw down a challenge for a duel. Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad. His son later converted to Islam and gained fame during the Muslim conquest of Syria as a fierce warrior. In the second phase of the battle, Khalid ibn al-Walid’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind, changing a Muslim victory to defeat. Many Muslim warriors fled from the battlefield due to fear or to plunder the spoils of war. So did Abu Bakr, however, he was among the first to return according to few Sunni Hadith. Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Talhah and a few other Muslims remained guarding Muhammad from the attacks of the Quraysh soldiers, majority of Shia and many Sunni Hadith agree to this. Criticisms of his lacklustre military achievements in comparison with the extremely accomplished Ali should be put into context: Abu Bakr was a middle aged man during these battles, was not a soldier but a merchant by trade, and had never seen battle before – it may thus <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> directly compare him with Ali in this regard.|$|E
500|$|Branson also later thanked local {{residents}} {{for their help}} at the accident site, describing how he [...] "was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E

He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can do at this time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E
500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised by many critics; Lejeune {{wrote that the}} actors portray [...] "real people doing real things under real conditions", while the {{reviewer}} for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "a talented cast sees to it that no island character study shall go unnoticed", while the lead roles [...] "make {{the most of their}} opportunities". The reviewer for the Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part [...] "with unusual subtlety", and thought that among the remainder of the cast [...] "there are so many excellent performances that it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> pick out two or three names for special praise". The critic Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, thought that Radford and Watson were the stand-out actors of the film, although he also considered the rest of the cast strong.|$|E
500|$|The album {{did receive}} some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of [...] "slid past notes and draw out the final syllables of lines are {{signatures}} indistinguishable from tics". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's [...] "delicate upper range is nicely attuned {{to some of}} the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his [...] "trademark delivery" [...] is [...] "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's [...] "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it would <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, [...] "Ain't nobody perfect".|$|E
