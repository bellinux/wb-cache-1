5|$|Chicago <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> strong sports culture. On August 1, 2006, it {{was named}} Best Sports City in the US by Sporting News. Chicagoans are famous for their rabid support of their home teams: the Chicago Bears, Chicago Bulls, Chicago Cubs, Chicago White Sox, Chicago Blackhawks, Chicago Wolves, and more recently, Chicago Sky (WNBA), Chicago Fire, the Chicago Red Stars (the new women's soccer team), and the Chicago Machine. Other {{events such as the}} Chicago Marathon, one of the five World Marathon Majors, would also play a part in Chicago's Olympic-planning process.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, {{the resort}} <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> £14million (2011:£) {{investment}} and improvement scheme, following which the resort {{was known as}} Funcoast World. Around this time, many of the structures were subject to change with the demolition of many chalets and some central buildings including the Windsor dining hall and Empire theatre. The 1980s saw {{the removal of the}} miniature railway and chairlift system, but also saw {{the construction of a new}} indoor swimming pool named the Funsplash and an outdoor fun pool.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset River Authority was {{established}} in the 1960s, and later became part of Wessex Water. Tidal models were used to explore the effects of any improvements to the river, and the likelihood of adverse consequences, i.e. flooding and subsequent silting. Engineering works were undertaken at the Parrett, King's Sedgemoor Drain, and River Brue systems, to try to ensure that the agricultural land <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> potable water supply in the groundwaters from the Quantock Hills to the coastline.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} {{brought the}} score to 41–26 with 11:29 {{remaining in the}} game. Florida State received the post-touchdown kickoff, then <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 10-yard holding penalty against Virginia Tech. Three subsequent plays failed to gain another first down, however, and on fourth down, a pass by Manuel was intercepted by Virginia Tech's Davon Morgan {{and returned to the}} Florida State 34-yard line. With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game. The Hokies went three-and-out, but capitalized on the good starting field position by kicking a 43-yard field goal that increased their lead to 44–26.|$|E

5|$|Culbreth was the first-base umpire for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In the third inning, Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base umpire Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} be thrown by a Mets pitcher. Santana <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> close call on the third base line by umpire Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltrán line drive {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011 it was {{reported}} that Benn had moved out of his home in Holland Park Avenue, London, into a smaller flat nearby that <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> warden. In 2012 Benn was awarded an honorary degree from Goldsmiths, University of London. He was also the honorary president of the Goldsmiths Students' Union, who successfully campaigned for him to retract comments dismissing the Julian Assange rape allegations. In February 2013 Benn was among those who gave their support to the People's Assembly in a letter published by The Guardian newspaper. He gave a speech at the People's Assembly Conference held at Westminster Central Hall on 22 June 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 20th century, the {{population}} sharply declined, as mechanization transferred work in cavalry and agriculture to machines. By the 1970s, the Mérens was on the verge of extinction, with only 40 horses registered in the stud book. The breed was saved by members of the hippie movement, who re-settled in the Ariège mountains, boosting the local economy and restarting breeding programs. The Mérens also <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> new surge in popularity in riding horses, and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded, leading the breeding program to be considered an example for the conservation of rare breeds. The herd size remains relatively small, however, and one genetic study considers the traditional type of the breed to be endangered and recommends that efforts should be focused on its preservation.|$|E

5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building is something of a mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E
5|$|Alipate {{was signed}} by the Saskatchewan Roughriders in 1989 but {{released}} {{prior to the start}} of the regular season. Nevertheless, he rejoined the team and played in 17 regular season games that year. Alipate <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> slew of linebacker injuries, and he finished the season as one of only two linebackers on the Roughriders who avoided injury in 1989. In a Week 17 win against the Calgary Stampeders, Alipate blocked a punt on special teams and intercepted Tom Porras to be named the CFL's Defensive Player of the Week. Alipate made 31 tackles and three fumble recoveries during his rookie season and was named the Roughriders' nominee for the Rookie of the Year award. Alipate recovered a fumble during the West Division Final, setting up a touchdown drive. The Roughriders went on the upset the championship-favorite Edmonton Eskimos 32–21 to become division champions. The Roughriders won the 77th Grey Cup 43–40 against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. In 1990, Alipate played in all 18 regular season games for the Roughriders and made 35 tackles.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century Tunbridge Wells {{experienced}} growth as a place for the well-to-do to visit and make their homes. It became a fashionable resort town again following visits by the Duchess of Kent, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, and <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> new estate on Mount Pleasant and the building of the Trinity church in 1827, and improvements made to the town and the provision of facilities such as gas lighting and a police service meant that by 1837 the town population had swelled to 9,100. In 1842 an omnibus service was set up that ran from Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells, enabling visitors to arrive from London within two hours, and in 1845 the town was linked to the railway network via a branch from South Eastern Railway's London-Hastings Hastings Line at Tonbridge. During this time Decimus Burton developed John Ward's Calverley Park estate.|$|E

5|$|In 1826, Metcalfe {{served on}} a House {{committee}} that investigated allegations that Vice-President John C. Calhoun had improperly <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> contract he awarded while serving as Secretary of War in 1822. While Calhoun was cleared of any wrongdoing, his friend, South Carolina Representative George McDuffie, began an exchange of correspondence with Metcalfe regarding the proceedings. The correspondence became heated, and McDuffie challenged Metcalfe to a duel. As {{the recipient of the}} challenge, Metcalfe had the right to choose the terms of the engagement. He chose rifles as the weapon at a distance of 90 feet. McDuffie insisted that wounds from a previous duel had left him incapable of handling a rifle, and proposed pistols as an alternative. Metcalfe replied that he had never handled a pistol in his life. Unable to come to an agreement on the conditions of the duel, both sides eventually dropped the matter entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, {{and the editor of}} the Alaska Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and the Alaska Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, to compete with the News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded his weekly newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded the Alaska islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was censored by the U.S. Army. Fairbanks <b>benefited</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E
