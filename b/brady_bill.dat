5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the <b>Brady</b> <b>bill</b> loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{voted against}} the Defense of Marriage Act, the Federal Marriage Amendment, and {{was in favor of}} {{repealing}} the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. He also supported gun control, voting for the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also voted to expand research of embryonic stem cells and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions.|$|E
5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill,</b> and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} {{effects of}} the ruling on the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> were negligible.

In 2004 Warner was one of three Republicans to sponsor an amendment by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that sought to provide for a 10-year extension of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E
25|$|With a {{stated goal}} of {{reducing}} crime and homicide, the Democratic Party has introduced various gun control measures, {{most notably the}} Gun Control Act of 1968, the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> of 1993, and Crime Control Act of 1994. However, some Democrats, especially rural, Southern, and Western Democrats, favor fewer restrictions on firearm possession and warned the party was defeated in the 2000 presidential election in rural areas because of the issue. In the national platform for 2008, the only statement explicitly favoring gun control was a plan calling for renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E

Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill,</b> but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.|$|E

500|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "I'm for gun legislation myself. I don't hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered. I don't think legitimate gun owners would mind that kind of legislation. Right now the furor against a gun law is by gun owners who are overreacting. They're worried that all guns {{are going to be}} recalled. It's impossible to take guns out of circulation, and that's why firearms should be registered and mail-order delivery of guns halted." [...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill,</b> with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on 'Larry King Weekend'... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls. 'Why would anyone need or want an assault weapon?' he said." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{gun control}} {{policy of the}} Bill Clinton {{administration}} was the White House's domestic policy on guns during Bill Clinton's term in office as President of the United States from 1993 to 2001. [...] Gun control was a major political issue {{in the first half}} of Clinton's first term and during that time he lobbied for, and signed, two major pieces of gun control legislation, the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> and the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the <b>Brady</b> <b>Bill</b> were ruled unconstitutional in court (Printz v. United States), and the {{government}} now uses an instant check system instead of a five-day wait, but otherwise it survived and is still in effect today. [...] Clinton claimed that the program had stopped thousand of criminals from purchasing guns. [...] Critics pointed out that by 1999, {{of the more than}} 23,000 cases that had been referred for prosecution by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the BATF [...] had only arrested 56 people. The assault weapons ban had a sunset clause and expired on September 13, 2004.|$|E

[...] When he was campaigning for Governor of Arkansas he met a hardware store owner who had sold a handgun to an unstable Vietnam vet, who had just been released from a mental hospital. [...] The man went on a killing spree with the gun. [...] Clinton cited this in his autobiography, as the best argument he encountered as to why the background checks in the Brady Law were needed.|$|E
