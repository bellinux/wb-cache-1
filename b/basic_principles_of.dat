5|$|During the 20th century, {{the field}} of {{professional}} astronomy split into observational and theoretical branches. Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects, which is then analyzed using <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> physics. Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena. The two fields complement each other, with theoretical astronomy seeking to explain observational results and observations being used to confirm theoretical results.|$|E
5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} {{by the standards}} of his age and learned French, German and Latin. He showed a special interest in history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders. His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E

5|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> New Labour {{existed in}} the post-war socialist {{revisionism}} of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of Socialism stressed the idea that socialism is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E
5|$|Advaita {{literally}} means non-duality, {{and it is}} a monistic {{system of}} thought. It deals with the non-dual nature of Brahman and Atman. Advaita is considered the most influential sub-school of the Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. Gaudapada {{was the first person to}} expound the <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the Advaita philosophy in a commentary on the conflicting statements of the Upanishads. Gaudapada's Advaita ideas were further developed by Shankara (8th century CE). King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to his {{invention}} in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of newspapers {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that his invention had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was his invention and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E
40|$|The {{central issue}} {{regarding}} non-regular employees is {{the disparity in}} compensation compared to regular employees. There are three policy choices to resolve this issue: (1) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same compensation for same career, (2) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same compensation for same work, and (3) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason. Of these choices, article 8 of the Part-time Labor Act adopts (1) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same compensation for same career, and the Democratic Party of Japan's manifesto (2009) extols the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same pay for same work (one form <b>of</b> (2) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same compensation for same work). A general legal principle based on a particular form (same career or same work) is not applicable to other types of employment systems and creates the problem {{of not being able}} to address the various benefits not directly connected to career or work duties, such as commuting allowance, in-house cafeterias, and health examinations. While France and Germany have adopted (2) the general legal <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> same compensation for same work, their systems, in fact, operate in line with (3) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason in order to resolve the issue. With an assumption of diverse and broad benefits for employees and diversified and multi-track human resource systems (wage systems), Japan has also adopted (3) the <b>basic</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> prohibiting discriminatory treatment without an objective reason; responses that incorporate diversity of particular situations for determining objective reason are likely appropriate in terms of theory and practice. In this paper, I clarify in concrete terms the details and nature <b>of</b> this <b>principle</b> (in particular, guidelines for interpreting objective reason and the concrete framework for decisions) while looking at various aspects such as the debate in France and Germany and show how to respond to problems in implementing this principle (low predictability). ...|$|R

5|$|The work of Pasteur and Koch did not {{accurately}} reflect the true {{diversity of the}} microbial world because of their exclusive focus on microorganisms having direct medical relevance. It {{was not until the}} work of Martinus Beijerinck and Sergei Winogradsky late in the 19th century that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed. Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of viruses and the development of enrichment culture techniques. While his work on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus established the <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation {{of a wide range of}} microbes with wildly different physiologies. Winogradsky was the first to develop the concept of chemolithotrophy and to thereby reveal the essential role played by microorganisms in geochemical processes. He was responsible for the first isolation and description of both nitrifying and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. French-Canadian microbiologist Felix d'Herelle co-discovered bacteriophages and was one of the earliest applied microbiologists.|$|E
5|$|This {{suggestion}} {{stemmed from}} the observation that many engineers relied on the <b>basic</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> physics and mechanics to guide their work, and yet this often required inventors and engineers to become scientists as well to obtain experimental data—something that they were rarely qualified or resourced to do. Short of government funding of such research, Evans also attempted to create {{in the aftermath of}} the Steam Engineer's Guide what he called 'The Experiment Company', which would be a private research consortium to conduct reliable experiments and gather data for the benefits of subscribed members. The venture failed and Evans could find no paying stockholders to launch it, possibly due to Evans committing the new venture to developing a steam wagon of his own design. The Franklin Institute would be founded in Philadelphia a few years after Evans's death on similar principles.|$|E
