40|$|This paper aims {{to enable}} the study of water reuse in the seat <b>belt</b> <b>webbing</b> dyeing process, {{achieving}} larger economy in water consumption since textile operations use {{a great amount of}} water. In order to reach this goal, various products were tested during the treatment of such effluents which met the following characteristics: biodegradability, greater efficiency in removing color, compliance with legislation, and low cost. Using these new products, approximately 59 % of water consumption and 30 % of effluent treatment were reduced on a monthly basis. Taking into account these initial results, payback is expected in approximately five months...|$|E
40|$|To use e-textiles as a strain-resistance sensor {{they need}} to be both elastic and conductive. Three kinds of elastic-conductive webbings, {{including}} flat, tubular, and belt webbings, made of Lycra fiber and carbon coated polyamide fiber, were used in this study. The strain-resistance properties of the webbings were evaluated in stretch-recovery tests and measured within 30 % strain. It was found that tensile hysteresis and contact resistance significantly influence the tensile elasticity and the resistance sensitivity of the webbings. The results showed that the webbing structure definitely contributes to the tensile hysteresis and contact resistance. The smaller the friction is among the yarns in the <b>belt</b> <b>webbing,</b> the smaller the tensile hysteresis loss. However the close proximity of the conductive yarns in flat and tubular webbings results in a lower contact resistance...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} the risk of some types of injury in crashes. One hypothesis is that obesity adversely effects belt fit by changing the routing of the belt relative to the underlying skeletal structures. To evaluate this hypothesis, belt fit was measured in a laboratory study of 54 men and women, 48 percent of whom were obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m 2 or greater. Test conditions included a wide range of upper and lower belt anchorage locations and ranges of seat height, seat cushion angle, and seat back angle spanning a large fraction of current vehicle front and rear seats. In some conditions, foot position was restricted to simulate the typical situation in the second row of a small sedan. Across individuals, an increase in BMI of 10 -kg/m 2 was associated with a lap belt positioned 43 mm further forward and 21 mm higher relative to the anterior-superior iliac spines of the pelvis. Each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI was associated with an increase in lap <b>belt</b> <b>webbing</b> length of 130 mm. The worsening of lap belt fit with restricted foot position was slightly greater for obese participants. Obesity was associated with a more-inboard shoulder belt routing across a wide range of upper belt anchorage locations, and the shoulder <b>belt</b> <b>webbing</b> length between the D-ring and latchplate increased by an average of 60 mm with each 10 -kg/m 2 increase in BMI. The results suggest that obesity effectively introduces slack in the seat belt system by routing the belt further away from the skeleton. Particularly in frontal crashes, but also in rollovers and other scenarios, this slack will result in increased excursions and an increased likelihood and severity of contacts with the interior. The higher routing of the lap belt with respect to the pelvis also increases the likelihood of submarining in frontal crashes...|$|E
50|$|The slouch hat {{was worn}} from the unit's {{formation}} to {{end of the}} 1960s where it {{was replaced by a}} rifle green beret. The khaki drill uniform, like that of most of the peace-time army, consisted of a heavily starched, short-sleeved light green drill shirt and similarly starched KD shorts (knee-long khaki drill short trousers), khaki woollen hose-tops and puttees, black ammo boots, a black <b>webbing</b> <b>belt</b> or regimental stable belt and a rifle green beret with the regimental badge underlain by a scarlet diamond-shaped flash. In war time, from about 1970 onwards, the everyday uniform was camouflage denim with a <b>webbing</b> <b>belt</b> and beret. The colours of the regiment were red, black and rifle green - on the stable belt, green above, black below and a thin red stripe in the middle.|$|R

50|$|A {{headlamp}} {{is designed}} to be worn on the head, often having separate lamp and battery components. The battery pack may be attached {{at the back of the}} head or in a pocket to improve balance. Headlamps leave the user's hands free. A headlamp can be clipped to the brim of a hat, or built to mount on a hard hat, instead of using straps; other types resemble eyeglass frames. Similar to the headlamp, an angle-head flashlight emits light perpendicular to the length of the battery tube; it can be clipped to a headband, <b>belt,</b> or <b>webbing</b> or set on a flat surface. Some types allow the user to adjust the angle of the head. The Fulton MX991/U Flashlight was an angle-head flashlight issued to US military personnel; similar style lights remain popular.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study and a case report was to {{demonstrate}} seat <b>belt</b> <b>webbing</b> induced injury due to seatbelt submarining during the frontal motor vehicle crash. Submarining is an undesired phenomenon during a frontal crash scenario and is dependent on design features of the seat pan and seatbelt system. The lack of adequate anti-submarining features at any seating position with three-point restraint can cause abdominal solid and hollow organ injuries. This paper reports a case of submarining and factors that exacerbated this phenomenon leading to critical occupant abdominal injury. This case report and the following injury causation analysis demonstrate the shortcomings of a cantilever seat pan design in context to the occupant safety. The inadequate seat pan anti-submarining feature in association with lack of seatbelt load-limiter and Pretensioner reduces the level of occupant protection offered by the seat belt system in the rear seat. This case report shows the dangers of cantilever seat pan design and its association with increased risk of submarining causing severe abdominal injuries...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering"December 2007. "The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the behavior of a wheel-chaired occupant for different crash scenarios in a mass transit bus. Actual crash sled tests were carried out at the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) crash laboratory facility and validated according kinematics and injury parameters. Setup of these crash tests was done by following various wheelchair restraint and tie-down standards. Other factors, such as wheelchair placement in a bus environment were taken into consideration while preparing the sled tests. The Hybrid III 50 th percentile anthropometric test device (ATD) was used for all crash pulses, as it represents the weight and size of an average American. A detailed Computer-Aided design (CAD) model using CATIA V 5 was created by applying a reverse engineering technique. This CAD model was then used to prepare a detailed finite element model (FEM) and a facet model which were used for carrying out simulations with the help of software such as MADYMO for multi-body dynamics and LS-DYNA for finite element analysis. These two models were then simulated for the same crash pulses as the actual sled tests to study the kinematics and injury parameters. To define correct material properties tension tests of the belt material were carried out to obtain the actual <b>belt</b> <b>webbing</b> characteristics. The detailed finite element model was developed and used to study the exact force-displacement relationship and to obtain the proper kinematics. Simulations were run using both software for all crash tests, and the kinematics and injury values were validated with the actual crash test values and kinematics. Validation was done using the Motion View software. The validation of the tests was studied to discern the various parameters responsible for the injury values of the wheel-chaired occupant. Further, a more detailed parametric study was carried out where these parameters were changed or modified to create combinations of restraint and securement systems, in order to provide an overview of the appropriate choice of restraint and securement system to reduce the potential injury to the wheel-chaired occupant...|$|E

50|$|Deubré is {{a generic}} term, {{originating}} at Nike, Inc., for an ornamental shoelace tag. Typically, a deubré {{will have two}} holes through which a shoelace is threaded, like a bead on string. When the shoe is laced, the deubré is centered between the first two eyelets (closest to the toe), with the shoelace passing through and behind the deubré. A deubré is typically made of metal, plastic, or leather, and may be decorated with a logo or text. It is distinguished from a bead {{in that it is}} non-tubular; it has two points of entry/exit for the shoelace, as a <b>belt</b> or <b>webbing</b> may pass through a buckle. One could argue a deubré is functional in that once threaded to the midpoint of a shoelace, it assists in centering the shoelace in the shoe, though not all deubré and shoelace combinations necessarily will provide enough friction to hold the deubré in place while lacing.|$|R

A strap, usually {{in the form of a}} belt, is folded in half by the street hustler or mountebank, and then wound into a coil, forming two identical loops in the center of the coil—one the folded center of the strap, and the other its first fold. These loops look identical.|$|R

50|$|Highland and Scottish regiments {{that have}} adopted kilts as their dress uniform {{typically}} wear spats, <b>webbing</b> <b>belts,</b> and kilts with pleating to the line. Spats are canvas coverings {{that cover the}} wearer's boot, and were originally intended for keeping mud off of one's ghillies and hose, although spats are now white and purely for visual use. A white web belt with a regimental clasp is often worn as well. During World War I kilts were worn into battle by British and Canadian regiments, usually with a fabric cover or apron to hide the bright colours of the tartan, {{and to keep the}} kilt from getting dirty if the soldier had to crawl.|$|R
50|$|The Strizh suits were {{constructed}} from olive drab colored nylon canvas with silver trim and lined with rubberized fabric and fitted with connectors for electrical, air and coolant umbilicals.

The gloves were detachable and fitted with rubber fingers and leather palms. The suit also had pleated knee sections. Utility pockets on the suit's thighs were intended to hold survival gear, such as a folding knife, a pistol and other items. A pressure gauge was fitted on the left sleeve and a pressure equalisation valve on the chest.|$|R
50|$|A stable belt {{is a wide}} <b>webbing</b> <b>belt,</b> {{usually a}} single solid colour or {{horizontally}} striped in two or more different colours. It is worn around the waist and when worn with Combat Soldier 95 it is worn through the trouser belt loops. In the British Army or Royal Marines, when worn with barrack dress, the belt is placed either in the belt loops of trousers or a skirt or over a jersey. In the Royal Air Force, it is worn with service working dress (No. 2 dress) either covering {{the top of the}} trousers (or skirt) and {{the lower part of the}} shirt or through the belt loops if they have been specially designed to accommodate the belt's width. Unlike the Army, it is never worn over a jersey. The original cavalry stable belts buckled at the side to avoid chafing the soldier's stomach as he bent down during stable work and also to avoid marking or catching on the horse harness, but many stable belts are now clipped at the front, sometimes behind a metal belt plate (usually bearing the badge of the regiment), although a few regiments such as the Light Infantry clip their stable belts at the front with the original two leather straps. A large number of units, however, continue to use the traditional method of securing the belt using two leather straps and metal buckles at the left-hand side.|$|R
50|$|A {{report by}} Tim Magee, an eyewitness, follows:Part of 156 Bty called out for riot control in New Lodge area. Departed HMS Maidstone {{where we were}} billetted, and de-bussed at {{northern}} end of Lepper street. Very large explosion as we moved down Lepper St towards New Lodge Road. I was on left flank, close to houses, very uncomfortable every time we passed {{one of the many}} narrow alleys leading off the road, seemed like ideal hiding place for attackers. When we reached New Lodge Road a lot of rioting going on, initially we cordoned NLR off, stones, bottles incoming in large quantities, also nail bombs (multiple as I recall, not just one as is often reported).Together with 4/5 others sent across NLR to cordon off Duncairn Parade. Whilst standing there, an overweight guy in white shirt and dark jacket came around corner of tower block on our left (part of Artillery flats), took aim with pistol and fired off several shots. We found this highly amusing and started laughing at his attempt to frighten us with a starting pistol. He looked somewhat surprised and ran back behind the flats. Some time later that night we were pulled back and started to move back up Lepper street. I don't recall if we were in the much discussed “box formation” but we were certainly arrayed across the road. Not far from the junction with Spamount street someone opened up from behind us with automatic fire. This time I was on the right flank. I felt a blow to my RH side, could see sparks coming off the cobble stones and wall to my right and decided to get the f! out of it, so ran around the corner to the right and into Spamount street.With the passage of time I forget exactly who was hit, Geordie of course, John Finch was hit in the abdomen, Pete Fishbourne (think that was his name) was hit in the backside. My recollection is that the newspapers reported 5 or 6 but that probably included Bob Reding. Heinz Pizarek (sic) found a spent round {{in the back of his}} <b>webbing</b> <b>belt</b> when he got back to HMS Maidstone.|$|R
