Results showed that the model was able to simulate initiation and propagation of fracture lines at the punch and die corners and the resultant break angle along the edge was found to be close to values observed in practice. Simulated edge geometry and microhardness were found to be in reasonable agreement with published experimental results for the steel plate considered although the model was unable to simulate double cutting at 0. 8 per cent clearance. Results also suggest that edge hardness is independent of the starting ductility in the plate and that increasing the edge radii does not eVectively simulate edge wear. Based on the results obtained, it may be concluded that the plane strain model is able to simulate plate shearing with su cient accuracy in the range of normal process conditions...|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a coating device for application of coating material {{to the surface of}} a web or a flexible substrate. The coating device contains a pressurized channel where a flowing stream of the coating liquid first comes into contact with the substrate.

A doctor element is positioned at the downstream side of the channel where the excess coating in the channel follows the contour of the boundary formed by the doctor element and leaves the channel. The geometry of the streamlined boundaries of the coating device eliminate the formation of recirculating eddies or vortices. The elimination of vortices eliminates flow instability due to centrifugal forces and removes harmful pressure fluctuations which could result in coat-weight nonuniformities. The elimination of recirculating eddies or vortices also removes the possibility of entrapping air pockets or air bubbles in the core of the vortices which could reach the <b>blade</b> <b>gap</b> and could result in coat-weight nonuniformities and wet streaks.

40|$|Compressor {{efficiency}} variation with rotor tip gap is {{assessed using}} numerical simulations on an embedded stage representative {{of that in}} a large industrial gas turbine with Reynolds number being approximately 2 x 106 to 7 x 106. The results reveal three distinct behaviors of efficiency variation with tip gap. For relatively small tip gap (less than 0. 8 % span), the change in efficiency with tip gap is non-monotonic with an optimum tip gap for maximum efficiency. The optimum tip gap is set by two competing flow processes: decreasing tip leakage mixing loss and increasing viscous shear loss at the casing with decreasing tip gap. An optimum tip gap scaling is established and shown to satisfactorily quantify the optimal gap value. For medium tip gap (0. 8 % - 3. 4 % span), the efficiency decreases approximately on a linear basis with increasing tip clearance. However, for tip gap beyond a threshold value (3. 4 % span for this rotor), the efficiency becomes less sensitive to tip gap as the blade tip becomes more aft-loaded thus reducing tip flow mixing loss in the rotor passage. The threshold value is set by the competing effects between increasing tip leakage flow and decreasing tip flow induced mixing loss with increasing tip gap. Thus, to desensitize compressor performance variation with <b>blade</b> <b>gap,</b> rotor should be tip aft-loaded and hub fore-loaded while stator should be tip fore-loaded and hub aft-loaded as much as feasible. This reduces the opportunity for clearance flow mixing loss and maximizes the benefits of reversible work from unsteady effects in attenuating the clearance flow through the downstream blade-row. The net effect can be an overall compressor performance enhancement in terms of efficiency, pressure rise capability, robustness to end gap variation and potentially useful operable range broadening. Preliminary assessment of a stage redesign with a 4 % chord more tip aft-loaded blade design for 1. 7 % span tip clearance yields 0. 2 point stage efficiency benefit. by Sitanun Sakulkaew. Thesis (S.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was on the {{layering}} of fine paper with a 3 -layer headbox and roll <b>blade</b> <b>gap</b> former. It consisted of methodological development and laboratory scale studies, as well as layering studies on the pilot paper machine scale. The potential of layered structures in papermaking and the phenomena affecting layer mixing were also studied. Filler distributions were characterized by two parameters – filler distribution shape and symmetry factors. The method developed made it possible to apply a statistical approach to experiments when studying the impact of typical wet end control parameters on the control of filler distributions and the contribution of filler distributions to paper quality parameters. A method by which the center layer fiber distribution may be characterized from the final paper is also presented. The method is based on the use of dyed fibers and a spectrofotometer. In addition, a laboratory device, a multilayer handsheet former for making layered structures, is presented. The process closely resembles a real continuous multilayer process by providing water phase interactions between layers during forming and two-sided dewatering characteristics. In a case study, retention chemical and filler layering with WFC base paper was performed by the multilayer handsheet former. Surface roughness decreased and brightness increased when the filler content in paper surfaces was increased. At constant filler content, paper strength increased as the filler concentration in the paper surfaces increased. The distinction between roll dewatering and blade dewatering in terms of layer mixing as well as differences in the mixing behavior of fibers and fillers in different dewatering phases was studied. Major fiber mixing takes place during the free jet and roll dewatering phase. In blade dewatering, fiber movements are related to formation improvements. The greatest mobility differences between fibers and fillers were found in the blade dewatering phase in roll and blade dewatering. Filler distributions were significantly affected during blade dewatering, with the mobility of the fibers remaining insignificant. The relationship between typical fine paper quality parameters and filler distributions was studied. Formation improvement and densification of the paper were achievable at the same running conditions. Low porosity was achieved by evenly distributed constituents (good formation) and a local rich filler concentration somewhere in the paper structure in the paper thickness direction. Oil absorption two-sidedness was minimized by symmetrical filler distributions. The combination of all these quality factors required the filler distribution to be symmetrical and as u- or turned u-shaped as possible. The use of additives layering as a part of paper quality control was also studied. Multilayering was found to be an effective tool for the control of filler distributions. On the other hand it was shown that, in order to get optimized impact of the multilayering on quality properties, the other process variables also need to be controlled. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|A {{review is}} {{presented}} of experiments examining {{the effects of}} <b>blade</b> tip <b>gaps</b> encountered in turbomachines and the methods by which the synthesised data are currently used in turbomachinery design and performance analysis. Data gained since the 1930 's is subdivided for convenience into diffusing, or compressor-type flows, and accelerating, or turbine-type flows. There is a further sub-division into cascade and rotating machinery data. The overall trend university is that an increasing tip gap whose effect can reach over {{most or all of}} the blade height brings reduced overall performance of a turbomachine.

40|$|This study aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the flow in the runner of a hydraulic propeller turbine. The focus is put on the leakage flow (q) and the tip vortex occurring at the clearance between the runner blades and the shroud. The influence of the tip clearance size on the runner flow is analyzed to provide an insight into the importance of this parameter for propeller turbine performance. Three <b>blade</b> tip <b>gaps</b> (τ=h/D) have been simulated with an eddy-viscosity model: τ= 0. 0, τ= 0. 0009 and τ= 0. 0013, being h the gap size and D the diameter of the turbine at the runner. A Q-criterion approach is used to identify the vortex core at the suction side of the blade. It is found that a smaller gap represents a less important loss in the runner and a larger gap presents more risk of cavitation in the suction side of the blades.

40|$|Effects {{of a large}} rotor tip gap on the {{performance}} of a one and half stage axial compressor are investigated in detail with a numerical simulation based on LES and available PIV data. The current paper studies the main flow physics, including why and how the loss generation is increased with the large rotor tip gap. The present study reveals that when the tip gap becomes large, tip clearance fluid goes over the tip clearance core vortex and enters into the next <b>blade's</b> tip <b>gap,</b> which is called double-leakage tip clearance flow. As the tip clearance flow enters into the adjacent <b>blade's</b> tip <b>gap,</b> a vortex rope with a lower pressure core is generated. This vortex rope breaks up the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, resulting in a large additional mixing. This double-leakage tip clearance flow occurs at all operating conditions, from design flow to near stall condition, with the large tip gap for the current compressor stage. The double-leakage tip clearance flow, its interaction with the tip clearance core vortex of the adjacent blade, and the resulting large mixing loss are the main flow mechanism of the large rotor tip gap in the compressor. When the tip clearance is smaller, flow near the end wall follows more closely with the main passage flow and this double-leakage tip clearance flow does not happen near the design flow condition for the current compressor stage. When the compressor with a large tip gap operates at near stall operation, a strong vortex rope is generated near the leading edge due to the double-leakage flow. Part of this vortex separates from the path of the tip clearance core vortex and travels from the suction side of the blade toward the pressure side of the blade. This vortex is generated periodically at near stall operation with a large tip gap. As the vortex travels from the suction side to the pressure side of the blade, a large fluctuation of local pressure forces blade vibration. Nonsynchronous blade vibration occurs due to this vortex as the frequency of this vortex generation {{is not the same as}} the rotor. The present investigation confirms that this vortex is a part of separated tip clearance vortex, which is caused by the double-leakage tip clearance flow...|$|R

The numerical model has advanced features such as non-linear friction damping for turbine <b>blades,</b> tip <b>gap</b> flows and <b>blade</b> vibratory motion. A series of inviscid and viscous computations were performed for an HP turbine with 36 stator and 92 rotor blades. The peak-to-peak maximum displacements were predicted with and without root friction dampers and the findings were compared against available experimental data. Good agreement was observed in most cases. It was found that most of the unsteady forcing was due to the potential effects. In a second phase of the turbine work, the response to low engine-order excitation was predicted using a multi-row whole-annulus model. The stator assembly was assumed to have blades with varying throat widths and the magnitude of the unsteady aerodynamic forcing was found to increase with increasing scatter in throat width variation. A second forced response study was conducted for a rig fan with 15 variable inlet guide vanes (VIGVs) and 20 rotor blades. For a 30 VIGV opening, a good match was observed between the predicted and measured wake profiles. Similarly, the measured and predicted rotor blade vibration levels were also found to be in good agreement.

40|$|Blade failure {{due to the}} {{overcoming}} {{of fatigue}} limit in turbo machinery for power generation could be fostered by excessive vibration level of the blade itself. Thus, blade vibration reduction is an important task, {{in order to avoid}} this risk, and can be achieved in different ways. One of these is a contact related phenomenon, which consists in physically limiting the vibration amplitude on the blade tip leaving a small gap between the shrouds of adjacent blades. When the relative displacement between adjacent <b>blades</b> exceeds the <b>gap,</b> in a certain vibration mode of the bladed disk, a contact occurs between the shrouds, the relative motion is restricted and energy is dissipated by friction and impact during the contact.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{deals with}} {{application}} of grooved type casing treatment for suppression of spike stall {{in an isolated}} axial compressor rotor blade row. The continuous grooved casing treatment covering the whole compressor circumference is of 1. 8 mm in depth and located between 90 % and 108 % chord of the blade tip as measured from leading edge. The method of investigation is based on time-accurate three-dimensional full annulus numerical simulations for cases with and without casing treatment. Discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations {{has been carried out}} based on an upwind second-order scheme and k-ω-SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence modeling has been used for estimation of eddy viscosity. Time-dependent flow structure results for the smooth casing reveal that there are two criteria for spike stall inception known as leading edge spillage and trailing edge backflow, which occur at specific mass flow rates in near-stall conditions. In this case, two dominant stall cells of different sizes could be observed. The larger one is caused by the spike stall covering roughly two blade passages in the circumferential direction and about 25 % span in the radial direction. Spike stall disturbances are accompanied by lower frequencies and higher amplitudes of the pressure signals. Casing treatment causes flow blockages to reduce due to alleviation of backflow regions, which in turn reduces the total pressure loss and increases the axial velocity in the <b>blade</b> tip <b>gap</b> region, as well as tip leakage flow fluctuation at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. Eventually, it can be concluded that the casing treatment of the stepped tip gap type could increase the stall margin of the compressor. This fact is basically due to retarding the movement of the interface region between incoming and tip leakage flows towards the rotor leading edge plane and suppressing the reversed flow around the blade trailing edge...|$|R

Numerical analyses were carried out by means of three-dimensional, viscous, unsteady simulations, adopting measured inlet/outlet boundary conditions. Two sets of measurements were performed: steady measurements, from one hand, for global performance estimation of the whole turbine, such as efficiency, mass flow, and stage work; steady and unsteady measurements, on the other hand, were performed downstream of rotor row, in order to characterize the flow structures in this region. The fidelity of computational setup was proven by comparing numerical results to measurements. Main performance curves and spanwise distributions have shown a good agreement {{in terms of both}} shape of curves/distributions and absolute values. Moreover, the comparison of two-dimensional maps downstream of rotor row has shown similar structures of the flow field. Finally, a comprehensive study of the axial gap effect on stage aerodynamic performance was carried out for four blade spacings (10 %, 25 %, 40 %, and 95 % of S 1 axial chord) and five aspect ratios (1. 0, 1. 6, 3, 4, and 5). The results pointed out how unsteady interaction between blade rows affects stage operation, in terms of pressure and flow angle distributions, as well as of secondary flows development. The combined effect of these aspects in determining the stage efficiency is investigated and discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|This article {{deals with}} {{application}} of grooved type casing treatment for suppression of spike stall {{in an isolated}} axial compressor rotor blade row. The continuous grooved casing treatment covering the whole compressor circumference is of 1. 8  mm in depth and located between 90 % and 108 % chord of the blade tip as measured from leading edge. The method of investigation is based on time-accurate three-dimensional full annulus numerical simulations for cases with and without casing treatment. Discretization of the Navier–Stokes equations {{has been carried out}} based on an upwind second-order scheme and k-ω-SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence modeling has been used for estimation of eddy viscosity. Time-dependent flow structure results for the smooth casing reveal that there are two criteria for spike stall inception known as leading edge spillage and trailing edge backflow, which occur at specific mass flow rates in near-stall conditions. In this case, two dominant stall cells of different sizes could be observed. The larger one is caused by the spike stall covering roughly two blade passages in the circumferential direction and about 25 % span in the radial direction. Spike stall disturbances are accompanied by lower frequencies and higher amplitudes of the pressure signals. Casing treatment causes flow blockages to reduce due to alleviation of backflow regions, which in turn reduces the total pressure loss and increases the axial velocity in the <b>blade</b> tip <b>gap</b> region, as well as tip leakage flow fluctuation at higher frequencies and lower amplitudes. Eventually, it can be concluded that the casing treatment of the stepped tip gap type could increase the stall margin of the compressor. This fact is basically due to retarding the movement of the interface region between incoming and tip leakage flows towards the rotor leading edge plane and suppressing the reversed flow around the blade trailing edge...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of both noise and aerodynamic characteristics of a multiple-disk fan was carried out {{with respect to the}} effects of three parameters: (1) the existence of <b>blades,</b> (2) the <b>gap</b> of disks, (3) the location of blades. It was shown that the bladed multiple-disk fan exhibited higher pressure head and the fan efficiency than the non-bladed multiple-disk fan, though the noise generated from the former was higher by 3 to 6 dB than that of the latter. The fan efficiency and noise increased proportional to the gap of disks, and it was experimentally shown that a 0. 7 mm gap gave the lowest specific noise level among the impellers tested in this experiment. Concerning the location of blade, when the distance between the trailing edge of the blade and the cutoff was larger than 13 mm, the discrete frequency noise generated by the interference between the blade and the cutoff became lower than the level of turbulent noise. We also obtained the experimental result that the multiple-disk fan with a 13 mm distance between the blade and the cutoff had the lowest specific noise level...|$|R
40|$|All modern {{automotive}} {{automatic transmissions}} {{require the use}} of a torque converter to allow for the transmission of torque from the engine to the drive train. Although they are commonly used throughout the automotive industry, there is little understanding of the internal flows within the torque converter. An experimental study has been conducted to reveal the internal flow characteristics within a production torque converter using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) under the operating conditions. LDV measurements were conducted on the planes between impeller <b>blades,</b> and the <b>gap</b> between the impeller and turbine blades. The study showed that the internal flow is highly complex and the difference in rotor speeds between the impeller and turbine compound the flow effects. Transmission oil flows in the planes at the impeller exit and gap region were affected by the turbine blade as it passed. Transmission oil flow was also found to be leaving the impeller and flowing over the turbine into the behind the turbine back plate. This affected the converter efficiency negatively. This study has led {{to a better understanding of}} flow mechanism within the torque converter and provided the guidance needed for the advancement of improved computational fluid dynamic models...|$|R
40|$|Blade {{vibration}} {{reduction is}} an important task in high performance turbo machinery for power generation, {{in order to avoid}} the risk of blade failure due to the overcoming of fatigue limit. A possible way to obtain this result is a contact related phenomenon, i. e. by physically limiting the vibration amplitude on the blade tip leaving a small gap between the shrouds of adjacent blades. When the relative displacement between adjacent <b>blades</b> exceeds the <b>gap,</b> in a certain vibration mode of the blade row, a contact occurs between the shrouds, the relative motion is restricted and energy is dissipated by friction and impact during the contact. This is called the snubbing mechanism. In this paper, an original simplified model of bladed disks, in which the snubbing mechanism can occur, is presented and numerical integration in time domain furnishes the time histories of the vibrations of the blades. The level of vibration reduction is then evaluated in some different modes that could be excited for instance by the fluid flow. It is also shown that unlucky combinations of system and excitation parameters can effect also a certain magnification instead of a reduction of the vibration amplitudes. Experimental results on single blade and blade groups of a steam turbine are used to tune the parameters of the system...|$|R
