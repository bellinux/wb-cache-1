5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a <b>basic</b> <b>substance</b> that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{elaborate}} and well-preserved Indian theory of atomism {{comes from the}} philosophy of the Jaina school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are Pancastikayasara, Kalpasutra, Tattvarthasutra and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls. [...] Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms. [...] Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by [...] "kind of touch". [...] Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space. [...] Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative [...] (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same <b>basic</b> <b>substance,</b> they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six [...] "aggregates", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of [...] "elements": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter. [...] To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul. [...] They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.|$|E

2500|$|The theory {{holds that}} {{the human body is}} filled with four <b>basic</b> <b>substances,</b> called humors, which are in balance when a person is healthy. Diseases and disabilities {{supposedly}} resulted from an excess or deficit of one of these four humors. Disease could also be the result of the [...] "corruption" [...] of {{one or more of the}} humors, which could be caused by environmental circumstances, dietary changes, or many other factors. These deficits were thought to be caused by vapors inhaled or absorbed by the body. The four humors are black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. These terms only partly correspond to the modern medical terminology, in which there is no distinction between black and yellow bile, and in which phlegm has a very different meaning. These [...] "humors" [...] may have their roots in the appearance of a blood sedimentation test made in open air, which exhibits a dark clot at the bottom ("black bile"), a layer of unclotted erythrocytes ("blood"), a layer of white blood cells ("phlegm") and a layer of clear yellow serum ("yellow bile").

Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate {{by the following}} process: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerinephosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine.|$|R
