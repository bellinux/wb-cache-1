5|$|On 24 July 1959, Vulcan B.1 XA891 crashed {{due to an}} {{electrical}} failure during an engine test. Shortly after take-off, the crew observed generator warning lights and loss of <b>busbar</b> voltage. The aircraft commander, Avro Chief Test Pilot Jimmy Harrison, climbed XA891 to , steering away from the airfield and populated areas while the AEO attempted to solve the problem. When {{it became clear that}} control would not be regained, Harrison instructed the rear compartment crew to exit the aircraft and the co-pilot to eject, before ejecting himself. All the crew survived, making them the first complete Vulcan crew to successfully escape. The aircraft crashed near Kingston upon Hull.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{features}} a RoboCoaster G2 ride system provided by Dynamic Structures, KUKA and RoboCoaster. The first generation RoboCoaster system featured KUKA robotic arm technology anchored to a stationary platform, while the second-generation G2 system mounted the arms on a <b>busbar</b> track. The system was first publicly disclosed at the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show in 2003. At {{around the same}} time, rumors began circulating {{about the possibility of}} Islands of Adventure adding a Van Helsing-themed ride using this technology. These plans were later scrapped with Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ultimately using the same technology and opening on the same plot of land proposed for the Van Helsing ride. The ride's seats are mounted on robotic arms which are in turn mounted on a track. This allows the arms to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, etc.). This concept first appeared in the 2004 International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) Trade Show. The disadvantage of this intricate machinery is that if the ride breaks down, some guests are stranded in uncomfortable positions, such as being tilted backwards in dark enclosed spaces.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 1958, Vulcan B.1 XA908 of No. 83 Squadron crashed east of Detroit, Michigan, USA. A {{complete}} {{electrical failure}} occurred at around , the backup system should have provided 20 minutes of emergency power, allowing XA908 to reach {{one of several}} airports in the area, however backup power only lasted three minutes due to a short circuit in the service <b>busbar,</b> locking the controls. XA908 went into a steep dive before crashing, leaving a 40-ft (13 m) crater in the ground, which was later excavated while retrieving wreckage. Despite extensive property damage, there were no ground fatalities, only one person on the ground was hospitalized. All six crew members were killed, including the co-pilot, who had ejected. The co-pilot's ejection seat was found in Lake St Clair, but his body was not recovered until the following spring. They were buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Trenton, Michigan, alongside 11 RAF student pilots killed during the Second World War in accidents at nearby Naval Air Station Grosse Ile.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{demonstrate}} {{the advantages of the}} Ni/Cu/Ag plating process when the number of <b>busbars</b> on the solar cell is increased. Cells with four and five <b>busbars</b> were processed and compared to those with three in respect of efficiency, finger and solder adhesion. It is shown that the efficiency can be increased by 0. 15 %, while the finger adhesion remains the same or improves and the solder adhesion remains mostly greater than 1 N/mm 2, if the number of <b>busbars</b> is increased from 3 to 4 or 5. The mass of metal deposited can be reduced by up to 30 % for 5 <b>busbars</b> compared to that required for 3 <b>busbars.</b> Furthermore, it is estimated that the cost of metallisation can be reduced from 9 €ct/wafer for three <b>busbars</b> to 8. 6 €ct/wafer for five <b>busbars...</b>|$|R
30|$|It can {{be noted}} that the {{topology}} of the system covers two different kinds of structures.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} most {{suitable}} location to place variable-speed wind generator based wind farms in a power system considering the steady-state voltage stability. The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) and the full-converter wind generator (FCWG) based wind generation is considered and the inherent reactive power capability of these generators are accurately represented in the study. Steady-state voltage stability is analysed using QV modal analysis and QV curves. QV modal analysis is used to identify the weak and strong <b>busbars</b> in the test system. Wind power generators with different power outputs are integrated to the power system from weak and strong <b>busbars</b> {{and the impact of}} voltage stability is compared using QV stability margins of the <b>busbars.</b> The results demonstrate that adding wind generation from the weak <b>busbars</b> significantly increases the QV stability margin of the weak <b>busbars.</b> However, adding wind generation from strong <b>busbars</b> slightly improve the stability margin of the weak <b>busbars.</b> Therefore, placing wind farms in the weak <b>busbars</b> in a power system is favorable for the overall voltage stability. Furthermore, the results of DFIG and FCWG based wind generation are compared and the higher reactive power capability of the FCWG based wind generation to support the voltage stability is demonstrated...|$|R
25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, Koeberg started {{experiencing}} numerous technical difficulties. On 11 November 2005, a fault on {{a transmission}} <b>busbar</b> caused the reactor to go into safe mode, cutting supply {{to most of the}} Western Cape for about two hours. On 16 November a fire under a 400 kV transmission line caused the line to trip, causing severe voltage dips which resulted in Koeberg once again shutting down. Various parts of the Cape were left without electricity for hours at a time. On the evening of 23 November, a routine inspection of the backup safety system revealed a below-spec concentration of an important chemical, resulting in a controlled shutdown of the reactor. Due to the sufficiency of backup supply, major power cuts were not experienced until Friday 25 November, when the backup capacity began running out. At this point, rotational load shedding was employed, with customers being switched off in stages for most of the day. Koeberg was re-synchronised to the national grid on Saturday 26 November.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all modern}} Finnish icebreakers, Kontio has a {{diesel-electric}} propulsion system. It utilizes the so-called power plant principle {{in which the}} main generators provide electricity for all shipboard consumers through a common <b>busbar.</b> Her main generators, four 16-cylinder Wärtsilä Vasa 16V32 four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines producing 5,460kW each and driving 7,540 kVA Kymi-Strömberg alternators, are located on the upper deck beneath the helicopter platform. In addition, she has two smaller Wärtsilä 4R22/26 generators with an output of 350kW for use in ports. The uncommon location of the engine room was chosen to improve the seakeeping characteristics of the icebreaker by moving {{the center of gravity}} higher to calm the ship's motions in heavy weather. In addition, the maintenance of the main engines is easier as the heavy engine components can be handled with the ship's main crane and the heavy fuel oil tanks could be placed amidships to reduce the probability of an oil spill in case of grounding. , Kontio and her sister ship Otso are the only Finnish icebreakers running on heavy fuel oil which, being the cheapest fuel available, reduces operational costs of the icebreaker.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth <b>busbar</b> of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
50|$|Down {{the left}} side of the phase <b>busbars</b> are two two-pole RCBOs and two single-pole breakers, one unused. The two-pole RCBOs in the picture are not {{connected}} across two phases, but have supply-side neutral connections exiting behind the phase <b>busbars.</b> Down the right side of the <b>busbars</b> are a single-pole breaker, a two-pole RCBO and a three-pole breaker.|$|R
50|$|Inside a {{switchboard}} {{there will}} be one or more <b>busbars.</b> These are flat strips of copper or aluminum, to which the switchgear is connected. <b>Busbars</b> carry large currents through the switchboard, and are supported by insulators.

25|$|The {{power plant}} is {{connected}} to the 330kV and 750kV electrical grid. The block has two electrical generators connected to the 750kV grid by a single generator transformer. The generators are connected to their common transformer by two switches in series. Between them, the unit transformers are connected to supply power to the power plant's own systems; each generator can therefore be connected to the unit transformer to power the plant, or to the unit transformer and the generator transformer to also feed power to the grid. The 330kV line is normally not used, and serves as an external power supply, connected by a station transformer to the power plant's electrical systems. The plant can be powered by its own generators, or get power from the 750kV grid through the generator transformer, or from the 330kV grid via the station transformer, or from the other power plant block via two reserve busbars. In case of total external power loss, the essential systems can be powered by diesel generators. Each unit transformer {{is connected to}} two 6kV main power boards, A and B (e.g. 7A, 7B, 8A, 8B for generators 7 and 8), powering principal non-essential drivers and connected to transformers for the 4kV main power and the 4kV reserve <b>busbar.</b> The 7A, 7B, and 8B boards are also connected to the three essential power lines (namely for the coolant pumps), each also having its own diesel generator. In case of a coolant circuit failure with simultaneous loss of external power, the essential power can be supplied by the spinning down turbogenerators for about 45–50 seconds, during which time the diesel generators should start up. The generators are started automatically within 15 seconds at loss of off-site power.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe, RCDs can fit on {{the same}} DIN rail as the MCBs, however the <b>busbar</b> {{arrangements}} in consumer units and distribution boards can make it awkward to use them in this way. [...] If it is desired to protect an individual circuit, an RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection) can be used. This incorporates an RCD and a miniature circuit breaker in one device.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} use of a screen-printable copper paste to form the front <b>busbars</b> on high {{efficiency}} photovoltaic cell structures in combination with copper fingers formed by light induced plating. Such a process route offers economic benefits relative to the fully plated front metallization due to the reduced requirement for laser ablation and increased cell performance. We demonstrate improved open circuit voltage and fill factor compared to cells that used plating for both the fingers and the <b>busbars.</b> These result from reduced contact between the semiconductor and the metal and from reduced shunting compared to the laser ablated and plated electrodes. p-type ‘PERC’ cells have been fabricated with copper plated fingers and screen-printed copper <b>busbars</b> with a median cell efficiency of 20. 4 %, compared to 20. 3 % for those with fully plated <b>busbars.</b> n-type ‘PERT’ cells reached a cell efficiency of 20. 9 % for both front metallization schemes.
