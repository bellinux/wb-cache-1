40|$|Following the avian {{influenza}} (AI) epidemics which occurred in Italy between 1997 and 2003, a surveillance program, {{funded by the}} Italian Ministry of Health was implemented. Among the tasks of this surveillance program was an investigation on wild and domestic birds to asses circulation of {{avian influenza}} viruses in their natural reservoirs. In this study we collected samples from migratory wild <b>birds</b> (<b>Anseriformes</b> and Charadriiformes), from national and importated game fowls, and from 7 backyard farms of geese and ducks. Cloacal swabs were screened by means of real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) and/or directly processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl’s SPF eggs and blood samples for presence of antibodies against avian influenza viruses. Avian influenza viruses were only obtained from migratory waterfowls belonging to the family Anseriformes, and not from domestic waterfowls or game birds.

40|$|Abstract. The highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} strain H 5 N 1 was first detected in Europe in 2005, {{and has since}} been documented continent-wide in wild birds and poultry.

Using recently developed tools for analysis of ecological niches and geographic distributions of species, we compared ecological niche requirements for H 5 N 1 between paired host groups (poultry versus wild <b>birds,</b> <b>Anseriformes</b> versus Falconiformes, swans versus non-swan Anseriformes). If environmental signals of different host groups are significantly different, the groups {{are likely to be}} involved in distinct transmission cycles. In contrast, models for which similarity cannot be rejected imply no unique ecological niches and no potential linkage of transmission cycles. In 24 similarity tests, we found significant similarity (13 / 24) or no significant differences (9 / 24).

We thus could not document distinct ecological niches for H 5 N 1 occurrences in different host groups and conclude that the transmission cycles are broadly interwoven.

50|$|The Odontoanserae is a clade that {{includes}} Odontopterygiformes (pseudo-toothed <b>birds)</b> and <b>Anseriformes</b> (waterfowls). It is the sister taxon of Neoaves. The Odontoanserae are most {{probably the first}} major group of modern birds that has developed adaptations to aquatic life. Webbed feet and functional salt glands, for instance, are most likely derived characters of this clade, although the degree of development of these structures are known to vary among waterfowls. Similar adaptations have appeared later {{in the evolution of}} modern birds, in various neoavian groups.|$|R
50|$|As is all {{too common}} in protozoal {{taxonomy}} the validity {{of several of the}} species is controversial. Species occurring in <b>Anseriforme</b> <b>birds</b> appear to be valid whereas the other species may be misidentifications. The application of DNA based methods it is to be hoped will resolve these matters.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} question surrounding emergence of novel strains of avian influenza viruses (AIV) {{is the ability}} for wild migratory birds to translocate a complete (unreassorted whole genome) AIV intercontinentally. Virus translocation via migratory birds is suspected in outbreaks of highly pathogenic strain A(H 5 N 1) in Asia, Africa, and Europe. As a result, the potential intercontinental translocation of newly emerging AIV (e. g. A(H 7 N 9) from Eurasia to North America via migratory movements of birds) remains a concern. An estimated 1. 48 to 2. 91 million aquatic <b>birds,</b> principally <b>Anseriformes</b> (ducks, geese, and swans) and Charadriiformes (gulls, terns, and shorebirds) move annually between Eurasia and North America.

40|$|An {{unresolved}} {{issue in}} higher avian systematics is {{the position of}} the fowl-like and the duck-like <b>birds,</b> Galliformes and <b>Anseriformes,</b> respectively. Most studies place these orders {{at the base of the}} neognath radiation. While DNA hybridization data support a sister-group relationship of Galliformes and Anseriformes, macromolecular sequence analyses have not yet been able to provide a clear-cut answer. In this study, we present nucleotide sequences coding for the eye lens proteins αA- and αB-crystallin of a palaeognath, a galliform, an anseriform, and two other neognathous birds. Phylogenetic analyses of this data set clearly support a galliform/anseriform clade, to the exclusion of other neognaths...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum is {{the most}} {{important}} pathogenic avian Mycoplasma species and causes chronic respiratory disease in poultry. In addition, the prevalence of Mycoplasma synoviae is of increasing concern in several EU member states. We investigated the prevalence of M. gallisepticum in commercial poultry (5220 layers, 1224 broilers and 1020 meat turkeys), 56 racing pigeons and 890 wild <b>birds</b> (Order <b>Anseriformes,</b> Galliformes, Pelecaniformes, Accipitriformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Strigiformes, Falconiformes and Passeriformes). Broilers and wild birds were also evaluated for M. synoviae. Dependent on the bird lifespan {{and the nature of the}} sample, different diagnostic tests were used including the rapid plate agglutination test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, polymerase chain reaction and real-time polymerase chain reaction. A low prevalence of M. gallisepticum was found in both layers (0. 9 %; 95 %CI: 0. 7 - 1. 2 %) and broilers (2. 7 %; 95 %CI: 1. 9 - 3. 8 %) possibly due to reduced vertical transmission by breeder farms, which are under official surveillance. None of the samples from turkeys or racing pigeons tested positive. In wild birds, we found five birds were positive (1. 7 %; 95 %CI: 0. 7 - 3. 9 %) : one wood pigeon, two grey herons, one mallard and one Eurasian magpie. For M. synoviae a high prevalence was found in broilers (12. 9 %: 95 %CI: 11. 1 - 14. 9 %). Four samples collected by hunters gave a positive result for M. synoviae (4 %: 95 %CI: 1. 6 - 9. 8 %) : one carrion crow and three wood pigeons. In addition 12 house sparrows were found to be positive (3 %; 95 %CI: 1. 7 - 5. 2 %). Wild birds probably play a limited role as a reservoir but we cannot exclude a possible impact on transmission of Mycoplasmas...|$|R

40|$|The Anseriformes is a {{well-known}} and widely distributed bird order, with more than 150 species in the world. This paper aims to revise the classification, determine the phylogenetic relationships and diversification patterns in Anseriformes by exploring the Cyt b, ND 2, COI genes and the complete mitochondrial genomes (mito-genomes). Molecular phylogeny and genetic distance analyses suggest that the Dendrocygna species {{should be considered as}} an independent family, Dendrocygnidae, rather than a member of Anatidae. Molecular timescale analyses suggests that the ancestral diversification occurred during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (58 ~ 50 Ma). Furthermore, diversification analyses showed that, after a long period of constant diversification, the median initial speciation rate was accelerated three times, and finally increased to approximately 0. 3 sp/My. In the present study, both molecular phylogeny and diversification analyses results support that <b>Anseriformes</b> <b>birds</b> underwent rapid and recent diversification in their evolutionary history, especially in modern ducks, which show extreme diversification during the Plio-Pleistocene (~ 5. 3 Ma). Therefore, our study support that the Plio-Pleistocene climate fluctuations are likely to have {{played a significant role in}} promoting the recent diversification for Anseriformes...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{relative}} importance of environmental (climate, habitat heterogeneity and topography), human (population density, economic prosperity and land transformation) and spatial (autocorrelation) influences, and the interactions between these predictor groups, on species richness patterns of various avifaunal orders. LOCATION: South Africa. METHODS: Generalized linear models were used to determine the amount of variation in species richness, for each order, attributable to each of the different predictor groups. To assess the relationships between species richness and the various predictor groups, a deviance statistic (a measure of goodness of fit for each model) and the percentage deviation explained for the best fitting model were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 12 avifaunal orders examined, spatially structured environmental deviance accounted for most of the variation in species richness in 11 orders (averaging 28 %), and 50 % or more in seven orders. However, orders comprising mostly water <b>birds</b> (Charadriiformes, <b>Anseriformes,</b> Ciconiformes) had a relatively large component of purely spatial deviance compared with spatially structured environmental deviance, and much of this spatial deviance was due to higher-order spatial effects such as patchiness, as opposed to linear gradients in species richness. Although human activity, in general, offered little explanatory power to species richness patterns, it was an important correlate of spatial variation in species of Charadriiformes and Anseriformes. The species richness of these water birds was positively related to the presence of artificial water bodies. MAIN CONCLUSION: Not all bird orders showed similar trends when assessing, simultaneously, {{the relative importance}} of environmental, human and spatial influences in affecting bird species richness patterns. Although spatially structured environmental deviance described most of the variation in bird species richness, the explanatory power of purely spatial deviance, mostly due to nonlinear geographical effects such as patchiness, became more apparent in orders representing water birds. This was especially true for Charadriiformes, where the strong anthropogenic relationship has negative implications for the successful conservation of this group...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{evaluate}} ecological diversity of wild birds in Siberia and the Russian Far East, which are carriers of Newcastle disease virus that belongs to potentially dangerous pathogen for poultry. Methods.   Biological materials (cloacal swabs and intestinal fragments) of wild migratory birds were collected in 2008 - 2014. The viral isolates were propagated in the allantoic cavity of developing chicken embryos. The presence of virus was determined in hemagglutination tests and primary identification of Newcastle disease virus was confirmed by RT-PCR. Pathogenicity of the obtained isolates was determined in tests ICPI and MDT. Results.   4443 samples were obtained from wild migratory birds of 11 avian orders and were investigated. Newcastle disease virus was detected in 40 birds from 4 orders. The Duck family (Anatidae) of the Waterfowl order (Anseriformes)  plays the {{leading role in the}} circulation of Newcastle disease virus in Siberia and the Far East. The main species among them - a teal (Anas crecca), a garganey (Anas querquedula), a mallard (Anas platyrhynchos)  and a shoveler (Anas clypeata). All studied isolatesof Newcastle disease virus are apatogenic except for two deponated strains. Main conclusions. Wild migratory <b>birds</b> from orders <b>Anseriformes</b> and Charadriiformes are capable of carrying Newcastle diseasevirus and could transfer pathogenic variants of this virus to the Russian territory. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFollowing the avian {{influenza}} (AI) epidemics {{that occurred in}} Italy between 1997 and 2003, the Italian Ministry of Health in collaboration with veterinary authorities promoted, funded and implemented a national surveillance programme. The main objectives of the surveillance effort were to identify {{avian influenza}} viruses (AIVs) circulating in wild birds and to investigate the role of backyard poultry flocks in the dynamics of infection in a densely populated poultry area (DPPA). Over two years (2004 - 2006) 164 backyard flocks and 4, 083 wild <b>birds</b> (mainly migratory <b>Anseriformes</b> and Charadriiformes) were sampled in three regions in the North of Italy. Samples collected were screened by means of real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and the positive samples were processed for attempted virus isolation in embryonated fowl's specific pathogen free (SPF) eggs. At {{the end of the}} study period 27 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses had been isolated from backyard flocks and 49 strains obtained from wild birds. Of these 26 belonged to the H 5 or H 7 subtype and were closely related to contemporary low pathogenic strains of Eurasian lineage. The findings confirm that backyard free range farming is at high risk for AIVs introduction, and the role of wild waterfowl in the introduction and perpetuation of LPAI viruses during the winter season in Southern Europe...|$|R
5000|$|Feduccia's {{research}} has focused on ornithology, evolutionary biology, vertebrate history and morphogenesis, and the tempo and mode of the Cenozoic vertebrate radiation. His early work in the 1970s focused on clarification of the evolutionary history of modern birds (Neornithes), focusing, in particular, on the importance of the identification of conserved morphological characters that might elucidate phylogeny more readily than more functionally correlated characters. Using this approach, in a series of publications, Feduccia analyzed the morphology of the bony stapes, the ear ossicle of birds, to help elucidate the interrelationships of passeriform birds. [...] This approach was extended to the analysis of non-passeriform birds as well, including owls and the shoebill, also known as the whalebill (Balaeniceps rex). [...] Other studies in the 1970s focused on the analysis of the Cenozoic avian radiation, with a particular focus on the origin and relationships of waterfowl Anseriformes. Based on his analysis of the osteology of the Paleocene and Eocene duck Presbyornis, represented in large quantities from Eocene deposits from outcrops of the Green River Formation in Utah and Wyoming, Feduccia concluded that Presbyornis represents a shorebird-duck mosaic and that waterfowl evolved from shorebirds (Charadriiformes). [...] This is contrary to the more widely held view that waterfowl are most closely related to chickens, turkeys, and related fowl (Galliformes), but Feduccia argues that this alternative phylogeny is unsupported by fossil evidence, and he suggests that any similarities between anseriform and galliform birds are attributable to homoplasy. [...] Partly based on his analysis of the osteology of Presbyornis, Feduccia also argued that flamingos, the phylogenetic relationships of which remain disputed, with some recent studies suggesting a sister-group relationship with grebes, were actually derived from shorebirds. [...] Feduccia summarized his position in the second edition of his book The Origin and Evolution of Birds: [...] "The study of Presbyornis planted the idea that shorebirds are the basic ancestral stock for both flamingolike <b>birds</b> and the <b>anseriformes,</b> ducks and their allies...".|$|R
