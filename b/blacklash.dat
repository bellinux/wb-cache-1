2500|$|Star Trek went to {{series on}} the basis of the second pilot, but still fearing <b>blacklash</b> against Spock's ears, and issues with selling the show to {{stations}} in the Bible Belt, NBC airbrushed out the pointed tips in an advertising brochure about the series. Spock's role was used as audition material for new cast members. Nichelle Nichols was intrigued by the role when she read his lines, and asked why the character could not be female. The producers response was that Nimoy would not like it. It was during the filming of the first non-pilot episode to be shot, [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", that under the direction of Joseph Sargent, Nimoy was directed to remain aloof during a tense moment and said the catchphrase [...] "fascinating" [...] for the first time. This moment was subsequently given by the writing staff as an example of how the character should act. Nimoy liked Spock's newly logical nature, observing that the character is [...] "struggling to maintain a Vulcan attitude, a Vulcan philosophical posture and a Vulcan logic, opposing what was fighting him internally, which was human emotion". Nimoy stated that after [...] "The Naked Time", in which a disease causes Spock to cry, [...] "I knew that we were not playing a man with no emotions, but a man who had great pride, who had learned to control his emotions and who would deny that he knew what emotions were. In a way, he was more human than anyone else on the ship." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{was dressed}} in blue linen, and a little cloud of honey-coloured hair; her small face had serious eyes the colour of the chicory flowers she was holding up to sniff at--a clean sober little maid, with a very {{touching}} upward look of trust. Her companion was a strong, active boy of perhaps fourteen, and he, too, was serious--his deep-set, <b>blacklashed</b> eyes {{looked down at her}} with a queer protective wonder; the while he explained in a soft voice broken up between two ages, that exact process which bees adopt to draw honey out of flowers. Once or twice this hoarse but charming voice became quite fervent, when she had evidently failed to follow; {{it was as if he}} would have been impatient, only he knew he must not, because she was a lady and younger than himself, and he loved her.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} All-New, All-Different Marvel event, {{a female}} supervillain takes the name of <b>Blacklash.</b> The female <b>Blacklash</b> was hired by Power Broker through the Hench App to protect his {{unveiling}} of Hench App 2.0.

50|$|The trio again {{tried to}} capture Force, who was {{protected}} by Iron Man. Although Blizzard fought better, when Force entered the fight he neutralized the villains' powers. Blizzard, Beetle, and <b>Blacklash</b> split up, fled and rested until their powers returned. Force found Blizzard, whose powers were ineffective against him so Blizzard fought him with bare hands. Force repelled him, blasting him through a wall. Blizzard doggedly tried to blast Force again (despite warnings), and was electrocuted. The Beetle and <b>Blacklash</b> abandoned Blizzard; Chemistro blamed them for their failures, and they were arrested.|$|E
5000|$|Born in Delaware, Donald [...] "Donnie" [...] Gill was a {{professional}} criminal hired by Justin Hammer (who gave him a cryogenic suit resembling the original Blizzard's suit). Since Blizzard was vaporized by Iron Man 2020, Donnie adopted the name. His first mission involved working with Beetle and <b>Blacklash</b> to capture Force, who had betrayed Hammer. However, Blizzard was clumsy and annoyed his teammates with his amateurish mistakes (such as creating an ice wall blocking the path to their objective). After encasing <b>Blacklash</b> in ice, the trio fled as reinforcements arrived to protect Force.|$|E
50|$|Luis Barrett {{had somehow}} {{obtained}} superhuman speed while in high school. He {{came from a}} poor family and {{knew that he would}} not obtain a scholarship after he graduated. Justin Hammer later learned of Luis' powers and sent Barrier, <b>Blacklash,</b> and Ringer II to bring Luis to him. Using his business connections, Justin Hammer obtained William Carver's Thunderbolt costume. Then he gave the costume to Luis Barrett so that he can convince him to join Hammer's criminal enterprises in exchange for funding his college scholarship. When members of the Pantheon warned Luis of Hammer's intentions, Luis turned against Justin Hammer's villain allies during a plot to steal an experimental plane from Air Force One base. Ringer bound Thunderbolt's legs during the fight. Before <b>Blacklash</b> could attack Thunderbolt, he managed to take out <b>Blacklash</b> despite the fact that his legs were bound.

Scarlotti, however, is hired by a rival of Stark and returns as Whiplash, with an upgraded costume and new weaponry.
