5|$|These {{appendages}} {{vary widely}} {{in form and}} function and the only consistent difference <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> their position: chelicerae arise from segment two, ahead of the mouth, and pedipalps from segment three, behind the mouth.|$|E
5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, their position corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E

5|$|Plasma and ionised gases have unique {{properties}} and display behaviors unlike {{those of the}} other states, and the transition <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> mostly a matter of nomenclature and subject to interpretation. Based on the surrounding environmental temperature and density, partially ionised or fully ionised forms of plasma may be produced. Neon signs or lightning storms are examples of partially ionised plasma, while the interior of the Sun is an example of fully ionised plasma, along with the solar corona and stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 and deep-level platforms, opened in 1913. It {{is one of}} two {{separate}} Underground stations of the same name. The other station, {{to the north of the}} mainline station, is served by the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a single station, the two stations are not directly linked and interchange <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> via the concourse of the mainline station.|$|E

5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. To form an ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese sleeper ray has {{an almost}} {{circular}} pectoral fin disc wider than long. Two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{under the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The small, protruding eyes are immediately followed by larger spiracles with prominently raised, smooth rims. The nostrils are small and placed close together, and <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The protrusible mouth forms a short, transverse line and is surrounded by a deep groove. There are fewer than 25 tooth rows in each jaw, arranged into bands; the teeth are small with oval bases and pointed crowns. Five pairs of short gill slits are located on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the onefin electric ray is wider than long and almost circular in shape. The two large, kidney-shaped electric organs are visible {{beneath the skin}} {{on either side of}} the head. The eyes are small and protruding; the larger spiracles lie closely behind and have three small finger-like projections on their rims. The nostrils are placed rather close together, and <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a long skirt-like flap of skin that reaches the mouth. The small and protrusible mouth is nearly straight and surrounded by prominent furrows. The teeth are tiny and pointed. There are five pairs of small gill slits on the underside of the disc.|$|E

5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Brain {{activity}} {{is made possible}} by the interconnections of neurons that are linked together to reach their targets. A neuron consists of a cell body, axon, and dendrites. Dendrites are often extensive branches that receive information in the form of signals from the axon terminals of other neurons. The signals received may cause the neuron to initiate an action potential (an electrochemical signal or nerve impulse) which is sent along its axon to the axon terminal, to connect with the dendrites or with the cell body of another neuron. An action potential is initiated at the initial segment of an axon, which contains a complex of proteins. When an action potential, reaches the axon terminal it triggers the release of a neurotransmitter at a synapse that propagates a signal that acts on the target cell. These chemical neurotransmitters include dopamine, serotonin, GABA, glutamate, and acetylcholine. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. Neurons link at synapses to form pathways and elaborate neural networks, and the activity <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E

5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space <b>between</b> <b>them</b> <b>is</b> stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E
