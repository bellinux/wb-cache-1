[...] "We called him that because I used to say, 'I {{want to take}} this dude's head and pull it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> his tongue out of his neck,'" [...] Rose grumbled. It features such lines as, [...] "Look at your face, look at your name/ Funny you're a loser with only yourself to blame," [...] and [...] "You want to be like me 'cause it's real/ So you steal on your way to fame." ...|$|R
40|$|Motor and {{galvanic}} skin potential (GSP) activity {{were investigated}} during the conditioning, extinction, <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning</b> of motor responses under a differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL) schedule of reinforcement. Interresponse time (IRT) distributions for motor responses during conditioning <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning</b> gradually stabilized at a peak {{just beyond the}} minimal IRT required for reinforcement. Few unreinforced motor responses and “bursts” of motor responses were observed during conditioning <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning.</b> Relative to conditioning <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning,</b> extinction effected larger IRTs and smaller GSP amplitudes. GSP amplitudes were greater for unreinforced than for reinforced motor responses during conditioning <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning.</b> However, GSP amplitudes associated with the unreinforced extinction responses were smaller than either the reinforced or unreinforced responses during conditioning <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... ===Knee=== This {{suspension}} {{takes place}} hooked from the knees and hung vertically {{with the head}} closest {{to the ground and}} the knees at the top. There is no standard for hook placement on this suspension, as it depends almost solely on the anatomy of the suspendee. Some people refer to this as a [...] "Falkner" [...] suspension since Allen Falkner is the first known person to ever attempt this particular configuration. This style is relatively new, but is quickly growing in popularity. It is not considered to be an extremely painful suspension, but the drawbacks include lower <b>back</b> pain <b>and</b> <b>ripping</b> of skin in the areas around the knees. Another factor of this suspension is the increased blood pressure to the brain due to the inverted position, which can lead to disorientation and cause headaches.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second season}} {{was the first}} to feature three {{different}} kinds of eliminations; also, the camera effects were removed. The contestant {{on the left side of}} the stage was seated in front of a seemingly normal brick wall. If they lost, his/her chair was pulled backwards and upon hitting the wall a trap door would swing open to allow the contestant to be pulled backstage. The door was then shut to [...] "trap" [...] the contestant behind the wall. The contestant in the middle was in front of a doorway lined with blue wallpaper. Upon elimination, he would be pulled <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>rip</b> through the wallpaper, with a black curtain lowered in front of the contestant to keep him hidden them from view. The contestant on the right was in the infamous [...] "flipper" [...] chair, which was yanked upwards and backwards so that the stage floor was now the wall from the vantage point of the audience.|$|R

50|$|Soon, {{they reach}} the Okavango Delta, where Xan is {{attacked}} by the deadly wildlife and the churning rapids of the Thamalakane River, but it’s too late for him to turn <b>back</b> now. Xan, <b>Rip</b> <b>and</b> Duma press through the Okavango, and finally the Erongo Mountains, {{on the border of}} Botswana and Namibia are in sight. However, once they get there, Xan is suddenly set upon by a swarm of tsetse flies. To protect him from their lethal bite, Rip huddles over Xan and is bitten by hundreds of flies. He soon develops sleeping sickness, and Xan takes him to a nearby village where he can be cared for. Later that night, outside the village, Duma is out on his own and starts calling out into the mountains. Duma finds another cheetah calling to him, and they bond rather quickly. It is never explained whether this is another male cheetah, or is in fact one of Duma's siblings. Xan hears this activity, and realizes that this is where he and Duma must part. Xan says goodbye to Duma, and Duma comes to Xan and says a final goodbye, and goes back to play with his new friend. Then Xan goes back to the village to Rip. Before the credits, it shows Xan being reunited with his mother and the film ends.|$|R

The experiments were conducted in the Laboratory of Postharvest of Vegetable Crops Research Institute (BALITSA) from July to October 2012. Altitude research is ± 1200 masl with temperatures between 14. 94 - 24. 61 °C and the relative humidity (rH) 85. 56 %. Experimental design used in this study was factorial a randomized complete design consisting of 2 factors.

40|$|Many Slovenian {{communities}} are facing drinking water supply issues. Major problems are {{the life span}} of pipelines and other supply system equipment, undersized water supply network and inappropriate pipeline material. The community of Vodice is facing the previously- described issues. A need to reconstruct <b>and</b> <b>recondition</b> the drinking water pipeline system was identified. It was necessary to develop a hydraulic model of Vodice’s drinking water pipeline system. A simulation, based on the hydraulic model, was used to analize the currents pipeline system’s functionality and conformity with technical standards. Through this a deviation from the applicable technical standards was identified and various solutions to improve the pipeline system’s functionality were proposed. The most optimal solution was selected for the reconstruction <b>and</b> <b>reconditioning</b> proposal...|$|R
40|$|Ribosome-inactivating {{proteins}} (RIPs) are toxins {{that act}} as N-glycosidases (EC 3. 2. 2. 22).
