40|$|This paper {{presents}} a quantitative {{general equilibrium model}} with multiple <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The framework incorporates a banking sector and distinguishes between M 1, the monetary base, currency and various measures of reserves: total, excess and non borrowed. We use {{a variant of the}} model to analyze two sets of empirical facts. The first set of facts is that different <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> covary differently with short term nominal interest rates. <b>Broad</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> like M 1 and the monetary base covary positively with current and future values of short term interest rates. In contrast, the non borrowed reserves of banks covary negatively with current and future interest rates. Observations like this `sign switch' lie at the core of recent debates about the effects of monetary policy actions on short term interest rates. According to our model, the sign switch occurs because movements in non borrowed reserves are dominated by exogenous shocks to monetary policy, while movements in the base and M 1 are dominated by endogenous responses to non-policy shocks. The second set of facts that we consider is that <b>broad</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> covary positively with output. We quantify the Friedman and Schwartz hypothesis that this covariation reflects the effects of exogenous shocks to monetary policy, and the hypothesis that they reflect the endogenous response of <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregates</b> to shocks in the private economy. ...|$|R

Employing multivariate co-integration methodology {{of the same}} order integrated variables, our estimation results indicate that there exists a theoretically plausible co-integrating vector in the long-run money demand variable space. The main alternative costs to demand for money are found as the depreciation rate of domestic currency and the course of equity prices, for which the former brings out the importance of currency substitution phenomenon settled in the economy. Besides, we find that domestic inflation carries a weakly exogenous characteristic and conclude that the main factors leading to the domestic inflation are determined {{out of the money}} demand variable space. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{empirical}} literature, monetary policy shocks are commonly measured as an innovation to a short-term nominal interest rate. In contrast, {{the majority of}} monetary business cycle models treats a <b>broad</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>aggregate</b> as the central bank's policy measure. We try overcome this disparity and present a business cycle model which allows {{to examine the effects}} of innovations to a non-contingent nominal interest rate rule. To obtain unique rational expectations equilibria we assume that changes in money supply are brought about open market operations. In addition to working capital, we consider staggered prices which enables real marginal costs to vary. Consistent with {{the empirical}} findings of Barth and Ramey (2000), the model predicts that real marginal cost and inflation rise in response to positive interest rate innovations. The mechanism corresponds to their 'Cost Channel of Monetary Transmission' and replicates typical monetary VAR results, including the puzzling behavior of prices. ...|$|E
