50|$|The {{remaining}} personnel {{arrived on}} 14 August 1943 when investigations were {{under way to}} locate a suitable airstrip. By {{the end of that}} month, a camouflage party from the Department of Home Security was engaged at the station. During this time <b>black-out</b> <b>lighting</b> was installed, preparation of slit trenches was under-way, fixed weapons had been installed and small arms were issued to the airmen whose defence training included shooting expeditions in the surrounding country. Defence preparations continued in January 1944 with the construction of a 25-yard shooting range.|$|E
5000|$|Residential {{customers}} in areas fed by affected {{overhead power lines}} can occasionally see the effects of an autorecloser in action. If the fault affects the customer's own distribution circuit, they may see one or several brief, complete outages followed by either normal operation (as the autorecloser succeeds in restoring power after a transient fault has cleared) or a complete outage of service (as the autorecloser exhausts its retries). If the fault is on an adjacent circuit, the customer may see several brief [...] "dips" [...] (sags) in voltage as the heavy fault current flows into the adjacent circuit and is interrupted one or more times. A typical manifestation would be the dip, or intermittent <b>black-out,</b> of domestic <b>lighting</b> during an electrical storm. Autorecloser action may result in electronic devices losing time settings, losing data in volatile memory, halting, restarting, or suffering damage due to power interruption. Owners of such equipment may need to protect electronic devices against the consequences of power interruptions and also power surges.|$|R
