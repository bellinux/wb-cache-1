50|$|Conversion bulbs are {{manufactured}} so {{they work with}} either a MH or HPS ballast. A grower can run an HPS conversion bulb on a MH ballast, or a MH conversion bulb on a HPS ballast. The difference between the ballasts is an HPS ballast has an igniter which ignites the sodium in an HPS bulb, while a MH ballast does not. Because of this, all electrical ballasts can fire MH bulbs, but only a Switchable or HPS ballast can fire an HPS <b>bulb</b> <b>without</b> a conversion <b>bulb.</b> Usually a metal halide conversion bulb {{will be used in}} an HPS ballast since the MH conversion bulbs are more common.|$|R

50|$|As of 2012, several {{companies}} {{have started to}} offer self-ballasted metal-halide lamps as a direct replacement for incandescent and self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps. These lamps include an arc tube with a starting electrode {{as well as a}} tubular halogen lamp which is connected in series and used to regulate the current in the arc tube. A resistor provides the current limiting for the starting electrode. Like self-ballasted mercury-vapor lamps, self-ballasted metal-halide lamps are connected directly to mains power and do not require an external ballast. In contrast to the former, these lamps usually have a clear outer <b>bulb</b> <b>without</b> a coating, making the arc tube and the halogen lamp tube clearly visible from the outside.|$|R

The results are as follows : 1. The consumption of fabric products in Japan has increased mainly dependent on the Gross Domestic Products. 2. The ratio of the consumption of fabric products to the whole consumption decreased every year, resulting 5. 9 % in 1996. The reason of the decrease of clothing expense was mainly because of decrease of the payment for men's and children's wear. The amount paid for women' s wear is rather increasing. 3. Focusing on the foundation garment, {{it is the best}} way to fit foundation garments before purchasing to decrease the inactive ones. Although purchasing <b>without</b> <b>fitting</b> decreased since 1989, 5856 of the purchasers still buy the foundation garments <b>without</b> <b>fitting.</b> It is necessary to enlighten the necessity of fitting when buying them. 4.
