5|$|These scenic {{areas were}} first {{described}} {{for the public}} in magazine articles published by Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads in 1916. People like Forest Supervisor J. W. Humphrey promoted the scenic wonders of Bryce Canyon's amphitheaters, and by 1918 nationally distributed articles also helped to spark interest. However, poor access to the remote area {{and the lack of}} accommodations kept visitation to a <b>bare</b> <b>minimum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a <b>bare</b> <b>minimum</b> 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded by {{soldiers of the}} Japanese Army and concludes that at least 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey proves that a <b>bare</b> <b>minimum</b> of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, plus at least another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally concludes that the death toll must have been well over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E

5|$|Extending the police's {{presence}} {{across the}} region was logistically challenging, requiring {{the creation of a}} network of new posts and the use of steamers to move supplies around the coast. It proved to be a harsh existence for the force, particularly when deliveries of supplies were delayed by bad weather. Work began on a railroad to Hudson Bay in 1908, continuing for two decades, which, although it required substantial police assistance, gradually eased the challenge of supplying the police outposts around the bay. The police opened temporary detachments around York Factory in 1912, and then at Port Nelson in 1913, where the police established their divisional headquarters. Patrols pushed up into Baker Lake and along the Coppermine River until, {{by the end of the}} decade, the police presence in Hudson Bay had been reduced to a <b>bare</b> <b>minimum,</b> with the force focusing on reaching out into ever more remote areas.|$|E
5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a <b>bare</b> <b>minimum</b> were {{provided}} as the time interval system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in recent days, and most suspected that an attack would come {{against one of the}} border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the <b>bare</b> <b>minimum</b> number of men as the majority that could be spared went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E

40|$|Assuming that {{tunnel effect}} between two {{degenerate}} <b>bare</b> <b>minima</b> occurs, in a scalar field theory at finite volume, this article studies {{the consequences for}} the effective potential, to all loop orders. Convexity is achieved only if the two <b>bare</b> <b>minima</b> {{are taken into account}} in the path integral, and a new derivation of the effective potential is given, in the large volume limit. The effective potential has then has a universal form, it is suppressed by the space time volume, and does not feature spontaneous symmetry breaking as long as the volume is finite. The finite temperature analysis leads to surprising thermal properties, following from the non-extensive expression for the free energy. Although the physical relevance of these results is not clear, the potential application to ultra-light scalar particles is discussed. Comment: 17 page...|$|R

The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the <b>bare</b> <b>minimum</b> to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E

30|$|At {{persistence}} phase, {{the principal}} factors were dissimilar as registration process (0.943) {{was the principal}} factor for the pooled data. Whereas tax (0.988) was the principal factor in Nigeria, while market regulation (0.999) was the principal factor in South Africa. Recently, in both economies, the registration process have been enhanced such that the bottle necks and bureaucratic processes {{have been reduced to}} the <b>barest</b> <b>minimum.</b>|$|R
30|$|Since patrol {{members were}} {{flexible}} in implementation of management plans and strategies they contributed to reducing the encounter rates to the <b>barest</b> <b>minimum.</b> In {{spite of the}} financial constraints, with often no more a trickle of operational funds flowing to the field, the patrol staffs have done a tremendous good job under difficult circumstance and if it continues illegal wildlife off-take would be reduced drastically.|$|R
