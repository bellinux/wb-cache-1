To that end, in 2009, forms were distributed asking Iranians to report income, assets and property <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> remains on how the government will verify this information gathered by self-reporting. Many people have chosen not to report or withhold information. The {{administration has}} categorized the people into three income brackets; namely lower, middle, and higher for the implementation of the subsidy reform plan. On the other side, it was not clear in what form the compensation would be distributed, direct cash or goods. Another concern is the accuracy of government information on family incomes.|$|E

25|$|There are however {{problems}} with the shell model when an attempt is made to account for nuclear properties well away from closed shells.

Problems with the shell model have led some to propose realistic two-body and three-body nuclear force effects involving nucleon clusters and then build the nucleus on this basis. Two such cluster models are the Close-Packed Spheron Model of Linus Pauling and the 2D Ising Model of MacGregor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s matroid theorists {{asked for a}} more general notion that shares the {{different}} aspects of finite matroids and generalizes their duality.

According to a recent result by , it solves the problem: Arriving at the same notion independently, they provided five equivalent systems of axioms – in terms of independence, bases, circuits, closure and rank. The duality of B-matroids generalizes dualities that can be observed in infinite graphs.|$|E

25|$|This {{notation}} {{does not}} easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords {{can be very}} difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are six possible permutations of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am+, which would strike most musicians as odd. In fact, this {{turns out to be the}} same as F/A bass (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A5.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1922, in {{an attempt}} to {{dislodge}} Anti-Treaty forces holed up in the Four Courts, salvos were launched by Free State troops into the area housing Anti-Treaty munitions, which led to an enormous out-of-control fire. The massive conflagration spread rapidly, destroying the buildings and resulting in the almost total destruction of the mass of Irish historical records archived in the Public Records Office of Ireland (and {{in other parts of the}} Four Courts). As this closely followed the 1921 destruction of centuries of other important Irish records kept in the Custom House, Dublin, the cumulative effect was the annihilation of a huge swath of Ireland's historical resources, to the despair of future researchers seeking to document many aspects of Irish history. Subsequent efforts by archivists and other interested parties have played an extremely important role in attempting to replace what was lost but, though an impressive inventory of material has been amassed, continues to accumulate and is now housed in the National Archives of Ireland, much of what was lost in the 1922 fire was irreplaceable. Which side bore the burden of the blame for the fire led to recriminations in the fire's aftermath, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of which side was ultimately responsible remains unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Most Ashkenazim {{have the}} custom {{to fill a}} fifth cup at this point. This relates to a Talmudic {{discussion}} that concerns the number of cups {{that are supposed to}} be drunk. Given that the four cups are in reference to the four expressions of redemption in Exodus 6:6-7, some rabbis felt {{that it was important to}} include a fifth cup for the fifth expression of redemption in Exodus 6:8. All agreed that five cups should be poured <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> as to whether or not the fifth should be drunk, given that the fifth expression of redemption concerned being brought into the Land of Israel, which - by this stage - was no longer possessed of an autonomous Jewish community, remained insoluble. The rabbis determined that the matter should be left until Elijah (in reference to the notion that Elijah's arrival would precipitate the coming of the Messiah, at which time all halakhic questions will be resolved) and the fifth cup came to be known as the Kos shel Eliyahu ("Cup of Elijah"). Over time, people came to relate this cup to the notion that Elijah will visit each home on Seder night as a foreshadowing of his future arrival at the end of the days, when he will come to announce the coming of the Jewish Messiah.|$|E
