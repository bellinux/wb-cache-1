30|$|Current {{harmonized}} guidance {{dictates that}} the hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, and <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are systematically established, {{but does not}} fully address the specific requirements for the bulk hold time stability study. The reason for this lack of flexibility is that the guidance definition of the date of manufacture is “the date when active ingredients are combined with other ingredients” for shelf life derivation. However, alternative methods of shelf life can be derived using “the date of stable intermediate being further processed for downstream process” instead of the date of manufacture. To be able to establish an alternative shelf life, stability studies that can establish sequential bulk hold times for drug substance intermediates, product intermediates, as well as <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> are required. This can be achieved during the development phase encompassing Phase I-III IND/CTA and NDA/WMA filing and the derived alternative shelf life methodology made applicable for later bulk manufacturing process.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of 24 {{buildings in the}} Greater Boston Area revealed that one-third (8 of 24) contained caulking materials with polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content exceeding 50 ppm by weight, which is the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) specified limit above which this material {{is considered to be}} PCB <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> waste. These buildings included schools and other public buildings. In a university building where similar levels of PCB were found in caulking material, PCB levels in indoor air ranged from 111 to 393 ng/m 3; and in dust taken from the building ventilation system, < 1 ppm to 81 ppm. In this building, the U. S. EPA mandated requirements for the removal and disposal of the PCB <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> waste as well as for confirmatory sampling to ensure that the interior and exterior of the building were decontaminated. Although U. S. EPA regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act stipulate procedures by which PCB-contaminated materials must be handled and disposed, the regulations apparently do not require that materials such as caulking be tested to determine its PCB content. This limited investigation strongly suggests that were this testing done, many buildings would be found to contain high levels of PCBs in the building materials and potentially in the building environment. The presence of PCBs in schools is of particular concern given evidence suggesting that PCBs are developmental toxins...|$|E

40|$|CuH is a {{material}} {{that appears in}} a wide diversity of circumstances ranging from catalysis to electrochemistry to organic synthesis. There are both aqueous and nonaqueous synthetic routes to CuH, each of which apparently leads to a different product. We developed synthetic methodologies that enable multigram quantities of CuH to be produced by both routes and characterized each product {{by a combination of}} spectroscopic, diffraction and computational methods. The results show that, while all methods for the synthesis of CuH result in the same <b>bulk</b> <b>product,</b> the synthetic path taken engenders differing surface properties. The different behaviors of CuH obtained by aqueous and nonaqueous routes can be ascribed to a combination of very different particle size and dissimilar surface termination, namely, bonded hydroxyls for the aqueous routes and a coordinated donor for the nonaqueous routes.

To reduce some of the drawbacks of frozen storage of <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> it is blanched. Blanching operation greatly influences the quality of stored frozen peas, considerably reducing the surface microflora of the product and produces the thermal inactivation of enzymes. It was found that insufficient blanching treatment leads to changes in aroma and taste of the product, especially due to enzyme activity and pyruvate-decarboxilase and lypoxidasa, with the formation of volatile compounds like aldehydes and ketones, which cause taste and smelly of herbal products.

40|$|In food {{processing}} plants, raw materials are {{fed into the}} system in different supply-lots of product, and are processed through different stages. In these stages, raw or intermediate materials are mixed or combined together, and physico-chemical and/or microbiological processes such as heating, concentration, pasteurisation etc. take place. In this setting, traceability consists {{of the ability to}} determine for each portion of intermediate or final product, in any part of the plant, its relative composition in terms of supply-lots fed into the system as well as of new lots generated during the production process. Traceability becomes particularly difficult in the very common case when <b>bulk</b> <b>products,</b> such as liquids or grains, are involved in the production chain. Current traceability practices are in most cases unable to directly deal with <b>bulk</b> <b>products,</b> and typically resort to the definition of very large lots to compensate the lack of knowledge about lot composition. As demonstrated in recent food crises, this over-bounding approach has weaknesses in clearly identifying, immediately after risk assessment, the affected product lots, leading to unavoidably wide, expensive and highly impacting recalls. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a novel approach to manage traceability of <b>bulk</b> <b>products</b> during production, storage and delivery. It provides a tight definition of lots in terms of their composition and size, thus allowing strict control of the production and supply chain...|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The apparatus (100) for evaporating a material (104) inside a vacuum chamber (101), comprises a vessel (103), in which the material is evaporatable, where a surface area of an outer wall of the vessel is covered with a porous heat-insulating layer (107), which is spaced with a gap from the outer wall of the vessel. A gas is conveyable through the pores of the heat-insulating layer and/or through the gap using a device. The heat-insulating layer comprises a <b>bulk</b> <b>product</b> such as granule and/or gravel, metal foam or graphite foam, and graphite fiber plates. The closing of the gap is formed at the top edge of the vessel as a nozzle. The exit direction of the gases from the nozzle is adjustable and the shape of the rising vapor clouds is modeled. The material is evaporatable by an electron beam generating device. The apparatus has a sensor, by which a value for the temperature of the vessel or a value for the temperature of the heat-insulating layer is detectable, and an evaluation device, by which the conveying quantity of the gases is regulated in dependent of the values detected by the sensor. The vessel consists of graphite, metal, metal compound, sintering body or ceramic. The device for conveying the gases through the pores and/or through the gap is operatable with switched-on vacuum pumps that are used for generating vacuum in the vacuum chamber and with switched-off vacuum pumps. The apparatus has a further device, by which the gas is pumpable from the vacuum chamber. USE - Apparatus for evaporating a material such as tin and copper inside a vacuum chamber.
