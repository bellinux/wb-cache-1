60|$|Yet another, {{the pick}} {{of all the}} East rooms, before we have done with blue water. Most of {{the nations of the}} earth are at issue under a stretch of white awning above a crowded deck. The cause of the dispute, a deep copper bowl foil of rice and fried onions, is upset in the foreground. Malays, Lascars, Hindus, Chinese, Japanese, Burmans--the whole gamut of racetints, from saffron to tar-black--are {{twisting}} and writhing round it, while their vermilion, cobalt, amber, and emerald turbans and head-cloths are lying underfoot. Pressed against the yellow ochre of the iron bulwarks to left and right are frightened women and children in turquoise and isabella-coloured clothes. They are half protected by mounds of upset <b>bedding,</b> <b>straw</b> mats, red lacquer boxes, and plaited bamboo trunks, mixed up with tin plates, brass and copper hukas, silver opium pipes, Chinese playing cards, and properties enough to drive half-a-dozen artists wild. In the centre of the crowd of furious half-naked men, the fat bare back of a Burman, tattooed from collar-bone to waist-cloth with writhing patterns of red and blue devils, holds the eye first. It is a wicked back. Beyond it is the flicker of a Malay kris. A blue, red, and yellow macaw chained to a stanchion spreads his wings against the sun in an ecstasy of terror. Half-a-dozen red-gold pines and bananas have been knocked down from their ripening-places, and are lying between the feet of the fighters. One pine has rolled against the long brown fur of a muzzled bear. His owner, a bushy-bearded Hindu, kneels over the animal, his body-cloth thrown clear of a hard brown arm, his fingers ready to loose the muzzle-strap. The ship's cook, in blood-stained white, watches from the butcher's shop, and a black Zanzibari stoker grins through the bars of the engine-room-hatch, one ray of sun shining straight into his pink mouth. The officer of the watch, a red-whiskered man, is kneeling down on the bridge to peer through the railings, and is shifting a long, thin black revolver from his left hand to his right. The faithful sunlight that puts everything into place, gives his whiskers and the {{hair on the back of}} his tanned wrist just the colour of the copper pot, the bear's fur and the trampled pines. For the rest, there is the blue sea beyond the awnings.|$|E

50|$|On many farms, {{the basic}} {{composting}} ingredients are animal manure generated {{on the farm}} and <b>bedding.</b> <b>Straw</b> and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the farming}} {{communities}} of Ohio, fertilization of fields was possible {{only by the}} distribution of animal excrement, usually mixed with <b>bedding</b> <b>straw</b> to create a semi-solid mixture of manure. The task of shoveling and distributing the manure was backbreaking {{and there were many}} attempts made to mechanize this process. One such example was a patent by a Daniel Merrell in 1886 for a mechanized [...] "manure spreader". [...] There were a number of other patent filings prior to the onset of the 20th century. In 1899 John M Kramer, Fred Heckman and Henry Synck, Jr., all of whom lived in the small farming community of Maria Stein, OH were awarded a patent for a device to spread manure which they named a [...] "manure distributor". Synck subsequently worked with his future father-in-law, Joseph Oppenheim, to develop the first practical manure spreader. Oppenheim's 1900 invention was so successful that it spawned a major manufacturing company, the New Idea Spreader Works, later renamed the New Idea Farm Machinery Company in 1899. New Idea celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999 as a division of AGCO. Synck's role in the evolution of manure spreader and other farm machinery technology is well documented by a steady stream of patents that not only describe improvements to the manure spreader, but also other farm machinery from 1899 to 1939.|$|E
40|$|Background Domesticated grazing animals {{including}} {{horses and}} donkeys are frequently housed using deep litter bedding systems, {{where it is}} commonly presumed {{that there is no}} risk of infection from the nematodes that are associated with grazing at pasture. We use two different approaches to test whether equids could become infected with cyathostomines from the ingestion of deep litter <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> Methods Two herbage plot studies were performed in horticultural incubators set up to simulate three <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> scenarios and one grass turf positive control. Faeces were placed on 16 plots, and larval recoveries performed on samples of straw/grass substrate over 2 - to 3 -week periods. Within each incubator, a thermostat was set to maintain an environmental temperature of approximately 10 °C to 20 °C. To provide further validation, 24 samples of <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> were collected over an 8 -week period from six barns in which a large number of donkeys were housed in a deep litter <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> system. These samples were collected from the superficial bedding at 16 sites along a “W” route through each barn. Results No infective larvae were recovered from any of the plots containing dry straw. However, infective cyathostomine larvae were first detected on day 8 from plots containing moist straw. In the <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> study, cyathostomine larvae were detected in 18 of the 24 samples. Additionally, in the two barns which were sampled serially, the level of larval infectivity generally increased from week to week, except when the <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> was removed and replaced. Conclusions We have demonstrated that equine cyathostomines can develop to infective larvae on moist <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> It is therefore possible for a horse or donkey bedded in deep litter straw to become infected by ingesting the contaminated straw. This has implications for parasite control in stabled equids and potentially in housed ruminants, and further investigation is required in order to establish the relative infective pressure from pasture versus <b>straw</b> <b>bedding...</b>|$|R

The objective of this work was to assess the efficacy of different technologies on the production of medicated <b>bedding</b> <b>straw.</b> Four critical control points of an industrial straw disinfection processing line were identified. The levels of fungi and bacteria present in the straw during an industrially applied mechanical – chemical process were quantified. The plate counting revealed that propionic acid and formaldehyde chemicals reduced the microbial levels from the raw material and that they were more efficient on moulds than on bacteria. The potential use of ozone gas as an alternative greener technology to the current liquid chemical treatments was also evaluated. Trials conducted on ozone treatments (flow rates: 0. 031, 0. 125, 0. 5 L/min, concentrations: 36, 99, 150 μg/mL, treatment time: 0, 5, 15, 30 mins, and residual times of 0 to 18 hrs) indicated that ozone successfully reduces the microbial counts and the fungi levels by more than 1. 5 logs (cfu/g) ...|$|E
40|$|After intensifying pig {{husbandry}} {{in the second}} half of the 20 th century to improve economical development, public concern brought about legislation to secure animal welfare and ecological values. The development of welfare-friendly sow husbandry in recent years focussed mainly on two purposes: to keep sows loose in groups and to provide the sows with <b>straw</b> <b>bedding.</b> The main objective of this research was to establish the effect on ammonia emission of group housing and <b>straw</b> <b>bedding,</b> and eventually to find tools to reduce the emission. With <b>straw</b> <b>bedding,</b> the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide were also considered, because environmental goals are not served by pollution swapping. The results showed that group housing of sows does not increase ammonia emission compared to individual housing of sows. Given appropriate straw management, providing a <b>straw</b> <b>bed</b> reduces ammonia emission, and emissions of methane and nitrous oxide are not substantial. However more research is needed in order to understand the conditions for low greenhouse-gas emissions. Although the measured effect was modest, shifting feeding time might be a tool to reduce ammonia emission. A model was developed to estimate ammonia emission from a sow house with group housing and <b>straw</b> <b>bedding</b> as the sum of the emissions from straw, solid floors, slatted floors and pits after urinations. The results of simulations show that measures to reduce ammonia emissions are most effective if aimed at decreasing the emission from the solid floor and stimulating relatively more urinations on the <b>straw</b> <b>bed.</b> The model appeared to be a useful tool for designing straw-bedded sow group-housing with low ammonia emissions...|$|R

30|$|Feasibility of {{lignocellulosic}} {{material for}} ethanol production has been explored {{around the world}} depending upon availability. Production of ethanol from wheat straw, {{one of the most}} abundant agricultural wastes, has been extensively studied (Ballesteros et al. 2004, Curreli et al. 2002, Curreli et al. 1997, Talebnia et al. 2010). The average yield of wheat straw is 1.3 – 1.4 lb per lb of wheat grain (Montane et al. 1998). According to Ballesteros et al. 2006, under the 60 % ground cover practice, about 354 millions of tons of wheat straw could be available globally and could produce 104 GL of bioethanol. Europe production would account for about 38 % of this world bioethanol capacity. In Spain, grain industry generates important amounts of wheat straw, a part of which is used as <b>bedding</b> <b>straw</b> and the remainder is burned or left on the land to fertilize the soil. Bioconversion of this residue to fuel ethanol would provide an attractive possibility to boost the development of biofuels in a sustainable way.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ecology of Salmonella {{infection}} in pigs in bed-ding production systems (500 - 1000 pigs in one large pen, bedded on straw and/or rice hulls) with that in pigs in traditional (10 - 20 pigs per pen, concrete floor) systems. Eight Salmonella sero-positive study herds were selected to give 4 different combinations of weaner/grow-finisher and deep litter/concrete-based production systems. Individually identified pigs were bled at 9 - 10 and 16 weeks of age and at slaughter (22 - 24 weeks) to estimate seroprevalence. At each bleed pen faecal samples were collected to identify the serotypes present. Two batches of pigs from each herd were studied. There were substantial differences in the infection patterns over time within both high and low prevalence herds as found overseas. This appeared to be unrelated to the use of bedding production systems at either the weaner or grower/finisher stage. Feed serovars may play a larger role in Australia than previously thought. Introduction In Australia, increasing numbers of pigs are housed on <b>bedding</b> (<b>straw</b> or rice hulls) instead of concrete (partial or full slats).

Application of cow manure (M) plus P+N fertilizers increased spice yield 1 n (stigma dry weight) of saffron. The highest yield (0. 45 g m) was obtained with combination of M, P and N, 2 n while, the lowest (0. 24 g m) with control. The maximum flower fresh weight (0. 99 g), with the longest stigma 2 (30 mm) were obtained in the N+P+M treatment and the lowest (0. 50 g) with control, respectively. The N onlyn application increased vegetative growth (highest leaf area index = LAI), but no significant on yield. The highest LAI (2. 8) was recorded in the N-only treatment, but the lowest (1. 7) in the control, respectively. The highest corm multiplications rate (5. 7 new corms yr) and the lowest (2. 5 new corms yr) were recorded in the M 1 1 n treatment and the control, respectively. Application of cow manure (M) increased both leaf tissue mineraln concentrations (DW %) and improved soil fertility (organic carbon level, soil K, Mg, Ca, N-NH and CEC).

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{compared the}} effects of sand and straw bedding in free stalls on resting time, cleanliness, hock injuries, and hoof health of dairy cows and tested whether cow preferences for a bedding material depended on the familiarity with the material. A total of 52 dairy cows were kept either on straw bedded concrete stalls or sand stalls for at least 21 wk. The lying behavior was observed, and hock lesions, hoof health, and cleanliness of the cows and stalls were measured. A 5 -d preference test between sand and straw stalls was conducted {{at the end of}} the experiment. The total daily duration of lying was longer for cows on straw bedding than on sand <b>bedding</b> (<b>straw</b> 749 +/- 16 vs. sand 678 +/- 19 min). During the preference test, cows that had been kept on straw bedding preferred lying in straw stalls [straw 218. 7 (133. 4 to 239. 7) vs. sand 9. 0 min (2. 8 to 44. 8) ]; however, cows that had been kept on sand showed no preference [straw 101. 3 (51. 7 to 205. 9) vs. sand 94. 3 min (54. 1 to 156. 1, median and interquartile range) ]. Although there were no differences in the dirtiness of stalls, the cows using straw stalls were dirtier than cows using sand stalls [straw 6. 04 (5. 39 to 6. 28) vs. sand 4. 19 (3. 62 to 5. 16) ]. At the end of experiment the severity of hock lesions was lower for cows on sand than for cows on straw [sand 0. 5 (0. 0 to 1. 0) vs. straw 1. 0 (1. 0 to 2. 0) ]. The improvement in overall hoof health over the observation period was greater for cows kept on sand compared with cows kept on straw [sand - 2. 00 (- 3. 75 to - 0. 25) vs. straw 0. 00 (- 2. 00 to 2. 00) ]. Straw bedding increased the time that cows spend lying, and cows preferred straw stalls to sand stalls. However, previous experience with sand reduces avoidance of sand stalls. Sand stalls were advantageous for cow cleanliness and health; hock lesions and claw diseases healed more quickly for cows using sand stalls compared with straw. ...|$|E
