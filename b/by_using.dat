30|$|Photonic crystal fibers {{are usually}} {{divided into two}} {{different}} types of fibers: solid-core photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) and air-core photonic bandgaps fibers (PBFs).

A stain sensor with a high sensitivity was demonstrated <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of an LPFG written in solid-core PCFs. An in-fiber polarizer based on an LPFG was fabricated <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of a focused CO 2 laser beam to notch periodically on a PCF.

5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed <b>by</b> <b>using</b> an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or <b>by</b> <b>using</b> a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage.

40|$|We {{developed}} a new method for automated detection of colonic polyps in CT colonography. The colon is extracted from CT images <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of a centerline-based colon segmentation method.

The regions of the polyp candidates are segmented <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of conditional morphological dilation. False-positive polyp candidates are reduced by a region-based supine-prone correspondence method and by a Bayesian neural network with shape and texture features. To evaluate the method, CT colonography was performed for 121 patients with standard technique and single- and multi-detector helical scanners <b>by</b> <b>use</b> of 2. 5 – 5. 0 mm collimations, 1. 0 – 5. 0 mm reconstruction intervals, and 60 – 100 m...|$|R
