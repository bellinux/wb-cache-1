50|$|Another control method, used by {{both the}} University of California and the Weed Science Society of America to control <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass,</b> is the {{spraying}} of glyphosate. Used {{over a two-year period}} in small areas, glyphosate was able kill <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> and all its seedlings. Although the chemical is effective in killing <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass,</b> it also kills the other plants in the area. Aminocyclopyrachlor, a new experimental chemical is being used to control <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> by the University of California's Weed Science department. It {{has been shown to be}} extremely effective, however, aminocyclopyrachlor is not a registered herbicide and as such, widespread use is not yet allowed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> is a fast-growing, rapidly {{spreading}} {{invasive species}} mainly in grasslands, pastures, and ranches. It {{is listed as}} a noxious weed by California Department of Food and Agriculture. Because of its fast, invasive growing patterns, <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> creates a monoculture, killing the other plants in its area. [...] The invasive nature of <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> is causing a decrease in species diversity, {{and a decrease in}} forage. Most grazing animals tend to avoid <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> because they do not like the taste of it, allowing the grass to take over the other grasses and grains consumed by the animals. [...] The barbs on the flower spikelets containing the seeds become attached easily to animal fur, human clothing, and vehicles which allows the seeds to become more widely dispersed over the area.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there are}} many ways to control the growth of <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass,</b> a real {{solution}} has not been found in its widespread prevention. <b>Barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> cross breeds with different types of wheat, causing the grain to become infertile and unusable for harvest, which hurts the economy of the rural California areas. It can also seriously harm grazing animals by the barbs becoming embedded in their nose, mouth, and eyes, causing farmers and ranchers extra expenses. [...] It reduces the amount of forage in the area, decreases biodiversity and overall degrades the ecosystem it resides in. Studies of the University of California also show that if climate change increased the amount of precipitation in the area, the amount of <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> may increase, destroying even more of its ecosystem. Its rapid growth and resiliency against control methods prove that <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> is an invasive species that could cause many more problems to the agriculture of California and possibly many other areas if it is not taken care of soon.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} {{component in the}} control of <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> is early detection. When found in small isolated areas, it can {{be taken care of}} more effectively. Controlled burning is one method being used by the University of California in small areas to try and control the amount of <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass.</b> To be most effective, multiple burns had to be put in place in the isolated area over two years to more fully rid the area of the grass. After the burns, many native species were able to live in the small area once again.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> was {{introduced}} to North America in the 20th century from Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia. [...] It {{has been found in}} California, Oregon, Nevada, and the New England area, but with the greatest impact in California. [...] <b>Barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> {{was introduced}} to the California area with the trade of Mexican cattle in the early 20th century. The plant's unusual ability to invade nutrient-depleted, infertile soils means that it can severely damage habitats which often serve as important refugia for endemic grassland species which most other invading grasses are unable to exploit.|$|E
50|$|Mowing of {{the grass}} is another control method. It allows the grass to be cut before {{maturing}} and developing seeds to reproduce, {{but it is not}} as effective as the other methods as the deep and established root system of the <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> is still in place and can grow again.|$|E
5000|$|Aegilops triuncialis, or <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass,</b> is {{a winter}} annual grass {{species of the}} Poaceae family. It is native to many areas in Eastern and Mediterranean Europe and Western Asia. [...] It is {{considered}} an introduced, invasive species in North America, mainly in the Western coast of the United States. In its native lands, the grass thrives in mainly rocky, serpentine soil, but also does well in grasslands and ruderal/disturbed ground as well as oak woodlands.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> {{grows to}} be about 8 to 16 inches tall with few to many rigid, loosely erect aerial stems (culms). [...] In late spring the plant {{produces}} rigid flower spikes consisting of three to six spikelets bearing long, stiff awns which assist in seed distribution. When the grass matures, the spikelets fall off in their entirety to germinate on the ground, and the long awns which give the plant its name assist in dispersal by animals, wind or water.|$|E
50|$|An {{invasive}} species {{might be able}} to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long taproot, or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, <b>barbed</b> <b>goatgrass</b> (Aegilops triuncialis) was introduced to California on serpentine soils, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high magnesium/calcium ratio, and possible heavy metal toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.|$|E
