There is usually an age requirement, varying greatly between Grand Lodges, and (in some jurisdictions) capable of being overridden by a dispensation from the Grand Lodge. The underlying assumption is that the candidate should be a mature adult.|$|E

The elections were considered to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> transparent by all observers and political parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} Spain {{following}} the Spanish–American War {{led to the}} short-lived Philippine Independence movement, which established the insurgent First Philippine Republic. The schools maintained by Spain {{for more than three}} centuries were closed briefly, but were reopened on August 29, 1898 by the Secretary of Interior. The Burgos Institute (the country's first law school), the Academia Militar (the country's first military academy), and the Literary University of the Philippines were established. Article 23 of the Malolos Constitution mandated that public education would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> obligatory in all schools of the nation under the First Philippine Republic. However, the Philippine–American War hindered its progress.|$|E

25|$|The {{right to}} an {{education}} is found in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 13 of ICESCR. The Constitution of Tokelau gives no indication {{to the meaning of}} each individual right, therefore ICESCR can be used to define what the right to education actually means. ICESCR goes into some detail of what the right to education entails. It states all primary education should <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> compulsory. Secondary education should be generally available and accessible to all, as should any higher education. It then goes on to say there needs to be development in school systems that are free from discrimination, with set minimum standards and a high level of quality.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the 2010 election, the Togolese {{government}} {{took steps to}} increase {{the credibility of the}} electoral process and reassure the international community that the election would <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> fair. It placed a particular priority on avoiding the violence that marred the 2005 election. Gnassingbé stood for a second term as the candidate of the RPT, while the UFC designated Fabre as its candidate due to health problems suffered by its President, Gilchrist Olympio. Although the UFC was the largest opposition party by a large measure, and although the election was to be decided in a single round on a first past the post basis, the other opposition parties largely refused to rally behind Fabre and chose to nominate their own candidates.|$|E
25|$|Leclerc ordered four French columns {{to march}} on Gonaives, {{which was the}} main Haitian base. One of the French columns was {{commanded}} by General Donatien de Rochambeau, a proud white supremacist and a supporter of slavery who detested the Haitians for wanting to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> it was Rochambueau who Toussaint tried to stop at Ravin-a-Couleuvre, a very narrow gully {{up in the mountains}} that the Haitians had filled with chopped down trees. In the ensuring Battle of Ravine-à-Couleuvres, after six hours of fierce hand-to-hand fighting with no quarter given on either side, the French finally broke through, albeit with heavy losses. During the battle, Toussaint personally took part in the fighting to lead his men in charges against the French. After losing 800 men, Toussaint ordered a retreat.|$|E

25|$|Months {{before the}} election, Communist leaders {{expressed}} confidence {{in being able}} to carry the election by 70 or 80% (statements by the Minister of Justice Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu and the Minister of the Interior Teohari Georgescu), or even 90% (Miron Constantinescu, head of the PCR's Scînteia newspaper). As early as May, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Constantin Vişoianu complained to Adrian Holman, the British Ambassador to Romania, that the BPD had ensured a means to win the elections through fraud. Writing in January, Archibald Clerk-Kerr assessed the results of his visit to Romania, arguing that no person he had met actually trusted that elections were going to <b>be</b> <b>free,</b> <b>and</b> that Vyshinsky himself believed that, on its own, the PCR was not capable of gathering more than 10% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} he was {{involved}} in underground activity against the Shah's regime, calling for the 1954 Majlis elections to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> fair and attempting to revive the nationalist movement. In 1960, the Second National Front was formed and Bakhtiar {{played a crucial role in}} the new organization's activities as the head of the student activist body of the Front. He and his colleagues differed from most other government opponents in that they were very moderate, restricting their activity to peaceful protest and calling only for the restoration of democratic rights within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. The Shah refused to co-operate and outlawed the Front and imprisoned the most prominent liberals. From 1964 to 1977, the imperial regime refused to permit any form of opposition activity, even from moderate liberals like Bakhtiar. In the following years Bakhtiar was imprisoned repeatedly, a total of six years, for his opposition to the Shah. He was also one of the prominent members of central council of the illegal Fourth National Front in late 1977, when the group was reconstituted as the Union of National Front Forces with Bakhtiar as head of the Iran Party (the largest group in the Front).|$|E

500|$|I {{wanted the}} video {{to have the}} same rawness that both the melody and the lyrics of the song have because [...] "Dance for You" [...] is one of my most {{intimate}} songs. I wanted the video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. When I write, when I perform, and when I make music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> unrestrained.|$|E
500|$|Adams in the 1776 {{session of}} Congress drafted the {{preamble}} to the Lee resolution of colleague Richard Henry Lee (Virginia), which {{called on the}} colonies to adopt new independent governments. On June 7, 1776 he seconded the resolution, which stated, [...] "These colonies are, and of right ought to <b>be,</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> independent states." [...] Adams also championed the measure until it was adopted by Congress on July 2. Once the resolution passed, independence became inevitable, though it still had to be declared formally. The commitment was, as Adams put it, [...] "independence itself." ...|$|E

Shakira talked about the video, saying [...] "I decided to just do something more spontaneous, and be myself and <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> feel free about it {{because that is what}} this song is about". The music video was released on 29 September 2010, and the Spanish and English versions of the video were individually released on iTunes on 11 October 2010, and 13 October 2010, respectively.|$|E
500|$|In the 1780s, prison reform {{became a}} popular topic for French writers and the Bastille was {{increasingly}} critiqued {{as a symbol}} of arbitrary despotism. Two authors were particularly influential during this period. The first was Simon-Nicholas Linguet, who was arrested and detained at the Bastille in 1780, after publishing a critique of Maréchal Duras. Upon his release, he published his Mémoires sur la Bastille in 1783, a damning critique of the institution. Linguet criticised the physical conditions in which he was kept, sometimes inaccurately, but went further in capturing in detail the more psychological effects of the prison regime upon the inmate. Linguet also encouraged Louis XVI to destroy the Bastille, publishing an engraving depicting the king announcing to the prisoners [...] "may you <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> live!", a phrase borrowed from Voltaire.|$|E
500|$|Feeling {{the need}} to {{preserve}} his power, Hasan-Jalal traveled twice to Karakorum, {{the capital of the}} Mongol empire, where he was able to obtain special autonomy rights and privileges for himself and the people under his domain from the ruling khan. Despite this arrangement, the Mongols viewed many {{of the people of the}} region with contempt and taxed them excessively. Arghun Khan, the regional Mongol ostikan at the time, placed so many restrictions against Armenians that it prompted Hasan-Jalal in 1256 to journey to the capital once more to protest against the encroachments upon Catholicos Nerses. In response, Batu Khan drafted a document [...] "guaranteeing freedom for Lord Nerses, Katolikos of Albania, for all his properties and goods, that he <b>be</b> <b>free</b> <b>and</b> untaxed and allowed to travel freely everywhere in the dioceses under his authority, and that no one disobey what he said." ...|$|E
