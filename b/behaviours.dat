The study employed a correlational survey design, sourcing the empirical data from secondary school teachers in a number of schools in and around Gaborone, Botswana. As expected, knowledge sharing <b>behaviour</b> and organizational citizenship <b>behaviour</b> were significantly positively correlated, organizational commitment {{was a significant predictor of}} organizational citizenship <b>behaviour,</b> and job satisfaction and organizational commitment were significantly positively correlated. Contrary to expectations, however, both job satisfaction and organizational commitment were unrelated to knowledge sharing <b>behaviour.</b> Not all study hypotheses were supported, and as such, it would be premature to conclude, on the strength of the evidence presented in this thesis, that knowledge sharing <b>behaviour</b> indeed {{is a kind of}} organizational citizenship <b>behaviour.</b> Nevertheless, the positive correlation between knowledge sharing <b>behaviour</b> and organizational citizenship <b>behaviour</b> would seem to suggest that the role of organizational citizenship <b>behaviour</b> in organizational knowledge sharing is worth investigating further.

40|$|In {{research}} and in practise social-cognitive models, {{such as the}} theory of planned <b>behaviour</b> (TPB), are used to predict physical activity <b>behaviour.</b> These models mainly focus on reflective cognitive processes. As a reflective process, intention {{is thought to be}} the most proximal predictor to <b>behaviour.</b> Nevertheless, research suggests that the relation between intention and actual <b>behaviour,</b> the so called intention-behaviour gap, is moderate. Many health-related actions in daily life are performed repetitively and with minimal forethought. In contrast to social-cognitive theories, dual-process theories suggest that <b>behaviour</b> is based on both reflective and automatic processes. Recent research reveals that automatic processes, such as habit, can significantly explain physical activity <b>behaviour</b> initiation. One important finding was that automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> strengthens intrinsic motivation for physical activity. However, research has yet to explain the effects of automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> within the adolescent population, although lifestyle habits are strongly influenced during this period of the lifespan. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the role of automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> within the constructs of the theory of planned <b>behaviour</b> (TPB) and the self-determination theory (SDT), using the integrated model of SDT and TPB. A sample of 582 highly active adolescents aged 15 - 19 completed measures of <b>behaviour</b> regulation, attitude, intention, physical activity <b>behaviour</b> and automaticity of <b>behaviour.</b> Results show that automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> correlated with higher forms of self-determined <b>behaviour.</b> Two multiple regression analysis were conducted to explore the effects of automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> on both intentions and on actual physical activity <b>behaviour.</b> Results show that automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> is a significant explanatory factor for physical activity <b>behaviour</b> (β=. 10, p=. 01), even if controlled for reflective processes. Moreover, automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> was the second strongest explanatory factor for intentions (β=. 14, p=. 00). Secondly, a difference in <b>behaviour</b> regulation was found between the models on intention and physical activity. Intentions were best explained by intrinsic motivation (β=. 18, p=. 00), followed by automaticity (β=. 14, p=. 00) and attitudes (β=. 13, p=. 01). Actual physical activity <b>behaviour</b> was best explained by integrated <b>behaviour</b> regulation (β=. 24, p=. 00), attitudes and intention, while intrinsic motivation had no significant explanatory power on actual physical activity <b>behaviour.</b> The present findings support previous research, which suggests that automaticity of <b>behaviour</b> has a role in the explanation of physical activity <b>behaviour.</b> The discrepancy in <b>behaviour</b> regulation between intentions and actual physical activity <b>behaviour</b> is further discussed, as well the effects of automaticity on <b>behaviour</b> regulation, attitudes and intention.

5|$|Social {{ecological}} <b>behaviours</b> are notable in {{the social}} insects, slime moulds, social spiders, human society, and naked mole-rats where eusocialism has evolved. Social <b>behaviours</b> include reciprocally beneficial <b>behaviours</b> among kin and nest mates and evolve from kin and group selection. Kin selection explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including ants, bees, and wasps are most famously studied {{for this type of}} relationship because the male drones are clones that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony. In contrast, group selectionists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic <b>behaviours</b> to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first use}} of the term <b>behaviour</b> {{modification}} appears to have been by Edward Thorndike in 1911. His article Provisional Laws of Acquired Behavior or Learning makes frequent {{use of the term}} [...] "modifying behavior". Through early research in the 1940s and the 1950s the term was used by Joseph Wolpe's research group. The experimental tradition in clinical psychology used it to refer to psycho-therapeutic techniques derived from empirical research. It has since come to refer mainly to techniques for increasing adaptive <b>behaviour</b> through reinforcement and decreasing maladaptive <b>behaviour</b> through extinction or punishment (with emphasis on the former). Two related terms are <b>behaviour</b> therapy and applied <b>behaviour</b> analysis. Emphasizing the empirical roots of <b>behaviour</b> modification, some authors consider it to be broader in scope and to subsume the other two categories of <b>behaviour</b> change methods. Since techniques derived from behavioural psychology tend to be the most effective in altering <b>behaviour,</b> most practitioners consider <b>behaviour</b> modification along with <b>behaviour</b> therapy and applied <b>behaviour</b> analysis to be founded in behaviourism. While <b>behaviour</b> modification and applied <b>behaviour</b> analysis typically uses interventions based on the same behavioural principles, many <b>behaviour</b> modifiers who are not applied <b>behaviour</b> analysts tend to use packages of interventions and do not conduct functional assessments before intervening.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of <b>behaviours</b> {{including}} burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. <b>Behaviours</b> associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases <b>behaviours</b> that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E

Methods: This study employed a pre-test post-test control group design among 668 rural black South African learners (15. 69 years, age range: 12 - 25 years) to assess the effectiveness of the CHAMP Prevention Programme in reducing risk-taking sexual <b>behaviour.</b> The main analysis used repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance with safe sex <b>behaviour</b> and risk-taking sexual <b>behaviour</b> as within-subjects measures (i. e. dependent variables), intervention group/control group, and social identity as between subjects factors (i. e. independent variables), and mechanisms as covariates. Results: The analysis of change in safe sex <b>behaviour</b> and risk-taking sexual <b>behaviour</b> between the intervention group and the control group showed that the CHAMP Prevention Programme increases safe sex <b>behaviour</b> among learners in the programme. The programme, however, did not change risk-taking sexual behavior among these learners. Furthermore, the analysis which included the change in learners’ choices and capacities that generate risk-taking sexual <b>behaviour</b> as covariates, showed several significant changes in safe sex <b>behaviour</b> and risk-taking sexual <b>behaviour.</b> Finally, the analysis of risk-taking <b>behaviour</b> among social identities showed no significant difference on risk-taking or risk aversive <b>behaviour,</b> but indicated a significant difference in learners’ ability to change sexual <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R
