50|$|A contact {{equilibrium}} may {{be regarded}} also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> some quantity {{between the two}} systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is 'permeable' only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures {{on either side of}} it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> as work.|$|R

40|$|The {{existence}} of a buoyancy-dominated scaling range in convective turbulence is a longstanding open question. We investigate this issue by considering the scale-by-scale energy budget in direct numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Bénard convection. We try to minimize the so-called Bolgiano length scale, the length scale at which buoyancy becomes dominant for scaling. Therefore, we deliberately choose modest Rayleigh numbers Ra= 2. 5 × 10 6 and 2. 5 × 10 7. The budget reveals that buoyant forcing, turbulent energy transfer, and dissipation are contributing significantly {{over a wide range}} of scales. Thereby neither Kolmogorov-like (<b>balance</b> <b>of</b> turbulent <b>transfer</b> and dissipation) nor Bolgiano-Obukhov-like scaling (<b>balance</b> <b>of</b> turbulent <b>transfer</b> and buoyancy) is expected in the structure functions, which indeed reveal inconclusive scaling behavior. Furthermore, we consider the calculation of the Bolgiano length scale. To account for correlations between the dissipation rates of kinetic energy and thermal variance we propose to average the Bolgiano length scale directly. This gives an estimate, which is one order of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, and actually larger than the domain itself. Rather than studying the scaling of structure functions, we propose that the use of scale-by-scale energy budgets resolving anisotropic contributions is appropriate to consider the energy cascade mechanisms in turbulent convection...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on the intent, content, and <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> knowledge <b>transfer</b> within and across firms is vast. Yet we conceptually develop a model of {{two different types of}} knowledge generation informed by research on mental maps. The first archetype which we call absorption is related to the traditional view of knowledge generation as a transfer between individuals, units, or organizations. The second archetype, autopoiesis, defines a joint creation of new knowledge across persons embodying a higher level of interpersonal, organizational, or interorganizational learning. Autopoiesis concerns collective learning procedures in which partners jointly develop new insights and solutions that can hardly be redirected to specific individuals. The autopoietic knowledge generation achieves a win-win situation of involved actors or organizations. It as such is highly relevant for alliances, where firms otherwise face the risk of loosing competitive advantages through unintended knowledge spill-overs. Thus this paper presents the two conceptualizations, absorption and autopoiesis, in the context of alliances...|$|R

Among the various combinations of model functions for wave breaking and wind source terms tested, no one fulfilled simultaneously the energy and momentum <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>transfer</b> equation. Based on experimental and theoretical grounds, wave breaking is known to contribute to frequency downshift of a narrow-banded wave spectrum, when the modulational instability is combined with wave breaking. On those grounds, it is assumed that, in addition to dissipation, wave breaking produces a spectral energy flux directed toward low wavenumbers. I show that it is then possible to remove the energy and momentum budget inconsistency, and correlatively the required strength of this spectral flux is estimated. Assuming such a downward spectral flux permits to fulfill both energy and momentum balance conditions, while slightly reducing the consistency between source terms and empirical spectra, as estimated by a cost function K. Other tests were performed in which it was further assumed that wave breaking would also be associated with azimuthal diffusion of the spectral energy. This could allow a slight improvement of the cost function K, and might correlatively reduce the required downward spectral flux by a factor of 4, although it {{would not be able to}} remove it entirely...|$|R
