A real coded genetic algorithm with a robust constraint handling technique is used as the optimization method. The objective {{is to develop a}} formulation of the optimization problem for the late bearing design of a complex rotor-bearing system. Furthermore, the usefulness of the search method is evaluated on a difficult problem. The effects considered are power loss and limiting temperatures in the bearings as well as the dynamics at the system level, i. e., stability and unbalance responses. The design variables are the <b>bearing</b> <b>widths</b> and radial clearances. A nominal design is the basis for comparison of the optimal solution found. An initial numerical experiment shows that finding a solution that fulfills all the constraints for the system design is likely impossible.

Various authors have described the phenomenon of spiral vibrations caused by rubbing in general [1 - 4] and specifically by the differential viscous shearing in fluid film bearings [5 - 8]. The history of {{the case of a}} turbo-expander for the cryogenic industry is described. The investigated machine has a single relatively stiff rotor with two overhung impellers. The rotor is supported on two tilting pad bearings, as they are commonly used for these applications. It was designed in line with API 617 7 th edition [11]. During internal factory testing excessive vibration at high speed suddenly developed, in spite of very high damping and comfortable separation margins of the relevant rotor vibration modes. The vibrations evolution in a polar plot had the appearance of a spiral, as they are typically observed in case of vibration induced hot spots. The tilting pad bearings were suspected as the most likely cause for the hot spots. In parallel to the tests, hot spot stability analyses with a rotor dynamic model of the turbo-expander were carried out. The applied method, introduced by Schmied [5] allows the handling of general rotor systems. The hot spot model is based on the theory of Kellenberger [3] using a thermal equation between the shaft’s thermal deflection and the shaft displacement at the hot spot location. The analytical results gave evidence of the instabilities and confirmed the fluid-film bearings as the source of the hot spot. The model was used to assess changes for the solution of the problem.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} encountered for the successful operation of high-power-density micro-devices lies in the stable operation of the bearings supporting the high-speed rotating machinery. This thesis presents the analysis, design, microfabrication, testing and operation of high speed micro-hydrostatic gas bearings for microturbomachinery in power-MEMS applications. A novel turbine driven microbearing test device for demonstrating repeatable high-speed gas bearing operation was designed, microfabricated and tested. The new microbearing test device incorporates numerous features, including a four plena journal bearing feed system enabling both isotropic and anisotropic journal bearing operation, labyrinth seals for reducing rotordynamic coupling, a redesigned turbine for satisfying power requirements, reinforced thrust bearing structural design, a novel rotor fabrication technology for achieving low radial imbalance and a symmetric feed system to avoid rotor sideloading arising from pressure or flow non-uniformities. A rigorous theory is presented to analyze the effects of compressibility in micro-flows (characterized by low Reynolds numbers and high Mach numbers) through hydrostatic thrust bearings for application to microturbomachines. (cont.) Operating protocols for ensuring thrust bearing static stability have been established and successfully demonstrated on several micro-devices in the MIT Microengine Project. In addition, a simple and useful dynamic stability criterion has been identified: Dynamic instability occurs when the flow through both thrust bearings chokes. A-priori dynamic stability predictions were subsequently verified experimentally {{for the first time}} on a micro-turbocharger. A generalized Green's function approach has been successfully implemented for analyzing tilting effects and geometric non-uniformities in micro-hydrostatic gas thrust bearings. The effects of a non fully-developed circumferential flow in low length-to-diameter ratio (L/D << 1) micro-hydrostatic journal bearings are analyzed for the first time. Effects on journal bearing whirl stability and viscous power dissipation are quantified using a simple analytical model and CFD calculations. A dimensionless parameter characterizing the ratio of the flow-through time of the axial hydrostatic flow to the viscous diffusion time was identified to govern the evolution of the circumferential flow field. Singular behavior of the stability boundary or whirl-ratio occurs when the flow through time of the axial hydrostatic flow is approximately half the characteristic viscous diffusion time. (cont.) Operating conditions for high speed, stable journal bearing operation can thus be ascertained. Experimental techniques and data reduction schemes facilitating the evaluation of key journal bearing rotordynamic information such as the stiffness, natural frequency and damping ratio, as well as the imbalance of the rotor have been successfully implemented. Imbalance-driven whirl response curves for providing an improved understanding of the rotordynamic behavior of micro-hydrostatic gas journal bearings have been obtained for the first time. Effects of journal <b>bearing</b> <b>width</b> and anisotropy are systematically investigated on the redesigned microbearing test device. For low levels of journal differential pressures DP, high whirl ratios ranging between 20 and 40 were achieved. These whirl-ratios were one order of magnitude higher than those encountered in macro-scale journal bearings. Almost all devices tested anisotropically at high values of DP achieved speeds in excess of 1 million rpm. The improvements in bearings and seals design, the high reliability of the novel microfabrication processes, and the repeatability and successful implementation of the operating protocols were vindicated. (cont.) A first-of-a-kind controlled high speed operation up to 70 % of the design speed was also demonstrated. This corresponds to a rotation rate of 1. 7 million rpm, a rotor tip speed of 370 m/s and a DN number of 7 million mm-rpm. The technical feasibility of high-speed gas bearings required for achieving high power densities in MEMS-based micro-turbomachinery has thus been experimentally demonstrated. by Chiang Juay Teo.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, soft lithographic {{techniques}} that circumvent the limitations of photolithography have emerged as important tools for the transfer of patterns with sub-micron dimensions. Among these techniques, microcontact printing (uCP) has shown special promise. In uCP, an elastomeric stamp is first inked with surface-reactive molecules and placed in contact with an ink-reactive surface, resulting in pattern transfer {{in the form of}} self-assembled monolayers in regions of conformal contact. The resolution in uCP is ultimately limited to the diffusion of ink and the elastomechanical properties of the bulk stamping material. One way to improve resolution is to eliminate diffusion by using inkless methods for pattern transfer. Inkless catalytic-uCP uses a chemical reaction between a stamp-immobilized catalyst and surface bearing cognate substrate to transfer pattern in the areas of conformal contact. By using pre-assembled cognate surfaces, the approach extends the range of surfaces readily amenable to patterning while obviating diffusive resolution limits imposed by traditional uCP. In this thesis, we report two methods using inkless catalytic uCP: biocatalytic-uCP utilizes an immobilized enzyme as a catalyst whereas catalytic-uCP utilizes an immobilized small molecule as a catalyst, such as an acid or base. Both catalytic techniques demonstrate pattern transfer at the microscale while using unconventional, acrylate-based stamp materials. Previous results produced with catalytic-uCP have shown pattern transfer with sub- 50 nm edge resolution. In this demonstration of catalytic-uCP, we use the technique to demonstrate a bi-layered patterning technique for H-terminated silicon, the foremost material in semi-conductor fabrication. This technique simultaneously protects the underlying silicon surface from degradation while a highly-reactive organic overlayer remains patternable by acidic-functionalized PU stamps. Lines <b>bearing</b> <b>widths</b> as small as 150 nm were reproduced on the reactive SAM overlayer, which would not be possible without circumvention of diffusion. Before and after patterning, no oxidation of the underlying silicon was observed, preserving desired electronic properties throughout the whole process.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common seismic {{isolators}} in use today is the elastomeric bearing. The combination of rubber layers and reinforcing steel shims gives a device that is axially very stiff but soft laterally. Flexibility may be increased, and large period shifts achieved, simply by increasing the number and/or thickness of the rubber layers. But increasing the shear flexibility of these short columns can lead to relatively low buckling loads, which may be further reduced when high shear strains are simultaneously imposed. As a consequence, many design procedures require the axial load rating of a bearing to be reduced as the shear displacement increases (e. g., AASHTO 1999). These reductions are based on engineering judgment and very little science. For example, for a rectangular <b>bearing</b> of <b>width</b> B, the critical load Pcr, at shear displacement ∆, is approximated by Pcr = Pcro [1 - ∆/B] where Pcro is the critical load at zero shear displacement.

The experimental program refers to the bottle-shaped stress field, that develops significant transverse compressive and tensile stresses, respectively in the bottle neck and far away along the vertical symmetry axis (bursting). The distribution of the high local stresses under the bearing plate causes transverse tensile stresses also along the horizontal upper border, there inducing concrete cracking (spalling).

For self-compacting concrete (SCC) however few test results are available and in practice the standards for conventional vibrated concrete (CVC) are applied to self-compacting concrete as well. To fill in this lack of knowledge and to develop adapted standards for predicting the bond of reinforcement in SCC, an experimental program has been set up. The bond strength of reinforcement bars with different diameters has been tested for 1 conventional vibrated concrete and 2 self-compacting concretes. The testing method, by means of "beam-test" specimen, was based on RILEM RC 6 part 1. During testing the free end slip of the bars and the applied load were recorded. The bar diameters ranged from 12 mm tot 40 mm. From the test results {{it can be seen}} that the maximum and characteristic bond strength of self-compacting concrete is as high as for conventional vibrated concrete, or even slightly higher. The bond strength decreases however for increasing bar diameters, and the decrease seems to be a little larger for specimen made of SCC. The slip corresponding with the maximum bond strength increases for increasing bar diameters...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the {{finite-element method}} (FEM) {{is used to}} develop the {{governing}} equation of motion of the working roll of a four-high rolling mill and to study its vibration due to different process parameters. The working roll is modeled as an Euler Bernoulli beam by taking beam elements with vertical displacement and slope as the nodal degrees-of-freedom in the finite-element formulation. The bearings {{at the ends of}} the working rolls are modeled using spring elements. To calculate the forces acting on the working roll, the interaction between the working roll and the backup roll is modeled by using the work roll submodel, and the interaction between the working roll and the sheet is modeled by using the roll bite submodel (Lin et al., 2003, "On Characteristics and Mechanism of Rolling Instability and Chatter," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 125 (4), pp. 778 - 786). Nodal displacements and velocities are obtained by using the Newmark Beta method after solving the governing equation of motion of the working roll. The transient and steady-state variation of roll gap, exit thickness profile, exit stress, and sheet force {{along the length of the}} strip have been found for different <b>bearing</b> stiffnesses and <b>widths</b> of the strip. By using this model, one can predict the shape of the outcoming strip profile and exit stress variation which will be useful to avoid many defects, such as edge buckling or center buckling in rolling processes...|$|R
