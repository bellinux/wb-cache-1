5|$|A {{conservative}} {{force that}} acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way}} that the direction and amount of a flow of water can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|Fewer colours of coat {{appear in}} the Pembroke breed. These include red, sable, tan, fawn and black, each {{of which can be}} with or without white markings. Plain white or grey coats can also be seen, but these would <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be a serious fault for the {{purposes}} of conformation shows. However, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi has no specific disqualification criteria present in the breed standard.|$|E

At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick that she <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E
5|$|Properties {{common to}} {{terrestrial}} organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) {{are that they}} are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. An entity with these properties is generally considered life. However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential. Human-made analogs of life may also <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be life.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{paleontology}} traces {{the history of}} the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past paleontology can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|Tracer {{diffusion}} {{describes the}} motion of individual adparticles on a surface at relatively low coverage levels. At these low levels (< 0.01 monolayer), particle interaction is low and each particle can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> move independently of the others.

5|$|Besides {{providing}} locomotion {{opportunities for}} winged animals and {{a conduit for}} the dispersal of pollen grains, spores and seeds, the atmosphere can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be a habitat in its own right. There are metabolically active microbes present that actively reproduce and spend their whole existence airborne, {{with hundreds of thousands}} of individual organisms estimated to be present in a cubic metre of air. The airborne microbial community may be as diverse as that found in soil or other terrestrial environments, however these organisms are not evenly distributed, their densities varying spatially with altitude and environmental conditions. Aerobiology has been little studied, but there is evidence of nitrogen fixation in clouds, and less clear evidence of carbon cycling, both facilitated by microbial activity.|$|E

5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling may <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may {{be performed by}} using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the articular cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the articular cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|In the southwest, Ecgberht was {{defeated}} in 836 at Carhampton by the Danes, but in 838 he won a battle against them and their allies the West Welsh at the Battle of Hingston Down in Cornwall. The Dumnonian royal line continued after this time, but {{it is at this}} date that the independence of one of the last British kingdoms may <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> have ended. The details of Anglo-Saxon expansion into Cornwall are quite poorly recorded, but some evidence comes from place names. The river Ottery, which flows east into the Tamar near Launceston, appears to be a boundary: south of the Ottery the placenames are overwhelmingly Cornish, whereas to the north they are more heavily influenced by the English newcomers.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the known}} species are little studied. Some 600 species (a quarter of the total) are known from a single record from a single host. Over 94% of species are {{associated}} with mammalian hosts, and only about 3% of species can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be specific parasites of birds. The fleas on birds {{are thought to have}} originated from mammalian fleas; at least sixteen separate groups of fleas switched to avian hosts during the evolutionary history of the Siphonaptera. Occurrences of fleas on reptiles is accidental, and fleas have been known to feed on the hemolymph (bloodlike body fluid) of ticks.|$|E

5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> be the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward.
