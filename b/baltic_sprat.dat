40|$|In spring 2004 and 2005 we {{performed}} {{two sets of}} experiments with <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus balticus Schneider) eggs and larvae from the Bornholm Basin simulating ten different temperature scenarios. The goal {{of the present study}} was to analyse and parameterise temperature effects on the duration of developmental stages, on the timing of important ontogenetic transitions, growth during the yolk sac phase as well as on the survival success of eggs and early larval stages. Egg development and hatching showed exponential temperature dependence. No hatching was observed above 14. 7 °C and hatching success was significantly reduced below 3. 4 °C. Time to eye pigmentation, as a proxy for mouth gape opening, decreased with increasing temperatures from 17 days post hatch at 3. 4 °C to 7 days at 13 °C whereas the larval yolk sac phase was shortened from 20 to 10 days at 3. 8 and 10 °C respectively. Maximum survival duration of non-fed larvae was 25 days at 6. 8 °C. Comparing the experimental results of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> with existing information on sprat from the English Channel and North Sea differences were detected in egg development rate, thermal adaptation and in yolk sac depletion rate (YSDR).

40|$|<b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus balticus S.) {{is a key}} {{species in}} the pelagic {{ecosystem}} of the Baltic Sea. Most stocks of small pelagic species are characterized by natural, fishery-independent fluctuations, which {{make it difficult to}} predict stock development. <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> recruitment is highly variable, which can partly be related to climate-driven variability in hydrographic conditions. Results from experimental studies and field observations demonstrate that a number of important life history traits of sprat are affected by temperature, especially the survival and growth of early life stages. Projected climate-driven warming may impact important processes affecting various life stages of sprat, from survival and development during the egg and larval phases to the reproductive output of adults. This study presents a stage-based matrix model approach to simulate sprat population dynamics in relation to different climate change scenarios. Data obtained from experimental studies and field observations were used to estimate and incorporate stage-specific growth and survival rates into the model. Model-based estimates of population growth rate were affected most by changes in the transition probability of the feeding larval stage at all temperatures (+ 0, + 2, + 4, + 6 °C). The maximum increase in population growth rate was expected when ambient temperature was elevated by 4 °C. Coupling our stage-based model and more complex, biophysical individual-based models may reveal the processes driving these expected climate-driven changes in Baltic Sea sprat population dynamics...|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} a coupled three-dimensional biophysical model to explore long-term inter- and intra-annual {{variability in the}} survival of sprat larvae in the Bornholm Basin, a major sprat spawning area in the Baltic Sea. Model scenarios incorporated observed decadal changes in larval diel vertical distribution and climate-driven abiotic and biotic environmental factors including variability in the abundance of different, key prey species (calanoid copepods) as well as seasonal changes, long-term trends, and spatial differences in water temperature. Climate forcing affected <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> larval survival both directly (via changes in temperature) and indirectly (via changes in prey populations). By incorporating observed changes in larval diel vertical migration, decadal changes in modeled and observed survival of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> agreed well. Higher larval survival (spawning stock biomass) was predicted in the 1990 s compared to the 1980 s. After changing their foraging strategy by shifting from mid-depth, low prey environment to near-surface waters, first-feeding larvae encountered much higher rates of prey encounter and almost optimal feeding conditions and had a much higher growth potential. Consequently, larvae were predicted to experience optimal conditions to ensure higher survival throughout the later larval and early juvenile stages. However, this behavioral shift also increased the susceptibility of larvae to unfavorable winddriven surface currents, contributing to the marked increase in interannual variability in recruitment observed during the past decade...|$|E
50|$|The {{thiamine}} deficiency syndrome M74 {{is related}} to the fat and thiamine content of prey fish. The diet of Baltic salmon leads to thiamine deficiency in eggs and consequently to the mortality of yolk-sac fry: The main prey species of the <b>Baltic</b> salmon are <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harangus membras). Average fat content is greater in sprat than in herring. The fat content is highest and the thiamine concentration is lowest in the youngest sprat. The need for thiamine depends on the amount of fat in the diet. Thiamine deficiency in eggs results from an unbalanced diet abundant in fatty prey fish, such as young sprat, from which the supply of thiamine is insufficient in proportion to the supply of energy and unsaturated fatty acids for salmon.|$|R
40|$|Predators {{commonly}} share prey {{with human}} exploiters, intuitively {{suggesting that there}} is an inherent human-predator conflict through competition for prey. Here we studied the effects of fishing and predation mortality on biomass distributions and yields of shared prey using a size-structured model of competing populations, describing the life histories of <b>Baltic</b> Sea <b>sprat</b> and herring. Whereas both species responded in a similar fashion to increased fishing mortality, with decreasing juvenile and adult biomasses, we found that responses to predation mortality differed between species. Sprat only display weak compensatory responses with increasing predation mortality, while over a substantial range of mortalities there was a strong increase in adult (and total) herring biomass, i. e. overcompensation. The observed biomass overcompensation results from relaxed intraspecific competition as predation mortality increased, allowing for faster individual growth rates that in turn lead to a change in population composition (juvenile:adult biomass ratio). Our results suggest that the potential for biomass overcompensation is higher for species exhibiting substantial growth after maturation. Differences in size-selectivity of predators and fishing mortality resulted in a positive effect of predation mortality on fisheries yields, which can be explained by an overcompensatory response in adult herring biomass. Thus, somewhat counter intuitive, our results suggest that fishermen, depending on prey life history, may actually benefit from allowing for a higher abundance of predators, despite competing for shared prey...|$|R

40|$|The GLOBEC Germany program (2002 – 2007) had {{the ambitious}} goal {{to resolve the}} {{processes}} impacting the recruitment dynamics of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus L.) by examining various factors affecting early life history stages. At {{the start of the}} research program, a number of general recruitment hypotheses were formulated, i. e. focusing on (1) predation, (2) food availability, (3) physical parameters, (4) the impact of current systems, and finally (5) the importance of top-down vs bottom-up effects. The present study synthesizes the results of field sampling (2002 and 2003), laboratory experiments, and modeling studies to re-evaluate these hypotheses for the <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> stock. Recruitment success was quite different in the 2 years investigated. Despite a lower spawning stock biomass in 2003, the total number of recruits was almost 2 -fold higher that year compared to 2002. The higher recruitment success in 2003 could be attributed to enhanced survival success during the post-larval/juvenile stage, a life phase that appears to be critical for recruitment dynamics. In the state of the Baltic ecosystem during the period of investigation, we consider bottom-up control (e. g. temperature, prey abundance) to be more important than top-down control (predation mortality). This ranking in importance does not vary seasonally. Prevailing water circulation patterns and the transport dynamics of larval cohorts have a strong influence on sprat recruitment success. Pronounced transport to coastal areas is detrimental for year-class strength particularly at high sprat stock sizes. A suggested mechanism is density-dependant regulation of survival via intra- and inter-specific competition for prey in coastal areas. A documented change in larval vertical migration behavior between the early 1990 s and early 2000 s increased the transport potential to the coast, strengthening the coupling between inter-annual differences in the magnitude and direction of wind-driven surface currents and year-to-year changes in reproductive success. However, due to the strong linkages and feed-back loops in the Baltic Sea food web, the most robust projections of the future strength of the <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> stock will need to take into account climate-driven changes in both abiotic (e. g., drift trajectories) and biotic (trophodynamic) factors. Although our understanding of processes affecting pre-recruit (larval) growth and survival has been advanced by the integrated research conducted within the GLOBEC Germany program, key mechanisms potentially affecting life stages outside of the spawning basins remain to be explored including the dynamics of coastal habitats of juveniles and the feeding and overwintering grounds of adults. Highlights: ► Food limitation may contribute to the formation of seasonal ‘windows of survival’. ► Change in larval migration exalted the importance of transport. ► Temperature is the most important physical factor influencing sprat recruitment. ► Bottom-up control is more important than top-down control. ► Projected Baltic water temperature increase suggests higher sprat recruitment potential...|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} recruitment variability in small pelagic fish like sprat, {{it is important}} to know when during the extended spawning season the successful recruits are predominantly produced and which environmental factors determine potential survival windows. Here, we inferred the temporal origin of 2 -year classes (2002 - 2003) of western and central <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> by means of otolith microstructure analysis, and found that in both years recruits mainly originated from the summer months June and July. In both years, this period coincided with temperature conditions in the surface layer of > 12 degrees C and peak seasonal abundance of the largest copepod stages of Acartia spp., the major prey item of sprat larvae. The peaks in seasonal sprat egg abundance, however, occurred in April 2002 and March 2003 and therefore about 1 - 2 months earlier than the long-term mean spawning peak of sprat in this area (end of May/beginning of June). We hypothesize that increased temperatures in the bottom layer of the Baltic, where the pre-spawning sprat stock concentrates during winter months, potentially caused this shift in sprat spawning patterns, although early spring temperatures and feeding conditions in upper water layers were still unfavourable for larval survival. Sprat recruitment, however, was comparatively strong in both 2002 and 2003, suggesting that summer born individuals had high enough survival rates to compensate for the spawning shift, possibly due to high summer temperatures, limited dispersion, and low predation mortalities by Baltic cod as the major predator of sprat. Recruits were on average younger in 2003 than 2002, yet length distributions in October were almost identical, likely because a period of substantially higher temperatures in July/August 2003 promoted faster initial (larval) growth of survivors. Given the strength of the 2003 year class, in spite of lower overall prey concentrations in 2003 than 2002 in the study area, our findings appear to emphasise the paramount importance of summer temperatures as the recruitment determinant in <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat.</b> (C) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Baltic</b> herring and <b>sprat</b> were sampled between October 1994 and January 1995 off the {{southern}} coast of Finland and around the Ar land Islands. From this material fish of 135 – 159 mm in length, a size class that {{was assumed to be}} preferred as prey by Baltic salmon, were selected and grouped according to species, sex and age. Herring were 1 – 3 years and sprat 3 – 13 years old. In addition, one group of smaller, two-year-old, female sprat was selected. Thus twenty groups were formed and prepared as whole-fish homogenates. Thiamine was quantified from all homogenates, while female and male sprat and female herring were analysed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and dibenzofurans (PCDFs). There {{were no significant differences between}} sexes within each species in the total thiamine concentrations, but the mean total thiamine concentration in 1 to 3 -year-old herring (8. 6 nmol g- 1) was higher than that in 2 to 13 -year-old sprat (6. 7 nmol g- 1). The mean-fresh-weight concentrations of total PCBs, coplanar PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs were on average 2 – 3 times higher in 2 to 10 -year-old sprat than in 1 to 3 -year-old herring of a similar size, although the difference in PCDD concentrations was not significant. In sprat females there were no significant correlations between age or fat content and the freshweight concentrations of coplanar PCBs or PCDFs. However, the higher OC concentrations in sprat could be explained both by their higher fat content, with the younger age groups being the most fatty, and by their age, which reflects their slower growth rate. The fat-weight-based total PCB, PCDD, PCDF and coplanar PCB concentrations increased with age in sprat and, after controlling for age, there was a significant positive relationship between the fat content and the fresh-weightbased concentrations of OCs, apart from total PCBs. On a fat-weight basis the concentration of coplanar PCBs was also higher in sprat than in herring. It is concluded that the Baltic salmon is provided with an adequate supply of thiamine, at least for growth, from its two main prey species, <b>Baltic</b> herring and <b>sprat.</b> Furthermore, sprat might have been the principal source of organochlorines, particularly coplanar PCBs and PCDFs, for salmon.

Identification and quantification have been performed by retention time of individual PCB congeners by the internal standard. The content of PCBs in liver of the Curonian and Vistula Bays fish is much lower than in liver of aquatic biological resources (ABR) of the Baltic Sea. Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are accumulated more intensively in liver of fish caught {{in the southern part of}} the Baltic Sea. β-HCH and γ-HCH prevail in the liver and muscle tissue of ABR samples as individual organochlorine pesticides (OCPs).

40|$|The {{recruitment}} {{processes of}} <b>Baltic</b> cod and <b>sprat</b> were analysed and critical periods {{were identified by}} addressing the major impact factors on individual early life history stages separately and relating observed abundance data between successive stages. For cod, recruitment appeared {{to be dependent on}} egg survival, with low oxygen concentration in dwelling depths and predation by clupeids as the major causes for egg mortality. Surviving egg production and larval abundance were weakly correlated, whereas larval abundance was significantly related to year class strength. This indicated that the period between the late egg and the early larval stage is critical for cod recruitment. A potential variable identified to affect this life stage was prey availability for larvae. For sprat, early and late egg stage production as well as late egg stage production and larval abundance were significantly related. However, year class strength was largely independent of larval abundance. Thus, the period between the late larval and early juvenile stage appeared to be critical for sprat recruitment. Potential variables identified to affect this life stage were ambient temperature and wind stress.

40|$|Acoustic survey {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} to quantify abundance and distribution {{of a variety of}} pelagic fish such as herring (Clupea harengus). The information provided is becoming increasingly important for stock assessment and ecosystem studies, however, the data collected are used as relative indices rather than absolute measures, due to the uncertainty of target strength (TS) estimates. A fish’s TS is a measure of its capacity to reflect sound and, therefore, the TS value will directly influence the estimate of abundance from an acoustic survey. The TS is a stochastic variable, dependent on a range of factors such as fish size, orientation, shape, physiology, and acoustic frequency. However, estimates of mean TS, used to convert echo energy data from acoustic surveys into numbers of fish, are conveniently derived from a single metric - the fish length (L). The TS used for herring is based on TS-L relationships derived from a variety of experiments on dead and caged fish, conducted 25 - 30 years ago. Recently, theoretical models for fish backscatter have been proposed to provide an alternative basis for exploring fish TS. Another problem encountered during acoustic surveys is the identification of insonified organisms. Trawl samples are commonly collected for identification purposes, however, there are several selectivity issues associated with this method that may translate directly into biased acoustic abundance estimates. The use of different acoustic frequencies has been recognised as a useful tool to distinguish between different species, based on their sound reflection properties at low and high frequencies. In this study I developed theoretical models to describe the backscatter of herring at multiple frequencies. Data collected at four frequencies (18, 38, 120 and 200 kHz) during standard acoustic surveys for herring in the North Sea were examined and compared to model results. Multifrequency backscattering characteristics of herring were described and compared to those of Norway pout, a species also present in the survey area. Species discrimination was attempted based on differences in backscatter at the different frequencies. I examined swimbladder morphology data of Baltic and Atlantic herring and <b>sprat</b> from the <b>Baltic</b> Sea. Based on these data, I modelled the acoustic backscatter of both herring stocks and attempted to explain differences previously observed in empirical data. I investigated the change in swimbladder shape of herring, when exposed to increased water pressures at deeper depths, by producing true shapes of swimbladders from MRI scans of herring under pressure. The swimbladder morphology representations in 3 -D were used to model the acoustic backscatter at a range of frequencies and water pressures. I developed a probabilistic TS model of herring in a Bayesian framework to account for uncertainty associated with TS. Most likely distributions of model parameters were determined by fitting the model to in situ data. The resulting probabilistic TS was used to produce distributions of absolute abundance and biomass estimates, which were compared to official results from ICES North Sea herring stock assessment. Modelled backscatter levels of herring from the Baltic Sea were on average 2. 3 dB higher than those from herring living in northeast Atlantic waters. This was attributed to differences in swimbladder sizes between the two herring stocks due to the lower salinity Baltic Sea compared to Atlantic waters. Swimbladders of Baltic herring need to be bigger to achieve a certain degree of buoyancy. Morphological swimbladder dimensions of <b>Baltic</b> herring and <b>sprat</b> were found to be different. Herring had a significantly larger swimbladder height at a given length compared to sprat, resulting in a modelled TS that was on average 1. 2 dB stronger. Water depth, and therefore the increase in ambient pressure, was found to have a considerable effect on {{the size and shape of}} the herring swimbladder. Modelled TS values were found to be around 3 dB weaker at a depth of 50 m compared to surface waters. At 200 m, this difference was estimated to be about 5 dB. The Bayesian model predicted mean abundances and biomass were 23 and 55 % higher, respectively, than the ICES estimates. The discrepancy was linked to the depth-dependency of the TS model and the particular size-dependent bathymetric distribution of herring in the survey area.

40|$|Contributors: Dankert Skagen, Else TorstensenThe Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) met in ICES {{headquarters}} from 9 to 18 March 2004. The main {{terms of}} reference were to assess the status of and to provide catch options for the North Sea autumn-spawning herring stock in ICES Division IIIa, Sub-area IV and Division VIId, the herring stocks in Division VIa and Subarea VII, the stock of spring-spawning herring in Division IIIa and Subdivisions 22 - 24 (Western <b>Baltic),</b> and the <b>sprat</b> stocks in Sub-area IV and Divisions IIIa and VIId,e. The WG reports {{on the status of}} all of the stocks (8 herring and 3 sprat stocks). Analytical assessments were only carried out on 4 out of the 11 stocks the WG was requested to examine and of these four analytical assessments of only three of the herring stocks were accepted last year. This year the working group adopted the proposed ACFM methodology of allocating assessments to categories (The Benchmark - Update assessment system). Of the different stocks to be considered by the HAWG, the NSAS-stock was on the Observation list, the WBSS was to have a benchmark assessment and herring in VIa, VIIa, Celtic and sprat update assessments. During the progress of the work, the WG agreed to redefine the assessment of WBSS stock into an update assessment as no new relevant information was available and the assessments on Irish Sea herring, herring in VIaS, VIIb and sprat in the North Sea, as experimental assessments. The other stocks were considered as update assessments. For Irish Sea herring, an additional two-stage biomass model was used to assist exploration of the stock dynamics. The assessments of the autumn spawners in the North Sea, VIaN and the Western Baltic spring spawners (WBSS), are consistent with those presented last year, resulting in little changes in the perception of the stocks. With regard to the model used for the assessment of all herring stocks, namely ICA, concern has been raised about the instability in the selection patterns at older ages which would affect the stock estimates {{in the early part of}} the time series. The WG examined the performance of ICA on North Sea herring and Western Baltic Spring Spawners with another regularly used assessment model, XSA. The two models gave very similar perceptions of the state of the stock and the WG felt that the use of the ICA model is still appropriate. This also maintains consistency with assessments in previous years. Most of the stocks assessed are considered within safe biological limits. Corresponding catch predictions are provided in options tables for 2005, where possible by fleet. A number of data revisions have been applied to the assessment input data set for North Sea and WBSS at this year’s WG, as total catch and catch-at-age have been updated for the catch years 1995 - 2002. The catch series for West of Scotland (ViaN) herring were extended back to 1957, with no changes in the perception of the status of the stock compared to the 2003 -assessment for the years 1976 - 2002. There is still a need for better input/sampling data for some stocks, and in other stocks there is a lack of fishery independent data. Though few estimates of discards were available, the amount of discards for most fisheries was regarded as insignificant. The Stock Annexes of the Quality Control Handbook have been drafted and are attached to the HAWG report. In many cases these are incomplete as there is a large amount of information needed for each and they take a considerable amount of time to compile. For stocks without an accepted assessment, general elements (stock definitions, fisheries and ecosystem aspects) are presented. For VIaN herring, the inclusion of the longer time-series of catches including a period with higher stock productivity and higher biomass, resulted in the WG reviewing the support for the proposed reference points for that stock. The WG considered that the proposed Blim of 50, 000 t and a Bpa of 75, 000 t are suitable limits and reference points. The management arrangement for North Sea herring, adopted in 1998 by EU and Norway, was largely based on medium-term simulations made in 1997. Since this is 7 years ago, and the management regime only became effective recently, the WG found it appropriate to reinvestigate the harvest control rules with new simulations. The simulations and the results are presented in the report. Two formal requests from the EU-Commission to advise on TACs for herring in the Skagerrak/Kattegat-area, were considered by the HAW...|$|R
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} co-occurring <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sprattus sprattus) and cod (Gadus morhua) larvae {{have been studied}} in the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea during 12 cruises {{covering}} the spawning seasons in 1987 and 1988. The seasonal and size-dependant diet composition is described based on Bongo-net samples. Contrary to investigations from other areas, first-feeding larvae of both species included almost no phytoplankton in their diet. Feeding started on calanoid copepod nauplii which were the dominating food item. Copepodite stages I–V and finally adult copepods were eaten with increasing larval length. Only sprat larvae used cladocerans additionally as food source of considerable importance. Cod larvae included copepodites/copepods in their diet at smaller total lengths than sprat larvae. The trophic niche breadth of both species did not increase with larval length. The feeding selectivity of different sized sprat and cod larvae (Pearre’s C-index) was calculated based on vertical resolving sampling of predator and prey. The results indicate a strong preference of sprat larvae for different developmental stages of Acartia spp., a species showing a pronounced increase in standing stock since the 1980 s. Cod larvae selected Pseudocalanus elongatus, a species which decreased in biomass. Possible implications for recruitment levels of both species are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recruitment {{patterns}} of Baltic Sea sprat (Sprattus sprattus) were correlated to time series of (i) month- and depth-specific temperature conditions and (ii) larval drift patterns inferred from long-term Lagrangian particle simulations. From the latter, we derived an index that likely reflected the variable degree of annual larval transport from the central, deep spawning basins to the shallow coastal {{areas of the}} Baltic Sea. The drift index was significantly (P < 0. 001) correlated to sprat recruitment success and explained, together with sprat spawning stock biomass, 82 % of the overall variability between 1979 and 2003. Years of strong larval displacement towards southern and eastern Baltic coasts corresponded to relative recruitment failure, while years of retention within the deep basins were associated with relative recruitment success. The strongest correlation between temperature and recruitment occurred during August in surface waters, explaining 73 % of the overall variability. Together, the two approaches advocate that new year classes of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> are predominantly composed of individuals born {{late in the season}} and are determined in strength mainly by processes acting during the late larval and early juvenile stages. However, prior to be included in recruitment predictions, the biological mechanisms underlying these strong correlations may need to be better resolve...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> is challenged by highly variable recruitment success and hence large stock fluctuations. Recent studies {{have identified the}} larval and early juvenile life stages to be critical for the survival rate of a sprat year class. Although prey abundance {{was found to be}} linked to larval survival success, an analysis identifying the functional relationship and relative importance of other environmental factors is still missing. Sprat larval feeding was investigated in 2002 during three cruises, covering the main spawning time in the Bornholm Basin, Baltic Sea. The aim {{of the study was to}} identify the key environmental factors determining the feeding success of larval sprat taking their potential interactions explicitly into account. An extension of generalized additive models (GAMs) was adopted that allows the inclusion of interaction terms in a non-parametric regression model. The final model of sprat larval feeding success explained ∼ 80 % of the variance in the data and was based on the following environmental factors: bottom depth, cubed wind speed as proxy for small-scale turbulence rates, degree of cloudiness as proxy for light conditions and prey density in combination with a feeding period–cloudiness interaction term. Our study demonstrates that the feeding success of sprat larvae in the Baltic Sea is controlled by a number of simultaneously acting key environmental factor...|$|E
40|$|Spatio-temporal density-dependent {{processes}} are crucial regulatory factors for natural populations. However, {{there is a}} lack of studies addressing spatial density-dependence in fish growth. A previous investigation has suggested spatio-temporal density-dependence in body condition of <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat.</b> Here, we used different techniques, such as centre of gravity, distance, and homogeneity indices, to better characterize the spatial and temporal variations in sprat density and body condition in the Baltic Proper. Our results evidenced a negative spatio-temporal co-variation between the centres of gravity of density and maximum condition. In the 1980 s-early 1990 s both centres were located in the middle of the Baltic Proper. From the mid 1990 s the centres progressively separated in space, as the sprat population moved towards the north-eastern Baltic Proper, and the centre of maximum condition towards the south-western areas. Moreover, at low abundances, sprat density and condition were homogeneously distributed in space, whereas at high abundances both density and condition showed pronounced geographical gradients. The ecological processes potentially explaining the observed patterns were discussed in the light of the Ideal Free Distribution theory. We provide evidence that the shift in the spatial distribution of cod, the main predator of sprat, has been the main factor triggering the overall spatial changes in sprat density, and thus condition, during the past thirty years. The spatial indices shown here, synthesizing the spatio-temporal patterns of fis...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{resource}} management faces trade-offs {{in the provision}} of various ecosystem goods and services to humanity. For fisheries management to develop into an ecosystem-based approach, the goal is not only to maximize economic profits, but to consider equally important conservation and social equity goals. We introduce such a triple-bottom line approach to the management of multi-species fisheries using the Baltic Sea as a case study. We apply a coupled ecological-economic optimization model to address the actual fisheries management challenge of trading-off the recovery of collapsed cod stocks versus the health of ecologically important forage fish populations. Management strategies based on profit maximization would rebuild the cod stock to high levels but may cause the risk of stock collapse for forage species with low market value, such as <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Fig. 1 A). Economically efficient conservation efforts to protect sprat would be borne almost exclusively by the forage fishery as sprat fishing effort and profits would strongly be reduced. Unless compensation is paid, this would challenge equity between fishing sectors (Fig. 1 B). Optimizing equity while respecting sprat biomass precautionary levels would reduce potential profits of the overall Baltic fishery, but may offer an acceptable balance between overall profits, species conservation and social equity (Fig. 1 C). Our case study shows a practical example of how an ecosystem-based fisheries management will be able to offer society options to solve common conflicts between different resource uses. Adding equity considerations to the traditional trade-off between economy and ecology will greatl...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the larval feeding ecology of sprat Sprattus sprattus L., an important commercial fish {{species in the}} Central Baltic Sea. We collected seasonally resolved larval abundance and gut content as well as zooplankton data, {{with the goal of}} identifying mechanisms leading to variability in larval survival. Our results show sprat larvae feed progressively on larger food items as they grow during the season depending on their size and the composition of the available prey. We found first-feeding larvae early in the spawning season to prey exclusively upon microplankton. Small larvae fed mainly upon nauplii of the copepods Acartia spp., Temora longicornis and Centropages hamatus (ca. 65 %), whereas larger larvae consumed up to 80 % Acartia spp. copepodites and adults, as well as cladocerans. Trends in sprat larval diets were to a large degree explainable by selective feeding. Feeding success and gut fullness increased linearly with larval size. Trophic niche breadth increased linearly until larvae reached a predator size of 16 mm, after which it decreased. We explain the latter decline by a restricted size spectrum of prey available to larger sprat larvae, which points towards the importance of considering the structure of the zooplankton community when evaluating the predator size to niche breadth relationship. Our results suggest first-feeding <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> larvae to be always food-limited, while larger larvae are not. We hypothesize medium-sized sprat larvae to be the life stage that has the potential to cause most of the interannual variability in sprat larval survival, which is dependent on a match between larval production and the state of the plankton cycle...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{sensitivity}} analyses regarding {{the effects of}} various assumptions about the magnitude of natural mortality (M) on resulting stock assessment parameters and derived references for sustainable fisheries management. The results revealed that the estimated exploitation rate is decreasing and the stock size is increasing with increasing M. The recommended and internationally agreed fisheries management references of sustainable exploitation F 0. 1 and Fmsy are also found to sensitively react to changes in M. Both F 0. 1 and Fmsy increase with increasing M. All simulations are {{based on data from}} the <b>Baltic</b> <b>sprat</b> (Sub-divisions 22 - 32), which has historically undergone quite large changes in M. Nevertheless, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is demonstrated to be a rather robust estimator over a wide range of M, including species at a rather low trophic level. The trend to underestimate fishing mortality and to overestimate the stock size with high M might deliver, in comparison with actual catches, a positively biased perception {{of the state of the}} stock and its productivity. The elevated risk for sustainable fisheries even increases when underestimated fishing mortalities are compared with overestimated management references of exploitation, like F 0. 1 and Fmsy. It is recommended to base M assumptions in the assessment of exploited resources and the advisory process to fisheries management to the longevity of the species concerned, if no quantitative information about M is available. Furthermore, M should account for the different ontogenetic stages and for changes in fish condition if observed. JRC. G. 4 -Maritime affair...|$|E
