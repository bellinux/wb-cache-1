5|$|As {{the wave}} {{breaches}} the Himalayas and approaches the site, an impact driver lodges in the ark-door gears, keeping a <b>boarding</b> <b>gate</b> open and preventing the ship's engines from starting. In the ensuing chaos where many people attempt {{to board the}} ships, Yuri, Tamara and Gordon are killed, Tenzin is injured, Ark 4 begins filling with water and is set adrift after Air Force One crashes into one of its supports, while also causing it to skim the hull of Ark 6 before drifting off. With Jackson and Noah's help, {{the crew of the}} Ark manages to regain control of the Ark narrowly before it fatally smashes into Mount Everest.|$|E
25|$|Jaswant Basuta, a 47-year-old car mechanic, {{had checked}} in for Pan Am Flight 103, but {{arrived at the}} <b>boarding</b> <b>gate</b> too late. Having {{attended}} a family wedding in Belfast, he was returning to New York City {{to start a new}} job. Basuta was initially considered a suspect, as his checked baggage had been on the flight without him. This suspicion may have been heightened by Basuta having been a Sikh as militant Sikhs had been implicated in the bombing of Air India Flight 182 three years previously.|$|E

As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen's Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan's Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai.

25|$|Emirates were {{to start}} the first Airbus A380 service to Perth from Dubai in early 2014 when the {{construction}} of a dual level <b>boarding</b> <b>gate</b> and other expansions to the terminal, including a new Emirates business class lounge, are completed. Emirates was originally scheduled to commence A380 operations in late 2013, however in June 2013 the airport revealed a 5-month delay in the terminal expansion project. While the A380 gate complex itself is due to be completed in November 2013, the airport will not have the capacity to facilitate A380 operations until the other upgrades are completed in March 2014. However, on December 16, 2014, Emirates announced that they will commence A380 operations to Perth in May 2015 with one of its three daily flights. As of the 1st of August, the remaining Emirates Boeing 777-300ER service, will be replaced with an Airbus A380, tallying the total Emirates A380 daily services to two.|$|E

[...] Concourse A (gates A1 – A7) {{is home to}} Southwest Airlines, {{which uses}} all the gates with the {{exception}} of A1 (no jet bridge) and A7 (ground-level <b>boarding</b> <b>gate).</b> Concourse B (gates B19 – B36) is home to Air Canada, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Frontier Airlines. The Vacation Express charters also depart from Concourse B. Gates B15 through B18 and B33 are no longer accessible due to concession and restroom construction. Gate B33 and B36 have had their jet bridges removed. Concourse C (gates C46 – C56) is home to Delta Air Lines, which uses gates C49-C56.

2500|$|The only {{station on}} the Cut-Off at which {{mainline}} passenger trains would stop was Blairstown. [...] Blairstown {{was also the first}} stop on westbound trains where passengers were permitted to unboard (i.e. westbound passengers boarding and detraining east of Blaistown were required to use suburban train service instead). [...] This explains why Blairstown was the first stop listed on the destination board at the <b>boarding</b> <b>gate</b> at Hoboken for trains travelling via Scranton. [...] In later years, Blairstown had a somewhat unusual facet of operation: any trains arriving after the station agent went home for the night would automatically activate the station platform lights as the train entered the signal block. [...] This practice was abandoned after passenger service ended.|$|E
