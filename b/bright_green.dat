5|$|Terrified, the {{engineer}} {{jumps into the}} chemical plant's waste pound lock to escape Batman and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. Once outside, he discovers to his horror that the chemicals have permanently bleached his skin chalk-white, stained his lips ruby-red and dyed his hair <b>bright</b> <b>green.</b> The engineer's disfigurement, compounded {{with the loss of}} his family, drives him completely insane and marks the birth of the Joker.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of}} the seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E

5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, where both putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia lanceolata {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, mainly due to {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have proven difficult to strike. Nevertheless, its <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> hue {{is considered an}} attractive horticultural feature. Well drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for this plant in a garden setting. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells, and grows fairly readily in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England were able to germinate seed there in 1791.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from pale blue to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
50|$|While Cinecolor {{could produce}} vibrant reds, oranges, blues, browns and flesh tones, its renderings of other colors such as <b>bright</b> <b>greens</b> (rendered dark green) and purples (rendered {{a sort of}} dark magenta) were muted.|$|R
50|$|Forpus conspicillatus metae - On the male, the underparts are a <b>brighter,</b> {{yellowish}} <b>green</b> colour, {{the throat}} and cheeks and bend of the wing may also appear yellowish. The head is a <b>brighter</b> <b>green,</b> and blue contour around eye is reduced to mainly the posterior part of feathers surrounding the eye. Can be found in Eastern Andes, and from Meta River, in Central Colombia {{all the way into}} Western Venezuela.|$|R

5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster the petals move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|Kyle {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> ushanka, a bright orange jacket, dark green pants, and lime-green mittens/gloves. The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within his normal vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
5|$|The B. z. zonarius and B. z. semitorquatus {{subspecies}} have a dull black head; back, rump {{and wings}} are brilliant green; throat and breast bluish-green. The {{difference between these}} two subspecies is that B. z. zonarius has a yellow abdomen while B. z. semitorquatus has a green abdomen; the latter has also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks (the intermediate shown in the box has characteristics of both subspecies). The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> crown and nape and blush cheek-patches. The underparts of B. z. barnardi are turquoise-green with an irregular orange-yellow band across the abdomen; the back and mantle are deep blackish-blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band. The B. z. macgillivrayi is generally pale green, with no red frontal band, and a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen.|$|E
50|$|While {{the adult}} male is distinctive, the female and youngsters can be {{confused}} with several similar species. The female golden-collared manakin is larger, and has orange (rather than brown) legs, while the female blue-crowned manakin is a <b>brighter</b> <b>green</b> (rather than olive).|$|R
50|$|A related species, the Fiji parrotfinch, E. pealii, also {{occurs on}} Viti Levu. This locally common bird is smaller, and adults have a red {{head and a}} much smaller, dark bill. Immatures have a pale bill, but are <b>brighter</b> <b>green</b> than their larger relative.|$|R

5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, {{but the rest of the}} plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 34 mm. The head and thorax are <b>bright</b> grass <b>green</b> with whitish edges. The abdomen is paler green. The forewings are <b>bright</b> grass <b>green</b> with a straight darker green postmedial line. The hindwings are paler green and the underside is green.|$|R
50|$|Some {{areas of}} colour were {{retouched}} by restorers around 1850 following dulling {{and loss of}} paint. This is most obvious with the <b>bright</b> <b>greens</b> {{to either side of}} Christ. However, the additions are barely noticeable as the restorers employed pigments prepared in a similar matter to the originals.|$|R
50|$|The intro changes {{starting}} this season, and now features Snicklefritz and Auntie Macassar. Auntie Macassar now speaks in the postcards sent to Loonette. The Clock Rug {{gets a new}} redesign with darker colors and a new font for the numbers. Also, Granny's garden is redesigned with <b>brighter</b> <b>green</b> grass.|$|R
5|$|The {{predominant}} metallic colour is green, but {{can vary}} by region, ranging from metallic green to purple. In the Flinders Ranges of South Australia and Alice Springs, the colour of the ants shifts from the typical green {{to a dark}} purple colour. In areas with more rainfall such as the New South Wales tablelands and Victorian savannahs, green-head ants are mostly green with purplish tints seen {{on the sides of}} the mesosoma. In the northern regions of New South Wales and Queensland, the alitrunk is reddish-violet, which shades into golden around the lower portions of the pleura. The green colour is either limited or completely absent in this case. Most populations have a <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> gaster, except for those living in the central desert. In some areas examined near Brisbane, two different colour forms were discovered within a single colony. One possibility is that the two colour forms may represent two sibling species, but this cannot be confirmed because of lack of evidence. In far north Queensland, populations appear to be dull green and distinct to those living in the south, but it is unknown how the ants in the far north and south hook up at the western and southern regions of the Atherton Tableland. With this said, it is unknown if the far north populations are actually a different species. In addition to colour variation, there are morphological differences among populations. For example, the size and shape of the head and petiole, the length of the appendages, and other sculptural details of the body may all vary.|$|E

25|$|Garden parsley is a <b>bright</b> <b>green,</b> {{biennial}} {{plant in}} temperate climates, or an annual herb in subtropical and tropical areas.|$|E
50|$|Forpus passerinus passerinus Found in the Guianas. Also {{known as}} Nominate subspecies. The male is <b>green</b> with a <b>brighter</b> <b>green</b> at the {{forehead}} and cheeks, {{underside of the}} body and behind the neck. Lower back, rump and upper tail are <b>bright</b> emerald <b>green.</b> Underside of wings and edge of wing are blue. Females are the same as males, but lacking any blue. They may have more yellowish colorings on forehead. Green-rumped parrotlets have a sleek body (feathers held tight), their eyes are dark brown, and their legs are a pale pink.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{constructed}} by Walkers Limited used electricity {{for the light}} on the rear of the tender, for side lamps and to illuminate the motion. All were fitted with roller bearings and chime whistles. The Vulcan built engines were painted hawthorn green when introduced, the Walkers built examples in a <b>brighter</b> <b>green.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{leaf blade}} of a {{butterwort}} is smooth, rigid, and succulent, usually <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> or pinkish in colour. Depending on species, {{the leaves are}} between 2 and 30cm.(1-12") long. The leaf shape depends on the species, but is usually roughly obovate, spatulate, or linear.|$|E
25|$|Uvarovite is a calcium {{chromium}} garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Cr2(SiO4)3. This {{is a rather}} rare garnet, <b>bright</b> <b>green</b> in color, usually found as small crystals associated with chromite in peridotite, serpentinite, and kimberlites. It is found in crystalline marbles and schists in the Ural mountains of Russia and Outokumpu, Finland.|$|E
