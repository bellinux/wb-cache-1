500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b> WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 1944, 2d Lieutenant Robert E. Femoyer, a {{navigator}} {{with the}} group, was flying {{a mission to}} Merseburg, Germany. [...] His B-17 was damaged by flak and Lt. Femoyer was severely injured in his back and side. [...] He refused morphine to relieve the pain of his injuries {{in order to keep}} his mind alert to navigate the plane out of the danger from heavily defended flak areas and then to a place of safety for his crew. [...] Because he was too weak to climb <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> he asked other crew members to prop him up so he could read his charts and instruments. [...] For more than two hours he directed the navigation of his plane back to its home station with no further damage. [...] Shortly after being removed from his plane, Lt. Femoyer died of his injuries.|$|E
60|$|The mate sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> and {{regarded}} him with open-mouthed, horrified astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Pore Sam leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>'is</b> <b>seat</b> panting {{and trying}} to wrap 'imself up better in the counterpane, which 'ad got torn in the struggle. They went through street arter street, and 'e was just {{thinking}} of a nice warm bed and a kind nurse listening to all 'is troubles when 'e found they was going over London Bridge.|$|R
60|$|She whispered {{something}} in Macheson's ear which he affected not to hear. He leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cushioned <b>seat</b> and laughed.|$|R
60|$|Peter, wot was {{standing}} by blinking and smiling, misunderstood 'im, and went back inside the pub. Ginger went arter 'im to fetch 'im back, and hearing a noise turned round and saw the cabman pulling Sam out o' the cab. He was {{just in time to}} shove 'im back agin, and for {{the next two or three}} minutes 'im and the cabman was 'ard at it. Sam was too busy holding 'is clothes on to do much, and twice the cabman got 'im 'arf out, and twice Ginger got him back agin and bumped 'im <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>'is</b> <b>seat</b> and shut the door. Then they both stopped and took breath.|$|R
60|$|Sarelli fell <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> twirling his moustaches fiercely. Harz, who had risen, {{looked at}} Christian's empty place.|$|E
60|$|Flambeau {{suddenly}} flung off all his pontifical pretensions. The great robber leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{and laughed}} low but long.|$|E
60|$|The {{man looked}} hard at him, {{and then went}} quietly out; and Grant leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> with a soft laugh.|$|E
50|$|By 2001, Metelsky had {{resigned}} to seek another office, leaving Koziura's former seat open again. Wanting {{out of the}} mayor's office, he accepted an appointment <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> the Ohio House. He was sworn into office on October 30, 2001, and won a full term in November 2002. He won reelection in 2004, and again in 2006. By 2008, Democrats had again attained control of the House, and Koziura was named to several powerful committees.|$|R
60|$|They drove {{straight}} to the depot, found two vacant seats in the train, and Quest with a little sigh of relief handed over his charge. Craig, who, though still dumb, had shown signs of intense nervousness since the landing, sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> corner <b>seat,</b> covering {{the upper part of}} his head with his hands. Suddenly Lenora, who had been chatting with French through the window, happened to glance towards Craig. She gave a little cry and stepped back.|$|R
60|$|All went prosperously, and he {{got into}} an empty {{carriage}} in the train, where he could lay Bebelle on the seat over against him, as on a couch, and cover her {{from head to foot}} with his mantle. He had just drawn himself up from perfecting this arrangement, and had just leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>seat</b> contemplating it with great satisfaction, when he became aware of a curious appearance at the open carriage window,--a ghostly little tin box floating up in the moonlight, and hovering there.|$|R
60|$|The captain sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> {{fighting}} for breath, and turning his head, gave a last triumphant {{look up the}} road.|$|E
60|$|The skipper smiled knowingly, and, rolling a {{cigar in}} his mouth, leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and cocked his eye at the skylight.|$|E
60|$|Saxon {{burst out}} laughing, and leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{with his long}} legs {{stretched}} straight out and {{his hands in his}} breeches pockets.|$|E
60|$|He sat up {{and looked}} about him, then rose {{and walked toward the}} table; but his head began to swim, and his eyes to darken; so he fell <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> feeling drowsy and beaten. Mechanically he began to move the hand that hung over the arm of his low chair, and it {{encountered}} a newspaper which had fallen on the floor. He lifted it automatically and without thought: it was the Times. Perhaps to try his eyes, and see if they served him again after his collapse, he ran them down the columns of the advertisements.|$|R
60|$|Herr Freudenberg {{was deep}} in {{conversation}} with Monsieur Jesen--the friend of mademoiselle's friend. He glanced up, but his greeting was almost perfunctory. Kendricks looked keenly {{at the man who}} was leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> padded <b>seat.</b> The eyes of Monsieur Jesen were a little more bloodshot now. He had spilt wine down the front of his waistcoat, cigar ash upon his coat-sleeve. He was by no means an inviting person to look at. Yet about his forehead and mouth there was an expression of power. Herr Freudenberg, with obvious regret, abandoned his conversation for a moment.|$|R
60|$|The Earl himself {{accompanied}} them, and as {{the heavy}} snub-nosed boat, rowed by the six oarsmen in Mackworth livery, slid slowly and heavily up against the stream, the Earl, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cushioned <b>seat,</b> pointed out the various inns of the great priests or nobles; palatial town residences standing mostly a little distance back from the water behind terraced high-walled gardens and lawns. Yon was the Bishop of Exeter's Close; yon was the Bishop of Bath's; that was York House; and that Chester Inn. So passing by gardens and lawns and palaces, they came at last to Scotland Yard stairs, a broad flight of marble steps that led upward to a stone platform above, upon which opened the gate-way of the garden beyond.|$|R
60|$|And the {{stranger}} pronounced these last words {{with a smile}} of peculiar meaning, leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and enjoyed a deep inhalation of tobacco.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot make it!' cried his {{trembling}} companion, falling <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{and covering}} his eyes. 'Do {{you see her}} now? Is she there still?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very, good," [...] {{said his}} friend, [...] "let us take coal," [...] {{settling}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{with the air}} of an intellect about to feed itself.|$|E
5000|$|Donnelly goes to {{the buffet}} cart to get a drink. The man comes out to get tea and engages Donnelly in a brief conversation. With her husband gone, the woman is left alone with the kid, who quickly moves over to harass her as she {{clutches}} {{a picture of her}} dead baby. He accuses her of [...] "banging it on something", because the baby was [...] "ugly". Aghast, the woman steps on the table to get away from him, only to trip, fall, and tear the photo. Moments later, the kid, <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own <b>seat,</b> is startled by a thump at the window; the woman had thrown herself out of the train. He goes to investigate, to find an open gate, and the torn picture of the baby on the floor.|$|R
60|$|She indeed {{held the}} lock fast. It was a firm hand, yet soft--their fingers had touched over the handle--and looked {{white in the}} moonlight. He made no reply, but sank <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> with a {{singular}} sensation in the fingers that had touched hers. He was in the shadow, and, without being seen, could abandon his reserve and glance at her face. It struck {{him that he had}} never really seen her before. She was not so tall as she had appeared to be. Her eyes were not large, but her pupils were black, moist, velvety, and so convex as to seem embossed on the white. She had an indistinctive nose, a rather colorless face--whiter at the angles of the mouth and nose through the relief of tiny freckles like grains of pepper. Her mouth was straight, dark, red, but moist as her eyes. She had drawn herself into the corner of the back seat, her wrist put through and hanging over the swinging strap, the easy lines of her plump figure swaying from side to side with the motion of the coach. Finally, forgetful of any presence in the dark corner opposite, she threw her head a little farther back, slipped a trifle lower, and placing two well-booted feet upon the middle seat, completed a charming and wholesome picture.|$|R
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or {{on the issues of}} Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old <b>seat.</b> Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into <b>his</b> brief tenure <b>in</b> the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.|$|R
60|$|The {{thought had}} brought a bitter pang. 'One half year sooner--' and he leant <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> with fingers tightly pressed together, and {{trembling}} with emotion.|$|E
60|$|Amyas {{had dropped}} <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{as if he}} had been shot; but he {{recovered}} himself before kind Mrs. Hawkins could rush to the cupboard for cordials.|$|E
60|$|But {{the second}} officer, {{with a strange}} awesome look in his eyes, was leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> tightly {{gripping}} {{the edge of the}} table in both hands.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a very}} {{beautiful}} road, and Mr. Sabin was quite content to lean <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> not uncomfortable <b>seat</b> and admire the scenery. For the most part it was of a luxuriant and broken character. There were very few signs of agriculture, save {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the large newly-built houses which they passed every now and then. At times they skirted the side of a mountain, and far below them in the valley the river Leine wound its way along like a broad silver band. Here and there the road passed through a thick forest of closely-growing pines, and Mr. Sabin, holding his cigarette away from him, leaned back and took long draughts of the rosinous, piney odour. It was soon after emerging from the last of these that they suddenly came upon a house which moved Mr. Sabin almost to enthusiasm. It lay not far back from the road, a very long two-storied white building, free from the over-ornamentation which disfigured most of the surrounding mansions. White pillars in front, after the colonial fashion, supported a long sloping veranda roof, and the smooth trimly-kept lawns stretched almost to the terrace which bordered the piazza. There were sun blinds of striped holland to the southern windows, and about the whole place there was an air of simple and elegant refinement, which Mr. Sabin found curiously attractive. He broke {{for the first time the}} silence which had reigned between him and the driver.|$|R
60|$|There was a pause. Jones sat <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{chair and}} looked hard across at Robinson. For some moments {{the two men}} gazed into each other's eyes with a stern, defiant intensity. Then Robinson turned slowly round <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and beckoned to the waiter, who was moving off with the muttered order on his lips.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Scott Eccles had fidgeted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> {{during this}} conversation.|$|R
60|$|At {{the foot}} of the ladder he paused abruptly, for the skipper was leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> gazing in a fascinated manner at some object on the table.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gaynsforth, {{although}} he was an Englishman and young, showed himself to be possessed {{of a sense of}} humor. He leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and roared with laughter.|$|E
60|$|And flinging himself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> he grinded {{his teeth}} till the foam flew from his lips, {{as from the}} tusks of the savage animal whose name and spoils he wore.|$|E
60|$|The skipper swung round <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> and {{regarded}} him open-mouthed.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} {{no one noticed}} Tarzan, sitting silently <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilberfloss, thus {{suddenly}} {{pulled into}} the conversation, again leaped <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R
