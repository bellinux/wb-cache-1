5|$|Lake Shore Road {{around the}} island was built between 1900 and 1910 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> the M-185 {{designation}} was first assigned on July 12, 1933. The roadway was purpose-built for non-motorized use; it is narrower than other state highways. During the 1950s, the state paved the road in asphalt. Since the 1970s, the MISPC has allowed snowmobiles to operate on Mackinac Island during the winter.|$|E
5|$|SR 133 was {{constructed}} as a county road by the 1910s; the portion from I-405 to I-5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later. Plans {{to extend the}} freeway south were canceled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> {{the southern part of}} the road remains an undivided highway. In 1998, the majority of the Eastern Transportation Corridor opened, and the connector between I-5 and SR 241 was designated as a toll extension of SR 133.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{originally}} constructed to connect rural cities in eastern Utah with Grand Junction, Colorado, {{the largest city}} in the region. Part of the highway was merged into the Utah state highway system in 1931; the rest was taken over <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> assigned route number 128 in 1933.

5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new gateways {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> these houses demolished.|$|E
5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all that remains is the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, private turnpike {{companies}} {{constructed and}} improved {{a few of}} the more important roadways in the state. Turnpikes were chartered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> privately financed, with tolls collected at toll houses every few miles along the road. The first turnpike in Delaware was the Newport Gap Pike, which was built in 1808 and completed to Wilmington in 1811. Many other turnpikes were constructed in northern New Castle County radiating from Wilmington and connected the industrial city to agricultural areas. The turnpikes were built as straight roads in order to reduce costs. Many of these roads were constructed with a macadam surface. During the course of the 19th century, new methods of transportation such as canals and railroads came about and there was less investment on roads. The revenues of the turnpike companies fell and roads became more of a local concern.|$|E
5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written {{only a handful of}} articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered the debates over trade policy and land reform in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|Lassen and Modoc Counties {{organized}} Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21, 1929 {{to construct}} and maintain a road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon. However, since the state took over the part north of Adin, the district's scope was narrowed to Susanville-Adin. It finally completed work in 1956, and held a ceremony on August 26, in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake. The legislature added {{the road to the}} state highway system as Route 216 in 1959. The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an extension of Route 20 instead; this route from Susanville to Ravendale (later Termo) was never constructed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> was deleted from SR 36 in 1998. Also in 1959, a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added; this became SR 161 in 1964.|$|E

5|$|Late in {{the same}} month, Catargiu was mysteriously assassinated on Mitropoliei Hill, {{on his way back}} from Filaret, where he had {{attended}} a festivity commemorating the Wallachian revolution (he was succeeded by Nicolae Kretzulescu, after the interim premiership of Apostol Arsachi). On June 23, Legea Rurală was passed by Parliament, but Cuza would not promulgate it. According to Kogălniceanu, the Conservatives Arsachi and Kretzulescu were reluctant to propose the law for review by Cuza, knowing that it was destined to be rejected. Discussions then drifted toward the matter of confiscating land from the Greek Orthodox monasteries in Romania (their sizable properties and traditional tax exemptions had been the subject of controversy ever since the Phanariote period). In late 1862, their revenues were taken over <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and,</b> during the summer of the following year, a sum of 80 million piasters was offered as compensation to the Greek monks, in exchange for all of the monasteries' land.|$|E
5|$|Legislative: The {{legislature}} of India is the bicameral parliament. It operates under a Westminster-style {{parliamentary system}} and comprises the upper house called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States") {{and the lower}} called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People"). The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms. Most are elected indirectly <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population. All {{but two of the}} Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected by popular vote; they represent individual constituencies via five-year terms. The remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian community, in case the president decides that they are not adequately represented.|$|E
5|$|The Umayyads were {{followed}} by the Abbasid dynasty which came to power {{with the help of}} Iranian Muslims. The persecution of Zoroastrians increased significantly under the Abbasids, temples and sacred-fire shrines were destroyed. Also during Abbasid rule, the status of Zoroastrians in Persian lands was reduced from zimmi (or dhimmi, people who were protected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> generally considered 'People of the Book') to 'kafirs' (non-believers). As a result, Zoroastrians were not granted the same rights and status as Jews and Christians. Iranian Muslims were welcomed to the court, but not Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians were denied access to bathhouses on the grounds that their bodies were polluted.|$|E

5|$|The {{formation}} of current-day Route31 began around1916, when {{a portion of}} the highway, along the community of Hampton was taken over <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> was repaired to state standards for $300 (1916USD). In1923, the state of New Jersey passed the Good Roads Act, which greatly expanded the state highway system in New Jersey. This act took over pre-existing highways and rebuilt them to a standard mandated by the state. Construction began on Route31 in1926, when the State Highway Department began work at the southern terminus in Trenton. A total of11 bridges were constructed along the highway during this time, signifying the route's construction northward. The oldest ones, dating back to1926, were located in Ewing Township and Oxford Township. The one in Ewing Township was along the first portion of the highway to be constructed.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights.

In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its hunting and fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
5|$|Toll {{collection}} {{started the}} day after the opening, and lasted until 24 May 2007. Seventy percent of the costs were to be covered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> thirty percent through toll fees. The debt was borrowed by the private company that was given a concession to operate a toll plaza on the Inderøy side. Including interest, NOK80 million was collected, and the bridge was paid off three years before schedule. The Vanvikan-based company was disestablished following the closure of the plaza. Until only a few years before the closing, it was the only toll plaza in Nord-Trøndelag. There were several price increases during the toll period. The bridge was free for pedestrians and cyclists, but all motor vehicles were charged, although discounts were available for frequent travelers. The plaza was manned, and did not take into use Autopass, like many other plazas.|$|E

The routes to Tromsø had a sufficient patronage that they were operated without subsidies.|$|E
5|$|During the {{conflict}} itself, monuments were erected near the battlefields and the temporary cemeteries {{being used to}} store the dead. It had been hoped in Britain to repatriate the war dead, but this rapidly proved entirely impractical, leading to haphazard, improvised arrangements around the battlefields. By 1916 over 200 war cemeteries had been commissioned in France and Belgium, prompting debate about what longer term memorials might be appropriate at these sites. The government was concerned that unsuitable, even distasteful memorials might be erected by relatives at the cemeteries and the decision was taken that the cemeteries would be controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> that a uniform design would {{be applied to the}} memorials at the graves. French cemeteries were used for as memorial sites for ceremonies by injured soldiers during the war and many towns began to name streets and squares after Verdun. In Belgium, where the movement of the war and losses of territory had meant that the Flemish elements of the population were increasingly forming a disproportionate percentage of the army, the language on the memorial headstone gradually became an issue, leading to calls for the creation of heldenhuldezerkjes, headstones inscribed in Flemish, rather than the usual French. In Imperial Russia, the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was constructed for the war dead in 1915 by the Imperial royal family and senior Moscow political leaders, who hoped that its inspiring architecture would ensure patriotism in future generations of Russians.|$|E
5|$|The {{major reasons}} for rising {{political}} tensions among the Finns were the autocratic {{rule of the}} Russian Czar and the undemocratic class system of the estates of the realm. The system originated in the Swedish Empire regime, preceding the Russian power, and divided the Finnish people into two groups, separated economically, socially and politically. Finland's population grew rapidly in the 19th century (from 860,000 in 1810 to 3,130,000 in 1917), and a class of industrial and agrarian workers and property-less peasants emerged. The Industrial Revolution was rapid in Finland, though it started later than {{in the rest of}} Western Europe. Industrialization was financed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>state,</b> <b>and</b> some of the social problems associated with the industrial process were diminished via control of the administration. Among urban workers, socioeconomic problems steepened during periods of industrial depression. The position of rural workers had worsened {{since the end of the}} 19th century, as farming became more efficient and market-oriented and the gradually developing industry did not fully utilize the rapid population growth of the countryside.|$|E
