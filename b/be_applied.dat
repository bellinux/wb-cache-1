The case revolved around a nurse dismissed for a conversation she had with a coworker. There was a discrepancy between what she argued was said and what her employer thought was said. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, joined by a plurality of justices, opined that the Connick test must <b>be</b> <b>applied</b> to the speech the employer thought occurred, and on which it acted, rather than that which the finder of fact determines did occur.|$|E
