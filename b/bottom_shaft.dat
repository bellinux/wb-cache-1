5000|$|The {{nose wheel}} is {{attached}} to the two rear engine mounts by y-shaped steel tubes attached to a steel tube with a shaft that slides freely with the wheel. Cables run underneath the belly directly from fixtures on the rudder pedals to the nose wheel shaft. This gave the ability to steer by pivoting the nose wheel shaft with the rudder pedals. The shock system consisted of six circular bungee cords, sometimes four for softer landings, located {{on either side of the}} nose wheel shaft to ears on the top tube and the <b>bottom</b> <b>shaft</b> connected to the wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Another feature {{which is}} {{suspected}} {{to be connected}} to the cave is the pit above the Kravljansko vrelo. It is located at an altitude of 450 m and is 123 m deep. In the winter of 1996 ASAK explored the pit again. Strong air drift from the eroded shaft {{at the bottom of the}} pit points to the existence of the spacious canal in the pit's extension, which is most likely connected to the Cerje cave. Previous measurements showed that the pit is located right above the cave's [...] "Salomna chamber" [...] which is located at the end of the corridor, as much as it was explored at the time. However, repeated measurements showed that the pit is actually 350 m east of the cave's canal and that the pit's bottom is close to the level of the Kravljansko vrelo, below the cave's siphon. A plan was made to dig through the pit's <b>bottom</b> <b>shaft</b> in order to make an easier access to the distant areas of the cave.|$|E
5000|$|The Gran Casino del Sardinero {{completed}} in 1916, has some relationship to El Hotel Real {{and is one}} of the symbols of the city. It has a terrace balcony which is accessed by a monumental staircase. The two-story central body is framed at the sides with two octagonal towers, covered by domes, whose edges involved, from top to <b>bottom,</b> <b>shafts</b> with capitals for each floor.|$|R

50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{accident}} occurred the agent, Mr. Hoyle, proceeded to descend into the shaft to the estimated 11 ft water-level whereby nothing could be seen. There was some minimal markings to the shaft walls below where the platform had fallen and little damage apart from some girders which had been dislodged at the High Hazel presumably by the tumbling scaffolding ropes. Recovery operations took place and the water remaining at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> was removed, some of the wreckage at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> {{had to be removed}} by using oxyacetylene burners before the bodies were finally recovered. The first body was initially recovered on Wednesday 17 March 1926 and the last on Friday 19 March 1926 and by Thursday 25 March 1926 the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> was fully cleared.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the series}} episode [...] "Joyride" [...] the Jokerz are shown {{initiating}} a new member. The initiation involves an abandoned mineshaft. During the sequence {{the leader of}} the group shines a flashlight toward the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft.</b> When the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> is illuminated the viewer is shown a close up of a skeleton. The remains of the skeleton's clothing are purple with a white flower over its chest, suggesting that it may belonged to the Joker.|$|R

5000|$|Addison, Matthew, 03 Mar 1859, aged 10, Trapper, {{crushed by}} tub and pony Anderson, Irvine, 24 Dec 1844, aged 29, who, with two others, was {{ascending}} Ludworth Pit in a corf. When {{it was about}} seven fathoms from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> it struck against the side and he was thrown out. He was recovered from the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> and taken home, but died three hours later from a fractured skull. The inquest into his death was held on Tuesday, 24 December ...|$|R
6000|$|Many more miners {{are killed}} by this choke-damp, as they hasten to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> after an explosion, than by the fire itself. Choke-damp, which is {{carbonic}} acid gas, is heavier than ordinary air, and thus the lowest parts of a colliery become first filled with it, as they would with water. In all coal-mines there is a slight, sometimes a considerable, inclination, or [...] "dip" [...] as it is called, of the otherwise flat bed of coal. The shaft is almost always sunk {{at the lower end}} of the area owned by the proprietors of the mine, as by this means the whole pit naturally drains to the [...] "sump," [...] or well, at the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> whence it is pumped up by the engine above; the loaded waggons, too, are run down from the workings to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> with comparative ease.|$|R
50|$|The shaft liner {{does not}} reach {{right to the}} <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> during sinking, but lags behind by a fixed {{distance}}. This distance {{is determined by the}} methodology of excavation and the design thickness of the permanent liner. To ensure the safety of persons working on the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> temporary ground support is installed, usually consisting of welded mesh and rock bolts. The installation of the temporary ground support (called bolting) is among the most physically challenging parts of the shaft sinking cycle as bolts must be installed using pneumatic powered rock drills.|$|R
60|$|He {{stepped back}} while he spoke--the bucket went rapidly upwards, and Trevarrow, sitting {{down in the}} <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> covered his eyes {{with a piece of}} rock and awaited the issue.|$|R
60|$|With this reply {{the other}} was fain to rest satisfied, and shortly after he {{returned}} to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> with his friends, leaving the hardy miner to pursue his work.|$|R

50|$|Byzantine pottery {{found at}} the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shafts</b> {{in the yard and}} two crosses {{engraved}} {{on the wall of the}} main room, show that use of the cave continued until the Byzantine period.|$|R
60|$|Toward one {{of these}} our captors led us, and after a short walk halted before a steel cage which lay at the <b>bottom</b> of a <b>shaft</b> rising above us as far as one could see.|$|R
50|$|Twiss’s {{plan was}} {{approved}} and building went ahead. The shaft {{was to be}} 26 ft in diameter, 140 ft deep with a 180 ft gallery connecting the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated £4000.|$|R
60|$|At the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft</b> {{they were}} accosted by a sturdy little man, who {{told them that}} {{a large piece of}} timber was being sent down the shaft, and it would be {{advisable}} to wait until it reached the bottom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{burial of}} Senebtisi {{was found by}} an American {{expedition}} in 1907 at Lisht {{as part of the}} funerary complex belonging to the vizier Senusret. Her burial was found at the <b>bottom</b> of a <b>shaft</b> in a chamber north of this shaft.|$|R
50|$|The colliery, sunk in 1846, {{was owned}} by Andrew Knowles and Sons and had two ten foot {{diameter}} shafts 24 yards apart.>The colliery originally had pitch pine timber headgear and a winding engine supplied by John Musgrave & Sons of Bolton that operated until 1944.The colliery was ventilated by furnace until the 20th century when ventilation fans were installed. Wrought iron boilers to raise steam for powering pumps, air compressors and haulage were originally sited near the <b>bottom</b> of No.2 <b>shaft,</b> the upcast <b>shaft.</b> The <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> was reached at 1,775 feet. The colliery accessed several coal seams including the Rams, Crumbouke and Doe mines.In 1896 the colliery employed 640 men underground and 165 surface workers while in 1923 there were 563 underground and 172 surface workers.|$|R
2500|$|The final {{nuclear test}} {{detonation}} at Nevada Test Site was Operation Julin's [...] "Divider" [...] on 23September 1992, {{just prior to}} the moratorium temporarily ending all nuclear testing. Divider was a safety experiment test shot that was detonated at the <b>bottom</b> of a <b>shaft</b> sunk into Area3.|$|R
50|$|Balanced {{friction}} hoists are {{not suitable}} for hoisting from multiple loading pockets on different horizons within a shaft, and are generally {{not suitable for}} deep shafts. Friction hoists can not operate at normal speeds if the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> is flooded and water reaches the tail ropes.|$|R
50|$|Around 200 shafts were {{dug into}} the Cissbury hill over around 900 years of use. Shafts were up to 12 m deep with 7 m diameters at the surface. Up to eight {{galleries}} extended outwards from the <b>bottoms</b> of the <b>shafts,</b> often interconnecting with one another.|$|R
50|$|Some shafts {{do not use}} guide beams {{but instead}} utilize steel wire rope (called Guide ropes) kept in tension by massive weights at <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> called cheese weights (because of their {{resemblance}} to a truckle or wheel of cheese) as these are easier to maintain and replace.|$|R
50|$|For this reason, and to {{minimise}} {{the number}} of persons on the <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> a number of projects have successfully switched to shotcrete for this temporary lining. Research and development {{in this area is}} focusing on the robotic application of shotcrete and the commercialisation of thin sprayed polymer liners.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to higher}} levels of water ingress as the mine shafts were {{developed}} under the North Sea, and resultant higher costs of operation and coal extraction, it was decided to close the mine in the mid-1960s. The final shift came up from <b>shaft</b> <b>bottom</b> on 8 June 1968.|$|R

6000|$|... "But, Roland," [...] said Margaret, {{holding in}} her hand the view taken of the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>shaft,</b> [...] "what is this {{in the middle of}} the proof? It is darker than the rest, but it seems to be all covered up with mistiness. Have you a magnifying-glass?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Organizing {{proceeded}} apace.
