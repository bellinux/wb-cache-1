5|$|Various caves {{within the}} gorge were {{inhabited}} by neolithic people from which flint tools {{are held in}} the Wells and Mendip Museum. One particularly fine flint flake {{can be seen in}} the museum at King John's Hunting Lodge in Axbridge. Human and animal <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the Neolithic were recovered from Outlook Cave in 1907. <b>Bones</b> <b>from</b> the Palaeolithic have been found at Savory's Hole.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus may {{be known}} from less {{complete}} remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming. A tooth from southern Arizona has {{been referred to}} the genus, and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the same area. Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus. Many other teeth and <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|MacPhee had {{material}} of Plesiorycteropus from twelve sites in central, western, and southern Madagascar. It and other recently extinct Madagascar mammals may {{have lived in}} and near wetlands. P.madagascariensis is known from sites throughout this range, but P.germainepetterae has only been definitely recorded from the center; small <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> southern sites may also belong to it. Thus, the two species apparently had widely overlapping ranges.|$|E
25|$|The {{formation}} of bone is called ossification. During the fetal {{stage of development}} this occurs by two processes: intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification. Intramembranous ossification involves the {{formation of}} <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> connective tissue whereas endochondral ossification involves the formation of <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> cartilage.|$|R

40|$|We report here {{differences}} in the fatty acid profile of cancellous bone matrix, including n- 3, n- 6, mono- and poly-unsaturated, as well as saturated fats, between femoral heads from female OA (n= 8, aged 68 - 88 years), fractured neck of femur (#NOF) (n= 19, 67 - 88 years) and autopsy controls (CTRL) (n= 4, 85 - 97 years). Femoral heads were collected from individuals undergoing orthopaedic surgery for OA or #NOF; the fatty acid profile of sub-samples from the superior principal compressive and superior principal tensile regions were determined by gas chromatography. A total of 42 individual fatty acids were detected at varying concentrations with significant differences between subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> OA subjects, subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> #NOF subjects and subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> CTRL subjects, {{as well as between}} the superior principal compressive and superior principal tensile regions (for saturated fats only). Subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> OA subjects had higher total n- 6 (OA= 10. 89 ± 3. 17, #NOF= 11. 11 ± 1. 83, CTRL= 8. 32 ± 2. 05, p= 0. 008) and total n- 3 (OA= 1. 34 ± 0. 38, #NOF= 1. 19 ± 0. 18, CTRL= 1. 15 ± 0. 48, p= 0. 011) percentages than subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> #NOF subjects and subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> CTRL subjects, and {{there was no difference in}} the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio, nor within the percentage of n- 9 fatty acids. Arachidonic acid (OA= 0. 42 ± 0. 16, #NOF= 0. 26 ± 0. 06, CTRL= 0. 28 ± 0. 06, p= 0. 01), and γ-linolenic acid (OA= 0. 11 ± 0. 03, #NOF= 0. 05 ± 0. 02, CTRL= 0. 04 ± 0. 02, p< 0. 001) were higher in subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> OA subjects than subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> #NOF subjects and subchondral <b>bone</b> <b>from</b> CTRL subjects. In conclusion, there is a wide diversity of fatty acids in cancellous <b>bone</b> matrix <b>from</b> the femoral heads of OA and #NOF, suggesting they may have regulatory effects on inflammatory processes, and their metabolites.

5|$|By about 15,000 years ago, Equus ferus was a {{widespread}} holarctic species. Horse <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> this time period, the late Pleistocene, {{are found in}} Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.|$|E
5|$|Excavations of Iron Age {{sites have}} {{recovered}} horse <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> ritual pits at a temple site near Cambridge, and around twenty Iron Age chariot burials have been found, {{including one of}} a woman discovered at Wetwang Slack.

Exceptions are the Ferrybridge and Newbridge chariots, which are the only ones found to have been buried intact. The Newbridge burial has been radiocarbon dated to 520–370BC, and the Ferrybridge burial is likely to be of similar date.|$|E

5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. The {{results of this}} study from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains showed that the Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> some of the crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide, 26 museums have {{significant}} holdings of dodo material, almost all {{found in the}} Mare aux Songes. The Natural History Museum, American Museum of Natural History, Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, the Senckenberg Museum, and others have almost complete skeletons, assembled from the dissociated subfossil remains of several individuals. In 2011, a wooden box containing dodo <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the Edwardian era was rediscovered at the Grant Museum at University College London during preparations for a move.

5|$|Although sauropods {{may have}} been the prey of choice for Majungasaurus, discoveries {{published}} in 2007 detail finds in Madagascar that indicate the presence of other Majungasaurus in their diet. Numerous bones of Majungasaurus have been discovered bearing tooth marks identical to those found on sauropod <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the same localities. These marks have the same spacing as teeth in Majungasaurus jaws, are of the same size as Majungasaurus teeth, and contain smaller notches consistent with the serrations on those teeth. As Majungasaurus is the only large theropod known from the area, the simplest explanation is that it was feeding on other members of its own species. Suggestions that the Triassic Coelophysis was a cannibal have been recently disproven, leaving Majungasaurus as the only non-avian theropod with confirmed cannibalistic tendencies, although {{there is some evidence that}} cannibalism may have occurred in other species as well.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Cetiosauriscus leedsi: In 1887, John Whittaker Hulke named a {{new species}} of sauropod, Ornithopsis leedsi. He {{designated}} BMNH R.1984–1988 as its type series, <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> the collections found by Alfred Nicholson Leeds. In 1905, Harry Govier Seeley made a suggestion to Arthur Smith Woodward, who took Seeley's advice and renamed O. leedsi, Cetiosaurus leedsi. Woodward also referred an additional specimen to the species, BMNH R.3078. The specimen was mounted and displayed {{for many years in}} the Dinosaur Gallery of the British Museum of Natural History (now the Natural History Museum) in London. An additional specimen, BMNH R.3706, referred to C. leedsi under the genus Cetiosaurus, includes some ribs, and may belong to a pliosaur. All referrals of C. leedsi outside of Ornithopsis are no longer accepted, and the species is thought to represent a new indeterminate brachiosaurid.|$|E
5|$|Conybeare's {{presentation}} {{followed the}} resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy {{of one of the}} fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.|$|E

5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic. This {{is in contrast to}} the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E
5|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers, however, classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature: German scholar Ernst Langlotz (1895–1978) thought that the women were holding a type of rose; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy, possibly the opium poppy, the Oriental poppy, or the Iranian poppy. Careful examination of the thick 'stems' fails to resemble that of the flowers. German scholar Eugen Petersen (1837–1919) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones (talus <b>bones</b> <b>from</b> goats or sheep used {{to play the game}} of jacks) in their left hand and roses in the right hand; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones, not flowers.|$|E
