40|$|International audienceType III {{secretion}} (T 3 S) systems {{play key}} roles in pathogenicity of many Gram-negative bacteria and are employed to inject toxins {{directly into the}} cytoplasm of target cells. They are composed of over 20 different proteins that associate into a basal structure that traverses both inner and outer bacterial membranes and a hollow, needle-like structure through which toxins travel. The PscF protein is {{the main component of}} the Pseudomonas aeruginosa T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle.</b> Here we demonstrate that PscF, when purified on its own, is able to form needle-like fibers of 8 nm in width and > 1 microm in length. In addition, we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> subunit requires two cytoplasmic partners, PscE and PscG, in P. aeruginosa, which trap PscF in a ternary, 1 : 1 : 1 complex, thus blocking it in a monomeric state. Knock-out mutants deficient in PscE and PscG are non-cytotoxic, lack PscF, and are unable to export PscF encoded extrachromosomally. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements show that the PscE-PscF-PscG complex is thermally stable and displays a cooperative unfolding/refolding pattern. Thus, PscE and PscG prevent PscF from polymerizing prematurely in the P. aeruginosa cytoplasm and keep it in a secretion prone conformation, strategies which may be shared by other pathogens that employ the T 3 S system for infection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The chlamydial {{developmental}} cycle {{involves the}} alternation between the metabolically inert elementary body (EB) and the replicating reticulate body (RB). The triggers that mediate the interchange between these particle types are unknown {{and yet this}} is crucial for understanding basic Chlamydia biology. Presentation of the hypothesis We have proposed a hypothesis to explain key chlamydial developmental events whereby RBs are replicating strictly whilst {{in contact with the}} host cell membrane-derived inclusion via type three secretion (T 3 S) injectisomes. As the inclusion expands, the contact between each RB and the inclusion membrane decreases, eventually reaching a threshold, beyond which T 3 S is inactivated upon detachment and this is the signal for RB-to-EB differentiation. Testing the hypothesis We explore this hypothesis through the development of a detailed mathematical model. The model uses knowledge and data of the biological system wherever available and simulates the chlamydial developmental cycle under the assumptions of the hypothesis in order to predict various outcomes and implications under a number of scenarios. Implications of the hypothesis We show that the concept of in vitro persistent infection is not only consistent with the hypothesis but in fact an implication of it. We show that increasing the RB radius, and/or the maximum length of T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needles</b> mediating contact between RBs and the inclusion membrane, and/or the number of inclusions per infected cell, will {{contribute to the development of}} persistent infection. The RB radius is the most important determinant of whether persistent infection would ensue, and subsequently, the magnitude of the EB yield. We determine relationships between the length of the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> and the RB radius within an inclusion, and between the RB radius and the number of inclusions per host cell to predict whether persistent infection or normal development would occur within a host cell. These results are all testable experimentally and could lead to significantly greater understanding of one of the most crucial steps in chlamydial development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most {{of us are}} {{familiar}} with Count Buffon 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Needle</b> Problem [...] {{the one in which}} a board of large size is ruled with parallel lines spaced equidistantly, and a needle is dropped randomly. This question from geometric probability involves the constant pi in the answer, the question being to find the probability that the needle touches a line.

One interesting conclusion is that the answer for an infinite number of concentric circles is the same as for the original question. For the case of N circles, however, the computations are quite involved. Naturally, one can create a simulation to approximate pi using the theoretical answer as the expected frequency of line crossings and pi as a unknown.

40|$|Translocation of {{bacterial}} toxins or effectors into host cells using the type III secretion (T 3 S) {{system is a}} conserved mechanism shared by many Gram-negative pathogens. Pseudomonas aeruginosa injects different proteins across the plasma membrane of target cells, altering the normal metabolism of the host. Protein translocation presumably occurs through a proteinaceous transmembrane pore formed by two T 3 S secreted protein translocators, PopB and PopD. Unfolded translocators are secreted through the T 3 <b>S</b> <b>needle</b> prior to insertion into the target membrane. Purified PopB and PopD form pores in model membranes. However, their tendency to form heterogeneous aggregates in solution had hampered the analysis of how these proteins undergo {{the transition from a}} denatured state to a membrane-inserted state. Translocators were purified as stable complexes with the cognate chaperone PcrH and isolated from the chaperone using 6 M urea. We report here the assembly of stable transmembrane pores by dilution of urea-denatured translocators in the presence of membranes. PopB and PopD spontaneously bound liposomes containing anionic phospholipids and cholesterol in a pH-dependent manner as observed by two independent assays, time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer and sucrose-step gradient ultracentrifugation. Using Bodipy-labeled proteins, we found that PopB interacts with PopD on the membrane surface as determined by excitation energy migration and fluorescence quenching. Stable transmembrane pores are more efficiently assembled at pH 3 ̆c 5. 0, suggesting that acidic residues might be involved in the initial membrane binding and/or insertion. Altogether, the experimental setup described here represents an efficient method for the reconstitution and analysis of membrane-inserted translocator...|$|R

Nanocrystals are synthesized using electrochemical method with the aim to have {{more control over the}} size and shape of the charge transfer salt based on the seed mediated nucleation method. AuNP seeds are prepared on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate by the electrocrystallization method. An aqueous solution of 0. 05 to 1 mM Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl 4) with 0. 1 mM (Potassium chloride) KCl as the supporting electrolyte was prepared. The electrodeposition of the AuNPs was monitored by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The results show that the most dominant factor to control the AuNP size is the HAuCl 4 concentration. Deposition time and applied potential are the other factors controlling the electrodeposition. The smallest particle size was observed with the lowest HAuCl 4 concentration. The synthesis of K 1. 75 Pt(CN) 4. 1. 5 H 2 O rods is conducted according to literature on bare HOPG with a concentration of 0. 07 M of K 2 Pt(CN) 4 in DI water and a potential pulse of 1. 5 V (vs SCE) for 0. 1 <b>s.</b> <b>Needle</b> shaped crystals with a size range of 600 nm to 5 µm in length and 100 - 500 nm in width were synthesized on the bare HOPG.

The results will help to have a better understanding of seed-mediated nucleation theory for producing nanoparticles of the desired size and shape, and also introduce a new way of manufacturing future nanosensors and nanoelectrods. Next, micro sized crystals were synthesized using the same method with longer deposition time on patterned Cr/Au electrodes. The conductivity of the KCP crystals was measured in exposure of different vapors. The results show dramatic conductivity change after introducing the vapors to the sensor, and also it shows a rapid respond and more sensitivity compare to commercial sensors.

To {{describe}} AIDS {{and malaria}} geography in Brazil, highlighting {{the role of}} injecting drug users (IDUs) in malaria outbreaks occurring in malaria-free regions, and the potential clinical and public health implications of malaria/HIV co-infection. Design. Review of the available literature and original analyses using geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques. Findings. Both HIV/AIDS and malaria distribution are currently undergo ing profound changes in Brazil, with mutual expansion to intersec ting geographical regions and social networks. Very recent reports describe the first clinical case of AIDS in a remote Amazonian ethnic group, as well as malaria cases in Rio de Janeiro state (hitherto a malaria-free area for 20 years); in addition, two outbreaks of both infections occurred {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s in the most industrialized Brazilian state (S??o Paulo), due to the sharing of <b>needle</b> <b>s</b> and syringes by drug users. Spatial data point to: (a) the expansion of HIV/AIDS towards malarigenic areas located in the centre-west and north of Brazil, along the main cocaine trafficking routes, with IDU networks apparently playing a core role; and (b) the possibility of new outbreaks of secondary malaria in urban setting s where HIV/AIDS is still expanding, through the sharing of <b>needle</b> <b>s</b> and syringes. Conclusions. New outbreaks of cases of HIV and malaria are likely to occur among Brazilian IDUs, and might conceivably contribute to the development of treatment-res istant strains of malaria in this population.

The MxiG N-terminal domain (MxiG-N) is the predominant cytoplasmic structure; however, its role in T 3 SS assembly and secretion is largely uncharacterized. We have determined the solution structure of MxiG-N residues 6 - 112 (MxiG-N(6 - 112)), representing the first published structure of this T 3 SS domain. The structure shows strong structural homology to forkhead-associated (FHA) domains. Canonically, these cell-signaling modules bind phosphothreonine (Thr(P)) via highly conserved residues. However, the putative phosphate-binding pocket of MxiG-N(6 - 112) does not align with other FHA domain structures or interact with Thr(P). Furthermore, mutagenesis of potential phosphate-binding residues {{has no effect on}} S. flexneri T 3 SS assembly and function. Therefore, MxiG-N has a novel function for an FHA domain.
