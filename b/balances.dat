5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble <b>balances</b> {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble <b>balances</b> and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards {{down the hall to the}} Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble <b>balances</b> between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble <b>balances</b> initially operating in the world.|$|E

5000|$|In some situations, {{terms on}} either side of the global <b>balance</b> {{equations}} cancel. The global <b>balance</b> equations can then be partitioned to give a set of local <b>balance</b> equations (also known as partial <b>balance</b> equations, independent <b>balance</b> equations or individual <b>balance</b> equations). These <b>balance</b> equations were first considered by Peter Whittle. The resulting equations are somewhere between detailed <b>balance</b> and global <b>balance</b> equations. Any solution [...] to the local <b>balance</b> equations is always a solution to the global <b>balance</b> equations (we can recover the global <b>balance</b> equations by summing the relevant local <b>balance</b> equations), but the converse is not always true. Often, constructing local <b>balance</b> equations is equivalent to removing the outer summations in the global <b>balance</b> equations for certain terms.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} checks and <b>balances</b> {{built into the}} state {{constitution}} that limit {{the power of the}} General Assembly. Other clauses allow the General Assembly to balance and limit the authority of the other branches of the government. Among these checks and <b>balances</b> is the governor's authority to veto any bill passed by the General Assembly. The General Assembly may in turn override his veto by simple majority vote in both houses. Bills passed by a super majority automatically become law without requiring the signature of the governor. Once the bill is made law, it can be challenged in the state courts which may rule the law to be unconstitutional, effectively repealing the law. The General Assembly could then override the court's decision by amending the state constitution to include the law. The General Assembly has historically been the most powerful branch of the state government, dominating a weak governor's office. Although the governor has gained more power in the past fifty years, the General Assembly still retains the power to remove much of that authority.|$|E

40|$|The graph-related symmetries of a {{reaction}} network {{give rise to}} certain special equilibria (such as complex <b>balanced</b> equilibria) in deterministic models of dynamics of the reaction network. Correspondingly, in the stochastic setting, when modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain, these symmetries give rise to certain special stationary measures. Previous work by Anderson, Craciun and Kurtz identified stationary distributions of a complex <b>balanced</b> network; later Cappelletti and Wiuf developed the notion of complex <b>balancing</b> for stochastic systems. We define and establish the relations between reaction <b>balanced</b> measure, complex <b>balanced</b> measure, reaction vector <b>balanced</b> measure, and cycle <b>balanced</b> measure and prove that with mild additional hypotheses, the former two are stationary distributions. Furthermore, in spirit of earlier work by Joshi, we give sufficient conditions under which detailed <b>balance</b> of the stationary distribution of Markov chain models implies the existence of positive detailed <b>balance</b> equilibria for the related deterministic reaction network model. Finally, we provide a complete map of the implications between <b>balancing</b> properties of deterministic and corresponding stochastic reaction systems, such as complex <b>balance,</b> reaction <b>balance,</b> reaction vector <b>balance</b> and cycle <b>balance...</b>|$|R
5|$|According to the classicist J. C. Stobart, Tiberius's Greek {{education}} had {{caused him to}} overestimate {{the reliability of the}} people as a powerbase, causing him to overplay his hand. In Rome, even when led by a bold Tribune the people lacked anywhere near the influence they enjoyed {{at the height of the}} Athenian polis. Another problem for Gaius's aims was that the Roman constitution, specifically the Tribal Assembly, was designed to prevent any one individual governing for a sustained period of time – and there were several other checks and <b>balances</b> to prevent power being concentrated on any one person. Stobart adds that another reason for the efforts' failures was the Gracchi's idealism; they were deaf to the baser notes of human nature and failed to recognize how corrupt and selfish all sections of Roman society had become.|$|E
