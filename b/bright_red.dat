5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known for wearing a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president {{when he and}} James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{were the}} first {{elements}} to be discovered using the spectroscope, invented in 1859 by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff. The next year, they discovered caesium in the mineral water from Bad Dürkheim, Germany. Their discovery of rubidium came the following year in Heidelberg, Germany, finding it in the mineral lepidolite. The names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra: a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> line for rubidium (from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red or <b>bright</b> <b>red),</b> and a sky-blue line for caesium (derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue).|$|E

5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E

The dorsal parts of the abdomen are brown, and there are two brown saddles on the dorsal carapace.|$|E
5|$|Australian robins are a {{group of}} small insectivorous birds, whose exact {{position}} in the bird family tree is unclear. Named after a superficial resemblance to the European robin, the males of many species sport <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> or pink on their plumage. Four species are found in Tasmania, of which one is endemic.|$|E
5|$|Like the French, the German air {{services}} used {{a variety}} of disruptive camouflage patterns until April 1917, when lozenge camouflage was introduced; it used up to five colors. German aircraft were however sometimes painted in deliberately conspicuous colors, like the <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> of Manfred von Richthofen's Albatros D.III, advertising the pilot's prowess to intimidate the enemy.|$|E

She marries Prince Eric, whom she rescued from a shipwreck, and together they have a daughter, Melody.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) {{was brought}} to Southern Florida as an {{ornamental}} shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after hurricanes and has invaded pineland forests. Following Hurricane Andrew, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees {{would be able to}} return to their natural state.|$|E

5|$|Many {{pictures}} {{depict the}} countryside at Wiedensahl and Lüthorst. They include pollarded willows, cottages in cornfields, cowherds, autumn landscapes and meadows with streams. A particular {{feature is the}} use of red jackets, found in about 280 of 1000 Busch paintings and drawings. The muted or <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> coats are worn usually by a small figure, depicted from behind. The paintings generally represent typical villages. Portraits of the Kesslers, and a series of other portraits depicting Lina Weissenborn in the mid-1870s, are exceptions. A painting of a 10-year-old girl from a Jewish family at Lüthorst portrays her as serious, and having dark, oriental features.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn <b>bright</b> <b>red.</b> Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) turns the flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> room with red candles and candelabra. While the spiritual and pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve present bright star calibration, data were {{gathered}} for the <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> and blue stars and the Cepheids in the Im V dwarf galaxy, Sextans A. On {{the basis of a}} magnitude sequence measured to V and B values of about 22 and 23, respectively, the mean magnitudes of the three brightest blue stars are V= 17. 98 and B= 17. 88. The three <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> supergiants have V= 18. 09 and B= 20. 14. The periods and magnitudes measured for five Cepheids yield an apparent blue distance modulus of 25. 67 + or - 0. 2, via the P-L relation, and the mean absolute magnitudes of V=- 7. 56 and B=- 5. 53 for the red supergiants provide additional calibration of the <b>brightest</b> <b>red</b> stars as distance indicators. If Sextans A were placed at the distance of the Virgo cluster, it would appear to have a surface brightness of 23. 5 mag/sq arcec. This, together with the large angular diameter, would make such a galaxy easily discoverable in the Virgo cluster by means of ground-based surveys...|$|R

5|$|The {{king vulture}} has, {{relative}} to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip {{and a sharp}} cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The irises of its eyes are white and bordered by <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> sclera. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching her upper arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a <b>bright</b> <b>red</b> mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E
