2500|$|Aluminum {{electrolytic}} capacitors with non-solid electrolytes have an exceptional position among electronic components because {{they work with}} an electrolyte as liquid ingredient. The liquid electrolyte determines the time-dependent behavior of {{electrolytic capacitors}}. They age over time as the electrolyte evaporates. This also implies {{that there is a}} sharp decline in useful lifespan with increasing temperature. As a rule of thumb, every 10 degrees rise halves the useful life span. This very slow drying-out of the electrolyte depends on the series construction, ambient temperature, voltage and ripple current load. Lowering the electrolyte over time influences the capacitance, impedance and ESR of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and impedance and ESR increases with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. The leakage current decreases because all weaknesses are healed after the long forming time. In contrast to electrolytic capacitors with solid electrolytes, [...] "wet" [...] electrolytic capacitors have an [...] "end of life" [...] when the components reach specified maximum changes of capacitance, impedance or ESR. The time period to the [...] "end of life" [...] is called the [...] "lifetime", [...] "useful life", [...] "load life" [...] or [...] "service life". It represents the time of constant failure rate in the failure rate <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E
50|$|While the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> is useful, {{not every}} product or system follows a <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> hazard function, {{for example if}} units are retired or have {{decreased}} use during or {{before the onset of}} the wear-out period, they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E

40|$|Reliability {{engineers}} {{generally have}} to deal with systems that consist of some components in series and others in parallel. Reliability of a series system can be calculated by multiplying the reliability of individual elements in that system. Failure rate of many deteriorating systems shows a <b>bathtub</b> shape <b>curve.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} find the average total cost of a series system, from a manufacturer’s point of view, during the first two phases of its life; considering optimality issues for burn-in and warranty periods.

30|$|In {{reliability}} analysis, {{hazard rate}} plays an indispensable role to characterize life phenomena. Technically, failure or hazard rate represents the propensity of a device of age t to fail {{in the small}} interval of time t to t + dt. The parametric models, such as gamma, Weibull, and truncated normal distributions, which are commonly used lifetime distributions display monotone failure rates. However, many physical phenomena exhibit failure rates which are non-monotonic. For example, the failure pattern of many mechanical and electronic components comprise of three stages: initial stage (or burn-in) where failure is high {{at the beginning of}} the product life cycle due to design and manufacturing problems, and decreases towards a constant level, the middle stage with an approximately constant failure rate, which is followed by a final stage (or wear-out phase), from where the failure rate starts to increase. Such failure rates are usually termed as bathtub (BT) or U shaped. The aforementioned models which allow only monotone failure rates are unable to produce <b>bathtub</b> <b>curves</b> and thus cannot adequately interpret data with this character. Bathtub models are possibly more realistic models than monotone failure rate models. Several models have been proposed one by one to model the real data with bathtub-shaped failure rate since 1980 s (see Aarset 1987; Xie et al. 2002; Gupta et al. 2008 for detailed discussion). There are number of papers discussing several flexible distributions with more than two parameters, which can accommodate increasing, decreasing, unimodal and bathtub-shaped hazard functions (see, for examples Mudholkar et al. 1996; Pham and Lai 2007; Carrasco et al. 2008). Nevertheless, from the practical point of view, it is always important to consider parsimonious models with as few parameters as possible.|$|R
50|$|Bathtub Plot - The <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> {{can provide}} {{tremendous}} {{insight into the}} BER performance of a link under test. A <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> is obtained by drawing a horizontal line across the waveform under test. The probability distribution function for signal transitions (zero crossings) from a high voltage to a low voltage or a low voltage to a high voltage is then computed. The <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> is useful because it can provide a lot of insight into {{the behavior of a}} system. Apart from estimating BER, it also provides an indication for the amount of margin that is in the system. When coupled with protocol testing with the Jitterlyzer, a high margin enables engineers to quickly rule out the physical layer as a potential cause of certain protocol errors.|$|E

Given a data set, the maximum likelihood estimators of the initial distribution and the infinitesimal transition rates of the Markov chain {{can be obtained by}} our novel algorithm. Suppose that there are m transient states in the system and that there are n failure time data.

Their main {{advantage over the}} single hazard models, such as the Weibull and the log-logistic models, is to include {{a large amount of}} nonmonotone hazard shapes, as <b>bathtub</b> and multimodal <b>curves.</b> Some influence methods, such as the local influence and total local influence of an individual are derived, analyzed and discussed. A discussion of the computation of the likelihood displacement as well as the normal curvature in the local influence method are presented.

30|$|An {{interesting}} two-parameter lifetime model {{capable of}} producing increasing as well as <b>bathtub</b> hazard <b>curve</b> is exponential power-distribution introduced by Smith and Bain (1975). This model has been discussed by several authors {{not only in the}} context of reliability literature (for examples, Rajarshi and Rajarshi 1988 and Leemis 1986) but also within asymmetric distributions; see, for example, Delicado and Goria (2008). This model may be useful in certain cases where the product may be quite reliable and possibly even improve for some period of time, and then fail rather quickly after it begins to wear-out. A notable amount of work has been done on this model from the frequentists perspective. For example, Smith and Bain (1975) considered least squares-type estimators for the model parameters and performed Monte Carlo simulation to obtain their distributions in order to get inference results for the reliability. Koh and Leemis (1989) developed statistical procedures for maximum likelihood and least squares estimation of the parameters for the complete as well as Type-II censored data. Chen (1999) proposed an exact statistical test for the shape parameter of the model and found an exact confidence interval for the same parameter. Srivastava and Kumar (2011) presented the exponential power distribution as a software reliability model and carried out the Bayesian analysis in OpenBUGS using informative priors (gamma priors) for the parameters but didn’t consider censoring mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, regression modeling of the exponential power distribution has not yet been discussed. This article analyzes the model in the Bayesian framework assuming weakly-informative priors for the model parameters for both the complete and censored reliability data. A distinguishing feature of this paper is that the whole analysis is done in R (R Core Team 2015) and codes developed are well illustrated. Both the analytic and simulation-based Bayesian studies are conducted.|$|R
50|$|In less {{technical}} terms, in {{the early}} life of a product adhering to the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve,</b> the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted. In the mid-life of a product—generally, once it reaches consumers—the failure rate is low and constant. In the late life of the product, the failure rate increases, as age and wear take their toll on the product. Many consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|E

40|$|As {{technologies}} continue advancing, {{semiconductor devices}} with dimensions in nanometers have entered all spheres of human life. This research deals {{with both the}} statistical aspect of reliability and some electrical aspect of reliability characterization. As an example of nano devices, TaO x -based high k dielectric thin &# 64257;lms are studied on the failure mode identi&# 64257;cation, accelerated life testing, lifetime projection, and failure rate estimation. Experiment and analysis on dielectric relaxation and transient current show that the relaxation current of high k dielectrics is distinctive to the trapping/detrapping current of SiO 2; high k &# 64257;lms have a lower leakage current but a higher relaxation current than SiO 2. Based on the connection between polarization-relaxation and &# 64257;lm integrity demonstrated in ramped voltage stress tests, a new method of breakdown detection is proposed. It monitors relaxation during the test, and uses the disappearing of relaxation current as the signal of a breakdown event. This research develops a Bayesian approach which is suitable to reliability estimation and prediction of current and future generations of nano devices. It combines the Weibull lifetime distribution with the empirical acceleration relationship, and put the model parameters into a hierarchical Bayesian structure. The value of the Bayesian approach lies in that it can fully utilize available information in modeling uncertainty and provide cogent prediction with limited resources in a reasonable period of time. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation is used for posterior inference of the reliability projection and for sensitivity analysis over a variety of vague priors. Time-to-breakdown data collected in the accelerated life tests also are modeled with a <b>bathtub</b> failure rate <b>curve.</b> The decreasing failure rate is estimated with a non-parametric Bayesian approach, and the constant failure rate is estimated with a regular parametric Bayesian approach. This method can provide a fast and reliable estimation of failure rate for burn-in optimization when only {{a small sample of}} data is available...|$|R

50|$|The {{intention}} is to detect those particular components that would fail {{as a result of}} the initial, high-failure rate portion of the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> of component reliability. If the burn-in period is made sufficiently long (and, perhaps, artificially stressful), the system can then be trusted to be mostly free of further early failures once the burn-in process is complete.|$|E
50|$|Failures most {{commonly}} occur {{near the beginning}} and near {{the ending of the}} lifetime of the parts, resulting in the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> graph of failure rates.

5000|$|The hazard {{function}} must be non-negative, λ(t) ≥ 0, and its integral over [...] must be infinite, but is {{not otherwise}} constrained; it may be increasing or decreasing, non-monotonic, or discontinuous.An example is the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> hazard function, which is large for small values of t, decreasing to some minimum, and thereafter increasing again; this can model the property of some mechanical systems to either fail soon after operation, or much later, as the system ages.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} model for item {{lifetime}} is the <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve,</b> {{a plot of}} the varying failure rate {{as a function of}} time.

As the time increases further, the curve reaches a period of increasing failures, modeling the product's wearout phase.|$|E

5000|$|The Lindy {{effect is}} a concept that the future life {{expectancy}} of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.

In contrast, living creatures and mechanical things follow a <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> where, after [...] "childhood", the mortality rate increases with time. Because life expectancy is probabilistically derived, a thing may become extinct before its [...] "expected" [...] survival.

50|$|The {{reliability}} of a component is a property that indicates how reliably this component performs its {{function in a}} time interval.

Reliability normally is shown as a <b>bathtub</b> <b>curve</b> and {{is divided into three}} areas: early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failures totalized in a failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters).
