5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply unpacked their <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E

5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E

5|$|For the German part, the High Seas Fleet {{determined}} not to engage the British without the assistance of submarines, and since submarines were more needed for commerce raiding, the fleet stayed in port {{for much of the}} remainder of the war.

5|$|In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, {{head of the}} Flanders Flotilla, used UB-6 to test {{a theory}} that British {{defenses}} in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, UB-6 departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. UB-6 sailed past Dunkirk {{on the surface and}} made Boulogne in the early morning of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. UB-6 immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I <b>boats,</b> , , <b>and</b> , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather and fog hampered the <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> none had any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these forays into the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.|$|E
5|$|In western Grenada, high waves {{affected}} {{much of the}} coastline, destroying 21small <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> causing significant beach erosion. The waves {{covered the}} entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened {{the foundation of the}} runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage. In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the water and power supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6million; this represented 27percent of the island's gross domestic product. Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.|$|E
