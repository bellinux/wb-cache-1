40|$|Abstract: Academic {{critics of}} {{economic}} forecasters, including Robert Lucas, generally base their criticisms on the methodological {{shortcomings of the}} techniques used by <b>business</b> <b>economists.</b> In truth, these apparent problems represent profound wisdom {{about the nature of}} economic knowledge that is recognized by <b>business</b> <b>economists</b> and the users of their services. Addfactors and the use of judgment allow forecasters to simulate the actual mapping from non-quantitative space to quantitative space that actual economic actors undertake. This allows forecasters to tell plausible stories that are consistent with both economic theory and the entire information set available to forecast users...|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we explore}} whether and if so, {{to what extent}} {{variations}} in the internal parameters change the Handelsblatt life’s work ranking {{as well as the}} Handelsblatt recent research performance ranking of <b>business</b> <b>economists.</b> We begin by attempting to reconstruct both rankings on the basis of our dataset by calculating and sorting the scores according to the approach described above. In line with the approach of Handelsblatt, we placed researchers with identical scores at the same rank. We then compare our results with the top 250 life’s work ranking of <b>business</b> <b>economists</b> and with the top 100 recent research performance ranking of <b>business</b> <b>economists,</b> respectively, that were published by Handelsblatt in 2012. Differences between our reconstruction and published version of the rankings arise only when a researcher refused to be ranked and named in the public rankings. At the time of publication of the ranking, the number of boycotters was 339; most of them are lower-ranked. For the purpose of our study, we include all boycotters in the data. Next, we modify the underlying score calculation in a consistent way and analyze the resulting effect on the (ordinal) ranks, (cardinal) scores and the composition of the top performing groups of researchers. More precisely, we provide the following robustness measures for each parameter variation.|$|R
