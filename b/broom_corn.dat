50|$|Flat brooms, made of <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> {{were invented}} by Shakers in the 19th century with the {{invention}} of the broom vice.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, in {{her early}} 20s, she {{received}} 5,000 acre from her father and grew <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> sunflowers, zinnias, chili peppers, ground cherries.|$|E
50|$|Artificial brooms {{made from}} {{man-made}} fabrics, rather than corn, {{such as the}} Rink Rat, also became common later during this time period. Prior to the late sixties, Scottish curling brushes were used primarily {{by some of the}} Scots, as well as by recreational and elderly curlers as a substitute for <b>corn</b> <b>brooms,</b> since the technique was easier to learn. In the late sixties, competitive curlers from Calgary, Alberta, such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by Paul Gowsell, proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to <b>corn</b> <b>broom</b> use. During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which sweeping device was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional <b>corn</b> <b>brooms</b> at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a <b>corn</b> <b>broom</b> on a regular basis.|$|R
5000|$|McRorie {{is known}} for her {{distinctive}} [...] "Manitoba tuck" [...] delivery while using a <b>corn</b> <b>broom</b> while delivering the rock.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture is {{the most}} {{important}} economic activity based on the production of field crops (wheat, <b>corn,</b> <b>broom</b> weed, sugar beet, hop), cattle, breeding dud ponetry and vegetable crops. Besides agriculture there is also some industry manufacture, metal and chemical. Manufacture of wood civil engineering, printing activities, etc.|$|R
50|$|Shaker brooms {{built upon}} the 1797 {{contribution}} of Levi Dickenson of Hadley, Massachusetts who used tassels of sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), known as <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> {{to make a}} better grade of broom. Brooms were essential to kitchen and hearth cleanliness. The manufacture and selling of brooms was the most widespread of all the Shaker industries. The first sorghum brooms were made by the Shakers at Watervliet. This colony is credited with being the first to grow <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> which was around 1800 when they first grew it on an island in the Mohawk River that was near their community.|$|E
50|$|One source {{mentions}} that the United States had 303 broom factories by 1839 {{and that the}} number peaked at 1,039 in 1919. Most of these were in the Eastern United States; during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the number of factories declined to 320 in 1939. The state of Oklahoma became a major center for broom production because <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> grew especially well there, with The Oklahoma <b>Broom</b> <b>Corn</b> Company opening a factory in El Reno in 1906. Faced with competition from imported brooms and synthetic bristles, most of the factories closed by the 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The broommaker uses <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> {{imported}} from {{south of the}} border, to produce brooms for the local market. By the mid-19th century corn brooms had become popular because they were superior to those made from twigs, splints or corn husks.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 1950s, most curling brooms {{were made}} of corn strands and were similar to {{household}} brooms of the day. In 1958, Fern Marchessault of Montreal inverted the corn straw in {{the centre of the}} broom. This style of <b>corn</b> <b>broom</b> was referred to as the Blackjack.|$|R
5000|$|Gowsell's {{teams were}} also {{credited}} with popularizing {{the use of}} the [...] "pushbroom" [...] in the sport. His teams revolutionized sweeping techniques in the sport, taking advantage of the chaff left on the ice by most of their competitors who had been using the [...] "Blackjack" [...] style of <b>corn</b> <b>brooms</b> prior to the Gowsell successes at the championship levels.|$|R
50|$|The {{species can}} be used as a source for making ethanol fuel, and in some environments may be better than maize or sugarcane, as it can grow under harsher conditions. It {{typically}} has protein levels of around 9%, enabling dependent human populations to subsist on it in times of famine, in contrast to regions where maize has become the staple crop. It is also used for making a traditional <b>corn</b> <b>broom.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Arcola is {{somewhat}} {{famous for the}} Lawn Rangers, a [...] "precision lawn mower drill team" [...] that marches in formation with brooms and lawn mowers while wearing cowboy hats. Every year since 1980, the Lawn Rangers have marched in the Arcola <b>Broom</b> <b>Corn</b> Festival Parade. The event, held the weekend after Labor Day, honors Arcola's position in the late 19th century as a center of <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> production. The Lawn Rangers were so named because the Grand Marshal of the Parade in 1980 was Clayton Moore, famous as the Lone Ranger, and they were named in his honor. This unique custom was publicized by humor columnist Dave Barry, who marched with the Lawn Rangers in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{has been}} the {{mainstay}} of the local economy since its founding. The main crops were cotton, corn, wheat, alfalfa, <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> and kaffir corn. Poultry and livestock production have also been important. By 1960, Caddo County ranked first in Oklahoma for producing of peanuts, hogs and poultry.|$|E
50|$|In 1886, a T. Hardenburgh {{established}} a broom factory in Bradfordville. Hardenburgh planted 5 acre of <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> while Col. John R. Bradford planted 8 acre and another farmer planted 1 acre. The 14 acre combined supplied the factory with enough material {{to keep it}} in operation for a year.|$|E
40|$|In 1833 William Clarke, the {{collector}} of customs at Niagara, completed and signed four forms {{for the movement}} of goods between Niagara and York, and Niagara and Brantford. The forms were issued to the firm of Lewis & Gray, James Armstrong, J. A. Wilks, and William Blackely. The goods being transported included scythes, <b>corn</b> <b>brooms,</b> hide whips, sacks, snuff, shovels, spades and two apple trees. 4 completed forms; 16 x 20 c...|$|R
2500|$|Players hit a small {{ball around}} the ice {{with a stick}} called a [...] "broom." [...] The broom may have a wooden or {{aluminum}} shaft and has a rubber-molded triangular head similar in shape {{to that of a}} regular broom (or, originally, an actual <b>corn</b> <b>broom</b> with the bristles either cut off or covered with tape). Players wear special rubber-soled shoes instead of skates, and the ice is prepared {{in such a way that}} it is smooth and dry to improve traction.|$|R
50|$|When peace returned, Camden grew rapidly. The Megunticook River {{provided}} excellent {{water power}} sites for mills. In addition to sawmills and gristmills, by 1858 {{the town had}} carriage factories, sash and blind factories and blacksmith shops. There were six shipyards, launching ten to twelve vessels annually. By 1886, the town also made foundry products, railroad cars, woolens and paper mill feltings, anchors, wedges, plugs and treenails, planking, powder kegs, excelsior, mattresses, powder, tinware, oakum, wool rools, boots and shoes, leather, flour and meal, <b>corn</b> <b>brooms</b> and barrels. Camden was second only to nearby Rockland in the lucrative manufacture of lime, excavated at quarries and processed in kilns before being shipped to various ports around the United States until 1891, when Rockport was set off as a separate town. As the 19th century came to an end, Camden {{was very much a}} shipbuilding town with the H.M. Bean Yard launching the largest four-masted schooner Charlotte A. Maxwell and the first six-master ever built-the George W. Wells.|$|R
50|$|The 16-room Italianate {{house was}} built in 1888 by Hans Hanson, {{one of the founders}} of Town of Marquette who helped {{organize}} the Fremont Lutheran Church (1869), the first church in the Smoky Valley, and the Elim Lutheran Church in Marquette (1878). Hanson was also an early promoter and grower of <b>broom</b> <b>corn.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Pleasant Hill Shakers raised <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> {{and made}} flat brooms {{so good that}} they sold for more than [...] "ordinary" [...] brooms. They also raised fruit and sold it dried or as {{preserves}} (more than ten tons of preserves in one year). Like many other Shaker communities, they raised and sold garden seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Quote from Damian Rogers, Colour It Beautiful, Eye Weekly September 20, 2007. “Those {{familiar}} with Vivian Reiss' fluid, colourful and exuberant paintings could pick her house {{out of a}} lineup in a heartbeat, with its sprawling, exotic-looking vegetable garden - featuring stalks of burgundy <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> that tower several feet above the heads of passersby - and custom flower-stem porch railings.” http://www.eyeweekly.com/style/myplace/article/1434 ...|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 1980 by a {{group of}} men from Arcola, Illinois, the Lawn Rangers are not the first of their kind. Two of the men, Pat Monahan and John O'Halloran, decided that they wanted to be in their {{hometown}} parade, the annual <b>Broom</b> <b>Corn</b> Festival parade, so they started to think about what skills they possessed. After deciding that they didn't have any, their wives told them that the only common skill they had was for mowing the lawn. Since Pat Monahan was part owner of the Thomas Monahan Broom Company, they decided to push lawn mowers and toss brooms in the parade. They still needed a name for what they were doing. Fortunately, Clayton Moore, the original Lone Ranger, was the Grand Marshal of that year's <b>Broom</b> <b>Corn</b> Parade. It was destiny that they became the World Famous [...] "Lawn Rangers". Over the years the Lawn Rangers have lived life by their motto: You're only young once, but you can always be immature.|$|E
5000|$|Sorghum is well {{adapted to}} growth in hot, arid or {{semiarid}} areas. The many subspecies {{are divided into}} four groups — grain sorghums (such as milo), grass sorghums (for pasture and hay), sweet sorghums (formerly called [...] "Guinea corn", used to produce sorghum syrups), and <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> (for brooms and brushes). The name [...] "sweet sorghum" [...] is used to identify varieties of S. bicolor that are sweet and juicy.|$|E
50|$|DeForest was a farmer, and {{specialized}} {{in the production}} of <b>broom</b> <b>corn.</b> He was also successful businessman, with interests including real estate, which made him the city's largest landlord. He was also a building contractor, with his company constructing more than 1,000 homes in the Schenectady area. In addition, he was active in banking as a board of directors member for the Citizens' Trust Companies. After the advent of the automobile, DeForest owned a Pierce dealership in Schenectady.|$|E
50|$|The European corn worm or European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis), {{also known}} as the European high-flyer, is a pest of grain, {{particularly}} maize. The insect is native to Europe, originally infesting varieties of millet, including <b>broom</b> <b>corn.</b> The European corn borer was first reported in North America in 1917 in Massachusetts, but was probably introduced from Europe several years earlier. Since its initial discovery in the Americas, the insect has spread into Canada and westward across the United States to the Rocky Mountains.|$|E
50|$|By 1911, 5,000 acres {{was under}} {{cultivation}} in East McAllen with produce consisting of cotton, alfalfa, <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> citrus fruits, grapes, and figs. East McAllen had an estimated population of 1,000 that year, and West McAllen {{had ceased to}} exist. In 1911 the town applied for and was issued a charter of incorporation under the name McAllen. In 1916, 20,000 New York state troops were stationed at McAllen to help quell border disturbances. The resulting economic boom increased the population from 1,200 in 1916, to 6,000 in 1920.|$|E
50|$|Contemporary marblers {{employ a}} variety of modern materials, some in place of or in {{combination}} with the more traditional ones. A wide variety of colors are used today in place of the historic pigment colors. Plastic broom straw can be used instead of <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> as well as bamboo sticks, plastic pipettes, and eye droppers to drop the colors {{on the surface of the}} size. Ox gall is still commonly used as a surfactant for watercolors and gouache, but synthetic surfactants are used in conjunction with acrylic, PVA, and oil-based paints.|$|E
50|$|Shakers won {{respect and}} admiration for their {{productive}} farms and orderly communities. Their industry brought about many inventions like Babbitt metal, the rotary harrow, the circular saw, the clothespin, the Shaker peg, the flat broom, the wheel-driven washing machine, a machine for setting teeth in textile cards, a threshing machine, metal pens, {{a new type}} of fire engine, a machine for matching boards, numerous innovations in waterworks, planing machinery, a hernia truss, silk reeling machinery, small looms for weaving palm leaf, machines for processing <b>broom</b> <b>corn,</b> ball-and-socket tilters for chair legs, {{and a number of other}} useful inventions.|$|E
5000|$|Each village also {{produced}} market goods for outside sale. The Watervliet Shakers had a tannery, produced brooms {{for sale in}} volume, and had a small industry manufacturing brass, steel and silver writing pens, but they are most noted in business history as having been among the first producers of garden seeds as a commercial product in the United States and the first Shaker community to have produced and sold seeds. [...] It has been claimed that {{a member of this}} community, Theodore Bates, invented the flat broom, older brooms having been fashioned as round bundles of <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> straw or twigs.|$|E
5000|$|Illustrations on [...] {{show that}} there are two sets of jaws affixed to the planks. The lower set are level with the top of the planks and are {{circular}} when closed to firmly grip the head of the broom. Metal plates rising from the planks carry the upper set which are flat and force the <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> flat. The jaws are closed by a toggle mechanism operating on horizontal links from the fixed jaw and vertical hanger links from the floor. The toggle is provided with a long wooden handle which the operator can pull down to secure the broom in the vise.|$|E
50|$|G. Kerndt and Brothers Elevator and Warehouses, No. 11, No.12 and No. 13 is a {{historic}} building located in Lansing, Iowa, United States. The four Kerndt brothers were all German immigrants who settled in the Lansing area by 1854. Gustav, William and Mortiz established a broom factory and cigar business in town while Herman farmed and provided the <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> for the factory. A fifth brother, Julian, died shortly after arriving in Iowa. They built their first grain warehouse in the late 1850s. In 1861 they began their general store, which would in time include private banking {{as a part of}} their mercantile business. In 1908 it was incorporated by the family as the Kerndt Brothers Savings Bank.|$|E
50|$|In the size-based method, colors {{made from}} {{pigments}} {{are mixed with}} a surfactant such as ox gall. Sometimes, oil or turpentine may be added to a color, to achieve special effects. The colors are then spattered or dropped onto the size, one color after another, {{until there is a}} dense pattern of several colors. Straw from the <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> was used to make a kind of whisk for sprinkling the paint, or horsehair to create a kind of drop-brush. Each successive layer of pigment spreads slightly less than the last, and the colors may require additional surfactant to float and uniformly expand. Once the colors are laid down, various tools and implements such as rakes, combs and styluses are often used in a series of movements to create more intricate designs.|$|E
50|$|He then {{returned}} to New York to attend Cherry Valley Seminary. Before graduating, he moved to Glenville, New York to operate a mill. Ellwood {{became interested in the}} cultivation of <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> and ran a successful broom business, employing 130 men. He married Eleanor Vedder in 1849; they had six children. He {{was a member of the}} New York State Assembly (Schenectady Co.) in 1851 as a Whig. Ellwood was named a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention, the party that he would identify with for the rest of his life. He returned to Sycamore in 1857, engaging in the hardware trade, particularly farm machinery. He invested in local farm implement manufacturers and became one of the wealthiest men in the county. Ellwood continued his political aspirations as U.S. Assessor for the 4th Congressional District of Illinois the first mayor of Sycamore.|$|E

50|$|The Starr Hotel is a {{historic}} hotel building located at 1913-1923 Western Avenue in Mattoon, Illinois. Businessman George M. Custer built the hotel in 1888. The hotel primarily housed workers on Mattoon's three railroads: the Illinois Central, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis (Big Four), and the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville. Mattoon's economy was primarily based on railroad traffic; the city expanded greatly after the Illinois Central and Big Four opened in the 1850s, its railroad yards employed hundreds of workers, and multiple industries grew in Mattoon due to its railroad access. While the hotel mainly housed railroad workers, it also catered to other working-class groups, such as seasonal <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> workers and hobos. The hotel became a boarding house in the 1920s, and its upper floors closed entirely in the 1960s; its first floor is still a commercial property. The building {{is one of two}} surviving working-class hotels in Mattoon.|$|E
5000|$|Sturgeon {{was laid}} out in 1856 very near to and {{eventually}} including the town of Prairie City. The town was incorporated in 1859 with Housen Canada as the first mayor and rechartered in 1875. It was named for Isaac H. Sturgeon, superintendent of the North Missouri Railroad. Colonel W. F. Switzler speculated that the depot was considered in Sturgeon because it bore {{the name of the}} railroad magnate, but six citizens who paid six thousand dollars finalized the deal. The first school-house was built in 1857, and in 1882 the white and colored schools had 301 students with an average daily attendance of 187. The first church, built in 1859, was the Methodist Episcopal Church South, with the Masonic lodge located above. The first early industry in Sturgeon was the broom factory, established in 1878, of S. A. Fretwell. The brooms were made of <b>broom</b> <b>corn</b> grown in the area, and brushes made of imported jute. In 1882, the factory turned out about 360 brooms daily ...|$|E
