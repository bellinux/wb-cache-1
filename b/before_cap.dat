A {{decrease in the}} n-layer sheet resistance, with a consequent increase in was detected after complete removal of the p-layer, due {{to a reduction in}} the n-layer depletion region. An increase in RF-dispersion was experienced, {{as a result of the}} progressive reduction of screening from surface-states originally provided by the overlying p-cap layer. No dispersion was detected <b>before</b> <b>cap</b> removal. A continuous increase in and was detected even before complete removal of the p-layer, due to virtual gate length reduction. It is expected that an optimized p-doped overlayer will provide current slump suppression without degradation in cutoff frequency or breakdown. Index Terms—GaN, JFET, passivation, RF-dispersion.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the conditions during growth of InAs/GaAs quantum-dot structures on GaAs(001) by molecular-beam epitaxy was investigated systematically with respect to achieving quantum-dot photoluminescence in the 1 eV range. The growth temperature, As flux, growth rate, InAs deposit, and growth interruption time <b>before</b> <b>cap</b> layer growth were varied. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to study the optical and structural properties. Large InAs quantum dots with photoluminescence in the 1 eV range were obtained at a low growth rate of 0. 0056 ML/s. Analyzing in particular the low-growth-rate regime, we found that an InAs deposition of at least 2. 4 ML and {{a growth temperature of}} 500 - 510 °C were crucial to obtain large quantum dots with a high size uniformity. Composition analyses by transmission electron microscopy revealed a significantly higher In concentration in the quantum dots grown at low growth rate compared to high-growth -rate samples...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) -induced radicals on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is overexpressed by oral squamous cell carcinoma, to determine the underlying mechanism of selective killing. CAP-induced highly reactive radicals were observed in both plasma plume and cell culture media. The selective killing effect was observed in oral squamous cell carcinoma compared with normal human gingival fibroblast. Degradation and dysfunction of EGFRs were observed only in the EGFR-overexpressing oral squamous cell carcinoma and not in the normal cell. Nitric oxide scavenger pretreatment in cell culture media <b>before</b> <b>CAP</b> treatment rescued above degradation and dysfunction of the EGFR as well as the killing effect in oral squamous cell carcinoma. CAP may be a promising cancer treatment method by inducing EGFR dysfunction in EGFR-overexpressing oral squamous cell carcinoma via nitric oxide radicals...|$|E

40|$|As part of {{the work}} towards a {{remediation}} plan for the Grenlandfjord area, thin cap test fields were established at 30 and 100 m depth in the outer Grenlandfjord in September 2009. One field was treated with crushed limestone, one field was treated with clay dredged from a nearby location and two fields were treated with a mixture of dredged clay and activated carbon (AC). The test fields and appropriate reference locations were surveyed with a sediment profile camera (SPI) every spring and autumn from May 2009 to May 2011. The benthic habitat quality index (BHQ) determined from picture analyses showed good conditions at all fields <b>before</b> <b>cap</b> placement and a change to less good at both fields treated with AC {{by the end of the}} investigation period. Full macrofaunal analyses were performed in October 2009 and November 2011 and characterized in accordance with standard community analyses and multivariate statistical methods (PERMANOVA). The analyses showed that both fields treated with AC were significantly depleted compared to the respective reference fields, and that they experienced a negative trend from 2009 to 2010. Neither the coarse limestone material (up to gravel size) nor the dredged clay without AC added had significant effects on number of species, biomass or the BQI index. Continued monitoring is recommended for fields treated with limestone and activated carbon.

40|$|A cytochemical {{study of}} {{intracellular}} thiol distribution in Acetabularia mediterranea intact cells was performed using the fluorescent thiol-labelling agent monobromobimane (mBBr). Different developmental stages were examined during the vegetative phase and generative {{phase of the}} algal life cycle up to cyst maturation. Important changes in thiol localization {{have been found to}} coincide with turning-points ofAcetabularia development. During the rapid growth phase, overall thiol content steadily increased along the stalk, being maximal shortly <b>before</b> <b>cap</b> differentiation. At this stage, the thiol distribution pattern paralleled that of cap morphogenesis essential processes: thiols being accumulated at the apex where morphogenesis is going to be expressed. High thiol contents were also present in the rhizoidal part of the alga throughout the vegetative phase. At the onset of the generative phase, important alterations in rhizoid thiol distribution coincided with the presumptive time of nuclear division. Overall thiol content strongly decreased and thiols became highly concentrated in definite zones localized in the central area of the rhizoid. Later on, during the sequence of morphogenetic events leading to cyst differentiation, changes in thiol localization and relative content were observed in the cap rays. Positioning of secondary nuclei into the cap coincided with a high increase in thiol content in the entire cap. During the process of cyst formation, thiol content slightly decreased and thiols were localized in cyst domains. Thiol distribution was also studied during regenerative processes after merotomy. A spatio-temporal coincidence was shown with cell wall regeneration. © 1992 Oxford University Press. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTRPV 1 is a Ca 2 + {{permeable}} {{channel and}} gated by noxious heat, oxidative stress and capsaicin (CAP). Some reports {{have indicated that}} non-ionized electromagnetic radiation (EMR) -induces heat and oxidative stress effects. We aimed to investigate the effects of distance from sources on calcium signaling, cytosolic ROS production, cell viability, apoptosis, plus caspase- 3 and - 9 values induced by mobile phones and Wi-Fi in breast cancer cellsMCF- 7 human breast cancer cell lines were divided into A, B, C and D groups as control, 900, 1800 and 2450 MHz groups, respectively. Cells in Group A were used as control and were kept in cell culture conditions without EMR exposure. Groups B, C and D {{were exposed to the}} EMR frequencies at different distances (0 cm, 1 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 25 cm) for 1 h <b>before</b> <b>CAP</b> stimulation. The cytosolic ROS production, Ca 2 + concentrations, apoptosis, caspase- 3 and caspase- 9 values were higher in groups B, C and D than in A group at 0 cm, 1 cm and 5 cm distances although cell viability (MTT) values were increased by the distances. There was no statistically significant difference in the values between control, 20 and 25 cm. Wi-Fi and mobile phone EMR placed within 10 cm of the cells induced excessive oxidative responses and apoptosis via TRPV 1 -induced cytosolic Ca 2 + accumulation in the cancer cells. Using cell phones and Wi-Fi sources which are farther away than 10 cm may provide useful protection against oxidative stress, apoptosis and overload of intracellular Ca 2 +.

40|$|Green tea catechins (GTCs) {{proved to}} be {{effective}} in inhibiting cancer growth in several experimental models. Recent studies showed that 30 % of men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN) would develop prostate cancer (CaP) within 1 year after repeated biopsy. This prompted us to do a proof-of-principle clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of GTCs for the chemoprevention of Cap in HG-PIN volunteers. The purity and content of GTCs preparations were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography [(-) -epigallocathechin, 5. 5 %; (-) -epicatechin, 12. 24 %; (-) -epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate, 51. 88 %; (-) -epicatechin- 3 -gallate, 6. 12 %; total GTCs, 75. 7 %; caffeine, < 1 %]. Sixty volunteers with HG-PIN, who were made aware of the study details, agreed to sign an informed consent form and were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Daily treatment consisted of three GTCs capsules, 200 mg each (total 600 mg/d). After 1 year, only one tumor was diagnosed among the 30 GTCs-treated men (incidence, similar to 3 %), whereas nine cancers were found among the 30 placebo-treated men (incidence, 30 %). Total prostate-specific antigen did not change significantly between the two arms, but GTCs-treated men showed values constantly lower with respect to placebo-treated ones. International Prostate Symptom Score and quality of life scores of GTCs-treated men with coexistent benign prostate hyperplasia improved, reaching statistical significance in the case of International Prostate Symptom Scores. No significant side effects or adverse effects were documented. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that GTCs are safe and very effective for treating premalignant lesions <b>before</b> <b>Cap</b> develops. As a secondary observation, administration of GTCs also reduced lower urinary tract symptoms, suggesting that these compounds might also be of help for treating the symptoms of benign prostate hyperplasia...|$|E
