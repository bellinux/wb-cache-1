5|$|Meanwhile, an {{intrusive}} {{public works}} inspector (Carter Jahncke) tests {{the air quality}} at the squad room, but insists to an inquisitive Gee that everything is fine. The next day, however, Gee goes upstairs and finds a team wearing protective respirator suits removing hazardous asbestos from the wall. Gee angrily confronts Captain Barnfather (Clayton LeBouef) and Colonel Granger (Gerald F. Gough) for not informing the detectives about the work, and demands it be stopped until precautionary medical checks can be conducted. Barnfather and Granger insist the removal work is safe, but give in when Gee threatens {{to go to the}} media. Meanwhile, Lewis (Clark Johnson) brags repeatedly to Crosetti (Jon Polito) about his new Ford FE V8 engine and the car he plans to build. Crosetti feigns disinterest, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> presents Lewis with a rear-view mirror as a gift.|$|E

50|$|Both Chen and Lien's {{election}} campaigns were suspended, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> {{election was}} not postponed, as Taiwanese law only allows for suspension of election upon {{the death of}} a candidate. Lien Chan and Wang Jyng-ping tried to visit Chen on the night of <b>the</b> incident, <b>but</b> were unable to see the president because he was resting.

5|$|Tropical Depression Three {{formed on}} July 3 in the Caribbean Sea, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> before {{being able to}} strengthen, it moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. The system emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on July 4 at which point a new center of {{circulation}} developed at {{the northern edge of}} the system and the system strengthened to a tropical storm, becoming Tropical Storm Cindy early July 4. The storm moved rapidly across the Gulf and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana late July 5 as a minimal hurricane; though it was originally thought to have been only a tropical storm at landfall, it was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis. As most storms do, it weakened while over land and became extratropical over the Carolinas on July 7.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{seems to}} recover, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> the {{producers}} find Truman sleeping in his basement. Marlon {{is sent to}} check on Truman, only to find he has disappeared through a makeshift tunnel. Marlon breaks character, and Christof orders the first transmission cut in the show's history while a citywide search for Truman is launched, going to such extreme measures as causing the artificial sun to rise hours ahead of schedule. Audiences {{around the world are}} drawn to this sudden change. Truman is found sailing out of Seahaven, having conquered his fear of water, and Christof resumes the broadcast as he sends a man-made lightning storm to try to capsize the boat. Network executives fear that Truman may die on live television, but Truman manages to persist. Realizing he cannot dissuade Truman any further, Christof ends the storm.|$|E
