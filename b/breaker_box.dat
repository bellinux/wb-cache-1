40|$|Abstract. Buildings are {{amongst the}} largest {{consumers}} of electrical energy in developed countries. Building efficiency {{can be improved}} by adapting building systems {{to a change in}} the environment or user context. Appropriate action, however, can only be taken if the building control system has access to reliable real-time data. Sensors providing this data need to be ubiquitous, accurate, have low maintenance cost, and should not violate privacy of building occupants. We conducted a three-year study in a mid-size office space with 15 offices and 25 people. Specifically, we focused on sensing modalities that can help improve energy efficiency of buildings. We have deployed 25 indoor climate sensor nodes and 41 wireless power meters, submetered 12 electric loads in circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>boxes,</b> logged data from our building control system and tracked activity on 40 desktop computers. We summarize our experiences with the cost, data yields, and user privacy concerns of the different sensing modalities and evaluate their accuracy using ground-truth experiments. ...|$|R
40|$|Challenger Electrical Equipment Corporation, {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, manufactures electrical circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>boxes,</b> loadcenters, and meterbreakers for {{commercial and residential}} use. Electroplating of the current-carrying aluminum bus bars and electrocoat painting of the external enclosures is conducted at the Jackson, Mississippi plant. These processes generate metal-bearing waste streams that require treatment before discharge to the sewer. Description of Plating and Painting- Processes The aluminum bus bars are plated with tin to prevent corrosion. The process involves cleaning, caustic etching, nitric acid pickling, phosphoric acid dip, and immersion in cyanide zincate solution before plating with a cyanide copper strike, followed by the final acid tin plate. After plating, the bus bars are removed from the racks, and the racks along with any rejected parts are stripped in nitric acid solution to remove plating before reuse. The cold roll and galvanized steel enclosures are pretreated in a six-stage washer prior to electrocoat painting. The parts are cleaned, phosphated, and then seale...|$|R
50|$|Itchenko {{and his men}} go to the Home Mart {{and take}} Ralph and several of McCall's other {{coworkers}} hostage, threatening to kill them if McCall does not surrender. McCall enters the store, disables most of the lighting, and tells Ralph to get the hostages to safety. McCall then kills Itchenko's henchmen one by one using booby traps constructed with items in the store. After a struggle between McCall and one of Itchenko's men, Ralph comes back to pull the injured McCall out of the store, but is shot in the leg himself. McCall tells Ralph {{to turn on the}} electricity at the <b>breaker</b> <b>box</b> in exactly 40 seconds, giving him his digital watch for precision. McCall sets up small containers of propane and oxygen in a microwave oven. The electricity turns it on, causing an explosion that kills the last of Itchenko's men.

50|$|Equipotential bonding {{involves}} joining together metalwork that is {{or may be}} earthed {{so that it is}} at {{the same}} potential (i.e., voltage) everywhere. Such is commonly used under transformer banks by power companies and under large computer installations. Exact rules for electrical installations vary by country, locality, or supplying power company. Equipotential bonding is done from the Service Panel consumer unit (also known as a fuse box, <b>breaker</b> <b>box,</b> or distribution board) to incoming water and gas services. It is also done in bathrooms where all exposed metal that leaves the bathroom including metal pipes and the earths of electrical circuits must be bonded together to ensure that they are always at the same potential. Isolated metal objects, including metal fittings fed by plastic pipe, are not required to be bonded. In Australia and South Africa, a house's earth cables must be connected both to an earthing rod driven into the ground and also to the plumbing or gas pipe.In Australia a house's earth cable must be connected to all reinforcing mesh in any concrete under any bathroom and in any swimming pool.|$|E

25|$|As {{commonly}} used, 10-30 and 10-50 plugs {{required the}} frame of the appliance to be indirectly grounded via a strap connecting to the neutral blade. Safe operation relied on the neutral conductor in turn being connected to system ground at the circuit <b>breaker</b> or fuse <b>box.</b> If the neutral conductor were to break, disconnect, or develop high resistance, the appliance frame could become energized to dangerous voltages. Modern practice is to require a separate safety grounding conductor whose only purpose is to divert unsafe voltages, and which does not carry significant current during normal operation.|$|R
40|$|Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is {{a method}} for characterizing and {{monitoring}} discrete loads connected to a power distribution system.

40|$|The Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) Simulator is a {{portable}} training aid, or demonstration tool, designed to physically illustrate real-time critical-safety concepts of electrical lockout/tagout. The {{objective is to}} prevent misinterpretations of what is off and what is on during maintenance and repair of complex electrical systems. The simulator is designed {{in the form of}} a hinged box that opens up and stands on its own as an easel for demonstrations. On the outer face of the unit is a simulated circuit <b>breaker</b> <b>box</b> housing the switches. The breakers control the main power to the unit, a light bulb, and an electrical control cabinet. The light bulb is wired so that either of two breakers can provide power to it. When power is sent to the electrical control cabinet, a red indicator light illuminates. Inside the cabinet is the power supply from a personal computer. The power supply produces a 12 -V dc output that is sent over to a small fan next to it, also from a computer, and an amber light on the front of the cabinet illuminates. A separate switch powers the fan on and off. The power supply is behind a plastic shield to protect against exposure to live conductors. Electrical banana jacks are mounted in the plastic shield to allow a voltmeter to be connected safely when opening the cabinet and taking a meter reading to verify de-energization as part of a simulation exercise. This LOTO simulator prototype is designed and fabricated as an all-in-one unit. All accessories can be stored inside the hinged case, and there is a handle on top for ease of transport. The circuit breaker labels attach with hook and loop fasteners so that they may be moved and changed to fit the training or demonstration scenario. The warning signs and labels on the electrical control box are magnetic, allowing for easy reconfiguration to emulate different equipment setups. A specially designed magnetic cover was made to disguise the indicator lights for demonstrations when these indicators are not used. The cover is disguised as an arc flash safety label that would typically be found on such a cabinet. One indicator light has a separate switch that can take it offline. This is to allow for demonstration to trainees on why it is important not to completely rely on indicator lights, but that they should always take a meter reading at the exposed conductors to absolutely verify de-energization before exposure. A clear plastic barrier and banana jacks inside the cabinet provide a safe way to plug in a voltmeter for demonstrations without exposure to the hazards of energized equipment. A small remote control unit is wired into the fan circuit. The remote allows the demonstrator to turn the fan on and off, provided that all of the breakers and switches leading to it are configured on as well. The remote feature was added in order to demonstrate the importance of starting the lockout/tagout task with energized equipment, then powering it down, isolating it, and locking it out to ensure that the correct breakers have been locked out...|$|E
