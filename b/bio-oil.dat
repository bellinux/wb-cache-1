25|$|Pyrolysis oil {{is another}} type of fuel derived from the {{lignocellulosic}} fraction of biomass. By rapidly heating biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen (pyrolysis), a liquid crude can be formed that can be further processed into a usable <b>bio-oil.</b> As opposed to other biofuels, pyrolysis oils use the non-edible fraction of biomass and can occur on the order of milliseconds and without the need for large fermentation reactors.

25|$|Currently, {{the first}} {{generation}} processes {{for the production of}} ethanol from corn use {{only a small part of}} the corn plant: the corn kernels are taken from the corn plant and only the starch, which represents about 50% of the dry kernel mass, is transformed into ethanol. Two types of second generation processes are under development. The first type uses enzymes and yeast fermentation to convert the plant cellulose into ethanol while the second type uses pyrolysis to convert the whole plant to either a liquid <b>bio-oil</b> or a syngas.

40|$|Most {{bituminous}} adhesives or binders {{that are}} used for pavement materials are derived primarily from fossil fuels. With petroleum oil reserves becoming depleted and the drive to establish a bio-based economy, there is a push to produce binders from alternative sources, particularly from biorenewable resources. However, until now, no research has studied the applicability of utilizing <b>bio-oils</b> as a bitumen replacement (100 % replacement) in the pavement industry. The main objective {{of this research was}} to test various properties of <b>bio-oils</b> {{in order to determine the}} applicability of using <b>bio-oils</b> as binders in the pavement industry. The overall conclusions about the applicability of using <b>bio-oils</b> as bio-binders in the pavement industry can be summarized as follows: <b>Bio-oils</b> cannot be used as bio-binders/pavement materials without any heat pre-treatment/upgrading procedure. Current testing standards and specifications, especially Superpave procedures, should be modified to comply with the properties of bio-binders. The temperature range of the viscous behavior for <b>bio-oils</b> may be lower than that of bitumen binders by about 30 °– 40 ° C. The rheological properties of the unmodified bio-binders vary in comparison to bitumen binders, but the rheological properties of these modified bio-binders change significantly upon adding polymer modifiers. The high-temperature performance grade for the developed bio-binders may not vary significantly from that of the bitumen binders, but the low-temperature performance grade may vary significantly...|$|R

50|$|There are {{numerous}} {{papers on the}} pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. However, very few reports are available for algal <b>bio-oil</b> production via pyrolysis. Miao et al. (2004b) performed fast pyrolysis of Chllorella protothecoides and Microcystis areuginosa at 500 °C, and <b>bio-oil</b> yields of 18% and 24% were obtained, respectively. The <b>bio-oil</b> exhibited a higher carbon and nitrogen content, lower oxygen content than wood <b>bio-oil.</b> When Chllorella protothecoides was cultivated heterotrophically, <b>bio-oil</b> yield increased to 57.9% with a heating value of 41 MJ/kg (Miao et al., 2004a). Recently when microalgae become a hot research topic as the third generation of biofuel, pyrolysis has drawn more attention as a potential conversion method for algal biofuel production. Pan et al. (2010) investigated slow pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. residue with and without the presence of HZSM-5 catalyst and obtained <b>bio-oil</b> rich in aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis. Algal pyrolytic liquids separate into two phases with the top phase called <b>bio-oil</b> (Campanella et al., 2012; Jena et al., 2011a). The higher heating values (HHV) of algal <b>bio-oil</b> {{are in the range}} of 31−36 MJ/kg, generally higher than those of lignocellulosic feedstocks. Pyrolytic <b>bio-oil</b> consists of compounds with lower mean molecular weights and contains more low boiling compounds than <b>bio-oil</b> produced by hydrothermal liquefaction. These properties {{are similar to those of}} Illinois shale oil (Jena et al., 2011a; Vardon et al., 2012), which may indicate that pyrolytic <b>bio-oil</b> is suited for petroleum fuel replacement. In addition, the high protein content in microalgae led to a high N content in the <b>bio-oil,</b> resulting in undesirable NOx emissions during combustion and deactivation of acidic catalysts when co-processed in existing 10 crude oil refineries. Algal <b>bio-oil</b> had better qualities in many aspects than those produced from lignocellulosic biomass. For example, algal <b>bio-oil</b> has a higher heating value, a lower oxygen content and a greater than 7 pH value. However, upgrading towards the removal of nitrogen and oxygen in the <b>bio-oil</b> is still necessary before it can be used as drop-in fuels.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} an {{analytical}} multi-technique approach {{was developed in}} order to describe as fully as possible the composition of several fast pyrolysis oils. Six <b>bio-oils</b> were produced at CIRAD (centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Développement) and TI (Thünen Institute of Wood Research) using the same three lignocellulosic biomass materials (i. e. hardwood, softwood and wheat straw). Different and complementary analytical tools were used to characterize these samples. Whole <b>bio-oils</b> were first directly analyzed by gas chromatographic (GC) hyphenated techniques with flame ionization detector (FID) and mass spectrometry (MS) (Headspace-GC-FID/MS, GC-FID/MS) and by a high resolution mass spectrometry technique (Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry FT-ICR/MS) without any pre-separation step. The GC analyses provide a detailed molecular description (more than 90 compounds) of {{the composition of the}} six <b>bio-oils.</b> To achieve {{a better understanding of the}} chemical composition of this set of <b>bio-oils,</b> the samples were fractionated into aqueous fractions and water-insoluble fractions (also called pyrolytic lignins).

Moreover, FT-ICR/MS analyses show that species having molecular weights up to 900 Da are present in the aqueous phases. The originality of this work is based on the development of complementary analytical tools (i. e., chromatographic and spectrometric techniques) to describe the composition from volatiles (monomeric) to non-volatiles (oligomeric) species of several <b>bio-oils</b> that were produced and stored under controlled conditions.

However, <b>bio-oils</b> {{need to be}} upgraded by decreasing {{the large amount of}} oxygenated and acidic compounds to enhance the heating value and stability. With the expanded production of <b>bio-oils,</b> the related by-products, most of which are realized as bio-wastes, are largely produced from bio-refinery.

Rice production process generates rice husk together with polyethylene (PE) bags that are used for rice packaging and to transport seeds and fertilizers used for rice culture. In Portugal, most of these plastic bags waste usually end up in landfills, since the amount of dirt and dust does not allow their recycling. <b>Bio-oils</b> produced by rice wastes pyrolysis present some undesirable properties: chemical instability, high solids content, ashes, oxygenated compounds and water, which prevent its direct use in conventional engines. On the other hand, PE pyrolysis produces around 80 % w/w of liquid hydrocarbons (<b>bio-oils)</b> composed by a complex mixture of hydrocarbons from C 5 to C 20 (without the mentioned undesirable properties), 10 % w/w of gases and almost no solids.
