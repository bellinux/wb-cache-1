40|$|International audienceSupercritical fluid {{synthesis}} {{offers an}} attractive and unique method to produce metal oxide nanoparticles such as barium strontium titanate (Ba 1 −xSrxTiO 3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). This synthesis pathway {{has the advantage}} of producing high quality, highly crystalline nanoparticles in a narrow size range, with accurate control of the elemental composition not easily afforded by other methods of production. Coupled with moderate reaction temperatures and short reaction times, this method could be an environmentally preferred synthesis route compared to conventional synthesis pathways. This paper examines the potential environmental impacts leading from the lab-scale supercritical synthesis of 1 kg of Ba 0. 6 Sr 0. 4 TiO 3 nanoparticles of an average size 16 nm using the approach of an anticipatory life-cycle assessment. A cradle-to-gate assessment was completed, estimating the impacts across resource extraction, material processing, and production of the nanoparticles, while excluding any associated use-phase or end-of-life considerations. The life-cycle assessment highlights a number of ways by which the environmental profile of the supercritical synthesis of barium strontium titanate nanoparticles could be improved. Lab-scale synthesis was bound by physical constraints of the reactor, whereby the precursor concentration was kept artificially low. Being able to synthesize nanoparticles with precursor concentrations of 0. 1 and 1. 0 molar would reduce the average life-cycle impacts by nearly 81 % and 95 %, respectively. Additionally, the recovery and reuse of solvents at high recycling rates (e. g. 90 %) could reduce average life-cycle impacts by 56 %. At high precursor concentrations and solvent recycling rates, the environmental performance was further limited by the precursors, namely barium and titanium alkoxides, which have high upstream life-cycle demands (i. e. isopropanol production and metal processing). General impact reductions were seen as the ratio of strontium : barium increased. Further reductions could be achieved by replacing the barium, strontium and titanium alkoxides with precursors having better life-cycle profiles such as <b>barium</b> and strontium <b>acetates</b> or <b>barium</b> and strontium hydroxides...|$|R

In addition, antitumoric potentiality was maintained more or less when ascorbate oxidase had been inactivated by heating or splitting off with trypsin.

40|$|Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear {{negatively}} charged polysaccharides and important components of extracellular matrices and cell surface glycan layers {{such as the}} endothelial glycocalyx. The GAG family includes sulfated heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), keratan sulfate, and non-sulfated hyaluronan. Because relative expression of GAGs is dependent on cell-type and niche, isolating GAGs from cell cultures and tissues may provide insight into cell- and tissue-specific GAG structure and functions. In our objective to obtain structural information about the GAGs expressed on a specialized mouse glomerular endothelial cell culture (mGEnC- 1) we adapted a recently published GAG isolation protocol, based on cell lysis, proteinase K and DNase I digestion. Analysis of the GAGs contributing to the mGEnC- 1 glycocalyx indicated a large HS and a minor CS content on <b>barium</b> <b>acetate</b> gel. However, isolated GAGs appeared resistant to enzymatic digestion by heparinases. We found that these GAG extracts were heavily contaminated with RNA, which co-migrated with HS in <b>barium</b> <b>acetate</b> gel electrophoresis and interfered with 1, 9 -dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assays, resulting in an overestimation of GAG yields. We hypothesized that RNA may be contaminating GAG extracts from other cell cultures and possibly tissue, and therefore investigated potential RNA contaminations in GAG extracts from two additional cell lines, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and retinal pigmental epithelial cells, and mouse kidney, liver, spleen and heart tissue. GAG extracts from all examined cell lines and tissues contained varying amounts of contaminating RNA, which interfered with GAG quantification using DMMB assays and characterization of GAGs by <b>barium</b> <b>acetate</b> gel electrophoresis. We therefore recommend routinely evaluating the RNA content of GAG extracts and propose a robust protocol for GAG isolation that includes an RNA digestion step...|$|E
