40|$|Context and Motivation] Business {{modeling}} is nowadays {{a common}} approach in huge enterprise software developments. It notably allows to align business processes and supporting IT solutions at best, {{to produce a}} documentation of the company’s "savoir-faire" and to look for possible optimizations. The business modeling discipline of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) has enriched the semantic of the Unified Modeling Language’s (UML) use case diagrams for the special purpose of representing the organization’s processes with accurate elements. [Question/Problem] RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> scemantics are nevetheless only intended to further stereotype use case models {{and not to be}} used for reasoning. In parallel and in line with artificial intelligence concepts, researchers have developed the i* framework enabling the evaluation and decomposition of multiple design opportunities. RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> semantics could be used more efficiently to integrate the latter benefits. [Principal ideas/results] Through a systematic mapping of elements from i* on the one side and of the RUP/UML <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> model on the other, we have set up a RUP/UML graphical notation for i* elements. Applicability has been shown on an illustrative example. [Contribution] The main contribution of the framework is allowing to model in an i* fashion using CASE-tools meant for RUP/UML and proposing an interface for forward engineering the produced model in a classical UML requirements model. Future work is required to fully validate the proposal, notably to measure the method’s efficacy. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Industry {{has adopted}} service {{orientation}} paradigm {{over the last}} years. Automatic service discovery, dynamic service composition and process adaptability will bring SOA to its full potential. The integrated research project “Adaptive Services Grid ” realizes a platform providing such automation functionalities based on semantics. Enhancing SOA with semantics has a massive impact on the development methodology for the overall system. In this paper a <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> for dynamic supply chains demonstrates how to disentangle the interdependencies between service identification, WSDL interface descriptions and their semantic specifications. The paper shows a step-by-step approach for developing such applications on top of adaptive service-oriented architectures.

40|$|Context and Motivation: The <b>Business</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> Model (BUCM) formalized in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) defines {{stereotypes}} of elements refining the UML Use Case Model for coarse-grained business processes modeling (BPM). The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) Business Process Diagram (BPD) {{is designed for}} workflow based (i. e. fine-grained) BPM. These are frameworks that can possibly be complementary for enterprise modeling. Question/Problem: The semantically richer BPMN BPD can be used instead of UML activity diagrams for operational BPM when the BUCM is used for tactical BPM. Principal ideas/results: The common use of the BUCM and BPMN BPD requires anchoring of elements in between the frameworks to ensure traceability. Traceable models increase their overall consistency.

40|$|Abstract. Information and {{knowledge}} management are fundamental components for helping organizations in efficiently acquiring, storing and utilizing knowledge for problem solving, dynamic learning, strategic planning and decision making. In a previous work we presented the Information and Knowledge Management Framework (MGIC), a methodology {{for building a}} model to serve as basis {{for the implementation of}} integrated information {{and knowledge}} systems that support business intelligence in public organizations. The first step of this methodology consists on building an integrated model, based in well-known modeling techniques, such as <b>Business</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> models and class models, which focus on the representation of the main business requirements and services provided by the organization. In this paper we discuss how such model is used to guide the requirements specification and development of new IT systems or the evolution of legacy systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{scenario}} {{can be used}} {{to describe}} a possible instantiation of a given <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> and can be expressed for example as a list of steps written in natural language, or by an interaction diagram. This paper discusses how a collection of scenarios, all expressed as UML 2 sequence diagrams, can be described for validation purposes by a single model, written in the Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) modelling language. Due to the support for parallelism given by the CPN language, the obtained CPN model can: (1) simultaneously execute several scenarios; and (2) elegantly represent the parallel activities inside a scenario. This two-level parallelism is crucial during validation, since it allows one to detect problems that are only evident when several scenarios are in simultaneous execution and may affect each other. We exemplify our approach in a system that has a rich set of interactions with its users.

40|$|Mainstream {{literature}} {{recognizes the}} validity and effectiveness of use cases as a technique for gathering and capturing system requirements. Use cases represent the driver of various modern development methods, mainly of object-oriented extraction, such as the Unified Process. Although the adoption of use cases proliferated {{in the context of}} software systems development, they are not as extensively employed in business modeling. The concept of <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case</b> is not a novelty, but only recently did it begin to re-circulate in the literature and in case tools. This paper examines the issues involved in adopting business use cases for capturing the functionality of an organization and proposes guidelines for their identification, packaging, and mapping to system use cases. The proposed guidelines are based on the principle of actor perception described in the paper. The application of this principle is exemplified with a worked example aimed at demonstrating the utility of the proposed guidelines and at clarifying the application of the principle of actor perception. The worked example is based on a series of workshops run at a major UK financial institution...|$|E

In Natural Language Processing, {{more complex}} <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases</b> and shorter {{delivery}} times drive a growing need of smoother, more flexible and faster implementations.

In this paper we present a Model Driven Architecture approach suitable to develop an open and interoperable UIMA-based NLP stack. By decoupling UIMA NLP models from other solution specific platforms and services, we obtain major architectural improvements. ...|$|R

40|$|Various {{frameworks}} {{are available}} for modeling an organizational setting. Their constituting models nevertheless mostly choose a particular decision level to represent perceived reality meaning that some introduce coarse-grained (i. e. abstract) elements and some others fine-grained (i. e. detailed) ones. Sometimes, in a same model, elements of various levels of granularity can be mixed like for example in the i* strategic rationale model. The main drawback is that this leads to hard to read and complex models, not ideal for easy and quick understanding of the software problem. Also, within the industry, poor unification {{in the use of}} models does exist. The various Unified Modeling Language (UML) models and the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) are nevertheless rather popular. In this paper, we study the use of the <b>Business</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Case</b> Model [...] an extension of the classical UML use-case model defined in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) [...] and the BPMN Business Process Model (BPM) as a unified framework for knowledge representation at strategic, tactical and operational levels. By default, the RUP advises to use UML activity diagrams for operational-level knowledge representation. Their main drawback is that they have been engineered to model software behavior with respect to the user and not business process modeling at large. The BPMN BPM thus offers more perspectives for pure business process modeling; that is why it mostly used in the industry for this purpose. The use of these models in a unified way is ensured by traceability at the various levels of modeling. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{its basic}} form, an {{activity}} diagram {{is a simple}} and intuitive illustration {{of what happens in}} a workflow, what activities can be done in parallel, and whether there are alternative paths through the workflow. Activity diagrams as defined in the Unified Modeling Language 1 are derived from various techniques to visually illustrate workflows; see, for example, Johansson et al. 2. And much of the basis for the definition of the activity diagram notation is found in Martin and Odell. 3. In the Rational Unified Process 4, we talk about how you can use activity diagrams to visualize the workflow of a <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>case.</b> A complete workflow description will have a basic flow, and one or several alternative flows. This workflow has a structure that we can define textually, using informal if, if-then-else, or do-until statements of various kinds. For a simple workflow with a simple structure, such textual definitions may be quite sufficient, {{but in the case of}} more complex structures, activity diagrams help to clarify and make more apparent what the workflow is. Historically, activity diagramming techniques have mostly been used in the business process modeling domain, but this article will also briefly discuss how you can use it in the system modeling domain. The purpose of this article is to show how you can use activity diagrams within the Rational Unified Process for business modeling as well as system modeling. Activity diagrams are often mentioned almost as a synonym to business modeling. For a more complete introduction to what business modeling is we refer to Kruchten, 5 and for details to Jacobson et al. 6.

We are {{currently}} devoloping an integrated business application platform named Corinna 3 where the long-term {{goal is to}} combine Semantic Web technologies with Natural Language Processing (NLP) {{to increase the efficiency}} of the enterprise search process. In this paper we consider one of the Corinna <b>use</b> <b>cases,</b> namely the Human Resource (HR) <b>use</b> <b>case,</b> which has already reached a prototype implementation. While NLP is used for automatic categorization of an unstructured resource, ontologies represent these resources in a taxonomical way with arbitrary properties. On top of the resource ontologies we use both the NLP for the information extraction as well as ontology-based similarity in order to get more acceptable similar search results. Our implemented approach of contextualized hybrid similarity search within the Corinna platform derives strongly from the defined <b>business</b> <b>use</b> <b>cases.</b> It combines and extends existing similarity measures under consideration of additional context information. ...|$|R
