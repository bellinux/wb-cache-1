5|$|Around Storybrooke, {{residents}} {{notice the}} clock tower's hands moving. Regina (Lana Parrilla) {{looks through the}} book of fairy tales and discovers that the last few pages are torn out. She confronts Henry (Jared S. Gilmore), who lies and says that the pages are missing <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> old book. Regina learns Emma is still in town when the clock's hands move forward. Believing that Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) will try to take Henry away from her, Regina encourages Emma to leave town. Regina meets with The Daily Mirror editor, Sidney Glass (Giancarlo Esposito), who has run a front-page story about Emma's auto accident which portrays Emma in a poor light, but tells Regina that he has found very little of interest in Emma's past.|$|E

5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and tinkering with things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter {{what has happened in the}} future.|$|E
5|$|Most of Yap State was {{affected}} by the typhoon, and the eye of Typhoon Lupit passed near the small atoll of Ulithi. The typhoon also passed near Fais, producing estimated gusts of over 185km/h (115mph). On both islands, Lupit produced waves of , causing severe beach erosion, and sea spray and flooding contaminated water supplies. In Fais, there was little flooding <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> elevated island, although several buildings were damaged, mostly to roofs. On Ulithi, areas along the coast were flooded up to 1.5m (5ft) deep. Crops were wrecked on both islands, and on Ulithi, {{it was estimated that}} the soil would be unfit for growing for at least a year. Stations on Ulithi reported wind gusts of 158km/h (98mph), and 263mm (10.35in) of rainfall. Lupit affected other islands in Yap State with coastal flooding of around 1m (3ft), severe beach erosion, and wrecked crops. Several islands' water supply were contaminated. On Woleai, the storm downed trees and power lines, and the runway was closed for a week after being covered with water. Damage in Yap State was least on Yap, where winds gusted to 93km/h (58mph) and rainfall totaled 128mm (5.02in) in a 24â€‘hour period. There, Lupit downed trees and damaged crops, while high seas flooded areas. There was moderate beach erosion, and some seawalls and coastal roads were damaged.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol, {{from the}} Ancient Greek chole- (bile) and stereos (solid) {{followed}} by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol, is an organic molecule.

Cholesterol enables animal cells to dispense with a cell wall (to protect membrane integrity and cell viability), thereby allowing animal cells to change shape rapidly and animals to move (unlike bacteria and plant cells, which are restricted by their cell walls).|$|E

Stainless steel was also investigated <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> important surface material in today's healthcare environments.
