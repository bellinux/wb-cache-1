5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} {{contribute to a}} high number of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating to or from the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact that}} the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E
5|$|By {{agreement}} among the Allied nations, in March 1942 the Pacific theatre was divided into two separate commands, {{each with its own}} commander-in-chief. The South West Pacific Area, which included Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines came under General Douglas MacArthur as supreme commander. Most of the remainder, known as the Pacific Ocean Areas, came under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. There was no overall commander, and no authority capable of resolving competing claims for resources, setting priorities, or shifting resources from one command to the other. Such decisions had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of compromise, cooperation and consensus.|$|E

5|$|In 798 Coenwulf invaded Kent and {{captured}} Eadberht, whom he blinded and imprisoned. Æthelhard was restored to Canterbury, where he set about restoring the see's possessions. He {{also managed to}} secure professions of obedience {{from a number of}} southern bishops, including Eadwulf of Lindsey and Tidferth of Dummoc. But, Hygberht was still being called archbishop in 799. Because Pope Leo was involved in disputes in Rome during 799 and 800, and was unable to spare attention for English affairs, no papal decisions could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dispute.|$|E
5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> board before it is written on paper or recorded with an electronic device.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often recalled in the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E

5|$|On 26 December 1943, a {{response}} to the Australian protest arrived. It stated that the Japanese Government had no information justifying the allegation made, and therefore took no responsibility for what happened. The reply counter-protested that nine Japanese hospital ships had been attacked by the Allies, although these claims were directed against the United States, not Australia. Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loss of Centaur.|$|E
5|$|The District of Kentucky and the Supreme Court of the District of Kentucky {{were both}} created in 1783. When the court moved to Danville in 1785, it ordered that two men {{determine}} {{the cost of}} constructing the buildings it needed to function, including a courthouse and jail. The report called for assessments to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> district's four counties {{for the construction of}} the buildings; Jefferson County was assessed £431, Nelson County £49, Fayette County £86, and Lincoln County £122. Isaac Hite was chosen to construct the buildings, which were finished in 1785. The jail was built {{in the center of the}} square, and the courthouse was situated between the jail and Walnut Street.|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of {{the community as a whole}} rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is especially important in comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

5|$|In August 1999, the {{architect}} informed the project group that the Parliament {{would need to}} be further increased in size by 4,000squaremetres (43,000sqft). A subsequent costing revealed that taking into account the increased floorspace net construction costs had risen to £115m by September 1999. Early in 2000, the SPCB commissioned an independent report by {{the architect}} John Spencely. The report concluded that savings of 20% could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> current project and that scrapping the project completely at that stage or moving to another site would entail additional costs of £30m. Spencely also cited poor communication between the SPCB and construction officials as increasingly costly. Given the outcomes of the Spencely report, MSPs voted to continue with the construction project on the Holyrood site in a debate in the Scottish Parliament on 5 April 2000.|$|E
25|$|The International Society for Clinical Densitometry {{takes the}} {{position}} that a diagnosis of osteoporosis in men under 50 years of age should not <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also states, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather than T-scores should be used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of densitometric criteria alone.|$|E

However, some linguists consider Burmese a pitch-register language like Shanghainese.|$|E
25|$|The first {{national}} examinations were administered {{in the kingdom}} of Silla beginning in 788, at the suggestion of Confucian scholar Choe Chiwon. However, due to Silla's entrenched bone rank system, which dictated that appointments <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of birth, these examinations did not have a strong effect on the government.|$|E

25|$|The Constitution {{provided}} that the British monarch be represented in Australia by a Governor-General. Originally, appointments were made {{on the advice of}} the British, not the Australian, government, and was generally a British aristocrat. In 1930, the Australian government insisted that Australian-born Isaac Isaacs being appointed. The British government very reluctantly accepted the Australian position that such appointments <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of the Australian government.|$|E
25|$|Efforts to {{conserve}} Minnesota's wildlife began {{as early as}} 1876, with a forestry association established to protect the state's timber resources. However, those efforts became futile as the industry took over and people sought the money that could <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> land. Over time, there were other attempts to control the destruction of resources, but most only had effects on what was done to public land, such as the Land Commission established in 1885. In 1911 the Minnesota Forest Service was established {{to conserve}} the state's forests by promoting fire prevention and protection.|$|E
