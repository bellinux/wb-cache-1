25|$|The battle {{started with}} an {{exchange}} of gunfire at long range, the federal gunboats {{setting up a line}} of battle across the river and firing their rear guns at the cottonclads coming up to meet them as they entered the battle stern first. Two of the four rams advanced beyond the line of the gunboats and rammed or otherwise disrupted the movements of their opponents; the other rams misinterpreted their orders and did not enter the battle at all. With the federal rams and gunboats not coordinating their movements and the Confederate vessels operating independently, the battle soon was reduced to a melee. It is agreed <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the ram flagship, , initiated hostilities by slamming into CSS Colonel Lovell. She was then rammed in turn by {{one or more of the}} remaining cottonclads. Ellet was at this time wounded by a pistol shot in his knee, thereby becoming the only casualty on the Union side. (In the hospital, he contracted measles, the childhood disease that killed some 5,000 soldiers during the war. The combination of the disease and the debilitation caused by his wound was too great, and he died on June 21.) The remainder of the battle is obscured by more than the fog of war. Several eyewitness accounts are available; however, they are mutually contradictory to a greater degree than usual. All that is certain is that at the end of the battle, all but one of the cottonclads were either destroyed or captured, and one Yankee boat, Queen of the West, was disabled. The sole boat to escape, CSS General Earl Van Dorn, fled to the protection of the Yazoo River, just north of Vicksburg. Personnel losses among the Confederates cannot be estimated reliably.|$|E
500|$|At {{about one}} {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} of 6 October 1789, the vast throng escorted the royal family and a complement of one hundred deputies back to the capital, this time with the armed National Guards leading the way. By now the mass of people had grown to over sixty thousand, and the return trip took about nine hours. The procession could seem merry at times, as guardsmen hoisted up loaves of bread stuck on the tips of their bayonets, and some of the market women rode gleefully astride the captured cannon. Yet, even as the crowd sang pleasantries about their [...] "Good Papa", their violent mentality could not be misread; celebratory gunshots flew over the royal carriage and some marchers even carried pikes bearing the heads of the slaughtered Versailles guards. A sense of victory over the ancien régime was imbued in the parade, and it was understood <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> the king was now fully at the service of the people.|$|E
500|$|The 1940 season {{opened with}} Stanford facing the University of San Francisco Dons at Kezar Stadium {{as part of}} the first-ever major college {{football}} doubleheader. It also featured [...] and Utah, but despite its unusual nature, the event was overshadowed by a concurrent game deemed much more significant between California and Michigan in nearby Berkeley. After Santa Clara defeated Utah, 34–14, the Stanford game began at 3:30p.m. It started off sloppily, and the Indians failed to advance the ball in their first two possessions. In their third series, however, Albert connected with an uncovered receiver, Hugh Gallarneau, for a 17-yard pass. Fullback Norm Standlee then rushed for 20yards. Halfback Pete Kmetovic ran untouched up the middle for the game's first touchdown. Stanford went on to win, 27–0, and outgained San Francisco by a margin of 247yards to eight. After the game, San Francisco head coach George Malley said, [...] "We were baffled, naturally, <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> running around in the backfield." [...] After the game, convinced that the T formation worked, Shaughnessy discarded the single-wing playbook he had drafted.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Malay and Islam became the {{national}} language and official religion, while the Malay rulers remained. This {{was taken to}} mean that the Malays were accorded deference as the definitive people of Malaya — i.e. being a Malayan {{would be the same}} as being a Malay — and in the eyes of many, gave Malaya a Malay identity. One academic suggested that [...] "The Malays have a deep-rooted feeling that they alone are the bumiputras, the sons of the soil, and as such have certain special rights over the land." [...] Indeed, the Tunku said in 1964 that [...] "It is understood <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> this country by its very name, its traditions and character, is Malay. ... In any other country where aliens try to dominate economic and other fields, eventually there is bitter opposition from the indigenous people. But not with the Malays.

2500|$|In January 1921, Stolzing-Cerny {{who joined}} the NSDAP in December 1920 wrote to Chamberlain about the new man on the {{political}} scene, [...] "one Adolf Hitler, an Austrian worker, a man of extraordinary oratorical talents and an astonishingly rich political knowledge who knows marvelously how to thrill the masses". Initially, Chamberlain was hesitant about Hitler, believing {{that he might be}} another Kapp, but after the [...] "battle of Coburg", where Hitler had personally fought with his followers in a street battle against the Communists, Chamberlain started to see Hitler as someone who practiced what he preached. From that a time onwards, Chamberlain started to closely follow and admire Hitler, whom he saw as [...] "Germany's savior". Hitler in his turn had read The Foundations, Chamberlain's biography of Wagner and many of his wartime essays, and was much influenced <b>by</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Chamberlain had written. British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, a biographer of Hitler, writes that [...] "...Hitler drew heavily for his ideas from well known anti-Semitic tracts such as those by Houston Stewart Chamberlain, Adolf Wahrmund and especially, the arch-popularizer Theodor Fritsch (one of whose emphasis was the alleged sexual abuse of women by the Jews)...". The fact that Hitler was an ardent Wagnerite who adored Wagner's music gave Chamberlain and Hitler a mutual ground for friendship beyond their shared hatred of the Jews. Likewise, Joseph Goebbels had been converted to the völkisch ideology after reading Chamberlain's books and essays, and came to the conclusion on the basis of Chamberlain's writings that the West could only be saved by removing the Jews from German society. During this period, Chamberlain who was practically a member of the Wagner family started to push for the Bayreuth Festival to become [...] openly identified with völkisch politics, and to turn the previously apolitical festival into a völkisch rally.|$|E
