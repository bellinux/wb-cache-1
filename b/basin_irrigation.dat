50|$|Intelligent urbanism {{understands that}} the social and {{economic}} region linked to a city also has a physical form, or a geographic character. A hierarchy of watersheds, creating valleys and defining edges of neighborhoods, may define the geographic character.

Within this larger, environmental scenario, one must conceptualize urbanism in terms of watersheds, subterranean aquifer systems, and other natural systems that operate across the entire region.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} was undertaken {{for the period}} of two years (2004 and 2005) to evaluate the effect of various levels of water and N application through drip irrigation on red hot pepper yield, Water Use Efficiency (WUE) and Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). In this experiment various combination of three irrigation treatments (Drip irrigation at 0. 5 and 1. 0 xEpan, check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation</b> at 1. 0 xEpan) and three nitrogen levels (50, 75 and 100 % of recommended nitrogen) were compared in split plot design having three replications. The results revealed that when the same quantity of water and nitrogen (100 % of recommended) was supplied through drip irrigation system, it increased the red hot pepper yield to 277. 4 q ha - 1 (an increase of 28. 4 %) under check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation.</b> In check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation,</b> the highest red hot pepper yield (216. 1 q ha - 1) obtained at 100 % of recommended N, while in drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan, the yield was highest at 75 % of recommended N. When water and nitrogen was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan, the yield remained statistically same at all the levels of nitrogen, however proved superior over drip irrigation at 1. 0 xEpan at all the levels of N. When half the recommended amount of N was supplied through drip at 0. 5 xEpan.,WUE and NUE increased by 232. 1 and 38. 7 % over check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation.</b> At lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan, Root length increased significantly with drip irrigation treatments as compared to check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation</b> and found maximum (36. 3 m) at lower level of drip irrigation 0. 5 xEpan. Thus drip irrigation at 0. 5 x Epan is beneficial for red hot pepper in term of yield, better morphological characters, viz, plant height, number of branches, root length, size and weight of fruits along with 58. 6 % saving of irrigation water over check <b>basin</b> method of <b>irrigation...</b>|$|R
50|$|Surface {{irrigation}} is {{the oldest}} form of irrigation {{and has been in}} use for thousands of years. In surface (furrow, flood, or level <b>basin)</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems, water moves across the surface of an agricultural lands, in an order to wet it and infiltrate into the soil. Surface irrigation can be subdivided into furrow, borderstrip or <b>basin</b> <b>irrigation.</b> It is often called flood irrigation when the irrigation results in flooding or near flooding of the cultivated land. Historically, this has been the most common method of irrigating agricultural land and still used {{in most parts of the}} world.|$|E

50|$|Level <b>basin</b> <b>irrigation</b> has {{historically}} been used in small areas having level surfaces that are surrounded by earth banks. The water is applied rapidly to the entire basin and is allowed to infiltrate. In traditional basins no water is permitted to drain from the field once it is irrigated. <b>Basin</b> <b>irrigation</b> is favoured in soils with relatively low infiltration rates(Walker and Skogerboe 1987). This is also a method of surface irrigation. Fields are typically set up to follow the natural contours of the land but the introduction of laser levelling and land grading has permitted the construction of large rectangular basins that are more appropriate for mechanised broadacre cropping.|$|E
