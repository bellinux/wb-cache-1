5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio.

Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may <b>bear</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E
