500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." ...|$|E
500|$|Though [...] "Yeah!" [...] was now completed, {{the label}} still had [...] "Burn" [...] on queue {{for the lead}} single. Usher's friend and former A rep Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather commented: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of them things where people said, 'It's strong, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." [...] Usher was unsure if [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the right choice. After Lil Jon leaked [...] "Yeah!" [...] to street DJs across the United States, Usher opted [...] "Burn" [...] as the lead single of the album and was already {{planning}} for its music video. The song was not intended to be a proper single and only a teaser for Usher's fans after waiting for years. However, the responses of [...] "Yeah!" [...] were overwhelmingly favorable, and [...] "Yeah!" [...] was released as the first single instead of [...] "Burn", which became the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12" [...] single. LaFace Records sent [...] "Yeah!" [...] to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two unreleased tracks from the album, [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Sweet Lies".|$|E
2500|$|During the war, Cixi {{displayed}} {{concern about}} China's situation and foreign aggression, saying, [...] "Perhaps their magic {{is not to}} be relied upon; <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> not rely on {{the hearts and minds of}} the people? Today China is extremely weak. We have only the people's hearts and minds to depend upon. If we cast them aside and lose the people's hearts, what can we use to sustain the country?" [...] The Chinese people were almost unanimous in their support for the Boxers due to the Western Allied invasion.|$|E

2500|$|Thus, if {{a person}} has several options, you can {{calculate}} the opportunity cost of choosing one. <b>But</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> calculate a universal opportunity cost, which would include all the options? The prevailing opinion was that the opportunity cost could not be applied outside of cases of limited resources. This led some economists to limit the object of economics to [...] "exceptional" [...] resource situations (an idea still present in all economics textbooks). Still unknown are the consequences that might follow from an economic science that has no fixed limits outside of the economic system, in terms of availability of goods.|$|E
2500|$|On D-Day, Donovan {{was on one}} of {{the ships}} that took part in the Normandy landing. Going ashore, he and his {{commander}} of covert operations in Europe, Colonel David Bruce, were shot at by a German plane, then moved on toward the American front lines and encountered German machine-gun fire. As they lay on the ground, Bruce later recalled, Donovan said, [...] "David, we mustn't be captured. We know too much." [...] Donovan said that he had two suicide pills, but then discovered he didn't. [...] "I must shoot first," [...] Donovan said. Bruce replied, [...] "Yes, sir, <b>but</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> do much against machine guns with our pistols?" [...] Donovan explained: [...] "Oh, you don't understand. I mean, if we are about to be captured, I'll shoot you first. After all, I am your commanding officer." ...|$|E

Yes, there is – that I {{do not have}} her forgiveness; and she is and remains an intermediate court, a legitimate court, that must not be bypassed. Her forgiveness certainly cannot justify me eternally, {{no more than a}} person’s implacability can harm anyone but himself, but her forgiveness is a part of a divine procedure.

Be it done for you as you believe. But everything in you that is flesh and blood and is timorousness and attachment to things of this earth must despair, so that you cannot acquire external certainty. If this like for like holds true even in relation to what most definitely must be called Gospel, how much more, then, when Christianity is itself the Law. “Forgive, then you will be forgiven" [...] Works of Love, Sep 29, 1847, Hong 378-380 ...|$|E
