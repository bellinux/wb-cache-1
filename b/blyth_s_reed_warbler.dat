50|$|The Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> Aguiguan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and Saipan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> are {{considered}} subspecies by some taxonomists.|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> looks {{similar to}} the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> but the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is larger in size and has a {{stronger}} supercilium.|$|R
50|$|The Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus orientalis) is a {{passerine}} bird {{of eastern}} Asia {{belonging to the}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> genus Acrocephalus. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (A. arundinaceus) of western Eurasia.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus percernis) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae. It was formerly considered conspecific with the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and together known as the Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the second case of a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> x great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> hybrid (Acrocephalus scirpaceus and A. arundinaceus). The bird was {{captured}} during a standardised ringing session in Belgium in autumn 1999, and fell between the parental species in all measurements. Molecular analyses of two microsatellite loci verified that the bird was a female that had a <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> father and a great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> mother...|$|R
50|$|Most taxonomists regard Garrett's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and the Moorea <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> as distinct. They {{used to be}} {{considered}} subspecies.|$|R
50|$|It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> and together known as the Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
5|$|The species {{exhibits}} {{no sexual}} dimorphism, {{and characteristics of}} the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, {{there is no chance}} that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is slightly smaller than the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is substantially larger, and the Oriental <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{speckled}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or streaked <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus sorghophilus) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.|$|R
500|$|A 2009 phylogenic {{study of}} the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as {{recently}} as 2010 its relation {{with other members of}} the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the [...] Australian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas. The closest relative of the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> A. luscinius yamashinae, but that species is polyphyletic, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the Pagan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands.|$|R
50|$|Though the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in Die Vogelarte der Erde (1980) and Howard and Moore in A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1991), have considered it a subspecies of Acrocephalus luscinius, the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> Recent DNA studies have affirmed {{its status as a}} separate species. It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler.</b> In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir. A 2009 phylogenic study of the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as recently as 2010 its relation {{with other members of the}} genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> forms a clade with the Australian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas.

50|$|The {{species is}} monotypic, {{and there is}} no {{significant}} geographical variation. The sexes are alike in appearance. Hybridisation with both <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> and Blyth's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> has been occasionally recorded.|$|R
50|$|The Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Caroline Islands <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus syrinx) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the Acrocephalidae family. It is found only on the Caroline Islands in Micronesia.|$|R
50|$|The Aguiguan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Aguijan <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus nijoi) {{originally}} {{occurred on}} the Northern Mariana Island Aguigan. It is considered a subspecies of the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> by some taxonomists. Of this subspecies there never have been reports of a substantial population. In 1982 only four up to possibly 15 birds of the subspecies have been counted, and since 1995 none has been sighted, despite extended efforts to find specimens.|$|R
50|$|The {{nightingale}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or Guam <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus luscinius) is an extinct {{song bird}} endemic to Guam. The Chamorro {{name for the}} bird is ga ‘kaliso. It has not been reported since the late 1960s and presumed extinct.|$|R
5000|$|The Mangareva <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or {{astrolabe}} <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Acrocephalus astrolabii) is a presumed extinct songbird {{that existed}} on Mangareva in the Gambier Islands. It is known from only two specimens, and {{is believed to}} have gone extinct in the mid-19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat is}} {{different}} from the reed beds favoured by <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> or the rank vegetation of marsh warbler, this species choosing trees or bushes as songposts. Like most warblers, Blyth's <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> is insectivorous, but will take other small food items, including berries.|$|R
50|$|More than 100 {{host species}} have been recorded: meadow pipit, dunnock and Eurasian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> {{are the most common}} hosts in {{northern}} Europe; garden warbler, meadow pipit, pied wagtail and European robin in central Europe; brambling and common redstart in Finland; and great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> in Hungary.|$|R

50|$|When cuckoo chicks were {{reared in}} the nests of four hosts (<b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> great <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> dunnock and meadow pipit), dunnock-cuckoos began begging {{more rapidly than}} reed warbler-cuckoos despite growing at the same rate. Perhaps surprisingly, the cuckoos do not vary their begging call note {{structure}} to match that of their hosts’ chicks.|$|R
500|$|The Nauru <b>reed</b> <b>warbler</b> (...) , Acrocephalus rehsei, is a {{passerine}} bird {{endemic to}} the island of Nauru in the Pacific Ocean. It {{is one of only}} two native breeding land-birds on Nauru, the other being the Micronesian pigeon, and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other Micronesian reed warblers, all of which evolved from one of several radiations of the genus across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the Carolinian <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the nightingale <b>reed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which was formerly sometimes considered the same species.|$|R
