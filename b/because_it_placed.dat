2500|$|While free-flight {{tests of}} Enterprise {{involved}} {{the release of}} an unpowered aircraft from a powered aircraft, these tests were not typical of drop testing because the orbiter was actually carried and released from a position above the SCA.

[...] As a result, the [...] "drop" [...] was conducted by using a series of carefully planned maneuvers to minimize the risk of aircraft collision. [...] Immediately after release, the Enterprise would climb to the right while the SCA performed a shallow dive to the left, allowing for quick vertical and horizontal separation between the two aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Another reason Tillich criticized {{theological}} theism was <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> God {{into the}} subject-object dichotomy. This {{is the basic}} distinction made in Epistemology, that branch of Philosophy which deals with human knowledge, how it is possible, what it is, and its limits. Epistemologically, God cannot be made into an object, that is, an object of the knowing subject. Tillich deals with this question {{under the rubric of}} the relationality of God. The question is [...] "whether there are external relations between God and the creature". Traditionally Christian theology has always understood the doctrine of creation to mean precisely this external relationality between God, the Creator, and the creature as separate and not identical realities. Tillich reminds us of the point, which can be found in Luther, that [...] "there is no place to which man can withdraw from the divine thou, because it includes the ego and is nearer to the ego than the ego to itself".|$|E

50|$|In 1935, the Commonwealth Government {{passed the}} National Defense Act, which aimed {{to ensure the}} {{security}} of the country. This was criticized <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> the burden of the defense of the Philippines on ground forces, which in turn, was formed from reservists. It discounted the need for a Commonwealth air force and navy, and naval protection was provided by the United States Asiatic Fleet.|$|E
50|$|Rebellion {{was criticized}} despite ambitiously {{depicting}} diplomacy, espionage, and fleet movements within the Star Wars universe. Critics {{argued that the}} game failed to provide an interactive experience <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> {{too much emphasis on}} space battles, with ground battles resolved automatically. Criticism was also levelled at the game's user interface. LucasArts' 2006 game Star Wars: Empire at War was seen as a successor to Rebellion.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{research}} into system modeling has dwindled in favor of other interests {{in the field of}} configuration management.

5000|$|The [...] "Open" [...] in {{the name}} Code Project Open License refers to the license {{offering}} accessibility to the software's source code.

50|$|The system {{discouraged}} manufacturers from {{switching to}} more fuel-efficient overhead valve engines as these generally required larger bores, while the established sidevalve layout could easily use very narrow bores. Despite OHV engines having significant benefits in economy, refinement and performance the RAC system often made these engines {{more expensive to}} run <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> them in a higher tax class than sidevalve engines of identical power output.|$|E
50|$|On August 4, 2004, the Cincinnati City Council {{unanimously}} {{overturned the}} ban <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> {{the city at}} a disadvantage for booking concerts. Many music acts prefer festival seating because it can allow the most enthusiastic fans to get near the stage and generate excitement {{for the rest of}} the crowd. The city had previously made a one-time exception to the ban, allowing festival seating for a Bruce Springsteen concert on November 12, 2002. Cincinnati was, for a time, the only city in the United States to outlaw festival seating altogether.|$|E
50|$|Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008), {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, held that {{immunity}} under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) did not apply to an interactive online operator whose questionnaire violated the Fair Housing Act. However, the court found that Roommates.com was immune under Section 230 of the CDA for the “additional comments” portion of the website. This case is notable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> a limit on the broad immunity that Section 230(c) gives to service providers.|$|E

The basis for Davenant's argument was that [...] "high taxation for debt service was a burden on trade, industry, and land." [...] Davenant still believed that land tax was unfair <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> the heaviest burden of generating public income on the landed gentry, and that the long-term result would be that the gentry would be forced to sell their land to [...] "monied men and usurers" [...] to pay the taxes.|$|E

5000|$|High Priestess of Soul is {{a studio}} album by jazz singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Nina Simone. The songs {{are accompanied by}} a large band directed and arranged by Hal Mooney. The album contains popular songs (such as [...] "Don't You Pay Them No Mind") and African American gospel and folk related songs written by Simone herself (such as [...] "Take Me to the Water" [...] and [...] "Come Ye"). After this album title -an attempt to broaden her appeal by management execs- Nina Simone was sometimes titled “the high priestess of soul”, although she completely rejected the title herself <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> a label on her as an artist.

50|$|A {{lawsuit was}} {{filed against the}} Washington Education Association by Washington Attorney General Christine Gregoire. The Thurston County, Washington Superior Court ruled that the union had to pay $590,375 in fines for {{intentionally}} violating the Washington statute. On appeal, the Washington Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that section 760 of the Washington Fair Campaign Practices Act had violated the First Amendment of the Constitution by placing the speech of union members as more valuable than teachers. However, the case was then appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, which {{ruled in favor of}} the union stating that the law was unconstitutional <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> too large of an administrative burden on the union.

5000|$|Emperor Napoleon III and the Prefect of the Seine Baron Haussmann {{developed}} {{a plan to}} incorporate several of the surrounding communes into the Paris jurisdiction in the late 1850s. Parliament passed the necessary legislation in 1859, and the expansion took effect when the law was promulgated on 3 November 1859 (though city taxes were not extended to the new neighborhoods until 1 July 1860). The previous twelve arrondissements were reorganized from twelve arrondissements into twenty. When Haussmann released his plan for the new boundaries and numbering system, residents of Passy objected <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> them in the new thirteenth arrondissement, {{and at the time}} the expression [...] "they were married in the thirteenth" [...] was [...] "a jocular way of referring to non-marital cohabitation".

50|$|At {{the same}} time, some adherents of the world’s major {{religious}} traditions became attracted to Jesus, yet were not {{drawn to the}} religion or institution of Christianity. In the 1960s, for example, numbers of Jews, after significant study, {{came to the conclusion}} that Jesus was indeed the long awaited Messiah. Yet they had no emotional or cultural link to the Christian religion, which was often seen as a part of Christendom, and associated with countries that had historically mistreated Jews. Therefore, when these Jews embraced Jesus as Messiah, many opted to remain within Judaism rather than convert to Christianity. Since the 1980s, similar phenomena have been seen among those of other non-Christian religious cultures, most notably among Hindus and Muslims. It is important to note that many Jews do not regard Messianic Jews as being true Jews anymore. Furthermore, some Jewish followers of Christ have come to consider that the term 'Messianic Judaism' was a mistake, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>placed</b> 'the emphasis on rabbinic Judaism instead of Jewish culture'.|$|E
50|$|Under the law (PD 1566), the NDCC's {{role as a}} {{temporary}} or ad hoc committee is very limiting <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>places</b> the budget and primary responsibility during natural disasters on the hands of local government officials.
