5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century the romantic medieval gothic style {{appeared}} as a backlash to the symmetry of Palladianism which brought certain changes to the city's appearance. Many of the new churches, for example, {{were built in the}} gothic style as were a number of new villas. Most of the new civic and retail buildings however continued to be designed in the classical mode but along much more ornamented and elborate lines than their 18th century predecessors. However virtually all the new buildings were constructed using the local bath stone so the city continued to have a cohesive look. By the middle of the 19th century, as a result of new technology, construction was able to develop incorporating steel as a <b>building</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E
5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern architectural style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his Pavillon Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's Sainte Marie de La Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, cantilevered over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architectural style of LeCorbusier, he used more architectural restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible <b>building</b> <b>component</b> brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|E

50|$|When {{convection}} currents {{play a part}} in transmitting heat {{across a}} <b>building</b> <b>component,</b> then thermal transmittance increases as the temperature difference increases.

50|$|Capillary tube mats {{are also}} used for thermal <b>building</b> <b>component</b> activation. In {{contrast}} to conventional concrete core activation, the capillary tubes used in thermal <b>building</b> <b>component</b> activation lie about 5 mm close under the ceiling surface. This arrangement ensures a fast reaction and a high transmission performance of up to 90 W/m² (at 10 K temperature difference, see above), and also uses the concrete mass as a thermal accumulator. Capillary tube mats {{can be used for}} the construction of very thinly built-up heating surfaces as underfloor or wall heating. A layer thickness of less than 15 mm is quite feasible. Capillary tube mats {{are also used}} as compact collectors for the exploitation of geothermal energy in heat pump plants. The extractor surface can be reduced in size through the use of capillary tube mats. In the processing and manufacturing industry, capillary tube mats are already in use for the temperature control of things such as acid baths.|$|E

40|$|An {{information}} {{model has been}} developed at the Centre for Building Studies, Concordia University to facilitate the management of design changes through inter-disciplinary coordination. The main component in the {{information model}} is a central project database that {{can be characterized as}} an active repository of <b>building</b> <b>components</b> data. The data in this active repository communicate design changes among affected disciplines and help ensure compatibility of design information. Because buildings are generally unique, a fixed data structure for <b>building</b> <b>components</b> in such an active repository is impractical. This paper proposes a methodology that enables managers of multi-disciplinary design teams to dynamically and transparently assemble and modify the data structure for the active repository of <b>building</b> <b>components</b> {{in such a way as}} to suit a variety of specific building design configurations. The methodology relies on combining some of the capabilities of the object-oriented technology with the flexibility of the relational database technology. To enable the implementation of such a combination, the project database is divided into <b>building</b> <b>components</b> data part and a management data part. The management data allows the model to take advantage of SQL capabilities in controlling the data structure of <b>building</b> <b>components.</b> Design managers are also given the option to assemble the data structure from reusable elements that contain both the <b>building</b> <b>components</b> attributes and the rules that are necessary for managing design changes. These reusable elements are gathered into three levels of increasing complexity: components, systems, and configurations. Such organization greatly facilitates the structuring of the project database and increases the reusability of elements. The paper details the methodology and demonstrates its use with a simple example...|$|R
