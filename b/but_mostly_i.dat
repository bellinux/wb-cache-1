All at once, however, one of the cherubic multitude pulled off his white gown, thus transforming himself before my very eyes into a commonplace youth of the day, in modern frock-coat and trousers of a decidedly provincial cut.

And it happened overnight—one day, you can’t get anyone’s assistance in the supermarket, the next, they’re queuing up to carry your shopping home! Fame didn’t change me—it changed people round me.

Speaking about the development on the material, Valentine revealed that [...] "Moves Like Jagger" [...] {{was the first time}} the band worked with an outside writer, so they decided to implement it more on Overexposed. [...] "At this point in our career I think it was a good thing to completely mix up our process and it yielded good results, as well as a more collaborative spirit within the band. We wanted to make something that sounded contemporary with the elements of a lot of early eras of pop music" [...] explained Valentine. On the development of the album, Levine also commented, [...] "Overexposed is definitely our most diverse and poppiest album yet. We had a great time recording it. I can't wait for our fans to hear the record, as well as hitting the road to play it live for everyone later this year." [...] In another interview for Rolling Stone, the singer revealed that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: [...] "It's very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it - <b>but</b> <b>mostly</b> <b>I</b> love it." [...] The album was executively produced by Max Martin, with additional tracks produced by Benny Blanco and Ryan Tedder. Tedder commented that the sound of the songs was very fresh and would affect kids. However, he further stated, [...] "maintaining that interest — that's the hardest thing in the world." [...] Blanco explained that he and Levine first met during recording the song [...] "Stereo Hearts" [...] by Gym Class Heroes on which Levine is featured. The producer explained that when Levine heard the song he solely wanted in for himself on which Blanco responded that they will make another track for the band. After producing [...] "Moves Like Jagger", he also worked on Overexposed and produced some songs including the lead single of the album, [...] "Payphone". Although new collaborators were recruited to help developing the album, Levine wrote all the songs with additional help from Valentine and produced a large portion of it, including the ballad [...] "Sad". According to Valentine, the development of the song began one morning, when he woke up and [...] "before he was even awake" [...] he was at his living room's piano playing the melody. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that [...] "Sad" [...] is his most personal track on the album, but didn't reveal the inspiration behind it, although critics speculated it was inspired by the singer's break up with Victoria's Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna.|$|E
