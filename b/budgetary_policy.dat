5|$|In July 803, an Abbasid army under al-Qasim, {{a son of}} the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786–809), began {{advancing}} {{towards the}} Byzantine frontier. As Nikephoros had broken his foot in early May, it fell to Bardanes to lead the Byzantine army against the Arabs. He therefore ordered the thematic armies of Anatolia assembled in the Anatolic Theme. In mid-July 803 (the date is variously interpreted by modern scholars as 16, 18 or 19 July), Bardanes was proclaimed emperor by the assembled troops of the Anatolic, Opsician, Thracesian and Bucellarian themes. Crucially, the Armeniac Theme, either because of its traditional rivalry with the Anatolics, or because it had not yet joined up {{with the rest of}} the army, did not join the uprising. It has also been hypothesized that Bardanes may have participated in the suppression of the Armeniacs' revolt in 793, leaving a memory of hostility towards him amongst its troops. Among the Byzantine chronicles that report on Bardanes's revolt, the 10th-century Theophanes Continuatus and the 13th-century Synopsis Chronike indicate that the troops were motivated chiefly by economic concerns. Nikephoros had initiated a strict <b>budgetary</b> <b>policy</b> to shore up the Empire's finances. The Emperor had revoked the exemption on inheritance tax for the soldiers, and had apparently left them unpaid for some time as well. Bardanes, on the other hand, had a good reputation in this regard, fairly dividing the booty won from the campaigns against the Arabs amongst the soldiers.|$|E

Maiorescu was becoming convinced that Carp's ambitions could prove dangerous for their party, and privately complained that his friend still prioritized familial obligations over the business of state. The King too worried that the Junimist <b>budgetary</b> <b>policy</b> was a failure, and Carp, announcing that he was retreating to a private life in the country, handed in his resignation. Although the monarch rejected it, Parliament passed a motion of no confidence. Backed by the German Ambassador Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter, who welcomed its free trade agenda, the cabinet received much German encouragement before Carp's awkward management of the crisis shook Kiderlen's confidence.|$|E

Another factor leading to less control over the budget was a Keynesian belief that balanced budgets were unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|Solid {{budgetary}} discipline {{is an essential}} condition {{for the success of}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

The paper examines whether European Union Member States will have to change their <b>budgetary</b> <b>policies</b> carried out during and after severe recessions, once these procedures become fully operational in the third stage of EMU. The results of this analysis suggest that when starting from a budgetary position of close – to balance or in surplus, the risk of breaching the 3 % reference value is relatively low during one-year recessions but increases in case of deep or protracted recessions. The early years of EMU, when some countries might still have a deficit of about 2 % of GDP, are likely to prove highly problematic {{in the event of a}} severe recession...|$|R

The following section focuses instead on three case studies, to show examples {{of the way in}} which the constraints influenced policy-making without mining the ability of government to adopt unbalanced <b>budgetary</b> <b>policies.</b> The weaknesses are combined with the adoption of a deferential approach by the Courts that generally legitimized the accounting devices adopted by the States.
