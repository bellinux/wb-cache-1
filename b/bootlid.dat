5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, the SS V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the <b>bootlid</b> bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
25|$|A face-lifted {{version of}} the X350 was {{launched}} {{at the end of}} February 2007 with a revised lower grille, prominent faux side air vents, small <b>bootlid</b> spoiler and revised seating.|$|E
25|$|The GTA {{variants}} {{shared a}} common interior with post-facelift 156 variants. The doors, <b>bootlid</b> and bonnet were also shared. All else was unique to the GTA, specifically made by Fiat Research Centre and Maserati Research Centre.|$|E
50|$|Thirty-six these decades, Zagato {{continued}} {{building a}} variety of aerodynamic cars. He adopted inclined windscreens, more aerodynamic headlights, firstly enclosing them in aluminium hemispheres and then incorporating them within the bodywork, convex <b>bootlids</b> and perforated disc wheels that favoured brake cooling. Thirty-six Zagato bodied cars were {{at the start of}} 1938 Mille Miglia.|$|R
2500|$|Leyland's {{corporate}} badge, {{a design}} {{based on the}} spokes of a wheel, appeared on the hubcaps of the 1500FWD, and next to the Triumph name on the metal identification labels fitted to the <b>bootlids</b> of various models. It was also used for the oil filler cap on the Dolomite Sprint engine. However it was never used as a bonnet badge, with models of that era such as the TR6 and the second generation 2000 carrying a badge simply stating the name [...] "Triumph".|$|R
50|$|The CL Series Valiant was {{introduced}} in November 1976. Although it used the same bodyshell as the previous VK range, {{the front and rear}} ends were restyled. The front end used horizontally arrayed quad round headlamps flanking a central grille. The front guards and bonnet were also reworked accordingly. The new <b>bootlid's</b> curved leading edge flowed down to new taillights that sandwiched a simple centre garnish panel. The bumpers, however, were the same units as had been used on the 1969 VF series Valiants.|$|R
25|$|For the 156 GTA, {{weight saving}} {{materials}} {{were also used}} in many other parts like magnesium framed front seats and dashboard frame. The 156 GTA only shared common parts with other 156 variants {{with respect to the}} facelift interior, doors, bonnet and <b>bootlid.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{additions}} {{include a}} new rear diffuser, a rear-wing {{which can be}} raised or lowered, and carbon-ceramic brakes. The <b>bootlid</b> and vented bonnet are also made from carbon fibre to help decrease the car's weight. In early 2008, Aston Martin's CEO confirmed production for V12 Vantage RS for mid-2009.|$|E
25|$|The GT's styling went wilder {{again with}} a 'Shaker' cold-air {{induction}} scoop protruding from {{a hole in the}} bonnet, which now sported twin wide GT stripes from grille to windscreen, rather than the bonnet blackouts of the XW. The thick side stripes remained, although altered slightly, as did the twin driving lights and blacked-out panel between the tail lights. Wheels were now the five-slot steel items first seen on the XW Phase II GT-HO. The Phase III GT-HO also sported a plastic front spoiler and a wild <b>bootlid</b> spoiler styled after those fitted to the Mach series Mustangs.|$|E
25|$|The Proton Prevé GXR CVT {{was finally}} {{launched}} in Australia between November and December 2013, {{almost a year}} after the Prevé GX Australian début. The GXR offers all the exclusive kit first seen on the Malaysian-market Prevé Premium trim and is priced at $23,990 drive-away, with an early bird $1,000 factory bonus. Australian-market Prevé GXRs are fitted with a Turbo badge in place of the usual CFE on the rear <b>bootlid</b> to emphasise the new turbocharged engine and to better distinguish the GXR from the GX variants. Additionally, a 6-speed manual variant of the Prevé GXR will launch {{in the second quarter of}} 2014 with an estimated price of $20,990, or $2,000 less than the GXR CVT currently on sale. Additionally, a more luxurious LE variant and a sportier R3 model will join the Prevé line-up later in 2014. The Prevé will also be offered with an all-new 2.0 litre turbocharged engine in early 2015.|$|E
25|$|The pre-facelift {{models from}} 1984 to 1993 used the model designations: 200/200 T (carburettor), 200 E/200 TE, 230 E/230 TE, 230 CE, 260 E (saloon only), 300 E/TE, 300 CE, 300 E-24/300 CE-24/300 TE-24 valve, 400 E (not in the UK), & 500 E (LHD {{only in the}} UK). Diesels were the 200 D/200 TD (not in the UK), 250 D/250 TD & the 300 D/300 TD. Facelift models {{produced}} from 1993 to 1996 used the model designations: E 200, E 220, E 280, E 320, E 420 (not in the UK) & E 500 (LHD only in the UK). Both saloon and estate versions of the facelifted model carried the same model designation on their <b>bootlid,</b> i.e. the T was no longer used for estate versions. In the UK post-facelift diesels were E 250 Diesel (saloon only) and E 300 Diesel (saloon & estate) models. The W124 was also offered as a long wheelbase targeted for taxi companies, but more luxury equipped version was also used as a limousine.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Ford Australia {{standardised}} {{the use of}} {{the blue}} oval logo across the Escort model range. These Escort models are identified by the familiar blue Ford oval in the centre of the grille and on the <b>bootlid.</b> It also revamped the image of its 'leisure range' by introducing the Escort Sundowner panel van, positioning it as a youth-orientated lifestyle vehicle complete with bold body decorations and domed side windows, available in 1.6L and 2.0L forms. In 1979, Ford Australia gave the Escort an update, increasing basic equipment levels and standardising square headlights on L and GL models (previously only available on Escort Ghia). Chasing both youth and performance, Ford Australia introduced their take on the RS2000, which– complete with its slant-nose– was available in both two-door form and as a unique to Australia four-door, in a choice of five solid paint colours. These RS cars certainly looked the part, but were actually powered by the same 2.0-litre engine {{as the rest of the}} local Escort range, and available with a choice of manual or automatic transmission. A total of 2,400 Australian RS2000 cars were made.|$|E
2500|$|The car used Ford's {{contemporary}} {{design language}} of the period with the black louvred radiator grille and straked rear lamp clusters, as well as introducing the aerodynamic [...] "bustle-back" [...] <b>bootlid</b> stump (trademarked by Ford as Aeroback) which would be further developed in the forthcoming Sierra and Scorpio; the stump was proven to reduce the car's aerodynamic drag co-efficient significantly, which was a class leading 0.37 at launch.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Since the {{taillights}} were {{mounted in}} the <b>bootlid,</b> additional lamps provided rearwards lighting when the boot was open.|$|E
50|$|At the rear, {{the tail}} lamps feature LED-type units with revised {{graphics}} and feature a thinner linking chrome <b>bootlid</b> bar.|$|E
5000|$|Bodykit {{featuring}} {{front wheel}} arch extensions and wheelbase skirts from the Magna VR-X, plus unique rear wheel arch extensions and <b>bootlid</b> spoiler.|$|E
50|$|The 1966 Phoenix {{was coded}} DP6. Changes follow the 1966 Fury III; a new grille, revised rear panels, new {{taillights}} {{and a new}} <b>bootlid.</b>|$|E
50|$|A face-lifted {{version of}} the X350 was {{launched}} {{at the end of}} February 2007 with a revised lower grille, prominent faux side air vents, small <b>bootlid</b> spoiler and revised seating.|$|E
50|$|The GTA {{variants}} {{shared a}} common interior with post-facelift 156 variants. The doors, <b>bootlid</b> and bonnet were also shared. All else was unique to the GTA, specifically made by Fiat Research Centre and Maserati Research Centre.|$|E
50|$|In March 1938 the PV51 Special and the PV52 Special were introduced. On {{these cars}} the spare wheel was {{moved from the}} <b>bootlid</b> to the boot floor. The cars had an {{expanded}} boot to increase the luggage space.|$|E
50|$|For the 156 GTA, {{weight saving}} {{materials}} {{were also used}} in many other parts like magnesium framed front seats and dashboard frame. The 156 GTA only shared common parts with other 156 variants {{with respect to the}} facelift interior, doors, bonnet and <b>bootlid.</b>|$|E
50|$|The PV802 {{could be}} used as a spare ambulance. After folding all seats on the car’s right side, a {{stretcher}} could be loaded through the <b>bootlid.</b> Volvo continued to build commercial chassis versions, which were often used as basis for proper ambulances.|$|E
50|$|The Premier was {{developed}} from the Pimlico in 1988, featuring lowered doorsills which enabled double skinned, internally hinged doors to be fitted. It also allows a regular Mini <b>bootlid</b> to be used.A variant, the Premier Plus is identical other than being six inches (152 mm) longer.|$|E
50|$|Cars from 1998 onwards (1999 model year) {{received}} further enhancements, {{including an}} aluminium-effect centre console on certain versions and a chrome Peugeot logo {{on the steering}} wheel. Other updates included removal of the black strip on the <b>bootlid,</b> colour-coded bumpers on some models and new upholstery in the cabin.|$|E
50|$|Other {{additions}} {{include a}} new rear diffuser, a rear-wing {{which can be}} raised or lowered, and carbon-ceramic brakes. The <b>bootlid</b> and vented bonnet are also made from carbon fibre to help decrease the car's weight. In early 2008, Aston Martin's CEO confirmed production for V12 Vantage RS for mid-2009.|$|E
50|$|The Hawk, a re-badged Hillman 14 (1938-1940) was {{the first}} Humber car to be {{launched}} after World War II. Slightly longer {{because of the new}} <b>bootlid</b> superimposed on its fastback tail and narrower having shed its running boards it also managed to be 112 lb lighter than the prewar car.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{shape and}} styling of the MG ZT {{remained}} {{the same as for}} the Rover 75 but with changes to the front bumper, now with an integrated grille, and detail alterations including colour coding of the chromed waistline, a new <b>bootlid</b> plinth, and different alloy wheels and tyres sizes.|$|E
5000|$|The Aston Martin Vanquish S debuted at the 2004 Paris Auto Show, with {{increased}} horsepower and performance and slight styling revisions. The engine displacement remained at , with power increased from [...] Visual changes included new wheels, {{a slightly different}} nose shape, a new raised <b>bootlid</b> with a larger integrated spoiler incorporating the third high level brake light (in the rear window on the original Vanquish), a Vanquish S badge on the <b>bootlid</b> (the original Vanquish had no rear model designation) {{and the addition of}} a small front splitter (although this was mainly done for aerodynamic reasons). As part of its improvements, the Vanquish S featured a slightly improved coefficient of drag of 0.32 (from 0.33), with help from a redesigned splitter and boot lid. Its front and rear track were 1524 mm and 1529 mm, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The Wolseley 6/90 is a car {{produced}} by Wolseley Motors Limited in the United Kingdom from 1954 to 1959. Announced {{on the first}} day of the October 1954 Motor Show, the 6/90 replaced the 6/80 as the company's flagship model. It was badged with Six-Ninety on the bonnet and with 6/90 on the <b>bootlid.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Evolution" [...] model (also called [...] "EVO2") {{produced}} up to [...] Other Evolution {{model changes}} included larger wheels (16 X 7.5 inches), thinner rear and side window glass, a lighter <b>bootlid,</b> a deeper front splitter and additional rear spoiler. It was only available in coupe and convertible bodies; no saloon option was available.|$|E
50|$|Key {{exterior}} design elements include uniquely shaped headlights, a bold grille with diamond-shaped inserts, prominent {{front wheel}} arch flares, strong structure to the flanks, heavily plunging roofline, prominent hunches over {{the rear wheel}} arches, a generously tapered glasshouse, acutely angled rear window, high-set <b>bootlid,</b> horizontally mounted tail-lights and trapezoidal tailpipes integrated into the lower section of the rear bumper.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was also}} built in Turkey, by Tofaş. The Turkish built cars {{generally}} did not feature catalytic converters and some thus have marginally {{more power than}} the models listed in the table beneath. The Turkish cars also have a small [...] "Tofaş" [...] logo {{on the left side}} of the <b>bootlid,</b> and production there continued at least until 2000.|$|E
50|$|The RV1 Valiant was {{the first}} Australian car to come with an {{alternator}} instead of a generator, and instead of coil springs, the Valiant came with torsion bar suspension. Brakes were hydraulic 9 in drums front and rear. The RV1 had a simulated spare wheel outline on the <b>bootlid,</b> but the spare wheel was actually under {{the floor of the}} boot.|$|E
50|$|In March 1962, Chrysler {{replaced}} the American 1961-model R Valiant with the American 1962 SV1 (S Series) Valiant. The SV1 {{used the same}} body shell as the RV1, with cosmetic changes including the deletion of the simulated spare wheel on the <b>bootlid,</b> and round tail lamps replacing the R-model's cat-eye shaped ones. There was a revised radiator grille and new exterior trim.|$|E
50|$|The XC60 {{concept was}} {{a preview of}} the {{production}} XC60. It included a glass roof and a newly styled grille, with a much larger Volvo logo along with the 'V' which is shaped on the Volvo. The model introduced Volvo's new 'DNA' which they slowly implementing throughout the model range. The XC60 concept also included a new shifting mechanism, electronic <b>bootlid,</b> and 20 inch wheels.|$|E
50|$|Production of Series 3 cars {{lasted from}} 1973 through October 1978, but was halted {{for all of}} 1975. 967 {{examples}} were produced in this time. While earlier V8 cars have louvers cut into the little panel mounted beneath the rear windshield, the Series 3 and later cars instead have a small lip {{at the bottom of}} this panel, just ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} <b>bootlid.</b>|$|E
