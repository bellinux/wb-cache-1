The information to be recovered includes the header of an image (width, height, color space etc.) and the data stream {{which might have been}} partially damaged. We begin our discussion on common image formats and necessary information for the image recovery. We then define several measures on image contents to facilitate the image recovery. Using these measures, an effective recovery algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show that the algorithm can successfully recover images of different formats, even multi-frame images from <b>broken</b> image <b>streams</b> in most cases.

60|$|Drops of water, or a thin <b>broken</b> <b>stream,</b> {{falling from}} a height on the {{filaments}}, {{did not cause}} the blades to close; though these filaments were afterwards proved to be highly sensitive. No doubt, {{as in the case}} of Drosera, the plant is indifferent to the heaviest shower of rain. Drops of a solution of a half an ounce of sugar to a fluid ounce of water were repeatedly allowed to fall from a height on the filaments, but produced no effect, unless they adhered to them. Again, I blew many times through a fine pointed tube with my utmost force against the filaments without any effect; such blowing being received [page 292] with as much indifference as no doubt is a heavy gale of wind. We thus see that the sensitiveness of the filaments is of a specialised nature, being related to a momentary touch rather than to prolonged pressure; and the touch must not be from fluids, such as air or water, but from some solid object.|$|E

It was the winged figure of a woman of such marvellous loveliness and {{delicacy}} of form that the size seemed rather to add to than to detract from its so human and yet more spiritual beauty. She was bending forward and poising herself upon her half-spread wings as though to preserve her balance as she leant. Her arms were outstretched like those of some woman about to embrace one she dearly loved, while her whole attitude gave an impression of the tenderest beseeching. Her perfect and most gracious form was naked, save--and here came the extraordinary thing--the face, which was thinly veiled, {{so that we could}} only trace the marking of her features.

He would have placed the larger windows at the same level with the other two, and have introduced above them smaller windows, like those of the upper story in the older building, as if that upper story had been continued along the fa√ßade. But the old Venetian thought of the honor of the paintings, and the comfort of the senate, before his own reputation. He unhesitatingly raised the large windows to their proper position with reference to the interior of the chamber, and suffered the external appearance to take care of itself. And I believe the whole pile rather gains than loses in effect by the variation thus obtained in the spaces of wall above and below the windows.|$|R

50|$|The Global Service for Mobile {{communications}} (GSM), {{with the}} greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. In the GSM, only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is optionally encrypted with a weak and <b>broken</b> <b>stream</b> cipher (A5/1 or A5/2). The authentication is unilateral and also vulnerable. There are also many other security vulnerabilities and shortcomings.

SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its store-and-forward feature, and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet.

Another concern arises when an adversary gets access to a phone and reads the previous unprotected messages.|$|E
50|$|Underground {{sprinklers}} function through {{means of}} basic electronic and hydraulic technology. This valve {{and all of}} the sprinklers that will be activated by this valve are known as a zone. Upon activation, the solenoid, which sits on top of the valve is magnetized lifting a small stainless steel plunger in its center. By doing this, the activated (or raised) plunger allows air to escape from the top of a rubber diaphragm located {{in the center of the}} valve. Water that has been charged and waiting on the bottom of this same diaphragm now has the higher pressure and lifts the diaphragm. This pressurized water is then allowed to escape down stream of the valve through a series of pipes, usually made of PVC (higher pressure commercial systems) or polyethylene pipe (for typically lower pressure residential systems). At the end of these pipes and flush to ground level (typically) are pre measured and spaced out sprinklers. These sprinklers can be fixed spray heads that have a set pattern and generally spray between 1.5-2m (7-15 ft.), full rotating sprinklers that can spray a <b>broken</b> <b>stream</b> of water from 6-12m (20-40 ft.), or small drip emitters that release a slow, steady drip of water on more delicate plants such as flowers and shrubs. use of indigenous materials also recommended.|$|E
