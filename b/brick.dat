5|$|Dutch <b>brick</b> {{is a type}} of <b>brick</b> made in the Netherlands, {{or similar}} <b>brick,</b> and an {{architectural}} style of building with <b>brick</b> developed by the Dutch. The <b>brick,</b> made from clay dug from river banks or dredged from river beds and fired {{over a long period of}} time, was known for its durability and appearance.|$|E

5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older <b>brick</b> temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the <b>brick</b> temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the <b>brick</b> temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the <b>brick</b> shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E
40|$|The use {{of earth}} <b>bricks</b> in Scanian {{building}} tradition The present work {{is concerned with}} the manufacturing and use of earth <b>bricks</b> in built heritage in the south Swedish province of Scania. The first part of the study provides a thorough description of the traditional use and manufacturing of earth <b>bricks</b> based on relevant literature, archive material as well as interviews with informants. This forms a basis for {{the second part of the}} study in which practical experiments on and tests with earth <b>bricks</b> where carried out. This involved the making of traditional earth <b>bricks</b> of different composition. The new handmade <b>bricks</b> were compared with industrially produced <b>bricks</b> (extrusion <b>bricks)</b> and old handmade <b>bricks.</b> The purpose of the comparison was to study how different manufacturing methods and compositions affect the <b>bricks</b> ability to resist water. The results of the test clearly indicated that industrially made <b>bricks</b> have a much lower resistance to water than handmade <b>bricks.</b> Furthermore, <b>bricks</b> with an addition of straw showed better results than any of the other <b>bricks</b> in the comparison. It is argued that the different properties of industrially produced <b>bricks</b> and handmade <b>bricks</b> must be taken into consideration when built heritage with earth <b>bricks</b> is to be restored. If possible, traditionally made earth <b>bricks</b> should be used not only because its water resisting properties are superior but also because the use of traditional methods and materials contributes to the preservation of traditional craftmanship, which in itself carries a cultural value...|$|R

500|$|The temple {{is built}} on a cushion of {{alluvium}} on which a layer of man-made <b>bricks</b> were laid. On top of this were another four layers of man-made <b>bricks</b> separated by four layers of laterite. There were two types of <b>bricks</b> used: large-sized laterite <b>bricks</b> of the Sangam period and thin, tabular <b>bricks</b> of a later age. [...] The <b>bricks</b> were plastered together with lime.|$|R
5|$|Imported Dutch <b>brick</b> {{was often}} used in {{buildings}} in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. In Dartmouth, a house built in 1664 for mariner Robert Plumleigh had traditional timber-framed architecture but included elaborate star-shaped chimney stacks made from imported Dutch <b>brick.</b> Houses in Topsham, Devon, also used Dutch <b>brick</b> for chimneys, window heads and dressing. One house from the late 17th century in Dutch Court in Topsham is built entirely of Dutch <b>brick.</b> The ports of Exeter and Topsham both shipped wool to the Netherlands, and the returning ships brought bricks as ballast from Amsterdam or Rotterdam.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1997, a new film, This <b>Brick,</b> was premiered. The film {{consisted}} of one three-minute {{shot of a}} <b>brick</b> made {{from the ashes of}} the money burnt at Jura. It was shown at the Barbican Centre prior to Drummond and Cauty's performance as 2K.|$|E
5|$|Rideau Cottage is a two-level, 22-room Georgian Revival building. Originally, the {{structure}} had 14 rooms {{on a single}} floor. An 1872 remodel, using a different <b>brick,</b> added both the second level and a verandah on three sides of the ground floor. During that remodel, the exterior <b>brick</b> of the first floor was covered in stucco painted to appear like <b>brick.</b> (When the verandah was removed some time later, the stucco remained.) Between 1999 and 2000, the building underwent major renovations to the basement, roof and interior finishes, and the mechanical and electrical systems were upgraded. Outside, the stucco was removed and each <b>brick</b> and joint was individually dyed to give a uniform appearance. It was again renovated in 2013.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to clear a certain number of <b>bricks</b> in each level in order to fill up the Brick-O-Meter. Players control a ship which moves {{horizontally}} along the bottom of the screen. The ship can grab and release <b>bricks</b> (up to 6 of the same-colored <b>bricks</b> at a time), moving them from one column to another. If the player releases <b>bricks</b> such that 4 of more <b>bricks</b> of the same color are touching, the <b>bricks</b> explode. As <b>bricks</b> explode, the <b>bricks</b> below move up to fill in the gaps. If this causes 4 or more <b>bricks</b> of the same color to meet, they too will automatically explode (referred to as a combo).|$|R

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. The house itself has three storeys constructed of red <b>brick.</b> The ground floor level has a rubbed <b>brick</b> band at nine courses, and another rubbed <b>brick</b> band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored <b>brick.</b> Red <b>brick</b> belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored <b>brick</b> on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full <b>brick</b> basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{physical}} properties and mechanical properties of Oil Palm Trunk (OPT) fibre and Oil Palm Fruit Bunches (OPFB) fibre reinforced laterite <b>bricks.</b> For comparison purposes, the properties such as dimension, density, water absorption and the compressive strength of both types of <b>bricks</b> were determined. The effects of the incorporation of various amounts of fibres on the above properties were analysed. The tests were carried out according to BS 3821 : 1985 for clay <b>bricks.</b> The samples were pressed at the factory Majpadu <b>Bricks</b> Sdn. Bhd., Malaysia and tested at the Material Testing Laboratory, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Malaysia. The findings of this research were, firstly, the dimension of <b>bricks</b> content with OPFB fibres were less accurate than <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. Secondly, the density of <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was higher than the density of <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. Thirdly, in compressive strength of the <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was higher than <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres, with the maximum fibre content identified as 3 percent fibres. Finally, the water absorption of <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres was lower than the water absorption of <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. It can be concluded that the <b>bricks</b> with OPFB fibres had better physical and mechanical properties than <b>bricks</b> with OPT fibres. </p...|$|R
25|$|For {{a double}} Flemish bond {{of one and}} a half bricks' thickness, facing <b>bricks</b> and the <b>bricks</b> behind the facing <b>bricks</b> may be laid in groups of four <b>bricks</b> and a half-bat.

25|$|The <b>bricks</b> have {{indeterminate}} numerals {{that can}} be read as 1632 or 1682, and the numerals's style does not match colonial scripts. The <b>bricks</b> also have a mortar coating indicating that they may have been re-used as interior <b>bricks</b> in later repairs, alterations, or new construction. The best case scenario is the <b>bricks</b> were part of an earlier church at the same site, then re-used as interior <b>bricks</b> in the 1680 church. However, Upton asserts the <b>bricks</b> are clearly forgeries.|$|R
5|$|The station {{consists}} of a parallel boiler house and turbine hall, which creates a large double-gabled building. It is of steel frame construction with <b>brick</b> cladding. Other features include round-headed openings and ridge ventilators. This building originally housed the station's boilers and turbo generators. Constructed alongside the station was a <b>brick</b> built chimney, to remove gasses from the boilers. The station was first <b>brick</b> built power station in North East England, with corrugated iron being the usual material used prior to this.|$|E
5|$|Though Han wooden {{structures}} decayed, some Han-dynasty ruins made of <b>brick,</b> stone, and rammed earth remain intact. This includes stone pillar-gates, <b>brick</b> tomb chambers, rammed-earth city walls, rammed-earth and <b>brick</b> beacon towers, rammed-earth {{sections of the}} Great Wall, rammed-earth platforms where elevated halls once stood, and two rammed-earth castles in Gansu. The ruins of rammed-earth walls that once surrounded the capitals Chang'an and Luoyang still stand, along with their drainage systems of <b>brick</b> arches, ditches, and ceramic water pipes. Monumental stone pillar-gates, twenty-nine of which survive from the Han period, formed entrances of walled enclosures at shrine and tomb sites. These pillars feature artistic imitations of wooden and ceramic building components such as roof tiles, eaves, and balustrades.|$|E

25|$|How {{were the}} <b>bricks</b> stuck together? One {{hypothesis}} is that the builders at Mỹ Sơn developed a way to glue <b>bricks</b> together using tree resin native to central Vietnam. Another {{hypothesis is that}} the builders used a sticky mortar made from the same clay as the <b>bricks</b> themselves. The latter hypothesis is supported by chemical tests that have found no trace of any organic substance between the <b>bricks,</b> but instead have found mineral substances similar to those present {{in the core of}} the <b>bricks.</b> Today the mortar that once held the <b>bricks</b> together has largely decayed, and even a strong wind can knock loose <b>bricks</b> from the structures.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology for making <b>bricks,</b> in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly manner, using the tailings produced from iron ore mines in Western Australia (WA). The study {{was based on}} the geopolymerisation process, which is known to conserve energy by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. The reduction is accomplished by avoiding the processes of high temperature kiln firing, traditionally utilised when making <b>bricks</b> from sandy soils with high clay content. In this study, the sodium silicate was added to the mine tailings in powder form, as an activator for the formulation of the geopolymer <b>bricks.</b> The effects of the initial setting time, curing temperature, curing time and activator content on the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), water absorption and other durability properties of the <b>bricks</b> were investigated. X-ray diffraction analysis was performed to investigate the phase composition of the geopolymer <b>bricks.</b> The <b>bricks</b> achieved an UCS as high as 50. 53 MPa for the optimum values of the parameters. Technically, the geopolymer <b>bricks</b> that were produced met both the American Society of Testing and Materials and the Australian Standards (AS) requirements for <b>bricks.</b> A cost analysis of the geopolymer <b>bricks</b> is also presented, and this shows that the cost of geopolymer <b>bricks</b> is lower than that of the commercial, fired clay <b>bricks...</b>|$|R
