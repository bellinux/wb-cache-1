Disertantė atliktu originaliu tyrimu siekė nustatyti save ir kitus žalojančio elgesio kitimus paauglystės laikotarpiu ir išskirti psichosocialinius veiksnius, susijusius su šiuo elgesiu; patikrinti probleminio elgesio teorijos pritaikymo galimybes save ir kitus žalojančiam elgesiui paaiškinti. In her dissertation, L Šeibokaitė {{analyzes}} {{gender differences}} in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others, changes in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others from 5 th to 12 th grade, and relationships among forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others. The study also analyzes psychosocial factors related to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others. In her study, 2, 894 students from grade 5 to grade 12 were assessed {{at the beginning of}} study and at the time of discharge using measures of psychosocial functioning in adolescence (Goštautas, 1998), Health and Lifestyle questions from the international Kaunas Rotterdam Intervention Study (Glazunov, Dowd, Baubinienė et al., 1981), the Abstract Thinking Scale from Cattell’s 16 Factor Inventory (1979), Rokeach values (Goštautas, Goštautas, 1996; Rokeach, 1969) and other social-demographic data. The survey was administered during years 2003, 2004 and 2005, each time following the same procedure. The results of the study show that boys are more prone to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> compared to girls; harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others has different transitional trends from 5 th to 12 th grade; changes in harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others occur due to age effect, but not the cohort effect; the relationship among forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others has been determined; psychosocial factors are related to harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others; there are different groups of students according to links between forms of harmful <b>behavior</b> towards <b>self</b> and others; the results of this research partly expand the Theory of Problem Behavior. The scientific review of L. Šeibokaitė’s dissertation includes scientific analysis of the methodological aspects of the dissertation as well as its originality, novelty, actuality, practicality and scientific significance...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{investigation}} is to assess the relationship between false <b>self</b> <b>behavior,</b> object relations and attachment variables, and adjustment. Theory suggests that object relations and attachment are interrelated, and have been independently linked to psychological consequences. Theory also postulates a relationship between false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> and object relations theory. Given the interrelatedness of object relations and attachment theory {{it is possible that}} false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> may also be linked to attachment variables. While the relationship between object relations and false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> seems to have been established object relations theory and attachment theory have not been studied in tandem as related to false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> In addition, this investigation will explore the relationship of adjustment variables to attachment and object relations variables. Undergraduate males and females will be solicited for participation, and will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires measuring false <b>self</b> <b>behavior,</b> object relations, attachment, and adjustment. The primary research hypothesis is that less false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> will be related to mature object relations, secure attachment, and fewer symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{experimental}} manipulation {{was used}} to investigate the effect of peer unconditional regard on adolescents’ false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> A total of 387 (M= 13. 4 years) participants conducted a brief writing task, focusing on unconditional regard. Receiving unconditional regard implies that one is accepted for who {{he or she is}} and that, as a consequence, one does not have to show as much false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> Of specific interest to the current study was whether unconditional regard could be beneficial in order to reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> in children with a high in need for approval. Further from that, it was proposed that children {{with a high level of}} need for approval would also score high on false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> and that girls show more false <b>self</b> <b>behavior</b> than boys. Results support these latter two hypotheses. No evidence was found for the prediction that unconditional regard may reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior.</b> These results demonstrate that reflecting on unconditional support does not reduce false <b>self</b> <b>behavior,</b> regardless of need for approval levels...|$|R

Cross sectional study was conducted among 274 respondents aged 13 to 15 years old. A questionnaire comprising sociodemographic items, Eating Behavior Patterns Questionnaire (EBPQ), Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale and exam result were taken. Significant relationship were found between low fat eating behavior with academic achievement with (p = 0. 008). There was no significant association between meal skipping, emotional, snacking and convenience eating <b>behavior</b> and <b>self</b> esteem toward academic achievement with (p = 0. 412) (p = 0. 243) (0. 05) and (p = 0. 812), respectively.

Its scope equals that of Skinner's nontechnical writings, but Baum's approach is more molar and more pragmatic than Skinner's. The book's second purpose is to embed behavioral science firmly {{in the context of}} Darwinian evolution. Baum is generally successful, we believe, in both of these ambitious purposes...|$|R
