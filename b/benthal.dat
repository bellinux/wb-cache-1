5|$|The {{proliferation}} of phumdis, coupled with severe infestation {{of the lake}} by water hyacinth, has substantially impeded water circulation and caused an increase in siltation and deposit of pollutants in the lake ecosystem. The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of <b>benthal,</b> which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as epilimnion, where fish survive to some degree. The <b>benthal</b> is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

50|$|The {{profundal zone}} {{is a deep}} zone of an inland body of {{freestanding}} water, such as a lake or pond, located below the range of effective light penetration. This is typically below the thermocline, the vertical zone in the water through which temperature drops rapidly. The temperature difference may {{be large enough to}} hamper mixing with the littoral zone in some seasons which causes a decrease in oxygen concentrations. The profundal is often defined, in accordance with Thienemann (1925), as the deepest, vegetation-free, and muddy zone of the lacustrine <b>benthal.</b> The profundal zone is often part of the aphotic zone.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 In situ {{light and}} dark planktonic and <b>benthal</b> respirometers were {{used to measure the}} oxygen {{requirements}} of Yaquina estuary water and <b>benthal</b> deposits. Respirometer devices were constructed so that actual conditions of mixing could be simulated and <b>benthal</b> deposit disturbance would be minimized. A mathematical model of a <b>benthal</b> respirometer was developed and was used to make corrections for respirometer leakage and to conduct oxygen transfer parameter sensitivity studies. The effect of mixing on <b>benthal</b> oxygen uptake was studied by varying the simulated mixing velocities. Studies were made {{to determine the effects of}} scour of bottom material on the salinity of the respirometer water and on the <b>benthal</b> oxygen uptake rates. Plots of various parameters such as <b>benthal</b> oxygen uptake versus dissolved oxygen concentration and respirometer leakage versus time were made to attempt to evaluate relationships that may exist...|$|E
40|$|This report {{discusses}} the measured distribution of total and {{low molecular weight}} organic halides through a Kraft mill aerated lagoon. Both <b>benthal</b> interstitial water and corresponding overlying water patterns were measured. <b>Benthal</b> solids were analyzed for extractable organic halide and for total halide concentration. Octanol/water partition coefficients were calculated for lagoon influent and inplant acid and caustic sewers. Ether extractables of the influent and sewers were determined at high and low pH. The extent of organic halide partitioning between the overlying water and the <b>benthal</b> zone {{is indicative of the}} role of biosorption in the transport of organic halide compounds from the water column to the <b>benthal</b> zone of the lagoon.

40|$|Settleable solids {{accumulate}} (<b>benthal</b> layer) in stabilization lagoons, reducing volume {{for treatment}} {{and providing a}} source of oxygen demand and nutrients (feedback). The objective {{of this research was}} to define the impact of overwater dissolved oxygen (DO) and temperature upon these <b>benthal</b> properties. Batch <b>benthal</b> deposits (2 : 1, vol/vol, primary clarifier underflow and waste activated sludge) under a continuous-flow overwater layer were subject to variable temperature and DO. Experiment conditions simulated a facultative lagoon. Over 124 days, DO uptake was measured and effluent was sampled for chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia-N, and ortho-phosphate. Nearly all phosphorus feedback occurred in the first 31 days, and ammonia-N feedback was most constant for the duration. COD feedback was greatly reduced and DO uptake increased slightly with increasing DO. All feedbacks increased more from 15 °C to 20 °C than from 20 °C to 26 °C. Residual sludge analyses indicated that phosphorus was limiting to <b>benthal</b> stabilization. Temperature dependent reactions caused a linear decrease in total and volatile suspended solids...|$|E
40|$|Raw and {{digested sludge}} from the New York Metropolitan area is {{presently}} barged {{out to sea}} for ultimate disposal. This report {{presents the results of}} laboratory studies {{to determine the effects of}} various types of sludge treatment - digestion, wet oxidation and heat treatment - on the <b>benthal</b> oxygen demands and leaching rates of sludge deposits. Two types of laboratory studies were conducted: (1) Warburg studies to determine the oxygen demand of the sludges when in an aerobic condition and (2) continuous flow reactor studies with the sludge layered on the bottom of reactors to simulate actual sludge deposits. The results of the studies indicated that treatment of the sludge prior to disposal at sea would significantly reduce the <b>benthal</b> oxygen demands and leaching rates of the bottom deposits. An oxygen diffusion analysis indicated that anaerobic decomposition in the raw, digested, heat-treated and low wet oxidized sludge layers markedly increased the <b>benthal</b> oxygen demands. In contrast the bottom layers of the intermediate and h i g h wet oxidized sludges were relatively dormant with negligible anaerobic decomposition occurring...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{studied the}} destruction of organic halides initially attached to sludge solids resulting from the secondary treatment of Kraft wastewater. The sludge solids were evaluated for Adsorbable organic halide (AOX) in static <b>benthal</b> deposits {{as a function of}} overlying water and the reduction in organic loading on static <b>benthal</b> sludges was compared with the resuspended and completely mixed deposits. Organic chlorine on the sludge was most effectively reduced under full strength Kraft wastewater. There were no significant increases in inorganic chloride content in the overall system in spite of decrease in total organic chlorine. The sum of sludge, water and gas-phase halides was not constant across the sludge/water system but decreased by at least 50 % in each of the reactors...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} reported herein {{was conducted}} to monitor the adsorbable organic halide (AOX) in wastewater from two Kraft mill facilities employing aerated stabilization basins (ASB) to treat the wastewater. Bulk water AOX across the ASB was characterized by apparent molecular weight (AMW) through ultrafiltration. Changes in the AMW fractions were evaluated to identify possible removal pathways for AOX. Seasonal variations such as temperature were explored to identify their influence on the ASBs ability to remove AOX. <b>Benthal</b> solids and interstitial water were utilized to estimate the partitioning of AOX between the water column and the benthic layer. The extent of organic halide partitioning between the overlying water and the <b>benthal</b> zone {{is indicative of the}} role biosorption plays in the transport of organic halide from the water column to the benthic layer. An attempt was made to ascertain apparent dehalogenation in the sediment layer of the ASB...|$|E

40|$|This article {{contains}} a quantitative analysis {{of the content of}} heavy metals in soils, waters and sediments of the Verkhniy Kuz'minskiy pond in Moscow. This pond, coupled with other water bodies of the recreation area, represent a historical monument included into the UNESCO registrar. It is common practice to consider heavy metals and toxic elements as target research components. In most cases, these substances serve as the markers of the human activity. Besides, iron was also included into the list of target research components due to the possibility of the ferrocene admixture in the fuel. This decision was also substantiated by the data obtained {{on the basis of the}} analysis of samples of soil, water and <b>benthal</b> deposits of the Bol'shoy Troparevskiy Pond in Moscow. The quantitative analysis performed according to GOST 17. 4. 02 — 83 (State Standard 17. 4. 02 — 83) included elements of the ICP-MS technique. The variations factor was calculated for the heavy metals content in the soil, water and <b>benthal</b> deposits. Highly concentrated elements were found there. A comparison with the prior data on the content of the above components in the Bol'shoy Troparevskiy Pond was performed to identify patterns of distribution and accumulation of the components under research.

U radu su iznesene neke ekološke odlike riba koje čine riblju populaciju Mavrovske akumulacije, u kojoj obitava jedna autohtona i šest unesenih vrsta riba: Salmo trutta (Linnaeus, 1758), Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1796), Leuciscus cephalus (Linnaeus, 1758), Pachychilon pictum (Heckel & Kner, 1858), Phoxinus phoxinus (Linnaeus, 1758), Barbus peloponnesius Valenciennes, 1844 i Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758). Tijekom istraživanja vrsta Ph. phoxinus je nestala. Najgušću populaciju ima A. alburnus, pelagična, ali i litoralna vrsta u isto vrijeme; na drugom je mjestu P. pictum, endemična vrsta za slijev, bentosna, kao što je i B. peloponnesius.
