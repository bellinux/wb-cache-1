Uematsu struggled with composition at first, as the Game Boy's sound hardware {{was different from the}} Famicom's, featuring a new stereo option, unique waveforms, and only three musical notes. Kawazu wanted the game's music to resemble that of Square's two preceding Final Fantasy titles, but Uematsu chose to develop new waveforms.

500|$|On September 28, the Mets {{came into}} Philadelphia for a three-game {{series against the}} Phillies. The Mets were [...] games out of first with six games left: three against the Phillies and the last three against the first-place Cardinals. They had an {{opportunity}} to win the division and were playing the Phillies, against whom they had a season record of 12–3. The Mets won the opener, 1–0, to move within two games back with five remaining to play. However, the Phillies effectively ended their season on September 29. As the Cardinals swept a doubleheader from the Montréal Expos, the Phillies' Don Carman pitched a complete-game one-hitter, facing only 28 batters to shut out the Mets. After the game, Mets manager Davey Johnson said, [...] "How does it feel now? Empty? Not yet. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> get help. When you play 162 games and you're eliminated, then you feel empty. And sick." [...] He promised reporters, [...] "We're going to win tomorrow night.". The following night, Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden struck out 10, and left after pitching nine innings with the score tied at three runs each, but the Phillies' Luis Aguayo won the game with a 10th-inning pinch-hit home run off of Orosco, clinching at least a tie for first place in the division for the Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|The {{team could}} only manage a draw against Chelsea on 8 September 2001, {{in a game}} {{described}} by The Guardian writer David Lacey as one where [...] "the teams simply battered away at each other until one cracked." [...] Henry scored the winning goal away to newly promoted outfit Fulham; the 3–1 victory moved Arsenal {{to the top of}} the league for the first time in the campaign. Against Bolton Wanderers, Arsenal was held to a 1–1 draw after Jeffers' goal was cancelled out by Michael Ricketts. A win at Derby County, where Henry scored two goals was followed by an identical scoreline against Southampton at the new St. Mary's Stadium. At home to Blackburn Rovers, midfielder Keith Gillespie gave the visitors the lead, before Pirès equalised and Bergkamp put Arsenal in front. A mistake by Lauren presented David Dunn the chance to shoot [...] "from 25 yards" [...] and score. Henry's controlled effort looked to have been the winner for Arsenal, until a pass by Tugay caused goalkeeper Wright to [...] "race out of his goal" [...] – the loose ball was collected by Dunn who shot into the empty net. Although Wenger was disappointed with the manner of the defeat, he saw some encouragement: [...] "What's positive for everyone is that Manchester United are dropping points as well. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> rectify the fact we concede goals at home." [...] October ended with a draw against Sunderland, where notably former Arsenal player Stefan Schwarz equalised for the home side and Patrick Vieira missed a penalty.|$|E

Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher with nine or more strikeouts in four consecutive starts since Hideo Nomo in 1996 Chad Billingsley matched Kershaw with eight shutout innings on July 8, Rafael Furcal came up with his first RBI since May 29 {{in the bottom of the}} eighth and rookie closer Javy Guerra escaped a bases loaded situation in the ninth as the Dodgers won their second straight shutout, 1-0, against the San Diego Padres. The next day was another pitching duel. Aaron Harang [...] and Rubby De La Rosa both pitched great games, De La Rosa only allowed one hit in his six innings of work and Harang was working on a no-hitter when he was taken out of the game after six. The Dodgers did not record a hit in the game until Juan Uribe doubled with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off Luke Gregerson. Dioner Navarro then singled him home for the winning run in the Dodgers second straight 1-0 victory over the Padres and their third straight shut out win. Andre Ethier hit two home runs on July 10, to lead the Dodgers to a 4-1 victory, their first series sweep of the season and first four-game winning streak of the season. They climbed out of last place and headed into the all-star break with a [...] 41-51 record.|$|E
