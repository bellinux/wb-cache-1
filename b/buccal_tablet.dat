Methods: A 4 -year budget impact model was developed for the period 2012 – 2015 for patients with BTcP from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. BTcP products included in this model were rapid-onset opioids containing fentanyl (buccal, sublingual, or nasal transmucosal). Prevalence data on cancer, BTcP, opioid use, and number of BTcP episodes were obtained from the literature. Input data on health care resources associated with opioid use and opioid-induced side effects were obtained by consulting experts in oncology from different Spanish hospitals. Resources used included drugs, medical and emergency visits, other nonpharmacologic treatments, and treatment of opioid-induced side effects. Unit costs were obtained from the literature, and a 3 % discount rate was applied to costs. Based on the unit costs for drugs and health care resources, the annual BTcP treatment costs per patient associated with each fentanyl product were determined to estimate the overall budget impact based on the total treatment population and the percentage of drug utilization associated with each product. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. Results: Patients treated with oral opioids for BTcP were estimated at 23, 291 in 2012, with an increase up to 23, 413 in 2015. The average annual budget savings, with an increase of fentanyl buccal tablets, fentanyl sublingual tablets, and intranasal fentanyl spray, and a decrease in oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate, was estimated at € 2. 6 million, which represents a 0. 5 % decrease in the total costs of BTcP over the next 4 years. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to drug cost per day for the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet.</b> A 50 % decrease in the daily cost of the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> resulted in the largest overall decrease in budget impact of € 5. 4 million. Conclusion: The increase in use of the fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> leads to overall savings in the budget impact for the Spanish National Health System.

Direct compression method was used for the preparation of <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets,</b> and screening studies were conducted with different polymers to determine their effects on tablet characteristics. Carbopol® (CP) and sodium alginate (SA) were selected as two polymer types for further optimization studies by applying response surface methodology. Tablet hardness (TH), ex vivo residence time (RT), and peak detachment force (DF) from buccal mucosa were selected as three important responses. Physicochemical compatibility of formulation excipients and RIS was evaluated by using Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. In vitro drug release profiles and release kinetics were investigated; swelling index and matrix erosion studies were conducted. Optimum formulation consisted of 16. 4 % CP and 20. 3 % SA, which provided 7. 67 ± 0. 29 hour ex vivo RT, 45. 52 ± 4. 85 N TH, and 2. 12 ± 0. 17 N DF. FT-IR spectroscopy and DSC analysis revealed that there was no chemical interaction present between tablet ingredients. Cumulative RIS release of > 90 % was achieved after 8 hours of in vitro dissolution studies, which was supported by swelling and matrix erosion analysis. Mechanism of RIS release was fitted best to zero-order model, while release exponent (n) value of 0. 77 demonstrated an anomalous (non-Fickian) release, indicating combined erosion and swelling mechanism.

Medications for such sudden-onset pain require non-invasive delivery of a potent and short-acting opioid for rapid pain relief. Although oral transmucosal delivery of fentanyl citrate (OTFC) {{has been shown to}} provide better pain relief than a typical oral opioid administration such as morphine sulfate immediate release (MSIR) in the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer-related pain, newer delivery systems offer a potential for further enhancement of pain relief. The fentanyl effervescent <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> (FBT) formulation employs a novel drug delivery system that relies on an effervescence reaction to improve buccal fentanyl absorption. Using the effervescence reaction results in the production and dissipation of carbon dioxide with a dynamic shift in pH as the tablet dissolves. The induced low pH favors dissolution of fentanyl citrate in saliva (higher water solubility). The subsequent increase in pH thereafter favors the buccal absorption of non-ionized fentanyl across the buccal mucosa. Such a pH &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; mechanism increases the permeation of fentanyl into and through the buccal to the vascular system from where the agent is transported to the specific opioid receptor sites in the CNS. Compared with OTFC, data in healthy volunteers show that the effervescence reaction employed in FBT increases the total amount and the speed of absorption of fentanyl being absorbed. Compared with OTFC there is an increase in peak fentanyl blood concentrations, and an enhancement of the amount of buccal delivery of fentanyl. Such favorable data are underlined by the results of clinical studies where the FBT technology was studied in patients with breakthrough pain in chronic malignant pathologies.

As an alternative to the slower onset of action seen with oral opioids, this paper discusses the use of fentanyl <b>buccal</b> <b>tablet</b> for pain management in the emergency department. Fentanyl buccal tablets are readily absorbed, with a bioavailability of approximately 65 %, and have a more rapid onset of action than achieved with traditional oral opioids used in the emergency department. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{involves}} the formulation {{and evaluation of}} <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> of venlafaxine hydrochloride, an antidepressant drug to circumvent the first pass metabolism. Buccal route is excellent for the systemic delivery, there by rendering great bioavailability. A significant reduction in dose and dosing frequency can be achieved, thereby reducing dose dependent side effects, patient compliance and prolonging duration of action. Tablets of venlafaxine HCl were prepared by direct compression method. Twelve formulations were prepared with varying concentrations of bioadhesive polymers like hydroxypropylmethylcellulose K 4 M (HPMC K 4 M), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), carbopol 934 P and chitosan. <b>Buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> were evaluated by different parameters such as thickness, hardness, weight uniformity, content uniformity, swelling index, surface pH, ex vivo bioadhesive strength, in vitro drug release, ex vivo drug permeation and FTIR studies. The modified in vitro assembly {{was used to measure}} the bioadhesive strength of tablets with fresh porcine buccal mucosa as model tissue. The tablets were evaluated for in vitro release in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer for 8 hours in standard dissolution apparatus {{in order to determine the}} mode of release, the data was subjected to model fitting, the optimized formula followed non-fickian release mechanism with zero order kinetics. The formulation containing venlafaxine HCl and HPMC K 4 M in the ratio of 1 : 1 could be used to design effective and stable buccoadhesive tablets of venlafaxine HCl...|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} half-life of testosterone {{varies depending on}} the route of administration and formulation and {{on whether or not}} it is esterified. Oral testosterone undecanoate (in oil capsules) has a {{terminal half-life}} of 1.6 hours. Because of its very short terminal half-life, oral testosterone undecanoate is taken two to four times per day. In contrast to oral testosterone, other forms of testosterone including topical gels and solutions, transdermal patches, and <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets</b> have an extended-release effect and can be administered less frequently, at intervals, depending on the route/formulation, of once a day, twice a day, or once every other day.|$|R
30|$|The {{compression}} loss, friability {{loss and}} hardness {{tests of the}} effervescent mini <b>buccal</b> rivastigmine tartrate <b>tablets</b> formed at 1500  psi compression pressure were 1.013 [*]±[*] 0.633 %; 0.100 [*]±[*] 0.082 %; 2.23 [*]±[*] 0.38 kilopond (kp) respectively (n[*]=[*] 4). Among the three antiadherents/lubricants (magnesium stearate, stearic acid, and tartaric acid) incorporated for tableting, their tablet disintegrating dispersions passed through a No. 25 sieve (aperture 0.71  mm) {{as a part of}} performance test for effervescent dosage form set by USP compendium (Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, General Chapters, 2017). The solution of the batch containing 3.17 % tartaric acid was totally clear, but not the liquid containing disintegrated tablets made of magnesium stearate or stearic acid. The retention time of rivastigmine HPLC was 6.8  min (data not shown). Judging from the breakage pattern of our successful rivastigmine tartrate mini <b>buccal</b> <b>tablets,</b> failure caused by diametrical compression was also due to the tensile failure.|$|R
