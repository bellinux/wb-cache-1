Advocacy of the indemnity features on rules of principal liability; the person to commit a tort and to cause damage should pay damages arising from it.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to review the response of professionals involved in the letting and management of industrial buildings to the implementation of Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act, 1990 which, has imposed a regime of “strict liability”, in terms of contamination, has implications for the owners, occupiers and managers of such properties and may be affecting rental and capital values of industrial premises. This research explores the current awareness of all parties to these changes. Design/methodology/approach – The study reported in this paper examines current practices in the UK and identifies areas where changes may be required, or be desirable, in order to arrive at recommendations as to “best practice”. The work was undertaken in three phases, a questionnaire survey involving leasing and managing agents, real estate owners, lawyers and bankers; a consultation stage with representative organisations including the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the Environment Agency, British Property Federation, British Bankers Association, <b>British</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Association,</b> the Law Society and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and interviews with a representative sample of persons from the survey.
