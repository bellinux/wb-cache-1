25|$|Romney named Representative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential {{running mate}} in August 2012. A year earlier, in June 2011, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives had passed a Republican {{alternative}} budget proposed by Ryan, with no Democrats voting for it. One controversial {{aspect of the}} proposal concerned Medicare; for those under age 55 as of its enactment, it would replace the existing Medicare {{system in which the}} government pays doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers fees for services rendered with a system in which the government would instead pay vouchers (also referred to as premium-support subsidies) to Medicare beneficiaries, who could then use their vouchers to either buy private medical insurance or to obtain coverage in a plan similar to traditional Medicare. Romney said that as president he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk, but he added that he would <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> forward his own plan before debating Obama.|$|E

[...] In 1977, Dickinson met Paul [...] "Noddy" [...] White, a multi-instrumentalist who owned a PA and other equipment, with whom Dickinson, along with drummer Steve Jones, would form a band together called Speed. According to Dickinson, the band was called Speed {{because of the way}} in which they played, rather than a reference to drug-taking. [...] In Speed, Dickinson began writing his own material after White taught him how to play three chords on the guitar.|$|E

It cannot be that the European and South American confederations lay claim to the majority of the berths at the World Cup."

500|$|After the Smyth Report {{was officially}} released, Smith {{immediately}} offered to publish it. Smyth patiently explained that anyone {{was free to}} publish it, but Princeton University Press was only willing to do so on the understanding {{that this would be}} [...] "Smyth's edition". Meanwhile, Smyth approached McGraw-Hill about publishing it. The editors at McGraw-Hill found the manuscript dull and somewhat technical for a general audience and suggested a rewrite. Smyth balked at this, as it would have meant going through the censorship process again. James S. Thompson, the president of McGraw-Hill, pointed out the U.S. Government Printing Office would <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> out an edition, probably more cheaply than he could, and there would likely be little profit in a McGraw-Hill edition. Smyth then turned back to Princeton University Press. He had only one condition: that he receive no royalties. Princeton University Press agreed, but added a stipulation of its own: that Groves's approval be secured. Smyth obtained this in a letter dated August 25, 1945.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical Breakfast of Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, Breakfast of Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems to <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E
500|$|Nelson {{mounted a}} loose {{blockade}} {{of the combined}} fleet, keeping most of his fleet out of sight, but with a line of frigates and larger ships stationed at intervals between himself and Cadiz. On 19 October the combined fleet was observed to <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> to sea, and the signal was passed down the line of ships. William Pryce Cumby, Bellerophons first lieutenant, was first in the main fleet to spot the signal, flying from the last ship in the communication link, HMS Mars. The British began to pursue the combined fleet as it made its way towards the Straits of Gibraltar, and came in sight {{of it on the}} morning of 21 October. The officer and sailors of Bellerophon prepared for battle, some of the gun crews chalking the words [...] "Victory or Death" [...] on their gun barrels. At 11 am Bellerophons signal midshipman, John Franklin, noted that Nelson had hoisted the signal [...] "England expects that every man will do his duty", and {{an hour and a half}} later Bellerophon entered the battle as the fifth ship in Collingwood's lee column. She was astern of the 80-gun HMS Tonnant and ahead of the 74-gun , with the 74-gun [...] close by her port side.|$|E

500|$|The Production Code {{was officially}} {{scrapped}} in 1968, {{to be replaced}} by the first version of the modern rating system. That year, two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade, with major consequences for the B movie. One was a high-budget Paramount production, directed by the celebrated Roman Polanski. Produced by B horror veteran William Castle, Rosemary's Baby was the first upscale Hollywood picture in the genre in three decades. It was a critical success and the year's seventh-biggest hit. The other was George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead, produced on weekends in and around Pittsburgh for $114,000. Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues, it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts. Its greatest influence, though, derived from its clever subversion of genre clichés and the connection made between its exploitation-style imagery, low-cost, truly independent means of production, and high profitability. With the Code gone and the X rating established, major studio A films like Midnight Cowboy could now show [...] "adult" [...] imagery, while the market for increasingly hardcore pornography exploded. In this transformed commercial context, work like Russ Meyer's gained a new legitimacy. In 1969, {{for the first time a}} Meyer film, Finders Keepers, Lovers Weepers!, was reviewed in The New York Times. Soon, Corman would <b>be</b> <b>putting</b> out nudity-filled sexploitation pictures such as Private Duty Nurses (1971) and Women in Cages (1971).|$|E
