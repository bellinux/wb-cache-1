5|$|Kenyatta's exact date {{of birth}} is not known, as birth records were not {{traditionally}} kept by the Kikuyu. It is known that he was probably born sometime in the 1890s.

The older members of Kenyatta's age group are believed to have been born around 1890. One biographer, Jules Archer, suggested that his year of birth was likely 1890, although a fuller analysis performed by Jeremy Murray-Brown concluded that he was likely born circa 1897 or 1898. Kenyatta was raised according to traditional Kikuyu custom and religious <b>belief,</b> <b>and</b> was taught the skills needed to herd the family flock.

In addition, the Celestial Masters were the first Daoist group to form an organized priesthood that helped spread their beliefs.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact of Child Development Associate (CDA) training on the <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices of early childhood teachers (N = 126) using a pre-post mixed-methods research design. Preschool teachers who were enrolled in CDA classes (n= 76) and a comparison group of teachers (n = 50) completed two surveys of <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices: the Teacher <b>Beliefs</b> <b>and</b> Practices Survey: 3 - to 5 -Year-Olds (TBPS) (Burts, Buchanan, 2 ̆ 6 Benedict, 2001) and the Early Childhood Survey of <b>Beliefs</b> <b>and</b> Practices (ECSBP) (Marcon, 1988, 1999). Repeated measures Multiple Analyses of Variance indicated teachers who had completed CDA training became significantly more developmentally appropriate on measures of <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices than a comparison group who did not attend CDA training. The CDA teachers held significantly fewer inappropriate <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> reported fewer inappropriate practices after training than the comparison group. Results suggest that the TBPS was a more sensitive measure than the ECSBP of <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices for these early childhood teachers, most of whom had no formal education. The decrease in developmentally inappropriate <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices on the TBPS subscales illustrates the importance of measuring not only increases in appropriate <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices but also decreases in inappropriate <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices. The Constant Comparative Method was used to organize and analyze the observation and interview data of the four case study participants. Three themes emerged which describe the effect of CDA training on the <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices of these teachers: Reflection on current practices describes the teacher {{who seemed to be}} actively considering how the material presented in the CDA training fit with her implicitly held <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> current practices. Confirmation of developmentally appropriate practices describes the teacher whose existing developmentally appropriate beliefs were reinforced by the training. Superficial changes describes two teachers who gained ideas for activities in the training but revealed no change in beliefs. This study suggests that CDA training decreases the developmentally inappropriateness of <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> self-reported practices of early childhood teachers. A change that past research suggests will ultimately impact classroom quality. Influences such as concurrent training, program requirements, <b>and</b> implicitly held <b>beliefs</b> may moderate the extent to which new concepts are accepted and existing practices are changed...|$|R
40|$|This study inquired into English {{language}} teachers’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> {{practices in}} China and in New Zealand, and explored {{the process of}} using New Zealand English language teachers’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices as a stimulus in promoting and developing Chinese English language teachers’ understanding of English language teaching and their practices in the classroom. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted respectively in both China and New Zealand from May, 2007 to November, 2007. An action research was conducted in China, which lasted about four months with three cycles from March to July in 2008. Two English language teachers with the students in their class participated in the action research. The goal {{of the study was}} to identify the role that New Zealand English language teachers’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices played in helping Chinese English language teachers develop their teaching <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices so as to promote their students’ communication competence in the target language. On investigation, it was found that New Zealand English language teachers’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices played a positive role in helping Chinese English language teacher participants develop their teaching <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices. They provided Chinese teacher participants with new angles to think and reflect their own teaching <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices, and provide teacher participants with implications to be creative in the construction and reconstruction of new <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices. However, it was also found that in learning and using New Zealand teachers’ <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices, Chinese teacher participants had to consider the contexts within which their teaching occurred. It was proposed by this research that during the cross-cultural transplantation of teaching <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices, cultural congruence and pedagogical reconciliation had to be achieved. Without regard to the Chinese educational culture, values, expectations, and Chinese teachers’ expertise, the change would be superficial. This study embraced a positive attitude toward using <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices from other culture(s) in Chinese English language teacher development and proposed it as an effective teacher development mode for China’s English language teacher education programme...|$|R

5|$|At {{a meeting}} with church and cathedral officials, held on 11 June, reporters noted that three people had been shot within {{the city in the}} {{previous}} 72 hours. The attendees produced a letter by the Very Reverend Rogers Govender, on behalf of the Dean and Canons of Manchester Cathedral to Sony. It stated that they were currently seeking the advice of lawyers in the matter, and reserved their legal position in relation to the same. It demanded a substantial donation for the cathedral's work with youth in resisting the culture of gun crime and other forms of violence in our society. It further demanded the immediate withdrawal of the game, and that Sony not re-issue it without removing the section of the game containing the Cathedral interior. Govender described the use of images of the cathedral as virtual desecration. The letter stressed that they were in consultation with their lawyers and urged Sony to contact them so there can be a mutually satisfactory conclusion to the matter. Govender told reporters that the church officials had only been told of the content on 8 June 2007, and, after watching footage of gameplay posted on YouTube, said they were dismayed beyond <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> were shocked to see a place of worship being presented to youths as a place where guns may be fired, and that every year, they invite hundreds of teenagers to see the Cathedral and appreciate it as an alternative to violence.

5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these ideas are repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin <b>belief</b> <b>and</b> claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins.

One of the reasons for measuring both <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices is to characterize teachers in terms of the relationship between their <b>beliefs</b> <b>and</b> practices. However, the practice-instruments and the beliefs-instruments discussed in the literature are predominately based on differing constructs.
