500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a Great Year, the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree <b>backward</b> <b>rotation</b> through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E

40|$|Knee {{movements}} play {{a critical}} role in most balance corrections. Loss of knee flexibility may cause postural instability. Conversely, trained voluntary knee flexions executed during balance corrections might help to overcome balance deficits. We examined whether bilateral knee flexion could be added to automatic balance corrections generated by sudden balance perturbations. We investigated how this could be achieved and whether it improved or worsened balance control. Twenty-four healthy subjects participated in three different test conditions, in which they had to flex their knees following an auditory cue (VOLUNTARY condition), had to restore their balance in response to multidirectional rotations of a support surface (REACTIVE condition), or the combination of these two (COMBINED condition). A new variable set (PREDICTED), calculated as the mathematical sum of VOLUNTARY and REACTIVE, was compared with the COMBINED variable set. COMBINED responses following forward rotations were close to PREDICTED, or greater, suggesting adequate integration of knee flexion into the automatic balance reactions. For <b>backward</b> <b>rotations,</b> the COMBINED condition resulted in several near-falls, and this was generally associated with smaller knee flexion and smaller EMG responses. Subjects compensated by using greater trunk flexion and arm movements. Activity in several muscles displayed earlier onsets for the COMBINED condition following <b>backward</b> <b>rotations.</b> We conclude that healthy adults can incorporate voluntary knee flexion into their automatic balance corrections and that this depends on the direction of the postural perturbation. These findings highlight the flexibility of the human balance repertoire and underscore both the advantages and limitations of using trained voluntary movements to aid balance corrections in man...|$|R
50|$|Class III {{malocclusion}} {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most difficult and complex orthodontic problems to treat for 12 years old patients or younger(not adults). This malocclusion is characterized by mandibular prognathism, maxillary deficiency or both. In subjects with maxillary deficiency where the mandible is not markedly affected treatment may involve stimulation and guidance of maxillary growth by orthopedic forces. Various types of orthodontic headgear, such as facemasks and reverse pull headgears have been used to correct maxillary deficiency; however, these extra-oral appliances have some unpleasant side-effects including the fear of being mocked by one’s peers due to the bulky size of these appliances and causing downward and <b>backward</b> <b>rotations</b> of mandible which pulls the upper jaw backwards into the airway of a growing child.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotation}} axes and rotation angles {{inferred from}} {{the intersection of}} inclusion fabrics in rotated porphyroblasts and the external foliation are apparent axes and apparent angles whose orientation and magnitude are strongly influenced by the initial orientation of the foliation {{with respect to the}} geometry of the deformation. Spherical porphyroblasts may show apparent angles of rotation consistently smaller than the corresponding true rotation angles and apparent rotation axes oriented at a distinct angle with the true axis of rotation. For nonspherical porphyroblasts this effect may lead to a scatter of apparent rotation axes. Sections of a rock intersecting the foliation through the resulting sector of apparent axes will show apparent forward and apparent <b>backward</b> <b>rotations,</b> even when the foliation remains stationary throughout the deformation and all porphyroblasts rotate with the same sense of true rotation.

50|$|The {{result of}} this {{sequence}} of events is a unidirectional 120° rotation of the triptycene moiety {{with respect to the}} helicene moiety. Additional forward or <b>backward</b> <b>rotation</b> of the triptycene rotor is inhibited by the helicene moiety, which serves a function {{similar to that of the}} pawl of a ratchet. The unidirectionality of the system is a result from both the asymmetric skew of the helicene moiety as well as the strain of the cyclic urethane which is formed in c. This strain can be only be lowered by the clockwise rotation of the triptycene rotor in d, as both counterclockwise rotation as well as the inverse process of d are energetically unfavorable. In this respect the preference for the rotation direction is determined by both the positions of the functional groups and the shape of the helicene and is thus built into the design of the molecule instead of dictated by external factors.|$|E

The older, larger and heavier turntables needed a 180 degree <b>backward</b> <b>rotation</b> to allow for run up to full speed; some of the newer 1950s models used aluminum platters and cloth-backed rubber mats which required {{a third of a}} rotational turn or less to achieve full speed when the song began. All this was done in order to present a music show on air with the least amount of silence ("dead air") between music, the announcer's patter and recorded advertising commercials. The rationale was that any [...] "dead air" [...] on a radio station was likely to prompt a listener to switch stations, so announcers and program directors instructed DJs and announcers to provide a continuous, seamless stream of sound-from music to an announcer to a pre-recorded commercial, to a [...] "jingle" [...] (radio station theme song), and then immediately back to more music.|$|E

40|$|Underlying {{somatosensory}} processing deficits {{of joint}} rotation velocities may cause patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{to be more}} unstable for fast rather than slow balance perturbations. Such deficits could lead to reduced proprioceptive amplitude feedback triggered by perturbations, and thereby to smaller or delayed stabilizing postural responses. For this reason, we investigated whether support surface perturbation velocity affects balance reactions in PD patients. We examined postural responses of seven PD patients (OFF medication) and eight age-matched controls following <b>backward</b> <b>rotations</b> of a support-surface platform. Rotations occurred at three different speeds: fast (60 deg/s), medium (30 deg/s) or slow (3. 8 deg/s), presented in random order. Each subject completed the protocol under eyes open and closed conditions. Full body kinematics, ankle torques {{and the number of}} near-falls were recorded. Patients were significantly more unstable than controls following fast perturbations (26 % larger displacements of the body’s centre of mass; P, 0. 01), but not following slow perturbations. Also, more near-falls occurred in patients for fast rotations. Balance correcting ankle torques were weaker for patients than controls on the most affected side, but were stronger than controls for the least affected side. These differences were present both with eyes open and eyes closed (P, 0. 01). Fast support surface rotations caused greater instability and discriminated Parkinson patients better from controls than slow rotations. Although ankle torques on the most affected side were weaker, patients partially compensated for this by generating larger than normal stabilizin...|$|R

5000|$|An {{effective}} approach shape can {{be derived}} from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the jumper crosses the bar to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting <b>backward</b> <b>rotation.</b> This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. [...] Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach. One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another. Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row. It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the J approach to carry the body across the bar.|$|E

The abutment deformations were recorded with inclinometer tubes and precise surveying techniques, and the column bending was measured using vibrating wire strain gauges. The earth pressures {{were found to be}} influenced by the concrete expansion during hydration which caused transverse bending of the columns after the capping beam pour, as well as longitudinal <b>backward</b> <b>rotations</b> and bending of the abutments after the deck slab pours. High residual lateral earth pressures were exerted against the rear of the capping beams due to heavy compaction of the backfill at this level, thus causing the abutment to rotate forwards and become effectively propped by the deck slab. Traffic loading and deck slab temperature fluctuations were found to cause seasonal earth pressure variations. The lateral earth pressure profiles as predicted by the existing design methods were found to be totally unrepresentative of the Wisley results, and a modified design approach has been proposed. Model tests were performed in the laboratory to investigate the behaviour of embedded laterally loaded columns within a spill through abutment. At small lateral displacements, the friction of the soil against the column sides was found to contribute significantly to the total soil resistance. Soil deformations were measured using specialised photography and the interaction between columns was found to be negligible.

40|$|SUMMARY In {{studying}} {{a group of}} fifty adult females with Class II division 1 malocclusion, {{it was evident that}} the skeletal problems of this malocclusion involved small, retruded man-dibles accompanied by <b>backward</b> <b>rotation.</b> This skeletal pattern was considered to be influ-enced by the vertical dimension of the upper dentition in the buccal segment for mandibular function. The anterior and the posterior occlusal planes were examined to gain a detailed assess-ment {{of the relationship between the}} dental and the skeletal patterns. The findings indicated that the steep cant of the posterior occlusal plane was strongly correlated with the following: 1. Small, retruded mandible with <b>backward</b> <b>rotation</b> as the skeletal pattern. 2. Short vertical height of the upper second molars and distal inclination of the upper molars as the dental pattern. The increased vertical height of the lower second premolars was found to be related to <b>backward</b> <b>rotation</b> of the mandible.

5000|$|The {{predominant}} {{symptom of}} Pisa syndrome is dystonia. Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contraction leading to abnormal posture, twisting, and repetitive movement. In Pisa Syndrome specifically there is commonly a tonic flexion {{of the trunk}} of the body to one side, leading to a slight lean (reminiscent of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, hence the name [...] "Pisa syndrome"). This is usually associated with a <b>backward</b> axial <b>rotation</b> of the spine and indifferent to markedly abnormal posture. Patients diagnosed with Pisa Syndrome usually experience either acute dystonia or tardive dystonia, also known as tardive dyskinesia. Differential diagnosis between the two may be hard to accomplish without a complete patient history, since both types of dystonia may occur simultaneously in a patient. These symptoms generally disappear after discontinuation of the antipsychotic drug. The time of onset of symptoms may vary depending on drug being administered and the neurological characteristics of the patient in question.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Motion sensors {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to obtain spatiotemporal measures of mobility-related activities such as sit-stand and stand-sit transitions. However, the application of new sensor-based methods for assessing sit-stand-sit performance requires the detection of crucial events such as seat on/off in the sensor-based data. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate the agreement of detecting sit-stand and stand-sit events based on a novel body-fixed-sensor method with a force-plate based analysis. Methods Twelve older adults and 10 patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease with mean age of 70 years performed sit-stand-sit movements while trunk movements were measured with a sensor-unit at vertebrae L 2 -L 4 and reaction forces were measured with separate force plates below the feet and chair. Movement onsets and ends were determined. In addition, seat off and seat on were determined based on forces acting on the chair. Data analysis focused on the agreement of the timing of sit-stand and stand-sit events as detected by the two methods. Results For the start and end of standing-up, only small delays existed for the start of forward trunk rotation and end of <b>backward</b> trunk <b>rotation</b> compared to movement onset/end as detected in the force-plate data. The end of forward trunk rotation had a small and consistent delay compared to seat off, whereas during sitting-down, the end of forward trunk rotation occurred earlier in relation to seat on. In detecting the end of sitting-down, <b>backward</b> trunk <b>rotation</b> ended after reaching the minimum in the below-feet vertical force signal. Since only small time differences existed between the two methods for detecting the start of sitting-down, longer movement durations were found for the sensor-based method. Relative agreement between the two methods in assessing movement duration was high (i. e. ICCs[*]≥[*] 0. 75), except for duration of standing-up in the Parkinson’s patients (ICC[*]=[*] 0. 61). Conclusions This study demonstrated high agreement of body-fixed-sensor based detection of sit-stand and stand-sit events with that based on force plates in older adults and patients with mild to moderate Parkinson’s disease. Further development and testing is needed to establish reliability for unstandardized performance in clinical and home settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Individuals {{with short}} lower {{anterior}} facial height (LAFH), reduced mandibular plane angle, and excessive overbite resulting from upward and forward mandibular rotation are traditionally classified as skeletal deep bites. Our {{purpose was to}} explore phenotypic variation within short LAFH individuals using geometric morphometric methods. Methods: Cephalograms of 101 individuals (64 female, 37 male; age range: 7 - 62 years) with LAFH to total anterior facial height (TAFH), ratio (LAFH/TAFH), at or below 52. 6 % were studied. Principal component analysis, cluster analysis, and canonical variate analysis captured phenotypic variation and identified homogenous groups. Results: Four principal components were identified which accounted for 49 % of the variation within the skeletal vertical and sagittal dimensions, flexure of the gonial angle, and incisor angulation. Cluster analysis resulted in 3 discrete short LAFH subpenotypes. Conclusions: Within the selected population of short LAFH individuals, we found: A range of morphologic variation. Convergent and divergent facial patterns with concomitant variation in gonial angle and ramus height.

40|$|Background: Teamgym is a {{relatively}} new and emerging sport that originating comes from Scandinavia. Teamgym differs a lot from the most known form of gymnastics, artistic gymnastic. For example artistic gymnastics is an individual sport, while teamgym is performed by 6 - 12 members in each team. In general gymnasts have to acquire many skills {{at a very young age}} like jumping, bouncing and twisting in different directions. A good jumping ability has been linked to a successful performance for gymnasts and is defined by a gymnast’s capacity to jump upwards and then perform series of forward and <b>backward</b> <b>rotations</b> in a successful way. Plyometric is a type of training based on the stretch- shortening cycle (SSC) and is often used to improve an athletes sprint and vertical jump ability. Studies indicate that these two components have been linked to a successful performance in gymnastics but there are no studies that are looking at this correlation in teamgym. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate how strong the correlation is between the vertical jump height in counter movement jump with arm swing, drop-jump and 20, 25 - meters sprint in young female teamgymnasts. Methods: Seventeen (17) female teamgymnasts participated to test their vertical jump ability by using countermovement jump with arm swing (CMJa) and drop-jump (DJ). Their sprint ability was tested through 20 and 25 meter sprint. The highest CMJa and DJ were correlated with the fastest time on 20 and 25 meter sprint. To study the relationship between the vertical jumps and the sprints, Spearman’s rank order correlation (rs) was used in SPSS version 20. 0. If the correlation is between 0. 30 to 0. 49 (- 0. 30 to - 0. 49) it is considered as a medium correlation. Anything under these values is a weak correlation and everything above it is strong correlation. Result: CMJa showed a strong significant correlation with both 20 and 25 meter sprint and DJ showed a moderate non-significant correlation with both 20 and 25 meter sprint. When the weight was set as a control variable the CMJa showed a moderate non-significant correlation with both the sprints but DJ showed a strong significant correlation with both 20 and 25 meter sprint. Conclusion: No other studies have looked at the relationship between vertical jump and sprint ability in teamgym but the result of this study somehow reflects findings in studies looking at the same variables. The findings in this study can be useful for gymnastic coaches when they create training programs for their athletes. Coaches and gymnasts will know the value of a good jumping- and sprinting ability and that plyometric- and sprint training can improve the gymnasts skills. More research is needed on this type of gymnastics and future studies should look at these variables in a larger sample size and with more experienced test subjects...|$|R

Garattini used a Bionator III appliance to correct Class III malocclusion and concluded that the majority of changes can be attributed to dentoalveolar changes [9]. Similar results were noted by Kidner {{with the use of a}} Class III twin block appliance [8]. However, Proffit noted that these changes are not skeletal in origin, but mainly dentoalveolar [2]. These appliances allowed the maxillary molars to migrate mesially and hold the lower molars in place. They also proclined the upper incisors and retroclined the lower incisors, rotate the occlusal plane and/or the chin posterior, but have no major effect on the skeletal growth of the mandible or maxilla.|$|R
