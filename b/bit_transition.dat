We present Selective Packet Interleaving (SPI), a flit transmission scheme that reduces power consumption in NoC links. SPI decreases the number of <b>bit</b> <b>transitions</b> in the links by exploiting the multiplicity of virtual channels in a NoC router. SPI multiplexes flits to the router's output link so as to minimize the number of <b>bit</b> <b>transitions</b> from the previously transmitted flit. Analysis and simulations demonstrate a reduction of up to 55 % in the number of <b>bit</b> <b>transitions</b> and up to 40 % savings in power consumed on the link. SPI benefits grow with the number of virtual channels. SPI works better for links with a small number of bits in parallel. While SPI compares favorably against bus inversion, combining both schemes helps to further reduce <b>bit</b> <b>transitions.</b> Keywords-network-on-chip; low-power design techniques; VLSI interconnects; routing; I...|$|R

40|$|The next {{generation}} of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as Galileo [1] and GPS modernization [2], will use signals with equal code and bit periods, which will introduce a potential <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> in each segment of the received signal processed in the acquisition block. The presence of <b>bit</b> sign <b>transitions</b> in the data record is a critical aspect in all the acquisition methods where the data are processed in blocks, like the fast acquisition method based on Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) where the <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> could occur in any position within the data block. A <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> occurring within an integration time causes a splitting of the main peak of the Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) into two smaller lobes along the Doppler shift axis, which causes a great performance degradation of the acquisition system [3]. In this paper an innovative two steps acquisition algorithm is proposed to mitigate the CAF peak splitting effect caused {{by the presence of}} <b>bit</b> sign <b>transitions</b> in the signal segments, which fits the requirements of the new generation of GNSS signals. The <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> problem is described in detail in this paper and the CAF peak splitting effect dependent on the <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> position in the signal segment is also clearly explained. It is able to prove that the presence of <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition</b> does not destroy the information on the presence of the satellite in view, but it introduces an erroneous Doppler frequency shift estimation. When the proposed two steps acquisition technique is adopted in the signal acquisition in presence of <b>bit</b> sign <b>transitions,</b> it could overcome the CAF peak splitting effect due to the presence of <b>bit</b> sign <b>transitions</b> and provide improved performance in comparison with the classical fast acquisition scheme. In order to validate the proposed technique, simulation campaigns have been performed on the simulated Galileo Open Service (OS) BOC 1, 1 signals to evaluate the performances in terms of histograms of the estimated Doppler shift and code phase delay, Receiver Operative Characteristics (ROC) and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) curves. The simulation results show that the proposed two steps acquisition method provides superior performance over the classical fast acquisition approach, which prove the advantages of the proposed technique and consolidate its validity and effectiveness to solve the CAF peak splitting problem in presence of <b>bit</b> sign <b>transition...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Basic {{measurements}} of global navigation satellite system receivers are obtained after {{the correlation of}} the incom-ing signal with locally generated replicas. Usually, correlation intervals are chosen synchronously with the data-bits sent with each satellite signal to avoid <b>bit</b> <b>transitions.</b> As a consequence, the ensuing code and carrier phase estimation signal processing operates at its own time and the navigation task must extrapolate loop measurements to a common instant. We have proposed an alternative receiver architecture using a common correlation interval for all satellite signals. Under this scheme, the correla-tions made for each satellite in-view have a common interval, chosen in synchronism with the navigation process rather than with the data bits. Naturally, now the <b>bit</b> <b>transitions</b> within a correlation interval require special treatment. The advantages of avoiding measurement extrapolation are shown with a scalar phase lock loop structure intended for high dynamics real-time receivers. The operation of this loop in a common correlation interval receiver needs a carrier phase discriminator structure able to produce outputs for the correlation with <b>bit</b> <b>transitions</b> inside the interval. Three possible carrier discriminator schemes are analyzed in this work. It is shown that the loops operating data-bit asynchronously {{with any of these}} schemes have similar tracking threshold and phase estimation quality than those working bit-synchronously. The proposed architecture naturally generates a vector of simultaneous measurements and then it is particularly suited for the implementation of real-time vector tracking loops...|$|R

In this case there is a potential sign transition in each segment of the signal processed in the acquisition schemes. The search space could result greatly impaired, especially with the methods based on FFT. These methods are very efficient, but a <b>bit</b> <b>transition</b> leads to a modification of the shape of the Cross Ambiguity Function evaluated in the search space.

We will show that the <b>bit</b> <b>transition</b> does not destroy the information on the presence of the satellite, but introduces an error in the estimation of the Doppler frequency and code delay. In fact the effect of the sign transition on the correlation peak is a splitting of the peak into two asymmetric lobes along the correct delay bin, so leading to a potential null value at the correct cell. However the integral of these lobes exhibits an invariance property, which can be exploited to recover the <b>bit</b> <b>transition</b> position, from which the acquisition process becomes feasible.
