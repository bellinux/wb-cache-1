2500|$|Catheter {{shearing}} {{is a very}} infrequent complication, but a {{very real}} danger. [...] Shearing occurs when part of the catheter is cut by the sharp <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> of the trochar. The sheared section may completely separate from {{the main body of}} the catheter, and become free floating in the blood stream. [...] The large majority of the time it is due to poor technique, but infrequently a poorly manufactured catheter may break from the hub or shear. [...] Infection, and a foreign body embolus are the two threats to the patient.|$|E
60|$|A flagged terrace of rounded stones {{with a list}} of two {{or three}} inches to port had been laid round the {{south-east}} and south-west sides of the house, and ran with a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> into mould, which was in preparation for being turfed; along this terrace James led the way.|$|E
60|$|There's an old silver-framed {{mirror in}} my room. It was given me {{by a friend}} who had a taste for antiquities, and he, as I happen to know, picked it up at a sale and had no notion where it came from. It's a large thing--three feet across and two feet high--and it leans at the back of a side-table on my left as I write. The frame is flat, about three inches across, and very old; far too old for hall-marks or other methods of {{determining}} its age. The glass part projects, with a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge,</b> and has the magnificent reflecting power which is only, as it seems to me, to be found in very old mirrors. There's a feeling of perspective when you look into it such as no modern glass can ever give.|$|E

30|$|Tablets were {{compressed}} by {{flat surface}} punch set without <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> failed the friability test. Contradictorily, those compressed by punch set with <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> required less binder and formed thinner tablets (5.7  mm, 1.73  g) {{and passed the}} friability test. The effervescent tablets that were compressed with the punches without <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> (Notoli Descriptions of Goods, 2017) lost more than 1 % weight thus failed the friability test (Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, General Chapters, 2017). The breakage was mainly due to simple tensile failure with slightly shear failure at one platen edge (Aulton & Taylor, 2013; Bubb, 2011).|$|R

50|$|A <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> (UK) or beveled edge (US) {{refers to}} an edge of a {{structure}} that is not perpendicular to {{the faces of the}} piece. The words bevel and chamfer overlap in usage; in general usage they are often interchanged, while in technical usage they may sometimes be differentiated as shown in the image at right. A bevel is typically used to soften the edge of a piece for the sake of safety, wear resistance, or aesthetics; or to facilitate mating with another piece.|$|E

50|$|The MN-123 is a Polish scatterable {{anti-tank}} mine. The mine is a flat cylinder, with a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge.</b> It {{is normally}} deployed from a ground vehicle, using a dispensing system holding 80 mines. The mine {{can also be}} manually laid. Like the MN-121 mine, it uses a magnetic influence fuze which detects when a vehicle passes over it. It also has an anti-handling device. Both faces of the mine have a Misznay Schardin effect shaped charge, which is reportedly able to penetrate 60 millimeters of armour at an offset of 0.3 meters.|$|E

50|$|Juggling {{is rarely}} {{performed}} with sharp knives, {{because there is}} little point in increasing the risk to performer for no aesthetic benefit. Specially balanced juggling knives are used, usually with a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> to appear sharp. Performing with genuine machetes is not generally advised because the spin and balance are unfavourable, and tricks beyond the basics become much more difficult. Various bladed implements can be juggled, but many have a dangerous and unpredictable spin as seen on an axe or chainsaw. Such items are generally avoided, although chainsaws provide a preferable spin to axes if needs must.|$|E

50|$|The {{standard}} New Series Dalek design incorporates additional detailing {{to many of}} {{the components}} including the dome, gun, appendage boxes, plunger and eyeball. The fender is larger with a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge,</b> the lower collar is integral to the casing and the upper collar and mesh are omitted, being replaced by a raised shoulder section beneath the neck bin. The slats have an indented central channel running down their length and the neck bin mesh has a denser, more complex design. The dome lights are substantially larger and enclosed in metal cages and the eye stalk pivot is surrounded by a cowl, below which is a horizontal oblong depression containing an ideogram unique to each Dalek. The standard New Series Dalek is finished in a metallic bronze colour scheme.|$|E
50|$|The cookie star {{is roughly}} {{pentagonal}} in shape with {{a diameter of}} up to 16 cm. It has a slightly inflated, broad central disc and five short rays. The aboral (upper) surface is covered with neatly arranged flat-topped scales, polygonal in the central area and hexagonal on the rays. Between the rays the scales are small and crowded together. There is a marginal row of distinctive larger scales forming a <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge.</b> Sometimes the disc and ray areas are swollen with sunken inter-radial areas between. This may happen when the starfish has recently fed or when its gonads are enlarged prior to spawning. The general colour is yellow, orange or pink. It {{is larger than the}} rather similar Arctic cookie star (Ceramaster arcticus) and does not have red patches on the aboral surface as that species often has.|$|E
50|$|Several dozen Olmec {{iron ore}} mirrors are known {{but only a}} few of these have been {{recovered}} in secure archaeological excavations. At the Olmec site of Las Bocas in Puebla, a particularly fine mosaic mirror was recovered that was dated to around 1000 BC. By the Middle Preclassic period the production of high status stone artefacts, including mirrors, was probably already being carried out by specialist artisans. An Olmec mining colony has been identified in the Cintalapa valley. Among items excavated were partially worked blocks of ilmenite and mangnetite and a fragment of mirror, together with tools and San Lorenzo style ceramics. These remains date to around 950 BC. Concave Olmec mirrors were fashioned from a single pied of iron ore. The front, with the mirror face, was concave with a highly polished lens. The <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> of the mirror was convex and the rear and sides of the mirror were roughly sawn or ground down, although there are occasional exceptions. One Olmec mirror had a back that was ground smooth and highly polished. Concave mirrors are depicted in Olmec art, where they are frequently represented as pectorals worn on the chest. They can be divided into two groups; those that have a singe drilled hole near the top and those that have at least two drilled holes at the sides. The latter tend to be larger than the former. Most of the mirror stones have been sawn from a larger piece of rock and fashioned into an oval shape; occasionally it is possible to distinguish the original form of the parent stone. The curve of each mirror is unique and tailored to the stone from which it is worked, and none possesses perfect symmetry; this appears to be deliberate. Although the elliptical mirrors are parabolic, the circular mirrors have a spherical concavity. The circular mirrors are effective at lighting fires while the parabolic mirrors are not, although they may have been used to produce smoke. Of four large mirrors found at Arrroyo Pesquero in Veracruz, two were circular and were excellent sources of ignition.|$|E

These results are confirmed by a finite element computation...|$|E
