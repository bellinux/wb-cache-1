40|$|Rotary {{ultrasonic}} machining (RUM) is a hybrid process that combines diamond grinding with {{ultrasonic machining}}. It is most suitable to machine hard brittle {{materials such as}} ceramics and composites. Due to its excellent machining performance, RUM is very often applied for drilling of hard machinable materials.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} used RC drill bits are 5-8 inches (13-20 cm) in diameter and have round tungsten 'buttons' that protrude from the bit, which are required to drill through shale and abrasive rock. As the buttons wear down, drilling becomes slower and the rod string can potentially become bogged in the hole. This is a problem as trying to recover the rods may take hours {{and in some cases}} weeks. The rods and drill bits themselves are very expensive, often resulting in great cost to drilling companies when equipment is lost down the bore hole. Most companies will regularly re-grind the buttons on their drill bits in order to prevent this, and to speed up progress. Usually, when something is lost (breaks off) in the hole, it is not the drill string, but rather from the bit, hammer, or stabilizer to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string (bit). This is usually caused by operator error, over-stressed metal, or adverse drilling conditions causing downhole equipment to get stuck {{in a part of the}} hole.|$|E

According to the Laplace transform method and the relationships among parameters of the model, the solutions to complex impedance at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string are obtained, and then the comparison results are analyzed, which is the lateral inertia effect on longitudinal vibration characteristics. The researches show that the smaller the length of the drill string, the greater the cross-sectional area of the drill string, the greater the damping coefficient of bottom hole on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string, and the more evident the effect on the dynamic stiffness of the drill string with lateral inertia effect.

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved drilling nitrogen fertilizer amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill.</b> The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|E
40|$|Core samples {{recovered}} {{during the}} Hawaiian Scientific Drilling Project (HSDP) drilling project {{reveal that the}} upper 1 km of the submarine flank of Mauna Kea is comprised mainly of hyaloclastites. Progressive, very low-temperature alteration of these hyaloclastites {{has been accompanied by}} systematic transformations in physical properties of these deposits. Hyaloclastite deposits which directly underlie ca. 1 km of subaerially-emplaced lavas are very poorly consolidated. But over a depth interval of ca. 500 m, compaction and, especially, precipitation of zeolitic, pore-filling cements associated with palagonitization of sideromelane, have eliminated porosity as well as promoted the consolidation of these hyaloclastites. The latter is reflected in unconfined compressive strengths which increase from mean values, respectively, of 2. 5 and 4. 6 MPa in weakly consolidated, smectite-rich hyaloclastites from the incipient (1080 to 1335 mbsl) and smectitic (1405 – 1573 mbsl) alteration zones, to a mean value of 10. 0 MPa in the more highly consolidated hyaloclastites of the palagonitic zone of alteration (from 1573 mbsl to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> hole). Conversely, overlying, intercalated, and underlying lava flows are generally much less altered, and have mean compressive strengths which are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater then hyaloclastites at equivalent depths. The shear strengths of the hyaloclastites also increase with depth and grade of alteration, but are uniformly and substantially lower in the lavas. Those hyaloclastites exhibiting the highest grade of alteration (i. e., palagonitic) also exhibit the highest measured strengths, and thus the alteration of hyaloclastites appears to strengthen as opposed to weaken the flanks of the edifice. However, the contrast in strength between hyaloclastites an...|$|E
40|$|Yucca Mountain in {{southern}} Nye County, Nevada, {{has been proposed}} as a potential site for the underground disposal of high-level nuclear waste. An exploratory drill hole designated UE 25 p# 1 was drilled 3 km east of the proposed repository site to investigate the geology and hydrology of the rocks that underlie the Tertiary volcanic and sedimentary rock sequence forming Yucca Mountain. Silurian dolomite assigned to the Roberts Mountain and Lone Mountain Formations was intersected below the Tertiary section between a depth of approximately 1244 m (4080 ft) and the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> hole at 1807 m (5923 ft). These formations {{are part of an}} important regional carbonate aquifer in the deep ground-water system. Tertiary units deeper than 1139 m (3733 ft) in drill hole UE 25 p# 1 are stratigraphically older than any units previously penetrated by drill holes at Yucca Mountain. These units are, in ascending order, the tuff of Yucca Flat(?), an unnamed calcified ash-flow tuff, and a sequence of clastic deposits. The upper part of the Tertiary sequence in drill hole UE 25 p# 1 is similar to that found in other drill holes at Yucca Mountain. The Tertiary sequence is in fault contact with the Silurian rocks. This fault between Tertiary and Paleozoic rocks may correlate with the Fran Ridge fault, a steeply westward-dipping fault exposed approximately 0. 5 km east of the drill hole. Another fault intersects UE 25 p# 1 at 873 m (2863 ft), but its surface trace is concealed beneath the valley west of the Fran Ridge fault.

40|$|In this research, we have {{investigated}} the illitization process in Quaternary calc-alkaline volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in the active Tinguiririca geothermal field (Andean Cordillera, central Chile). XRD, SEM, and HRTEM/AEM techniques havebeen used to establish the illitization sequence and evaluate {{the influence of the}} factors controlling the mineral reaction and kinetics at low temperature (T). Analysed samples were collected through a slimhole core up to 815 m deep in which the T was measured in situ (up to 230 degrees C at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> core). Textural information indicates that the dioctahedral clays have replaced most of the vitreous components. In contrast, plagioclase phenocrysts have only been partially and patchily albitized. The observed replacements imply dissolution-crystallization processes. The illitization sequence detected by XRD is apparently continuous from smectite to R 3 I-S through R 0 and R 1, with a progressive increase in illite layers. HRTEM data show a similar illitization trend. However, the high-resolution images reveal that the clays are more heterogeneous than the XRD patterns suggest, with the coexistence of different types of dioctahedral clays at the sample level. They also indicate that the most abundant dioctahedral clays are smectite, R 1 I-S, and illite. Therefore, the XRD patterns are probably the result of a mixture of these phases plus accessory I-S mixed layers with higher ordering (R > 1). Increasing T with depth would enhance the kinetic conditions necessary for illitization and also favour the dissolution of the vitreous K-rich component and, locally the albitization of plagioclases. Both processes release K, which, with the concomitant increase in T and K availability, enhances the crystallization of clays progressively richer in K. Thus, at T 85 degrees C the conditions are appropriate for the crystallization of R 1 I-S (with minor smectite + RO I- 5), up to T >= 175 degrees C, where illite is the most abundant and relatively stable phas...|$|E

The measurements show two well defined regions of nearly constant fluence: (1) a thick deep section with a very large neutron fluence, and (2) a thinner shallow region with a small fluence. This depth dependence is most plausibly described by a model of rapid accumulation in the last 100 – 200 m. y., the layered structure reflecting accumulations of isotopically homogeneous source material. This interpretation is compatible {{with a variety of}} other characteristics of the soils, including the spallation produced 126 Xe normalized to target element abundances.

The uniformity of various properties of soils provides criteria for defining major stratigraphic intervals in the drill stem which differ from those identified by the Preliminary Examination Team. Neutron fluences measured on shallow and deep soils from all lunar landing sites have been normalized to irradiation in an arbitrary standard chemical environment. We infer from histograms of the normalized fluences that there is a distinct difference in neutron fluence between shallow and deep samples which implies a general vertical stratification of neutron fluence in the lunar regolith. The regolith can be divided into three vertical regions: (1) a well mixed surface layer, ∼ 100 g cm^(− 2) thick, with an average fluence of 2. 3 × 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2), (2) a poorly mixed zone extending from 100 g cm^(− 2) to at least 500 g cm^(− 2) with an average fluence of 3. 5 × 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2), and (3) a deep layer of lightly irradiated materials (< 10 ^(16) n cm^(− 2)). Analysis of this stratification, using a vertical mixing model, indicates that the probability of mixing to several hundred g cm^(− 2) is comparable to the probability of mixing to several kg cm^(− 2). This is in contrast to the depth-cratering rate models which have been inferred from crater size frequency distributions using a power law. Alternatively, this discrepancy can be resolved if the true ^(157) Gd capture rate is 1 / 3 of the value calculated by Lingenfelteret al. (1972). The most plausible interpretation is that vertical mixing models are not an adequate description of relatively rare deep cratering events which result in significant lateral heterogeneity and addition of unirradiated material to the lunar surface. ...|$|E
40|$|This report details {{maturity}} and migration modelling of four wells for the 21 CXRM Palaeozoic project, Orcadian study area. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maturity modelling was to predict if Devonian and Carboniferous source rock intervals within the wells are, or have been, mature for hydrocarbon generation. Wells 12 / 27 - 1 and 20 / 10 a- 3 {{were chosen for}} 1 D modelling based on availability of {{maturity and}} geochemical data (Figure 1). As this region comprises a series of Palaeozoic structural highs and basins, two wells cannot fully represent <b>the</b> geological evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study area. Two ‘scenario’ or ‘pseudo’ wells, 12 / 16 - 1 and 21 / 06 b- 5 were included to contrast the basin history. Previous basin modelling work in the Inner Moray Firth is summarised in Greenhalgh (2016) and this study is placed in regional context in Monaghan et al. (2016). Inner Moray Firth (IMF) Lacustrine strata deposited during Lower and Middle Devonian times are believed to offer the main source rock potential in the IMF (see summary in Greenhalgh, 2016), as the high TOC Jurassic strata are largely immature (Fraser et al., 2003, their fig. 17. 2). Well 12 / 27 - 1 is situated on a post-Lower Devonian relative high (Figure 2), has moderate/good Total Organic Content (TOC) in the Lower Devonian Struie Formation and oil and gas shows are observed (well report; Vane et al., 2016). Two cases were modelled to accommodate uncertainty in the maturity data, with {{a significant impact on}} <b>the</b> timing <b>of</b> generation. If deepest burial was achieved during Devonian times (fitted to higher maturity values; Figure 13, 14, 15), then main hydrocarbon generation occurred during Devonian burial (Figure 17). However, if deepest burial occurred during Cretaceous – Cenozoic times (best fit to maturity values, though these data are possibly supressed; Figure 5, 7, 8) then generation occurred from the Struie Formation during both Devonian and Cretaceous – Cenozoic times (Figure 9). Please see Section 4 for more detail. Carboniferous strata are rarely penetrated by wells in the IMF. The anomalous Firth Coal Formation to Devonian succession proven in Well 12 / 16 - 1, close to the Great Glen and Wick faults was modelled (Figure 21, 24). Well 12 / 16 - 1 lies in a different Palaeozoic sub-basin to Well 12 / 27 - 1. It is classed as a ‘scenario’ well due to uncertainties in the constraining data. The source rock intervals contain mainly gas prone kerogens and as the Carboniferous strata only reached the main oil maturity window during deep Carboniferous burial, significant gas generation is not expected. Given the block and basin structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IMF during the Palaeozoic Era and <b>the</b> variable distribution <b>of</b> facies, any single well is unlikely to provide a complete representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geological history and petroleum systems. The model results are useful in assessing the maturity geohistory and generation potential <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, but must be considered in <b>the</b> regional context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Orcadian study area (see Monaghan et al., 2016). South Buchan Basin Well 20 / 10 a- 3 was drilled on a high at <b>the</b> western margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South Buchan Basin and was chosen for modelling based on availability <b>of</b> maturity data. <b>The</b> Firth Coal Formation source rocks are interpreted to be mainly gas prone but some condensate prone intervals were noted towards <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drilled</b> interval. <b>The</b> 1 D basin modelling shows that the Firth Coal Formation reached the mid mature window for oil generation during deep Cenozoic burial (Figure 288, 30, 31, 32) ...|$|R

40|$|A concept {{review of}} {{concentric}} coiled tubing drilling (CTD) system is performed in this Master thesis, hereafter named DualCTD. The main {{purpose is to}} investigate and present the advantages, limitations and applications for the DualCTD system. A feasibility study {{has been carried out}} for subsea drilling of drainage holes from an existing well, and drilling of subsea production wells in the Barents Sea. The DualCTD system consists of two concentric coiled tubing (CT) strings that form a separate circulation system for <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus between the two CT strings to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) where a mud motor generates rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> bit. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid cleans <b>the</b> bit for cuttings and transports the cuttings through a circulating sub/dual float valve and into the inner string. This separated circulating system provides effective hole cleaning from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid can be a light fluid, that is optimized for hole cleaning capabilities. A secondary annulus, formed between the DualCTD string and the borehole, is filled with a barrier fluid (BF). Viscous BF is used to separate the two fluid systems in the secondary annulus. Placing the BF in the secondary annuls below seafloor results in an optimized stabilized hydrostatic head. The BF can also be optimized for formation preserving properties. A choke valve in the return fluid line is used to control the back pressure and match the downhole pressure for the two fluid systems with the formation pressure. A light drilling fluid and a heavy BF will also increase <b>the</b> buoyancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DualCTD string. Buckling calculations conducted show that longer horizontal sections could be drilled due to increased buckling resistance and reduced friction drag for the buoyant DualCTD string. Horizontal sections of up to 2300 m can be drilled with a 3, 5 x 2, 375 DualCTD setup with a 6 bit for vertical kick-off points of 2000 m and deeper. This is more than three times as long as for conventional CTD. A hydraulic model for calculating the pressure loss in the circulating system is developed. Burst and collapse pressure was found to be limiting for the maximum flow rate due to high frictional pressure loss in the circulation system in deep wells. Cutting transport capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> circulation system was found to be low due to the low acceptable flow rates. Cutting transport capacity will therefore limit <b>the</b> maximum rate <b>of</b> penetration. <b>The</b> DualCTD system will also make it possible to drill through challenging pressure regimes, depleted reservoirs and problematic zones with its unique potential for managed pressure drilling. Well control approach for the DualCTD concept will be much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same as in underbalanced-/managed pressure CTD operations The DualCTD blow out preventer needs to be verified for cutting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DualCTD string. Running of casing and cementing operations may have to be performed on drill string due to <b>the</b> large weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casing and the low axial load capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DualCTD string.

40|$|This master thesis has {{investigated}} feasibility of effective well control in riserless drilling. An attempt was undertaken {{to design a}} realistic model of riserless well using advanced multiphase simulation tool and evaluate well control aspects as loss of primary well control, kick detection and well killing operations. One {{of the most significant}} findings in this study is that the well control procedures, which were specially developed for riserless and dual gradient application, do not work as expected. Modified Driller’s method and detection of shut-in drill pipe pressure after well is shut with HCV did not show desired results during simulations and must be revised. With unknown formation pressure it is impossible to circulate kick out of the well and pump the kill mud into the wellbore safely. And both Driller’s and Wait and Weight methods are not applicable. Therefore, well control operation in riserless drilling cannot be executed safely and in controlled manner using current technologies and procedures. Kick detection in riserless system is similar to conventional drilling. Almost all conventional kick detection methods are applicable in riserless drilling and allow detecting the kick effectively. The speed of the subsea pump also proved to be an effective method, which can be used in addition to conventional ones. However, {{it is not possible to}} perform a flow check and fluid fill-ups on trips to verify that kick is taken. It was also shown that the new equipment with complex control logic–hydraulic control valve is a very critical element of riserless drilling system. It is installed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> string, which creates restriction for its maintenance. Effectiveness of the well control relies solely on HCV in the situation when the well must be shut-in. Therefore, the fact that HCV is the single point of failure is considerable disadvantage of the riserless system. The results of this study indicate that new well control procedures for riserless drilling require a high level of understanding of wellbore fluids influence on conditions in the well. Therefore, further development and utilization of model that was established in OLGA is important. It is also recommended that further research be undertaken in the following areas: Back-up emergency procedures for failure of the hydraulic control valve, subsea pump or both of them. Alternative well control procedures for the situation when the bit is not on the bottom. Research and development of the subsea pump so that new system would have high degree of operational flexibility to act not only as a pump but also as an analog of subsea choke during drilling, tripping and well control operations. Prior to development of the technical solutions and procedures it is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of the model and simulation software. OLGA multiphase phase flow simulator is intensively validated against field data for subsea multiphase flow lines, production riser systems and gas condensate pipelines. For the drilling systems, the extensive validation campaign against the field data is required to increase the confidence in the simulations results. This could be achieved through the cooperation between leading oil companies via JIPs. In addition operator training simulators could potentially help with such a complex and dynamic phenomena. The verified (for long vertical risers/pipes, with viscous mud) multiphase flow simulator could be integrated to the drilling simulator. This online system could potentially predict the behavior of the flow during the gas kick in the system during the drilling operation and will provide more time to react (as analogy to the OLGA/Hysys or Leda/K-Spice online integrated systems for the process/transport systems). </p...|$|E
40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. <b>The</b> capsizing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at <b>the</b> fatigue failure <b>of</b> a weld as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct causes. This accident led to a number <b>of</b> improvements to <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> offshore structures. <b>The</b> noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well. The wellhead is part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second well barrier envelope during <b>drilling.</b> <b>The</b> subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> Blow Out Preventer (BOP) is placed on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subsea wellhead. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> riser is <b>the</b> connection between the BOP and <b>the</b> floating <b>drilling</b> unit. Waves and current forces acting on <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> riser protects <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis {{can be used as a}} tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a safe fatigue limit. This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. <b>The</b> majority <b>of</b> research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is <b>the</b> primary objective <b>of</b> well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. <b>The</b> “near-seabed” conditions <b>of</b> lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead top casing cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and installation of BOP/drilling riser will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> a subsea well. Bending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. <b>The</b> combination <b>of</b> delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one <b>of</b> its features. <b>The</b> implementation <b>of</b> a modified cement boundary condition will change <b>the</b> global stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|R
40|$|The {{petroleum}} industry constantly works to optimize operational aspects within <b>drilling.</b> <b>The</b> cost to <b>drill</b> a well is a parameter all companies want to minimize. To do {{this new technology}} and new methods are used to optimize <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> process. <b>Drilling</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack is a process where components in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> casing are <b>drilled</b> out. <b>The</b> components include different equipment used when cementing <b>the</b> casing. <b>Drilling</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack can be a time consuming process, generating large cost and problems for <b>the</b> operators. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack includes many factors, making it a complex situation. A study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters will help to optimize this process. Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters are expected to reduce the operational cost and time when <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack. <b>Drilling</b> data from 143 runs were given {{in order to get}} a better overview over the problems occurring, and to show were most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time is used. Special cementing plugs are used to displace the cement slurry and give surface pressure indications during the cementing operation. After the casing is cemented into place, all the equipment in the shoetrack needs to be drilled out in order to reach the next open hole section. <b>The</b> inclination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wells plotted against the total time to <b>drill</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack, shows that the more deviated a well is, the more time consuming <b>the</b> shoetrack <b>drill</b> out process is. The study further shows that the component in the shoetrack taking the most time to <b>drill</b> is <b>the</b> landing collar, this applies for 6 of 7 casing sizes studied. The landing collar is a component used in the shoetrack when the cementing operation takes place. The cement plugs that displace the cement when pumping will land and seal inside and on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landing collar, this will give surface pressure indications, indicating that the cementing job is complete. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> different bit did not give any big difference when studying all <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> runs, so for <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack, it is <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> parameters that account for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect. <b>The</b> shoetrack drillout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 10 ¾” liners has shown to take too much time. The focus was therefore directed towards this casing size. A total of 15 wells in this casing size were selected, where Halliburton was <b>the</b> provider <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack equipment. Further, feet-by-feet data were examined, containing drilling parameters as weight on bit, rotation speed, torque and flowrate. The study included both single stage cemented liners and two stage cemented liners. The study clearly shows that <b>drilling</b> <b>the</b> cementing plug and lading collar, is the process taking most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. Since the landing collar took most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack drillout, a deeper studied was performed. For the single stage cemented liners a trend was seen when studying the flow rate up against the total time to <b>drill</b> <b>the</b> shoetrack. An increased flow gave better drillout times. For the WOB, no trend was seen. No trends were seen when studying <b>the</b> total <b>drilling</b> time up against WOB and flowrate for the two stage cemented liners. The materials studied for <b>the</b> shoetrack <b>of</b> 10 ¾” liners was relatively soft materials, consisting of aluminium, rubber, plastic and cement. Connecting <b>the</b> time to <b>drill</b> <b>the</b> landing collar up against <b>the</b> average values <b>of</b> WOB, Torque, flowrate and revolution speed gave some interesting results.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of a project funded by the Minerals Management Service (MMS) (now Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE)) to study <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> epoxy to plug {{hurricane}} damaged wells. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wells destroyed by hurricanes are damaged to an extent that vertical intervention from the original wellhead is not possible. These wells have to be plugged to prevent future flows through the well to protect the environment. Cement is usually the preferred plugging material because it is very cheap compared to other materials like epoxy. However, cement can easily get contaminated by sea water or brines present in wells as completion fluids. Therefore, {{to be able to use}} cement it has to be placed at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well by <b>drilling</b> an offset well all the way to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original well. Epoxy, on the other hand, being much more chemically stable can be placed at <b>the</b> very top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well and let to settle by gravity without fearing contamination. Therefore, in wells described above, epoxy can be much more economical than cement. Placing epoxy at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> a well and letting it settle by gravity can also be more economical than using cement in other situations such as in a leaking annulus of a well where circulation in that annulus is not possible, or if a well that has been previously plugged starts leaking again after the rig has been removed. Placing epoxy in the manner described can be achieved without using a rig and therefore, would be much more economical than cement. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important factors in this process is to be able to predict <b>the</b> settling velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epoxy to be able to determine the required setting time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epoxy so that the epoxy does not set prematurely. In addition, it is important to evaluate whether the epoxy can successfully settle to the bottom and how much of it will adhere to the pipe walls while freefalling. This thesis aims to design, build and run an experimental setup that would help study <b>the</b> settling velocity <b>of</b> epoxy. Some experiments were conducted to assess <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> different parameters that might affect <b>the</b> settling velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epoxy such as the epoxy?s density, the annulus size and the inclination angle. The results show that the settling velocity was proportional to the epoxy?s density. Also the settling speed was almost double in experiments done at an angle compared to experiments done at vertical position. The annulus size did not have any clear effect on the settling speed. The adhesion to the pipe walls was found to be proportional to the epoxy?s viscosity and angle of inclination and was inversely proportional to the annulus size...|$|R
