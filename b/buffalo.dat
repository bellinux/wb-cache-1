5|$|<b>Buffalo</b> Creek {{begins in}} Hartley Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between <b>Buffalo</b> Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and <b>Buffalo</b> Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of Hartley Township. Upon leaving Hartley Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows into southern West <b>Buffalo</b> Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West <b>Buffalo</b> Township, <b>Buffalo</b> Creek picks up its tributary North Branch <b>Buffalo</b> Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E

40|$|The {{trial was}} {{conducted}} to assess anoestrous problem in Nili Ravi <b>buffaloes</b> kept under rural and peri-urban management around Islamabad, during the months of October to December. One hundred and three <b>buffaloes</b> under peri-urban management and 40 <b>buffaloes</b> under rural management belonging to six and 21 farmers, respectively, were included in this study. <b>Buffaloes</b> that did not show heat signs for 6 - 12 months postpartum were considered anoestrus in this study. For inducing heat, two injections of cloprostenol were administered in silent oestrous <b>buffaloes,</b> whereas gonadotropin releasing hormone followed by cloprostenol was administered in true anoestrous <b>buffaloes.</b> A higher proportion of <b>buffaloes</b> (35 %) was noted in anoestrus under rural than under peri-urban management (17. 5 %, P= 0. 02). All the <b>buffaloes</b> diagnosed as silent oestrus responded to cloprostenol therapy by showing heat signs under both management systems. However 71 % rural <b>buffaloes</b> diagnosed in true anoestrus showed heat symptoms compared to 100 % peri-urban <b>buffaloes</b> followed by GnRH+cloprostenol therapy. Fixed time insemination (72 and 96 hours after 2 nd cloprostenol injection) resulted in a conception rate of 58 % and 67 % in rural and peri-urban <b>buffaloes,</b> respectively. An overall 33 % conception rate was observed in true anoestrous compared to 83 % in silent oestrous <b>buffaloes.</b> It is concluded that cloprostenol could be used successfully to induce heat and achieve an optimum conception rate in silent oestrous <b>buffaloes</b> during peak breeding season...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{efficacy}} of the Ovsynch alone or in combination with CIDR treated <b>buffaloes</b> on conception rate of anestrous Iraqi <b>buffaloes.</b> The present study was conducted on 50 anestrous <b>buffaloes</b> suffering from postpartum ovarian inactivity. <b>Buffaloes</b> were randomly assigned to three treatment groups. <b>Buffaloes</b> in Treatment 1 (n= 20) received on day 0 GnRH 250 μg and a 25 mg of PGF 2 α on day 7, two days later a second injection of GnRH (250 μg). <b>Buffaloes</b> in Treatment 2 (n= 20) injected on day 0 of the experiment, GnRH 250 μg and a CIDR was placed in the anterior vagina. On day 7, they were injected with 25 mg of PGF 2 α and on the following day (day 8) the CIDR were removed. On day 9 a second dose of GnRH (250 μg) was injected. Treatment 3 a control group (n= 10) received no treatments. Results showed that in treatment 1, 7 out of 20 <b>buffaloes</b> received treatment exhibited estrus within 74. 8 ± 6. 3 after second GnRH administration. The estrus induction rate was 35 %. Total number of <b>buffaloes</b> became pregnant was 1 (5 %). In treatment 2 75 % of the <b>buffaloes</b> received treatment exhibited estrus within 77. 8 ± 5. 6 h after CIDR removal. Total number of <b>buffaloes</b> became pregnant was 7 (31. 8 %). Lower (P < 0. 05) Pregnancy rate was achieved in <b>buffaloes</b> treated with Ovsynch than other <b>buffaloes</b> treated with Ovsynch plus CIDR. Higher rates of estrus induction (75 %; P< 0. 05) and conception rate (7 <b>buffaloes</b> out of 20) were found in <b>buffaloes</b> treated with Ovsynch plus CIDR. In conclusion, our results indicate that the addition of Ovsynch to a progesterone-based CIDR protocol substantially improves the estrus induction and pregnancy rates in postpartum anestrous <b>buffaloes...</b>|$|R
