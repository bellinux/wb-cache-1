5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a <b>bolide</b> <b>impact</b> (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact would have killed frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{paradigm for}} the climatic effects of large asteroid or comet impacts is {{a reduction in}} sunlight and significant short-term cooling caused by atmospheric aerosol loading. Here we show, using global climate model experiments, that the large increases in stratospheric water vapor that can occur upon impact with the ocean cause radiative forcings of over + 20 W m− 2 {{in the case of}} 10 km sized bolides.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{prominent}} patterns {{have been}} recognized in Phanerozoic extinction data: (1) a quasi-periodic distribution of extinction-intensity peaks, and (2) a linear, declining background extinction i tensity gradient. Characterization a d interpretation f both patterns are necessary to understand Phanerozoic extinction controls. The extinction-intensity peak spectrum has been variously interpreted as a reflection f the time-series of major sea-level regressions, continental flood-basalt province (CFBP) eruptions, and <b>bolide</b> <b>impacts.</b> In order to evaluate the level of association between these time-series and the Phanerozoic marine invertebrate extinction record statistically, a new Monte Carlo simulation strategy is presented. Results of simulation-based tests suggest that the time-series of major, eustatic sea-level regressions a d CFBP eruption events have a statistically significant (p 4 0. 05) association with Tatarian-Pliocene, stage-level, extinction intensity peaks. Associations between this peak series and the time-series of crater-producing <b>bolide</b> <b>impacts</b> do not appear significant at this level. A limited multicausal event scenario was also tested using the Monte Carlo method, and recognized the combination of sea-level regression a d CFBP volcanism to be significantly associated with the largest extinction intensity peaks of the last 250 Ma.

25|$|Paleotologists {{compared}} the taxonomic diversity {{and patterns of}} morphological disparity in mosasaurs with sea level, sea surface temperature, and stable carbon isotope curves for the Upper Cretaceous to explore factors that may have influenced their evolution. No single factor unambiguously accounts for all radiations, diversification, and extinctions; however, the broader patterns of taxonomic diversification and morphological disparity point to niche differentiation in a “fishing up” scenario {{under the influence of}} “bottom-up” selective pressures. The most likely driving force in mosasaur evolution was high productivity in the Late Cretaceous, driven by tectonically controlled sea levels and climatically controlled ocean stratification and nutrient delivery. When productivity collapsed {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, coincident with <b>bolide</b> <b>impact,</b> mosasaurs became extinct.|$|E
500|$|One other crater {{also appears}} to have been formed {{around the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. Other crater-like {{topographic}} features have also been proposed as impact craters formed in connection with Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction. This suggests to some the possibility of near-simultaneous multiple impacts, perhaps from a fragmented asteroidal object, similar to the Shoemaker–Levy 9 impact with Jupiter. In addition to the [...] Chicxulub Crater, there is the [...] Boltysh crater in Ukraine (...) , the [...] Silverpit crater in the North Sea (...) possibly formed by <b>bolide</b> <b>impact,</b> and the controversial and much larger [...] Shiva crater.

500|$|The {{asteroid}} collision theory, {{which was}} brought to wide attention in 1980 by Walter Alvarez and colleagues, links the extinction event {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period to a <b>bolide</b> <b>impact</b> approximately 66million years ago. Alvarez et al. proposed that a sudden increase in iridium levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact. The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a bolide [...] wide hit in the vicinity of the Yucatán Peninsula (in southeastern Mexico), creating the approximately [...] Chicxulub Crater and triggering the mass extinction. Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the impact event. Some scientists propose that the meteorite impact caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.|$|E

2500|$|The Bay's geology, {{its present}} form, and its very {{location}} {{were created by}} a <b>bolide</b> <b>impact</b> event {{at the end of}} the Eocene (about 35.5 million years ago), forming the Chesapeake Bay impact crater and the Susquehanna River valley much later.

2500|$|The {{cause of}} the Late Triassic {{extinction}} is uncertain. It was accompanied by huge volcanic eruptions that occurred as the supercontinent Pangaea began to break apart about 202 to 191 million years ago (40Ar/39Ar dates), forming the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), {{one of the largest}} known inland volcanic events since the planet had first cooled and stabilized. Other possible but less likely causes for the extinction events include global cooling or even a <b>bolide</b> <b>impact,</b> for which an impact crater containing Manicouagan Reservoir in Quebec, Canada, has been singled out. However, the Manicouagan [...] impact melt [...] has been dated to 214±1 Mya. The date of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary has also been more accurately fixed recently, at [...] Mya. Both dates are gaining accuracy by using more accurate forms of radiometric dating, in particular the decay of uranium to lead in zircons formed at time of the impact. So, the evidence suggests the Manicouagan impact preceded the end of the Triassic by approximately 10±2 Ma. It could, therefore, not be the immediate {{cause of the}} observed mass extinction.|$|E
