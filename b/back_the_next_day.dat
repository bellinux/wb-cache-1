5|$|With {{the hope}} of {{improving}} their offense, the Minnesota Twins acquired Núñez from the Yankees on April 7, 2014, in exchange for minor league pitcher Miguel Sulbaran. The Twins optioned him to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. After batting 7-for-22 (.318) for Rochester, {{he was promoted to}} the Twins as the 26th man on their roster for a doubleheader on April 17, and was optioned <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{playing an}} {{exhibition}} match, Murray started the French Open with three tough wins, before losing in straight sets to Tomáš Berdych {{in the fourth}} round. In London, Murray progressed to the third round, where he faced Mardy Fish. At 3–3 in the final set with momentum going Murray's way (he had {{just come back from}} 3–0 down), the match was called off for bad light, leaving Murray fuming. Coming <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> Murray was edged out by the eventual finalist in a tie-breaker for his second defeat by him in the year. At Wimbledon, Murray progressed to the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. On 27 July 2010, Murray and his coach Maclagan split, and Murray replaced him with Àlex Corretja.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{had begun}} {{planning}} a counterattack during the Australian advance on Finschhafen. The {{main part of}} the 20th Division was moved down from Madang as the Japanese began concentrating their forces around Sattelberg, with the main force arriving there on 11 October. The Japanese plans became known to the Australians through captured documents and by mid-October 1943 the Australian 24th Infantry Brigade had been brought up to reinforce the 20th. When the Japanese counterattack came, signalled by a bonfire on Sattelberg, the first wave fell upon the 24th Brigade around Jivevaneng on 16 October but the attack, having been put in a piecemeal fashion, was pushed <b>back.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> Japanese aircraft attacked Allied forces around Scarlet Beach and this was followed shortly an amphibious landing which was all but destroyed at sea by fire from American and Australian anti-aircraft and machine-guns. It was during this assault that an American soldier, Private Nathan Van Noy, from the 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment, performed the actions for which he was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Only a small number of Japanese managed to make it ashore amidst the devastating fire and, by the following day, these all had been killed or wounded by Australian infantry conducting mopping up operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{second meeting}} in New York was {{attended}} by Levine, Bellanca, and Chamberlin. With check in hand, Levine added a stipulation that Columbia Aircraft would select the crew on the flight, which Lindbergh objected to. Reminding Lindbergh that the WB-2 was the only plane that could make the flight at the time, they made him leave and call <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> to reconsider. The terms did not change, and Lindbergh returned to St. Louis without an airplane. Lindbergh then approached Travel Air Manufacturing Company, asking for a Travel Air 5000 modified with a Wright Whirlwind motor and was declined. Lindbergh also inquired {{what it would cost}} to buy a Fokker for the attempt; he was given a quote of $100,000 for a custom trimotor, and was told that Fokker would not build a single-engine craft for a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh instead purchased a single-place aircraft from Ryan aircraft, the Spirit of St. Louis, for $6000.|$|E

25|$|Hunter {{made her}} senior debut for Victoria in the 200304 season. She took 1/32 from 9.1 overs {{in her first}} match, against Western Australia, and had the winning runs hit from her bowling as Victoria lost by two wickets. She {{was in and out}} of the team in her first season and played in seven of eleven matches. A tail-ender, she only batted once and ended unbeaten without scoring, and she only managed four wickets at 31.25 at an economy rate of 3.19. Although a {{specialist}} bowler, she averaged less than six of the maximum ten overs allowed per bowler per match. In the first final against New South Wales, she took 0/14 from four overs as the Victorians chased down the target of 129 with six wickets to spare. However, New South Wales hit <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> and won by five wickets, taking 10 runs from Hunter's two overs. She was dropped for the third and deciding final, which New South Wales won.|$|E
25|$|The Web of Caves, {{which is}} in black and white, sees Walliams and Putner as aliens (somewhat similar in {{appearance}} to Movellans) trying to persuade the Doctor (Gatiss) to defeat their schemes. The Walliams alien appears alone at first and outlines his scheme to hollow out {{the core of the}} Earth {{and replace it with a}} motor; the Doctor dismisses this plan, in a rather bored fashion, as having been done, and the alien suggests he will come <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> with a new plan. The next day he returns, accompanied by the Putner alien, and proposes to drain the world's oceans into its core thus boiling them away; again the Doctor points out that it has been done, but decides he has to stop them. The two aliens and the Doctor agree on a time for their battle and the Doctor leaves in the TARDIS, only to have it rematerialise in the same spot, leaving the Doctor visibly annoyed. He disappears back into the TARDIS, only to have the Walliams alien obliviously comment on how nice the Doctor is.|$|E
25|$|Te Uku {{is served}} by the Raglan bus and school buses, but once also had {{services}} north and south. The first Hamilton-Raglan coach ran in 1880 and became a service car route about 1916. From March 1922 a {{two and a half}} hour, Pakoka Landing to Frankton, via Te Mata, “Silver Trail”, bus service started, with a motor launch connection to Kawhia on Fridays. Problems with rough roads and tides caused it to fail. In 1938 Western Highways started a service from Kawhia to Auckland via Makomako, Te Mata, Waingaro and Tuakau (via Highway 22) and <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> In 1946 Brosnan Motors started a daily run, leaving Kawhia at 5.45am, arriving at Auckland at 1pm, returning at 2 pm. and back at Kawhia about 9.30pm. In 1950 Brosnan Motors sold the Raglan-Kawhia run to Norman Rankin, who ended it in 1952. Brosnan Motors sold the Raglan-Auckland run to Pavlovich Motors in 1971. The first bus used on the Auckland-Kawhia run was a 7-seater Studebaker. Then a 10-seater Dodge used by Norman Collett later gave way to a 14-seater Oldsmobile. As the roads improved 18 and 21-seater Diamond T buses took over. Later 40-seaters ran from Raglan to Auckland, until Pavlovich closed the route in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to be judged on anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E
500|$|When scouts brought word on February 23 {{that the}} Mexican advance guard was in sight, the {{unprepared}} Texians gathered what food {{they could find}} in town and fell back to the Alamo. [...] By late afternoon, Béxar was occupied by about 1,500 Mexican troops, who quickly raised a blood-red flag signifying no quarter. For the next 13 days, the Mexican army besieged the Alamo. Several small skirmishes gave the defenders much-needed optimism, but had little real impact. [...] Bowie fell ill on February 24, leaving Travis in sole command of the Texian forces. [...] The same day, Travis sent messengers with a letter To the People of Texas & All Americans in the World, begging for reinforcements and vowing [...] "victory or death"; this letter was reprinted throughout the United States and much of Europe. [...] Texian and American volunteers began to gather in Gonzales, waiting for Fannin to arrive and lead them to reinforce the Alamo.

500|$|From {{conception}} {{to final}} release in 2009, drummer Aaron Harris {{estimates that the}} creation and execution of Wavering Radiant took {{about two and a}} half years. During the writing of the record, all of Isis' members were residing permanently within Los Angeles; a situation in contrast to their previous full-length, 2006's In the Absence of Truth; band members were divided between New York and Los Angeles throughout that album's inception and creation. The entire band felt a degree of dissatisfaction with In the Absence of Truth, and Harris felt that the logistical change was beneficial to the writing process, allowing for more time: [...] "rather than feeling like we had limited time to capture something, I felt like we could take our time with the songs, and come <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> to work on things rather than in a few weeks". The resulting sound was described by guitarist Michael Gallagher as [...] "more live [...] a little bit dirtier – almost, for lack of a better word, sloppy. But in a good way. We spent a lot of time getting all of our takes as close to perfect as we could on previous records. On this one, we went more with the vibe of the particular take in question." ...|$|E

In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and he picks it up. In the laundromat scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside the washer that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her {{to go on a}} date with him. He takes pictures of him in situations such as buying chocolate for her and the puppies scene, and others, with notes doting quips of what he would do for her.

500|$|On 22March, the {{day after}} he arrived in New Guinea, Jackson took No.75 Squadron on a dawn raid against the Japanese {{airfield}} at Lae. [...] Rather than attacking directly from the south, he led the Kittyhawks in from the east, where they would not be expected and where the rising sun would hide their approach. Achieving the surprise he had hoped for, Jackson made two strafing passes over the airfield, ignoring standard practice that called for only one such pass to reduce the risk from anti-aircraft fire. The Australians claimed a dozen Japanese planes destroyed on the ground and five more damaged. They also shot down two Mitsubishi Zero fighters in the air, and lost two Kittyhawks over Lae, along with one that had crash-landed on takeoff from Moresby. The Japanese struck <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> destroying two Kittyhawks at Seven Mile Aerodrome. With his losses mounting, Jackson was given permission to withdraw the squadron to Horn Island in Far North Queensland, but refused. On 4April, Jackson made a solo reconnaissance over Lae, after which he led another four Kittyhawks on a raid against the airfield, claiming seven enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground without loss to themselves; Japanese sources credited the Australians with only two machines destroyed, but seventeen others damaged. Two days later, Les Jackson was forced to ditch his aircraft on a coral reef, but made it to shore {{with the aid of a}} life jacket that John dropped to him, not realising at the time that the downed pilot was his younger brother.|$|E

He leaves her {{in the middle of}} Albert Square with some flyers he printed so she can find a new flatmate. Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson) sees the flyers and helps Stevie up. She invites him back to her flat, and asks him to move in. When Asher returns later, he has his brother Sol (Tosin Cole) and new friend Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen) with him, and Stevie says she does not mind them staying, so they all become friends. Olly warns Stevie not to attend a party later but Naz says they should go anyway, and on the way there, Stevie meets Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), but assumes he is a suicide bomber. At the party, Asher poses as Stevie's new boyfriend to make Olly jealous. She gets drunk and badmouths Olly to a girl called [...] (Roxanne McKee) but Pippa introduces Olly as her own boyfriend, so Stevie insults her, resulting in Pippa pushing Stevie. The four friends leave and Stevie meets Masood again and he offers her his coat because she is cold. Feeling humiliated by photos that have been posted on the internet from the party, Stevie worries her only chance to win Olly back has been ruined. She tells Naz she had an erotic dream about Masood and develops a crush on him. She tries to get work with Masood by flirting but is left embarrassed. She returns after being given tips from Naz, and Masood tells her they are short staffed and to come <b>back</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Stevie thinks her flirting was successful so goes over the top and flashes her bra, so Naz ushers her away.|$|E
