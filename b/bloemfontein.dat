5|$|John Ronald Reuel Tolkien {{was born}} on 3 January 1892 in <b>Bloemfontein</b> in the Orange Free State (now Free State Province in South Africa) to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was {{promoted}} to head the <b>Bloemfontein</b> office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who {{was born on}} 17 February 1894.|$|E
5|$|Reitz married twice. His first {{marriage}} (Cape Town 24 June 1874) was to Blanka Thesen (Stavanger, Norway, 15 October 1854 – <b>Bloemfontein,</b> 5 October 1887). She was {{the sister of}} Charles Wilhelm Thesen, and the daughter of Arnt Leonard Thesen, tradesman, and Anne Cathrine Margarethe Brandt. The Thesen family had settled in Knysna, Cape Colony, from Norway in 1869. The couple had seven sons and one daughter. After {{the death of his}} first wife Reitz remarried (<b>Bloemfontein,</b> 11 December 1889) with Cornelia Maria Theresia Mulder (Delft, Netherlands, 25 December 1863 – Cape Town 2 January 1935), daughter of Johannes Adrianus Mulder, typesetter, and Engelina Johanna van Hamme. At the time of her marriage Mulder was acting director of the Eunice Ladies' Institute at <b>Bloemfontein.</b> With his second wife he had six sons and one daughter.|$|E
5|$|After his {{resignation}} he {{established himself as}} law agent (wetsagent) in <b>Bloemfontein,</b> and acted as publisher of the Dutch language weekly paper De Tijd. Staatkundig Nieuws- en Advertentieblad voor den Oranje-Vrijstaat (The Times. Political Newspaper and Advertiser for the Orange Free State), started by H.A.L. Hamelberg as a competitor to the English language newspaper The Friend.|$|E
5|$|After six weeks' {{training}} in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the last stop before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. Notwithstanding these grand farewells, the Maritz Rebellion was all but over {{by the time the}} Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at <b>Bloemfontein.</b> The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned <b>Bloemfontein</b> for about a month, then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the South-West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.|$|E
5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in <b>Bloemfontein</b> which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The economic benefits grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and <b>Bloemfontein</b> (1890) and between <b>Bloemfontein</b> and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Institutionally, Reitz {{promoted}} {{the foundation of}} the Letterkundige en Wetenschappelijke Vereeniging (Literary and Scientific Society) of the Orange Free State, of which he was chairman for a while, the library at <b>Bloemfontein,</b> and the National Museum of the Orange Free State.|$|E
5|$|Later Spruyt {{acted as}} State President during the {{absences}} of President Pretorius from <b>Bloemfontein.</b> Although general opinion {{had it that}} Spruyt {{was a man of}} lesser qualities, on his resignation he was praised by State President Pretorius as very loyal and accurate in his work.|$|E
5|$|Under Reitz's {{presidency}} the new meeting {{hall for}} the Volksraad, the so-called Vierde Raadszaal (Fourth Council Hall) was opened (1893), {{and the new}} Government Building received a second floor (1895). Outside <b>Bloemfontein</b> the road network received attention.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{spent most}} of its early career in the South African Navy {{training}} or making good-will visits to foreign countries. She was laid up in the late 1950s and was recommissioned in 1961 {{to serve as an}} interim training ship until the shore-based training establishment then under construction was completed. This occurred in 1963 and <b>Bloemfontein</b> returned to briefly returned to reserve before she was deemed surplus to requirements. The ship was sunk as a target in 1967.|$|E
5|$|With his {{appointment}} to the judiciary of the Orange Free State, Reitz came into his own. His arrival – now almost thirty years old and just married – in <b>Bloemfontein</b> in August 1874 {{was the start of}} a residency of twenty-one years, as well as the start of a glowing career, to be crowned with his election as State President.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Delagoa Bay on a {{ship with}} J.A. Smellekamp as supercarga – he later became a {{well-known}} figure in South Africa – and his two travel companions and fellow migrants, Hendrik van der Linden and W.P.J. Poen, he travelled across the Lebombo Mountains in an ox-cart into the Transvaal. In March 1852 Spruyt was appointed schoolteacher {{in the town of}} Rustenburg. Because of disputes among the Dutchmen in the Transvaal, more specifically between Rev. Dirk van der Hoff and J.A. Smellekamp, who had now also settled there, Spruyt moved to the Orange Free State, where he established himself in <b>Bloemfontein.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1901, Alderson's {{innovations}} {{had resulted}} in several successful operations, participating in the battles of Paardeberg and Driefontein {{as well as the}} relief of Kimberley and the capture of <b>Bloemfontein</b> and Pretoria. The result of Alderson's contribution of these campaigns was to be rewarded with confirmation as a brigadier general, appointment as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and to receive the ceremonial post of Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria, who died the same year. He was mentioned in despatches several times (including by Lord Roberts dated 31 March 1900, and by Lord Kitchener dated 23 June 1902), and received the Queen's South Africa Medal.|$|E
5|$|During his {{lifetime}} H.P.N. Muller was well respected for his work. He was extensively decorated by {{almost all the}} countries he worked for or in, in many cases with the highest distinction. He was made a Knight Grand Cross in military and civilian orders of Portugal, Liberia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands, was commander of the French Legion of Honour, and knight in orders of Liberia, Annam and the Netherlands. Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the <b>Bloemfontein</b> municipal authorities named a street after him.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 Muller {{travelled}} to South Africa, {{where he}} visited Cape Town, the Orange Free State, and the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek. In Pretoria {{he attended the}} inauguration of President Kruger and in <b>Bloemfontein</b> he struck up a friendship with the newly elected President M.T. Steyn and his family. He also renewed his relations with other leading statesmen, like former President F.W. Reitz, government secretary P.J. Blignaut, {{and chairman of the}} Volksraad C.H. Wessels. In Cape Town, he was granted an audience with High Commissioner Sir Alfred Milner.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the Imperial Scout Headquarters {{granted the}} {{complete}} {{independence of the}} Scout Movement in South Africa. Work started on yet another constitution which was finalised in 1936 at <b>Bloemfontein</b> during the visit of Baden-Powell. During 1937, the Boy Scouts Association of South Africa {{became a member of}} the International Scout Conference (now World Scout Conference) and was registered with the International Bureau (now World Scout Bureau) on 1 December 1937. South Africa was the first of the Commonwealth countries to achieve independence for its Scout Movement.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave him a lot of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to <b>Bloemfontein</b> in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left <b>Bloemfontein</b> to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bloemfontein,</b> {{the former}} British {{garrison}} town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal {{seat of government}} became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was {{in the latter part}} of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan ("Makapansgat") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Bloemfontein</b> Spruyt {{worked as}} clerk of the Landdrost (1854–1855), {{and in that}} {{capacity}} he acted {{as secretary of the}} Volksraad on two occasions (September 1854 and February 1855), also filling in as Government Secretary. On the strength of his capacities Spruyt was appointed clerk to the State President in September 1855. Soon after, during the illness of Government Secretary Groenendaal, Spruyt again took up that position. In October 1856 he was appointed to the vacancy and succeeded J. Groenendaal as Government Secretary of the Orange Free State. Spruyt was regarded by his colleagues as an accurate civil servant, but as a lesser politician and statesman, reason that he was not appointed Acting State President when State President Boshoff went on leave in 1858. However, Boshoff trusted Spruyt fully, and he allowed him to represent the presidency in meetings of the Volksraad on several occasions in 1861 and 1862.|$|E
5|$|In December 1994, Mandela {{published}} Long Walk to Freedom, {{an autobiography}} based around a manuscript {{he had written}} in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with American journalist Richard Stengel. In late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the ANC in <b>Bloemfontein,</b> at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them Winnie Mandela; although she {{expressed an interest in}} reconciling, Nelson initiated divorce proceedings in August 1995. By 1995, he had entered into a relationship with Graça Machel, a Mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president Samora Machel. They had first met in July 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with Machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. She turned down Mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between Mozambique and Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|In late 1859 Pretorius {{was invited}} to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly {{as a means to}} {{overcome}} the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for <b>Bloemfontein,</b> appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be Acting President in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as President of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.|$|E
5|$|In the Orange Free State President Brand {{was one of}} the {{politicians}} who held on to a more cautious and consolidating policy towards the British government at the Cape, maintaining strict neutrality. In this position Brand followed the habit of a lifetime, and it earned him a British knighthood. Despite the changing political climate and the polarisation of political positions, Brand remained hugely popular with the burghers of the Orange Free State. The presidential elections of 1883 could on content have become a political battle between the pan-Dutch Afrikaner Bond supporters and followers of the Brand-line. However, Reitz, as the ideal pan-Dutch candidate, again refused to stand against Brand. Only when Brand died in office five years later, the time was ripe for change. Reitz stood candidate and won a landslide victory on the ticket of Afrikaner nationalism. He was inaugurated as state president in the Tweetoringkerk (Two-Towers Church) in <b>Bloemfontein</b> on 10 January 1889.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{was one of}} two {{contrasting}} halves for the Highlanders. The {{team won}} their first four matches — against the Chiefs, Crusaders, Waratahs, and Hurricanes. By that point the Highlanders were {{on the top of the}} table, but lost the position after losing to the Brumbies in Canberra. After a win over the Rebels, loss to the Stormers, and a bye, the Highlanders defeated the Blues 30–27 in Dunedin. They narrowly defeated the Cheetahs in <b>Bloemfontein</b> in round 10; they then stood fifth in the table. The team went on to lose five of their seven remaining matches, and slip to ninth on the table after the end of the regular season. Despite winning more matches than in 2011, the Highlanders finished fourth in the New Zealand conference — with only the Blues below them.|$|E
5|$|The British {{relief of}} Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning {{of the war}} against the Boers. Morale {{plummeted}} among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot. He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so, along with a few thousand foreign volunteers (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians). When British troops entered <b>Bloemfontein</b> on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war. Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May Lord Roberts took Johannesburg. Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to Machadodorp, and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.|$|E
5|$|Despite serious set-backs at Colenso, Stormberg, Magersfontein, and Spion Kop in January—and with Ladysmith {{still under}} siege—the British mounted a five {{division}} counter-invasion of the Orange Free State in February. The attacking force included {{a division of}} cavalry commanded by Lieutenant General John French with the New South Wales Lancers, Queensland Mounted Infantry and New South Wales Army Medical Corps attached. First, Kimberley was relieved following the battles of Modder River and Magersfontein, and the retreating Boers defeated at Paardeberg, with the New South Wales Mounted Rifles locating the Boer general, Piet Cronjé. The British entered <b>Bloemfontein</b> on 13 March 1900, while Ladysmith was relieved. Disease began to take its toll and scores of men died. Still the advance continued, with the drive to Pretoria in May including more than 3,000 Australians. Johannesburg fell on 30 May, and the Boers withdrew from Pretoria on 3 June. The New South Wales Mounted Rifles and Western Australians saw action again at Diamond Hill on 12 June. Mafeking was relieved on 17 May.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone had the Transvaal's {{annexation}} as a British territory formally {{announced in}} Pretoria on 12 April 1877. Burgers resigned {{and returned to}} the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as President was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to <b>Bloemfontein</b> to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train {{for the first time in}} his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Already in 1878, voices sounded for Reitz {{to run for}} the presidency, but President Brand's {{position}} was still very strong and Reitz openly praised his qualities and refused to stand against him. In the late 1870s and early 1880s the political temperature ran high in the Orange Free State. The annexation of the South African Republic (Transvaal) by the British in 1877 and the First Anglo-Boer War of 1880–1881 in which that republic regained its autonomy impacted deeply on political sentiments in the Orange Free State. On the one hand there were those who propagated caution in the relationship with the British, on the other there developed a political movement that strongly propagated a (reawakened) Afrikaner national consciousness. Reitz was part of the latter, and together with C.L.F. Borckenhagen, editor of the <b>Bloemfontein</b> Express newspaper, he wrote a constitution for the Afrikaner Bond (Afrikaner Union), a political party originally set up by leading Afrikaner politicians in the Cape Colony, like Rev S.J. du Toit and his Genootskap van Regte Afrikaners ('Society of True Afrikaners') and Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr and the Zuidafrikaansche Boeren Beschermings Vereeniging ('South African Boer Protection Association'). Among the supporters of this new Afrikaner nationalism in the Orange Free State was also Reitz's successor, M.T. Steyn, then still a young lawyer. The constitution was presented in April 1881, and several months later Reitz became the chairman of the Bond. His overt political activities earned Reitz criticism from those who feared a breakdown of relations with the British. It is obvious, however, that a wind of change was blowing through the Boer republics and among the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony, which was to change Anglo-Boer relations drastically.|$|E
5|$|The Highlanders {{struggled}} in Moore's {{first season as}} coach. They won only three of their thirteen matches and finished eleventh on the table. Many of their losses were by seven points or less, including losses to the Reds, Brumbies, Waratahs and Hurricanes. The team did not win a match until the eighth round, when they defeated the Lions in Dunedin. Their second win of the season was over the Cheetahs <b>Bloemfontein</b> in round twelve. However, the team finished their season on a high — defeating the Crusaders in Christchurch. The Crusaders {{would go on to}} win the tournament that season. The 2009 season was similar to 2008, with the team winning four of their thirteen matches, and again losing many of their matches by seven points or less. After losing their first three matches, including to the Brumbies and Hurricanes by less than seven points, they defeated the Crusaders 6–0 in Dunedin for their first win of the season. The match produced the lowest aggregate score in Super Rugby history. After a narrow loss to the Chiefs, the Highlanders picked up their second win of the season over the Cheetahs. They then achieved their most dominant win of the season; a 36–12 victory over the Bulls. The Bull eventually won the tournament; the second year the Highlanders defeated the eventual champions. After a bye round, the Highlanders defeated the Reds for their third consecutive win. The team lost their remaining matches of the season — this included losses to the Stormers, Lions, and Western Force.|$|E
