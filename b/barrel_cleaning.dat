50|$|Due to {{the large}} case {{capacity}} {{in relation to the}} 6.5 mm (.264 inch) calibre bore size the 6.5×63mm Messner Magnum is very harsh on barrels. It typically wears out a rifle barrel in 500 to 1000 rounds. A lot of thorough <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> (after every 5 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots help to minimize barrel wear. This makes this cartridge impractical for most competition shooters who tend to fire a lot of rounds in practice to acquire and maintain expert long-range marksmanship.|$|E

A lot of thorough <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> (after every 5 to 10 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots help to minimize barrel wear.

5000|$|Original {{production}} rifles at Remington and Smith-Corona had a dark gray/black finish {{similar to}} the bluing of late World War I. Beginning in late 1943 a lighter gray/green parkerizing finish was used. This later finish was also used on arsenal repaired weapons.It is somewhat unusual to find a World War I or early World War II M1903 with its original dated barrel. Much, if not all, World War II [...]30-06 ammunition used a corrosive primer which left corrosive salts in the barrel. If not removed by frequent and proper <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> these residues could cause pitting and excessive wear. In the jungle fighting on various Pacific islands cleaning was sometimes lax and the excessive moisture compounded the corrosive action of the residue.|$|E
50|$|Factory rifles in 6.5×68mm {{normally}} have 250 mm to 280 mm (1 in 9.8 to 11 inch) twist rates, which are {{too long to}} adequately stabilize modern long heavy 6.5 mm bullets. This slow twist rate was chosen since the bullet jackets used in the 1930s were {{not strong enough to}} cope with the forces generated by the magnum muzzle velocities of the 6.5×68mm. The traditional 6.5×68mm twists nowadays inhibits its potential. To make the 6.5×68mm an awesome long-range cartridge, rifle barrels with a 200 mm to 230 mm (1 in 7.9 to 9 inch) twist rate are a better choice. Due to the large case capacity in relation to the 6.5 mm (.264 inch) caliber bore size the 6.5×68mm is very harsh on barrels. The 6.5×68mm typically wears out a rifle barrel in 500 to 1000 rounds. A lot of thorough <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> (after every 5 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots help to minimize barrel wear. This makes this cartridge impractical for most competition shooters who tend to fire a lot of rounds in practice to acquire and maintain expert long-range marksmanship.|$|E
50|$|The {{floating}} chamber {{can become}} fouled and stuck leading to poor feeding. When field stripping the Ace, the recoil spring is removed after removing the slide. The ejector may be removed before removing the barrel and the floating chamber must be aligned vertically {{to remove the}} barrel from the slide. Once the barrel is removed, the floating chamber can be rotated and separated from the main <b>barrel</b> for <b>cleaning.</b> When the extractor is replaced into the barrel, {{the back of the}} extractor should slide into the rear slot of the slide.|$|R
5000|$|The breech would, on rare occasion, fail {{to close}} entirely {{due to the}} lack of an {{effective}} obturation seal; however, due to the conical shape of both the breech and bolt face, escaping gas would be directed towards the muzzle of the rifle as to not burn the soldier's skin unless his support arm was inappropriately placed. The placement of the primer directly behind the bullet meant the firing needle was enclosed in black powder when the gun was fired, causing stress to the pin, which could break over time and render the rifle useless until it could be replaced. Soldiers were provided with two replacement needles for that purpose. The needle could be replaced quite easily, even in the field, in under 30 seconds. Because the rifle used black powder, residue accumulated at the back of the <b>barrel,</b> making <b>cleaning</b> necessary after about 60-80 shots. This was not a large problem because the individual soldier carried fewer cartridges than that and Dreyse created an [...] "air chamber" [...] by having a protruding needle tube (the Chassepot also had this, but it was more likely to jam after fewer shots because of its smaller-diameter chamber). A soldier trained well before the war of 1866 had to finish field cleaning in less than 10 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{industrial}} companies use 55 and 30 gallon barrels to hold, transport, and dispense liquids and chemicals. Due to this {{there are}} many businesses that will reuse their barrels. In order to reuse their barrels, they must clean them to ensure there is no cross contamination from contents {{that were in the}} barrel before placing new contents in them. This is normally a time consuming process for most businesses depending on the material that was inside the barrel. With the hefty time relationship related to <b>cleaning</b> <b>barrels</b> most companies either dispose of their barrels, either legally or sometimes illegally, or take the time to clean them to save money. It’s found that the environmental impact from both of these methods is fairly drastic either taking over 75 gallons of water to clean them or extensive energy processes to transport, destroy, and recycle these barrels. On top of the environmental concerns on a global level there are concerns on the internal level that include long cycle times for each barrel, operator safety, poor working conditions and possible contamination of new product being placed into the barrels. A new way of <b>cleaning</b> these <b>barrels</b> is designed such that there is a repeatable cleaning method for a given cycle time and barrel soil level. A drastic reduction in water using the newly designed system from 75 gallons to just under 2 gallons. A cycle time decrease is created on the magnitude of 50 times from 30 minutes to 38 seconds per barrel. The installed automated barrel cleaner is much safer than the previous method of cleaning as the operator does not have to handle the <b>barrel</b> during the <b>cleaning</b> cycle. Complete coverage of the interior surface of the barrel is obtained by designing a rotary head which spins in a full 360 -degree path while being actuated up and down the interior of the barrel utilizing an electro-mechanical apparatus and a microcontroller.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess {{postural}} risks associated with the current gun <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> method and to develop an ergonomic gun <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> method that could reduce such risks. The inner surfaces of gun barrels should be cleaned after use to maintain their firing function. The current method of cleaning gun barrels requires multiple soldiers to push and pull a long cleaning pole for 1 &# 8211; 3 hr. Such motions require both hands to be raised to shoulder height. The current manual method and a newly designed automated method were compared in terms of safety and effectiveness. Postural risk assessments were performed using OWAS, RULA, and REBA. Results: The manual cleaning method involves the highest postural risk level (Action Category/Level 4), requiring immediate intervention, and exposes multiple soldiers to life-threatening situations for a longer time during wartime. The postural risk associated with using the automated cleaning system was much lower (Action Category/Level 2). Once loaded into the gun barrel by a single soldier, the automated system takes approximately 20 min to complete cleaning. The automated cleaning method reduces musculoskeletal disorder risks associated with cleaning gun barrels and increases military power. The automated gun <b>barrel</b> <b>cleaning</b> method is an ergonomic solution {{that can be used for}} cleaning gun barrels within a short time without exposing soldiers to postural risks...|$|E

Troller's caption: Girls in the kitchen - <b>cleaning</b> <b>barrels</b> (H- 12) Estate of the artist, Doris Rauch. Born in Bruenn, Austria-Hungary (now Brno, Czechoslovakia) in 1900, Norbert Troller served as a soldier in World War I, spending time as a prisoner-of-war in Italy. After the war he studied architecture in Brno and Vienna and worked as an architect in Brno until the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. He was deported to Theresienstadt in 1942, where he worked as an architect for the Jewish self-adminstration of the camp, and produced works of art as well. In 1944 he was imprisoned by the Gestapo, and was sent to Auschwitz later that year. After liberation, he lived briefly in Cracow, and then reopened his architectural business in Prague and Brno. He emigrated to the United States in 1948 and worked for the National Jewish Welfare Board in New York designing Jewish community centers, before opening his own practice. He died in 1984. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R
