25|$|Austin had {{an unmistakable}} {{physical}} presence, described as 6 feet 2 {{inches tall and}} athletic, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and a shock of red hair. In addition to his native English, Austin spoke French, Spanish and Japanese, and could read Italian.|$|E
25|$|The {{silhouette}} of men's fashion changed in similar ways: by the mid-1820s coats featured <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> with puffed sleeves, a narrow waist, and full skirts. Trousers were worn for smart day wear, while breeches continued in use at court {{and in the}} country.|$|E
25|$|Androgens, such as {{testosterone}} and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are {{the major}} sex hormones in XY chromosomed individuals, and {{are responsible for the}} development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics, such as a deep voice, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and a masculine pattern of hair, muscle, and fat distribution. In addition, they stimulate sex drive and the frequency of spontaneous erections and are responsible for acne, body odor, and masculine-pattern scalp hair loss. Androgens act by binding to and activating the androgen receptor (AR), their biological target in the body. In contrast to androgens, antiandrogens are drugs that prevent the effects of androgens in the body. They do this by preventing androgens from binding to the AR or by preventing the production of androgens. The most commonly used antiandrogens in transgender women are cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, and GnRH analogues.|$|E

25|$|Props {{have to take}} in {{pressure}} from the locks and loose forwards pushing from behind and the opposition pushing against them, so they are often among the strongest players in a team. Some of the more successful props have short necks and <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> to absorb this force as well as powerful legs to drive the scrum forward. Since the game has become professional, non-specialist props or hookers cannot play in the front row. If, through sendings-off or injuries, a team {{does not have enough}} specialist front row players, the scrums become 'uncontested' (i.e. no pushing is allowed and the team putting the ball into the scrum wins it). On their own scrum, the loosehead's role is to provide the hooker with a clear view to strike the ball, while the tighthead tries to keep the scrum stable. When the opposition is putting the ball in, the tighthead attempts to disrupt the opposing hooker or loosehead, making {{it difficult for them to}} win the ball.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six basic body shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and skinny. With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, they fear the rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the Highway Code, therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E
500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul {{was a big}} man, possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and a big voice. He spoke {{the language of the}} common soldier, and led from the front. Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to be intimidated. When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E

6000|$|She {{tried to}} answer, {{but she could}} not, and in another minute, to tell the honest truth, she had {{exchanged}} the gate-post for Harold's <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and was finishing her [...] "cry" [...] there.|$|R
500|$|Leech's regimen {{differed}} from most swimmers because Froelich {{was not an}} advocate of distance training, and designed shorter workouts for his students. She trained once a day, swimming no more than [...] Froelich did not push her to continue swimming laps when she felt tired, but emphasised an efficient stroke mechanism, which Leech implemented with a long and graceful arm action. Leech stood 180 centimetres (5'11"), but weighed only , with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> slim hips and large hands and feet. Her long streamlined action prompted observers to call her a [...] "flying fish". Spinal problems caused by a back misalignment prevented her from using the optimal flip turn preferred by freestyle swimmers. Instead, {{she was forced to}} utilise the touch turn, which was slower.|$|E
500|$|Relatively small (5 foot 7, 180 pounds (82kg)), Rogan was solidly {{built and}} strong, with thin legs and a narrow waist but <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b> He threw and batted right-handed, and used an unusually heavy bat. [...] "You saw Ernie Banks hit in his prime, then you saw Rogan", said Buck O'Neil. [...] "He could hit that ball...He {{was the type}} of guy that stood {{a long way from the}} plate. Not too close, because they'd jam you." [...] According to his {{longtime}} teammate Frank Duncan, [...] "Rogan was one of the best low-ball hitters I ever saw, and one of the best curve-ball hitters. Rogan taught Bob and Irish Meusel how to hit curve balls." [...] While not extremely fast, he ran the bases well and stole when necessary.|$|E
500|$|Flashman is [...] tall, weighs [...] (12½ {{stone in}} the first book, {{fourteen}} {{stone in the}} last), has <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and is attractive to women. He was forced into marriage in the first book, after he [...] "caddishly deflowered" [...] Elspeth Morrison, {{the daughter of a}} wealthy Scottish textile manufacturer with whom he had been billeted. Despite being married—and the fact he deeply loves his wife—Flashman is [...] "a compulsive womaniser" [...] who has bedded 480 women by the tenth book in the series, which was set in 1859. Elspeth is also probably unfaithful to him on several occasions. Flashman notes that he has three [...] "prime talents, for horses, languages, and fornication"; he was also described by the master-at-arms of the 11th Hussars as a strong swordsman and was skilled with a lance, particularly at tent pegging. When it is necessary for him to control his fear, he will perform bravely, although is more adept at saving his own skin at the expense of others.|$|E

5000|$|The {{record label}} is often {{associated}} with the symbol of the [...] "Chaos Cross" [...] and the [...] "Twisted Chaos Cross", symbols which have appeared on several Eskaton releases, such as Gold Is The Metal with the <b>Broadest</b> <b>Shoulders.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{second section}} of Facundo explores {{the life of}} its titular character, Juan Facundo Quirogathe [...] "Tiger of the Plains". Despite being born into a wealthy family, Facundo {{received}} only a basic education in reading and writing. He loved gambling, being called el jugador (the player)in fact, Sarmiento describes his gambling as [...] "an ardent passion burning in his belly". As a youth Facundo was antisocial and rebellious, refusing to mix with other children, and these traits became more pronounced as he matured. Sarmiento describes an incident in which Facundo killed a man, writing {{that this type of}} behaviour [...] "marked his passage through the world". Sarmiento gives a physical description of the man he considers to personify the caudillo: [...] " [...] short and well built stature; his <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> supported, on a short neck, a well-formed head covered with very thick, black and curly hair", with [...] "eyes ...full of fire".|$|E
500|$|Drax is {{physically}} abnormal, as {{are many of}} Bond's later adversaries. He has very <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders,</b> a large head and protruding teeth with diastema; his face is badly scarred from a wartime explosion. According to the writers Kingsley Amis and Benson—both of whom subsequently wrote Bond novels—Drax is the most successful villain in the Bond canon. Amis considers this to be [...] "because the most imagination and energy has gone into his portrayal. He lives in the real world... his physical presence fills Moonraker. The view is shared by Chancellor, who considers Drax [...] "perhaps the most believable" [...] of all Fleming's villains. The cultural historian Jeremy Black writes that as with Le Chiffre and Mr Big—the villains {{of the first two}} Bond novels—Drax's origins and war history are vital {{to an understanding of the}} character. Like several other antagonists in the Bond canon, Drax was German, reminding readers of a familiar threat in 1950s Britain. Because Drax is without a girlfriend or wife he is, according to the norms of Fleming and his works, abnormal in Bond's world.|$|E
500|$|An authoritative, combative stylist, Macartney's élan {{and devastating}} strokemaking led Kent cricketer Kenneth Hutchings to dub him [...] "The Governor-General". Fingleton noted that, {{early in his}} innings, Macartney had a {{strategy}} of aiming a shot straight at the bowler's head, in order to rattle him and seize a psychological advantage. On one occasion, after reaching a century before lunch {{on the first day}} of a match, he immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team-mate brought out and stated [...] "Now I'm going to have a hit". His rate of scoring and boundary-hitting subsequently increased. He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Leg spinning Test team-mate Arthur Mailey recalled that Macartney would often hit him for six in Sydney Grade Cricket matches. Grinning, he would say [...] "Pitch another one there and I'll hit you for a few more". On the occasions when he lost his wicket attempting further long hits, Macartney's grin remained, and he would remark [...] "Wasn't it good fun?" [...] The famed cricket writer RC Robertson-Glasgow said ...|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} {{distinguished}} from Splendrillia aoteana by its much smaller size, the <b>broader</b> <b>shoulder,</b> and the slender, short, oblique costae, sometimes reduced to pointed tubercles {{on the body}} whorl, their number being 12 to 14 on the body whorl.|$|R
6000|$|Klaus {{took a look}} at them, {{leaning over}} Hendricks' <b>broad</b> <b>shoulder.</b> [...] "You can see what we're up against. There's another type. Maybe it was abandoned. Maybe it didn't work. But there must be a Second Variety. There's One and Three." ...|$|R
500|$|Several {{film critics}} have {{described}} Mulan as a tomboy. Andy Patrizio of IGN observed, [...] "In this slightly modernized {{version of the}} story, Mulan... {{is something of a}} rebel and a tomboy. She has no interest in being a good little subservient wife, despite her sighing parents' wishes." [...] Jo Johnson, in contribution to the book Queers in American Popular Culture Volume 1: Film and Television, wrote that [...] "Unlike other Disney heroines, Mulan is immediately coded as a tomboy," [...] observing {{the way in which the}} character speaks using a full mouth. Johnson additionally noticed several ways in which Mulan's design and personality differ from those typically associated with traditional Disney heroines and princesses, citing the character's clumsy, awkward demeanor; <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and muscular limbs; unruly single strand of hair; and choice of everyday attire which usually consists of loose, baggy clothing concealing her [...] "traditionally slim Disney waist." [...] Additionally, Mulan's intelligence has been observed in several professional analyses, with critics often citing the character as [...] "brainy." ...|$|E
500|$|Bostock's {{deposition}} describes Teach as a [...] "tall spare {{man with}} a very black beard which he wore very long". [...] It is the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and {{is the source of}} his cognomen, Blackbeard. [...] Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. [...] Johnson (1724) described him as [...] "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." [...] Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone. [...] Teach was tall, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. [...] Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing [...] "a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches (Slow match) under his hat", the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. [...] Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. [...] Teach may have used other aliases; on 30November, the Monserrat Merchant encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).|$|E
2500|$|He was an {{aggressive}} batman, stocky in build like his father, particularly {{later in his}} career, with <b>broad</b> <b>shoulders</b> and strong arms.
