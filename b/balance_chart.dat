Activities in time-distance diagrams are displayed both along a time axis and along a distance axis according to their relative linear position. This allows showing not only the location of the activity but also the direction of progress and the progress rate. Activities can be presented as geometrical shapes showing the occupation of the work site over time such that conflicting access can be detected visually. Different types of activities are differentiated by color, fill pattern, line type, or special symbols. A symbolic drawing along the distance axis is often used to improve the understanding of the time-distance diagram.|$|E

Pitt {{suffered}} from psychotic symptoms requiring anti-psychotics and allegedly may have suffered from Asperger syndrome. Pitt was a patient of Dr David Brown between 1995 and 1997, who prescribed him various drugs to treat his symptoms. However, Pitt and his parents believed that he should have been prescribed anti-depressants and were opposed to him being forced to take the medication. It was heard at the inquiry that Pitt did not take the medication or respond to any prescriptions made out to him, additionally he did not see Dr David Brown for four years after 1997. He returned to Gartnavel Royal Hospital in 2001 after his condition failed to improve and was again prescribed medication which he refused to take; he was then prescribed alternative drugs and given two [...] CT scans and a consultation with a psychologist. In 2003 Pitt was admitted to the McNair ward of Gartnavel Royal Hospital. Dr David Brown believed Pitt may require forcibly injected medicine if he continued to refuse his oral medication. However, his condition improved after an alternative prescription which Pitt agreed to take. During this stay, Pitt refused food and fluids given to him by hospital staff but accepted some from his parents. Dr June Ellison requested that the hospital and Pitt’s parents maintain a fluid <b>balance</b> <b>chart.</b> It was found, after Pitt’s death, that the fluid balance charts were maintained poorly and on some days had no entry at all. Pitt was found to be suffering from dehydration on 28 May 2003 and spent long periods of time lying in his bed. Kenneth Pitt’s father, Hugh Pitt, requested that he be given physiotherapy but this was not provided. The same day Pitt was found collapsed in his en-suite bathroom and could not be revived, he was transported to and pronounced dead in the Western Infirmary where he was given active resuscitation. Pitt died of [...] pulmonary thromboembolism and it was found that it wasn’t likely that his anti-psychotic medication or Pitt’s immobility and dehydration caused the pulmonary thromboembolism.

40|$|Dietary carbohydrates, {{which are}} absorbed as hexose, (glucose, fructose) have a caloric value of 3. 9 kcal/g (16. 3 kJ/g), and their {{cellular}} metabolism produces approximately 38 mol ATP/mol. However, chicory inulin and oligofructose resist digestion {{and they are}} not absorbed in {{the upper part of the}} gastrointestinal tract. After oral ingestion, they reach the colon intact where they become hydrolyzed and extensively fermented by saccharolytic bacteria, which produce short-chain carboxylic and lactic acids as electron sinks. Depending on both the degree of their colonic fermentation and the assumptions of the model used, the caloric value of such nondigested but fermented carbohydrates varies between 0 and 2. 5 kcal/g. Through the catabolism of the absorbed short-chain carboxylic and lactic acids, they may produce up to 17 mol ATP/mol of fermented sugar moiety. Because the daily intake of these dietary carbohydrates is likely to remain relatively small (5 % of total daily calorie intake), it is of low relevance nutritionally to give them a precise caloric value. On the basis of biochemical <b>balance</b> <b>charts</b> for carbon atoms, metabolic pathways and energy yields to the host, the caloric value of a fructosyl residue in chicory inulin and oligofructose has been calculated to be approximately 25 - 35 % that of a fully digested and absorbed fructose molecule.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{peri-operative}} {{fluid and}} electrolyte {{management in the}} UK may be suboptimal. We assessed the attitudes of consultant surgeons to fluid and electrolyte prescribing and gathered suggestions for improvement in education on the subject. METHODS: A postal questionnaire survey was sent to 1091 Fellows of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. Of the 730 (67 %) replies, 20 were invalid or incomplete, and 710 (65 %) questionnaires were analysed. Outcome measures included provision of guidelines and teaching to junior staff on fluid and electrolyte prescribing, appropriateness of fluid management and suggestions to improve standards. RESULTS: Junior staff were given written guidelines in 22 % of instances. Only 16 % of respondents felt that their preregistration house officers (PRHOs) were adequately trained in the subject before joining the firm; 15 % also stated that PRHOs did not receive much training on their firm. 65 % felt that fluid <b>balance</b> <b>charts</b> were accurately maintained, nursing shortages being the commonest reason for inaccuracies.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Introduction: Acute kidney injury {{results from}} a rapid decline in kidney function. There are many {{potential}} causes, {{some of which are}} preventable. It carries the risks of mortality, progression to chronic kidney disease and worsening of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. There is a scarcity of data on the epidemiology of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa. The aims of this study were to describe the epidemiology of acute kidney injury at Groote Schuur hospital, and factors associated with mortality and renal recovery. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of patients with acute kidney injury, referred to Groote Schuur Hospital Renal Unit from the 8 th of July 2012 to the 8 th of July 2013. Ethics approval was granted by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee. We excluded patients younger than 13 years, kidney transplant patients, and those not fulfilling the consensus definition of acute kidney injury according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group. Data on patient demographics, medical history, clinical observations, investigations, and cause of acute kidney injury was collected from a clerking sheet designed for the study. Patients were followed up at, or after 3 months (90 days) for assessment of survival and renal recovery. The main outcomes were recovery of renal function and mortality at 3 months. Data was entered into an Excel spreadsheet, and imported onto Stata 12. 1 for analysis. Results: A total of 366 patients were included. The median age was 44 years (IQR 14 - 82). Of these 214 were male (58. 5 %). Referrals were from medical, surgical and obstetrics and gynaecology departments. The majority, 217 (59. 3 %) were medical referrals. Most, 265 (72. 4 %) had community acquired acute kidney injury. The majority of the 101 patients with hospital acquired acute kidney injury, 72 (71. 3 %) had severe, stage 3 acute kidney injury. Hypertension was the commonest co-morbidity, present in 152 (41. 5 %) of the patients. There were 75 (20. 6 %) HIV positive patients. Acute tubular necrosis was {{the most common cause of}} acute kidney injury, identified in 251 (68. 6 %) patients. Renal biopsies were carried out in 36 (9. 8 %) patients. More than half, 202 (55. 2 %), of the patients were in the intensive care unit, while 204 (55. 7 %) were dialysed. Fluid input was recorded in 140 patients (38. 3 %). Overall 3 month mortality was 38. 8 % (142 patients). Of the 224 surviving patients, 119 (53. 1 %) had a follow up serum creatinine. Of these, 95 (80. 5 %) had full renal recovery, and 4 (3. 4 %) went on to end stage renal disease. On multivariate analysis, mechanical ventilation was strongly associated with mortality at 3 months (OR 2. 46, p-value 0. 0 19, 95 % CI 1. 41 - 4. 03). Sepsis had a borderline significant association with 3 month mortality (OR 1. 83, P-value 0. 066, 95 %CI 1. 02 – 3. 27), as did prolonged time to dialysis (OR 1. 93, p-value 0. 080, 95 % CI 0. 93 – 4. 03). HIV was not associated with mortality on univariate analysis (OR 1. 07, p-value 0. 801, 95 %CI 0. 64 - 1. 80). Conclusions: Acute kidney injury carries a high mortality risk, most significant in mechanically ventilated patients. Sepsis and, in those dialysed, late dialysis, may be associated with a high risk of mortality.

40|$|Concerns {{about the}} over-prescription of {{peri-operative}} fluids, particularly normal saline, {{culminated in the}} recent publication of UK national guidelines on fluid prescription during and after surgery. A working group comprising members of the nutrition support team, surgeons, anaesthetists and pharmacists therefore sought to reduce the overall levels of fluid prescription and to limit normal saline usage in our large Teaching Hospital by producing written local fluid prescribing guidelines and holding a series of fluid prescription education sessions for consultants and junior staff. Ideally, the success of such measures would have been determined by studies on fluid balance, body weight and/or measured body water in large numbers of individual patients in a large cluster-randomised controlled trial. However, this would have proved logistically difficult and very costly especially as it is notoriously difficult {{to rely on the}} accuracy of daily fluid <b>balance</b> <b>charts</b> in large numbers of patients on busy post-operative surgical wards. We therefore undertook a pragmatic study, comparing historical data on fluid type/volume prescribed (from both individual and ward level pharmacy records), oedema status and clinical outcomes from 2002 with two prospective audits of similar data carried out during 2008 and 2009. Our data showed that in the comparable, elective surgical patients within each audit, there was a decline in total intravenous fluids prescribed over the first 5 post-operative days from 21 · 1 litres per patient in 2002 to 14 · 2 litres per patient in 2009 (P< 0 · 05), while pharmacy records showed that the proportion of 0 · 9 % saline supplied declined from 60 % to 35 % of all fluids supplied to the surgical wards involved, with a concomitant increase in the use of 4 %/ 0 · 18 % dextrose-saline and Hartmann's solution. Alongside these changes in fluid prescribing, the number of patients with clinically apparent oedema declined from 53 % in 2002 to 36 % in 2009; gut function returned more quickly (6 d in 2002 v. 4 d in 2009, P< 0 · 05) and the length of stay improved from 13 d in 2002 to 10 d in 2009, P< 0 · 05).

Ji and Xue (2002) obtained the mean working dimensions from the reverse chain matrix containing reverse tolerance chains. Huang et al.

Process-oriented tolerancing was focused upon, by considering all the variations arising due to tool wear, measurement device fluctuations, tolerance stack-up propagation (Ding et al. 2005). A process optimization model was introduced which considers process means and process tolerances simultaneously, with sequential operation adjustment to reduce process variability, and with part compensation to offset process shifting (Jeang et al. 2007). Peng et al. (2008) derived quality loss function of interrelated critical-to-quality dimensions. Through this quality loss function, the design-tolerances of the component are determined for achieving an improved product as well as process quality. The tolerance <b>chart</b> <b>balancing</b> was mathematically modeled for minimizing the manufacturing cost and quality loss (Jeang 2011). Concurrent tolerancing was identified as an optimization problem and a feasible solution for systematically distributing the process tolerances within the design constraints was proposed (Sivakumar et al. 2012).

The major issues {{for this study were}} the efficiency and appropriateness of FB charting. The study design included an analysis of 250 medical records and an opinion survey. Seventy-five doctors and 98 nurses participated in the survey. The results indicated that 50 % of all medical records had FB charts and in these cases they made up between 12 and 16 % of the whole medical record. Intravenous infusion and urinary catheterization accounted for almost 70 % of the recorded reasons for using them. Thirty-two per cent of FB charts were found to be incomplete or inaccurate. Forty-six per cent of doctors and nurses reported that they believed that charts were not always terminated when they were not required. The most common belief among doctors was that only doctors should discontinue the FB charts. Nurses were almost unanimous in believing that they should not do this without the agreement of the doctors! It was concluded that nurses in the context under study should be empowered to terminate charts when they become unnecessary. In addition, the design of charts should be modified to accommodate different purposes. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Planning and {{scheduling}} are {{considered as one}} of the most difficult but most important processes from perspectives of project management. These processes involve implementation of a widerange of planning methods used by different organizations with various levels of planning knowledge. The planning methods for scheduling can be classified as traditional methods (e. g. line of <b>balance,</b> Gantt <b>chart</b> and critical path) and modern methods (e. g. last planner and critical chain). Over time these methods had advanced from paper based to computer based. However, some project planners still prefer using the traditional methods despite other new alternatives. Users of those methods have different perspectives about the efficiency and effectiveness of the different planning methods used to manage different projects. Evidences from the secondary data found from extensive literatures have been used to assess the planning {{and scheduling}} methods mentioned above. A taxonomy describing each of the method in terms of their theories, key features, application areas, benefits and limitations is presented. The preliminary outcome of this paper may provide a tool to aid organizations in selecting and prioritizing the most appropriate methods to be developed and implemented in planning and scheduling of their projects. It also initializes a theoretical base for more rapid taxonomy studies on the use of different planning and scheduling approaches. As an overall, the present paper reminds practitioners of common ground about its important insights on how such taxonomy studies have potential to make scope of those methods and tools clearer, especially when they compare among them within the same application contexts...|$|R
30|$|Primitive {{studies on}} process {{tolerancing}} were introduced through graphical representation of machining tolerance charting (Irani et al. 1989). The graphical approach and rooted tree diagram were adopted for tolerance charting (Whybrew et al. 1990). A tree theoretical representation for a tolerance chart was presented from the part blue print dimensions, stock removals and working dimensions (Ji 1993). The manufacturing process sequence {{was determined by}} using a profile representation method which incorporates a two-dimensional matrix containing a number coding system to represent the part profile (Ngoi and Ong 1993). A mathematical rooted tree model incorporating the linkage between the capability of manufacturing process and tolerance <b>chart</b> <b>balancing</b> was developed (Wei and Lee 1995). Geometrical control requirements were expressed as equivalent linear dimensions and then applied to a tolerance chart (Ngoi and Tan 1995). A backward derivation approach was traced for determining the machining tolerances starting from the last operation and computing machining allowances backwardly till the first machining operation (Ji 1996). A graphical method for presenting the process link and for obtaining the necessary working dimensions and tolerances was introduced (Ngoi and Tan 1997).|$|R
40|$|China is the world's second-largest energy {{producer}} and consumer, {{so that it}} is very necessary to analyze China's energy situation for saving energy consumption and reducing GHG emission. Energy flow chart is taken as a useful tool for sorting out and displaying energy statistics data. Energy statistics data is the premise and foundation for analyzing energy situation. However, there exit many differences between China and foreign energy balance. Based on the international criterion of energy balance and some advices given by related experts, the author properly adjusts China's energy balance. And {{the purpose of this paper}} is to draft China's energy flow chart for 2007, which is used to study the characteristics of energy production and consumption in China. We find that: (1) coal is the main energy in China, which accounted for 73. 2 % of total energy supply in 2007; (2) thermal power accounted for 83. 2 % of the total electricity supply, and 78. 43 % thermal power was based on coal; (3) in 2007, the secondary industrial sector consumed about 69. 93 % of energy; (4) China's energy utilization efficiency was about 33. 23 % in 2007.

40|$|The 'Food Web Explorer' is a {{computer}} program that was developed to construct and mass-balance compartmental food web flux charts. The program takes as input available information such as biomasses, production, and food preferences of the compartments, and gives as final output a food web flux <b>chart</b> simultaneously <b>balanced</b> for carbon and a nutrient. This computer model was used to study seasonal carbon flow patterns over a four year period in the euphotic zone of Lake Kinneret and Lake Constance. The flows were estimated using an extensive data base and the above computer model which found the mass <b>balanced</b> flux <b>charts</b> most consistent with the data. Cladocerans were the dominant grazers on phytoplankton, with ciliates, rotifers and copepods being of secondary importance. The microbial loop was also an important food source for cladocerans, especially during the spring period, when carbon that had been recycled through the POC/DOC pool often made up {{over half of the}} cladoceran diet. Our analysis of the Kinneret food web shows that invertebrate predators, may cause a damping of top down trophic cascade effects at the phytoplankton/zooplankton link. This may mean that the current efforts to improve water quality by reducing fish biomass (thereby controlling phytoplankton) may be ineffective. We have compared our results to a similar study by our German partners on Lake Constance. The spring bloom in Lake Kinneret consists of large inedible algae which fuels a highly active microbial loop. This sharply contrast with the highly edible fast growing spring algal bloom of Lake Constance. Microbial organisms are often {{an important component of the}} diet of metazoans in Lake Kinneret, while in Lake Constance, their significance is mainly confined to the recycling of nutrients.

40|$|A future policy {{instrument}} {{for assessing the}} consequences of changes (already made) to the physical environment {{can be found in}} the instrument known as the human environmental balance. By taking all relevant aspects into account when using this instrument, present and future serious defects along with necessary areas of focus will become clear. In this way, the balance will fulfil an important evaluative and indicative function, serving as an integral conceptual framework to find out what investments to make and where they should be made. This report describes a survey, representing an initial step on the road to a <b>balanced</b> physical environment, <b>charting</b> further work along the way. It is also meant to stimulate a broad debate on how to audit this physical environment and what to study. The concept of the physical environment is defined as consisting of (stocks of) various objects in a certain (spatial) arrangement. These objects are evaluated from three perspectives: ecological, economic and social/psychological. The first two perspectives focus on long-term issues on sustainability. In the third perspective the central theme is the perception of the environment by humans themselves; here, we are concerned about short-term issues on the sub-national (local) level. The 1970 - 1995 draft balance also saw its first elaboration in this report...|$|R
