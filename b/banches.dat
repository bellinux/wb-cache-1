[She {{sits down on the}} plinth of the column, sorting her flowers, on the lady's right. She is not at all an attractive person. She is perhaps eighteen, perhaps twenty, hardly older. She wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust and soot of London and has seldom if ever been brushed. Her hair needs washing rather badly: its mousy color can hardly be natural. She wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to her waist. She has a brown skirt with a coarse apron. Her boots are much the worse for wear. She is no doubt as clean as she can afford to be; but compared to the ladies she is very dirty. Her features are no worse than theirs; but their condition leaves something to be desired; and she needs the services of a dentist].|$|E
50|$|Enrique <b>Banchs</b> (1888 - 1968) was an Argentine poet. He {{published}} all {{his work}} in the space of four years {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, then lay dormant until his death. In his four works, Las barcas (1907), El libro de los elogios (1908), El cascabel del halcón (1909) and La urna (1911). <b>Banchs</b> cultivated an ephemeral, classicistic style drawing inspiration from the Siglo de Oro. His final work was composed in sonnets, a form which had already been almost completely abandoned by that time. <b>Banchs</b> published nothing during the final fifty years of his life, but he remained a part of the Argentine literary scene, and a member of the Argentine Academy of Letters. He was friend of Carlos Alberto Leumann.|$|R

40|$|ArticleIn {{this article}} we provide a set of {{sufficient}} conditions that allow {{a natural extension of}} Chernoff's well-know product formula to the case of certain one-parameter family of functions taking values in the algebra L(B) of all bounded linear operators defined on a complex <b>Banch</b> space B. Those functions nedd not be contraction-valued and are intimately related to certian evolution operators U(t,s) _ 0 ≤< s ≤< t ≤< T on B. the most direct consequences of our main result are new formulae of the Trotter-Kato type which involve either semigroups with time-dependent generators, or the resolvent operators associated with these generators. In the general case we can apply such formulae to evolution problems of parabolic type, as well as to Schrödinger evolution equations albeit in some very special cases. The formulae we prove may also be relevant to the numerical analysis of non-autonomous ordinary and partial differential equations...|$|R
30|$|An early {{earthquake}} prediction {{system based}} on WSNs is designed using {{information and communication technologies}} for disseminating earthquake information (Rahman et al. 2016). Unlike this work, our work uses WSANs to predict earthquakes and minimize damages caused by earthquakes. Further, most of the previous work on WSANs is simulations based which have some drawbacks and to overcome these limitations we have used formal methods. Formal model of WSNs with agent-based simulation model is proposed in (Niazi and Hussain 2011), however, this work lacks in describing mathematical model therefore, it is extended through Gaussian function to describe sensing of emergent behaviour in CAS (Chaudhry 2015). Complex network representations of visual-agent and its formal model are developed for cognitive evolution {{in the form of a}} temporal cognitive level networks (Hussain and Niazi 2014). Validation of this approach is done through historic data of citations.

40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) {{disease or}} {{hereditary}} motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN) is a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions {{that affect the}} peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by degeneration or abnormal development of peripheral nerves and exhibits a range of patterns of genetic transmission. In the majority of cases, CMT first appears in infancy, and its manifestations include clumsiness of gait, predominantly distal muscular atrophy of the limbs, and deformity of the feet {{in the form of}} foot drop. It can be classified according to the pattern of transmission (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked), according to electrophysiological findings (demyelinating or axonal), or according to the causative mutant gene. The classification of CMT is complex and undergoes constant revision as new genes and mutations are discovered. In this paper, we review the most efficient diagnostic algorithms for the molecular diagnosis of CMT, which are based on clinical and electrophysiological data.
