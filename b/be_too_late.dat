5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening their houses to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in their houses dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E
5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, eager to take command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to see any combat.|$|E

5|$|A reanalysis of the Book of Clanranald {{has shown}} that, instead of 1207, this source may {{actually}} date Ragnall's demise to 1227. However, this date may well <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for {{man who was}} an adult by 1164. Ragnall's grant to Paisley may leave clues to his fate. The similarity between this charter and another granted to the priory by his son, Domnall, may be evidence that the documents were drawn up {{at about the same}} time. If so, Ragnall's charter may be evidence that he survived his defeat at the hands of Áengus, and the two charters may indicate that Ragnall was nearing the end of his life. Ragnall's grant may also indicate that he entered into a confraternity with the monks at Paisley. If the charter was indeed granted {{near the end of his}} life, it is also possible that Ragnall ended his days there. Since the priory was one of the religious houses founded by the meic Somairle, his possible retirement there may partly explain why Ragnall disappears from record after 1192.|$|E
5|$|At Gibraltar, {{the only}} ship in harbour was the small sloop-of-war HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas, who on {{sighting}} the French squadron immediately sent word to Saumarez off Cadiz. The message arrived on 5 July, delivered by Lieutenant Richard Janvrin {{in a small}} boat. The admiral, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile, immediately gathered his ships and sailed eastwards to investigate. He had only six ships of the line as one, HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, was on detached duty {{at the mouth of the}} Guadalquivir River with the brig HMS Pasley. Saumarez sent messages in the frigate HMS Thames recalling Keats, who followed Saumarez towards Algeciras, and was in sight of the admiral's ship on the horizon at dawn on 6 July. However, after hearing an inaccurate report from an American merchant ship that Linois had already sailed from Algeciras, Keats reasoned that the French would have turned eastwards for Toulon and thus he would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to catch them. He therefore resolved to return to his station observing the Spanish at Cadiz, retaining Pasley and Thames.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians and limiting the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E

25|$|Climate {{change was}} {{referred}} to in several of Giddens’s books from the mid-1990s onwards, but was not discussed at length until {{the publication of his}} work The Politics of Climate Change in 2009. Climate change, Giddens says, constitutes a fundamental threat to the future of industrial civilisation as it spreads across the globe. Given that is the case, he asks, why are countries around the world doing so little to counter its advance? Many reasons are involved, but the prime one is the historical novelty of humanly induced climate change itself. No previous civilisation intervened into nature on a level remotely similar to that which we do on an everyday level today. We have no previous experience of dealing with such an issue and especially one of such global scope, or of the dangers it poses. Those dangers hence appear as abstract, and located at some indefinite point in the future. ‘Giddens’s paradox’ consists of the following theorem. We are likely put off responding adequately to climate change until major catastrophes unequivocally connected to it occur; but by then by definition it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late.</b> For {{we have no way of}} reversing the build-up of greenhouses gases that is driving the transformation of the world’s climate. Some such gases will be in the atmosphere for centuries.|$|E

In August 2006, Thompson requested a congressional subpoena for an early copy, threatening to file suit in Miami {{if he did not}} gain help from U.S. Rep. Cliff Stearns. Once the game is out, according to Thompson, [...] "the horse will be out of the barn and it will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to do anything about it".

500|$|The third main {{theory is}} that Quistclose trusts could be {{constructive}} trusts, which are created when the future trustee uses the money in an [...] "unconscionable" [...] manner. In Quistclose situations, the requirement of [...] "unconscionableness" [...] could be met by the borrower using the money for a purpose {{other than the one}} for which it was lent, allowing the lender to claim an equitable interest in it. In Carreras Rothmans Ltd v Freeman Mathews Treasure Ltd, the Quistclose trust principle was said by Peter Gibson J. to be that [...] "equity fastens on the conscience of the person who receives from another property transferred for a specific purpose only and not therefore for the recipient's [...] own purposes, so that such person will not be permitted to treat the property as his own or to use it for other than the stated purpose"; this reference to [...] "conscience" [...] could make Quistclose trusts constructive in nature. However, no constructive trust could be created until the money is misused, which may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for an effective remedy.|$|E

500|$|Critics of an {{expansionist policy}} {{consider}} the EU ETS to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> and to price carbon {{too low to}} adequately mitigate the climate change impact of aviation emissions. Instead they advocate addressing these impacts by constraining demand for air travel. The study Predict and Decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy, noting that a 10 per cent increase in fares generates a 5 to 15 per cent reduction in demand, recommends {{that the government should}} seek an alternative aviation policy based on managing demand rather than providing for it. This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes [...] "… against the expansion of UK airport capacity" [...] and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. In another study the levying of £9billion of taxes is calculated to constrain the forecast growth in demand by 2030 to 315million passengers, reducing the annual rate of growth to 2 per cent. The environmental message is echoed in the ninth report of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, published in July 2006, which labels the government strategy a predict and provide model and expresses scepticism about the timescale and efficiency of the EU ETS. It recommends instead that the government rethinks its airport expansion policy and considers ways, particularly via increased taxation, in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies, so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms.|$|E
500|$|St. Anger {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics; the album holds {{a score of}} 65 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, on review-aggregating website Metacritic. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters noted positive and negative aspects of the album, saying: [...] "While it's an ungodly mess at times, what you hear on this album is a band playing with passion {{for the first time}} in years." [...] Producer Bob Rock said that it was intended to sound like [...] "a band jamming together in a garage for the first time, and the band just happened to be Metallica." [...] Talking about the album, Greg Kot of Blender said, [...] "It may <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> to rehabilitate Metallica's image, but once again, their music is all about bringing the carnage." [...] Writing for NME, Ian Watson said that: ...the songs are a stripped back, heroically brutal reflection of this fury. You get the sense that, as with their emotional selves, they've taken metal apart and started again from scratch. There's no space wasted here, no time for petty guitar solos or downtuned bass trickery, just a focused, relentless attack. Johnny Loftus of AllMusic praised the album and described it as a [...] "punishing, unflinching document of internal struggle—taking listeners inside the bruised yet vital body of Metallica, but ultimately revealing the alternately torturous and defiant demons that wrestle inside Hetfield's brain. St. Anger is an immediate record." [...] Barry Walter of Rolling Stone magazine also had a positive reaction to the direction taken in [...] "St. Anger", stating: [...] "No wonder there's an authenticity to St. Anger's fury that none of the band's rap-metal followers can touch." [...] He also went further to note the lack of commercial influence and modern rock aspects of previous albums, continuing: [...] "There's no radio-size, four-minute rock here, no pop-friendly choruses, no ballads, no solos, no wayward experimentation." ...|$|E
