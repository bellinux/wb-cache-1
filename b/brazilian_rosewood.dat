2500|$|In 1993, carpenter-turned-luthier Stephen Cripe {{tried his}} hand at making an {{instrument}} for Garcia. After researching Tiger through pictures and films, Cripe set out on what would soon become known as Lightning Bolt, again named for its inlay. The guitar used <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> for the fingerboard and East Indian rosewood for the body, which, with admitted irony from Cripe, {{had been taken from}} a 19th-century bed used by opium smokers. Built purely from guesswork, Lightning Bolt was a hit with Garcia, who began using the guitar exclusively. Soon after, Garcia requested that Cripe build a backup of the guitar. Cripe, who had not measured or photographed the original, was told simply to [...] "wing it." ...|$|E

50|$|For years, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood</b> was the {{industry}} standard as the best wood for the backs and sides of guitars. Unfortunately, the export of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood</b> has been restricted due to the endangerment of the species. Much of the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood</b> used for guitars is of poor quality, and the inflated price of the wood has caused many luthiers to search for alternative tonewoods. There are many other good very dry woods for guitar construction. In fact, of the surviving Torres instruments, the most common back and side wood used was maple. Many guitars made today use East Indian Rosewood {{because it is a}} close substitute for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood,</b> is readily available in high-quality, and has desirable characteristics as tonewood. There are many other woods with the characteristics to make excellent guitars and are excellent alternatives: cocobolo, maple, bubinga (African Rosewood), African Blackwood, Camatillo Rosewood, Spanish Cypress (used exclusively for flamenco guitars), granadillo, ebony, satinwood, ziricote, among others, are excellent choices for backs and sides.|$|E

50|$|Dalbergia nigra {{produces}} {{a very hard}} and heavy wood, characteristically varied in color from brick red through various shades of brown (medium to nearly black). Pieces that feature veins of black coloration called spider webbing or landscape grain are especially prized. <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> has a distinctive floral fragrance—reminiscent of roses with a distinctive sweetness—and strongest in old growth wood. Another distinguishing feature is its outstanding resonance. An evenly cut piece that is tapped emits a bright metallic ring that sustains. This property, combined with its beauty, has made <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> a favorite of musical instrument makers for centuries.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, many musicians, {{including}} Clarence White and Eric Thompson preferred Martin guitars {{built before}} World War II to more recent guitars {{of the same}} model. The prewar guitars had a different internal bracing pattern consisting of scalloped braces (the later ones were tapered rather than scalloped), with the x-brace forward-shifted to about an inch of the soundhole, producing better resonance, and tops made from Adirondack red spruce rather than Sitka spruce. After 1969, the rosewood components, including the backs and sides of some models, were changed from <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> to Indian rosewood, due to restrictions {{on the sale of}} <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood.</b> The D-28s and D-35s (introduced in the mid-1960s {{to make use of the}} more narrow pieces of wood, by using a three-piece back design) are now very sought-after on the vintage guitar market, fetching sums in the neighborhood of $5,000-$6,000. The same models from the early 1970s, with Indian Rosewood backs and sides, generally sell for less than $2,500.|$|E

5000|$|Rosewoods {{are often}} used in the back and/or sides of guitars and mandolins and fretboards on guitars. The most sought-after variety, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood,</b> Dalbergia nigra, has become scarce and {{expensive}} due to severe trade restrictions (embargo and CITES), scarcity and demand. The most widely used rosewood used now is east Indian Rosewood, often paired with a spruce top for steel string guitars and with spruce or cedar for classical guitars.|$|E
5000|$|Charles and Ray Eames {{aimed to}} develop {{furniture}} that could be mass-produced and affordable, {{with the exception of}} the Eames Lounge Chair. This luxury item was inspired by the traditional English Club Chair. The Eames Lounge Chair is an icon of Modern style design, although when it was first made, Ray Eames remarked in a letter to Charles that the chair looked [...] "comfortable and un-designy". Charles's vision was for a chair with [...] "the warm, receptive look of a well-used first baseman's mitt." [...] The chair is composed of three curved plywood shells: the headrest, the backrest and the seat. In early production, beginning in 1956 and running through the very early 1990s, the shells were made up of five thin layers of plywood which were covered by a veneer of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood.</b> The use of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> was discontinued in the early 1990s, and current production since then consists of seven layers of plywood covered by finishing veneers of cherry, walnut, Palisander rosewood (a sustainably grown wood with similar grain patterns to the original Brazilian versions), and other finishes.|$|E

Particularly interested in 18th-century English furniture and in early Egyptian furniture, {{one of his most}} successful pieces was his delicately designed Egyptian Stool (1960) crafted from luxurious materials. Another successful item was his Colonial Chair in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood.</b> He was awarded the Grand Prix for furniture at Milan's triennale in 1960.|$|E
50|$|Old growth <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> remains {{highly prized}} by {{classical}} and steel string guitar makers, who {{regard it as}} perhaps the best sounding wood for guitar backs and sides. It was used in instruments {{as long ago as}} the late Renaissance and Baroque eras, when luthiers used it for lute backs (ribs) and various parts of other stringed musical instruments. It was also used in woodwind instruments, such as bassoons, flutes and recorders.|$|E
50|$|The late Robert Lundberg, a noted luthier who {{performed}} extensive research on historical lute-making methodology, states in his 2002 book Historical Lute Construction that yew was historically a prized wood for lute construction. European legislation establishing use limits and requirements for yew limited supplies available to luthiers, {{but it was}} apparently as prized among medieval, renaissance, and baroque lute builders as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> is among contemporary guitar-makers for its quality of sound and beauty.|$|E
5000|$|All genuine {{rosewood}}s {{belong to}} the genus Dalbergia. The preeminent rosewood appreciated in the Western world is the wood of Dalbergia nigra which is [...] a CITES-listed endangered species on Appendix 1, which means no commercial sales for wood that is cut after 1992. It {{is best known as}} <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Rosewood,</b> but also as Bahia rosewood. This wood has a strong sweet smell, which persists for many years, explaining the name rosewood.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies of}} most PRS guitars are crafted of mahogany, with a maple top on most models. They often feature highly figured tops, {{including}} flame maple, quilt maple and figured maple creating {{the effect of}} tiger stripes. A small number of bodies feature white Limba, referred to as Korina by luthiers. PRS necks are usually made from mahogany, although some models feature maple or Indian or <b>Brazilian</b> <b>rosewood</b> necks; fingerboards on production models are normally made of rosewood.|$|E
