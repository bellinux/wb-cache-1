5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|Paul Bernard Krichell (December 19, 1882 – June 4, 1957) was a Major League Baseball catcher, {{best known}} for being the head scout for the New York Yankees for 37 years until his death.

He co-founded, along with Dr. Harley Wilhelm, the Institute for Atomic Research and the Ames Laboratory of the Atomic Energy Commission, and directed the Ames Laboratory from its founding in 1947 until 1968.|$|E
5|$|Beyond these controversies, Jones {{significantly}} {{influenced the}} Air Force's development {{during and after}} the war. He was honoured for his work running the Empire Air Training Scheme in 1940–42 and has received credit as CAS for <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> RAAF's strength to 70squadrons by 1945. After the war he played a personal part in improving education within the service, including the establishment of RAAF College, along similar lines to Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Royal Australian Naval College, as well as the RAAF Staff College. One of his last directions as CAS was the formation of RAAF Museum at Point Cook, where it is still based.|$|E
5|$|In Italy, German Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, {{unaware of}} what was {{happening}} in Germany, had been <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> strength of his forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Straits of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.|$|E

5|$|In {{his first}} months in New Guinea, Whitehead {{concentrated}} on <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> infrastructure there. He obtained additional engineer units and construction equipment. New airfields were developed, along with roads, housing, taxiways and revetments {{to protect his}} aircraft from the frequent Japanese air raids. He also attempted {{to build up the}} morale and leadership of his units. These months coincided with the Kokoda Track campaign. For a time, despite the efforts of his airmen and the ground troops, the Japanese advanced steadily on Port Moresby, but they ultimately turned back short of it. For his part in the Papuan campaign, Whitehead was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. The Australian government made him an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, General Walter M. Robertson, {{commander}} of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division, was ordered to attack and seize the Roer River dams. In case he had to pull back, he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line. General Walter E. Lauer, commanding the 99th Infantry Division, was charged with <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> defenses around Elsenborn Ridge. Lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned; he gave instructions to his division's soldiers to dig in and build cover for their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda was proclaimed a town on 31 July 1893 {{with sales}} of the first allotments made on the same day. In 1886 it {{became part of the}} Munno Para West District Council area, moving to the {{district}} of Salisbury on 1 July 1933 along with most of the Munno Para West area. The islands were extensively modified after floods in 1948 and 1957 which cut off St Kilda from the rest of Adelaide. Salisbury council began <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> area, expanding seawalls and reclaiming additional land by dumping of earth spoil.|$|E

5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The {{escalation}} of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC-68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> U.S. both militarily and economically.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{was active}} again in 1868, 1877, 1884, 1885, 1894, and 1918, before its next major {{eruption}} in 1918–1919. Halemaumau, then a small upwelling in the caldera floor, was {{topped by a}} lava lake that then drained, before refilling again, forming an enormous lava lake and nearly reaching {{the top edge of}} the caldera before draining once more. This activity eventually gave way to the construction of Mauna Iki, <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> large lava shield within the caldera over a period of eight months. The eruption also featured concurrent rift activity and a large amount of lava fountaining.|$|E

5|$|By 1950, 45% of the {{necessary}} repairs {{had been made to}} Altes Stadthaus by a few simple expedients such as emergency roofing. In the immediate post-war years, neither manpower, supplies, nor financing was available to undertake repairs on a larger scale. The reconstruction took place between 1950 and 1955 in five phases; the first focused on <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> courtyard wing on the Stralauer Straße side while the second phase, completed in early 1952, focused on the Stralauer Straße/Judenstraße wing and included construction of additional offices on the fourth floor and a 300-person dining hall with kitchen. However, {{for a number of reasons}} most significant of which was that the building was not the seat of government, the remaining three phases were not carried out. In addition, the reconstruction of Wilhelmine architecture was not a high priority, where as housing was and so funding for the restoration work was not included in the economic plan.|$|E
5|$|Genghis Khan was {{declared}} Khaghan in 1206. The Mongols had united under his leadership, and defeated the rival tribes of the steppes. In the same period, China {{was divided into}} three separate states. In the north, the Jurchen Jin dynasty controlled Manchuria and all of China north of the Huai River. The Tangut Western Xia ruled parts of the western China, while the Song Dynasty reigned over the south. The Mongols subjugated Western Xia in 1210. In that same year, the Mongols renounced their vassalage to the Jin. Hostilities between the Jin and Mongols had been <b>building</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> Mongols coveted the prosperity of Jurchen territory. They may have also harbored a grudge against the Jin for assassinating Ambaghai, one of Genghis' predecessors, and for the Jin emperor Wanyan Yongji's rude behavior to Genghis when Wanyan Yongji was still a Jurchen prince.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} Test, Jardine scored 35 and 65 not out. His first innings began with England in an {{uncertain}} position, having lost three wickets for 108 {{on a very}} good batting wicket. His innings led England to a stronger position. He played very cautiously, being troubled by Clarrie Grimmett and Bert Ironmonger, the Australian spinners. Jardine believed that Ironmonger threw the ball, and this bowler gave him considerable trouble throughout his career. Thanks to the bowling of Harold Larwood, England took a huge first innings lead. In his second innings, although he played well in his 65, Jardine was not under much pressure. He scored {{a large number of}} singles, giving his partners most of the bowling and <b>building</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lead to the point where England achieved a massive victory by 675 runs. This victory surprised and troubled the Australian cricketing public. Jardine played a similar role in the second Test, batting with Wally Hammond to retrieve a poor start for England in his only innings as they won by eight wickets. Jardine scored 62 in the third Test, supporting Hammond who made a double century. However, when Australia batted a second time, they built up a big lead and left England needing 332 to win on an exceptionally bad wicket which had been damaged by rain. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe, in one of their most famous partnerships, put on 105. Hobbs sent a message to the team that Jardine should be the next batsmen to come in, even though he usually batted later on, as he was the batsman most likely to survive in the conditions. When Hobbs was dismissed, Jardine came in to bat. He survived, although finding batting exceptionally difficult, until the day's play ended. Percy Fender believed that Jardine was the only batsman in the side who could have coped with the difficult conditions. He went on to make 33 next day, and England won by three wickets.|$|E
