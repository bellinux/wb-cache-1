5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film's small budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines, with a less-realistic design inspired <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film's distributor until {{near the end of}} production, and while the company had many roles recast, it otherwise made few changes to the film.|$|E
5|$|The two {{non-standard}} proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are selenocysteine (present in many non-eukaryotes {{as well as}} most eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA) and pyrrolysine (found only in some archaea and one bacterium). The incorporation of these non-standard amino acids is rare. For example, 25 human proteins include selenocysteine (Sec) in their primary structure, and the structurally characterized enzymes (selenoenzymes) employ Sec as the catalytic moiety in their active sites. Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons. For example, selenocysteine is encoded <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> codon and SECIS element.|$|E

Electric stop actions can be controlled at the console <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights. Some may include electromagnets for setting or resetting when combinations are selected.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, Falle {{appeared}} at the Party for Freedom at York University in Toronto, which launched the Alliance Against Modern Slavery, a nonprofit organization seeking to combat human trafficking through partnerships, education, and research. Falle was joined by Glendene Grant, human trafficking victim Jessie Foster's mother; Kevin Bales, co-founder and president of Free the Slaves; Kate Todd, a singer-songwriter and actor; Janelle Belgrave of Samba Elégua Drummers and Peace Concept; Roger Cram of Hiram College; and Jeff Gunn, a guitarist. That September, Falle attended Toronto's second annual Freedom Walk, which was hosted <b>by</b> <b>Stop</b> Child Trafficking Now, Freedom Relay Canada, and Oakville's Free-Them. At this event aimed at raising awareness about human trafficking nationally and internationally, Falle was joined by other abolitionists including Tara Teng, who was Miss Canada at the time; Trisha Baptie, co-founder of EVE; Shae Invidiata, founder of Free-Them; Timea Nagy; Constable Lepa Jankovic; MP Joy Smith; MP Olivia Chow; and MP Terence Young.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 2010, Wilders, who {{had become}} a regular guest with American conservatives and libertarians, {{announced}} that he would speak at a rally on 11 September in New York to protest the plans for Park51, a Muslim community center with a prayer space to be built near the World Trade Center site. The rally, to be held on the ten-year anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks, was organised <b>by</b> <b>Stop</b> Islamization of America, which was supported by former House speaker Newt Gingrich, who was originally announced as a speaker at the event, but never confirmed his appearance and cancelled a video appearance. According to SIOA's website world leaders, prominent politicians and 9/11 family members would be speaking at the rally, but Wilders was not mentioned by name, though he did attend as he had announced.|$|E

25|$|Laws and {{regulations}} regarding how drivers {{must comply with}} a stop sign vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> signs, generally the driver who arrives and stops first continues first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> signs, generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.|$|E
25|$|Traffic circles are {{typically}} larger, operate at higher speeds and often {{give priority to}} entering traffic. They may control entering traffic <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> signs or traffic lights.

25|$|In {{response}} to the UK Governments's 2003 White Paper The Future of Air Transport, the airport published a Master Plan for expansion over the period 2006–2030. In October 2007, the airport {{announced that it would}} delay the planning application until the middle of 2008 to give it time to complete research on the airport's effect on the environment. The World Development Movement claimed that flights from the airport generated the same amount of carbon dioxide as the nation of Malawi. A campaign against the plan was led <b>by</b> <b>Stop</b> Bristol Airport Expansion, supported by Bristol Friends of the Earth and the Campaign to Protect Rural England.|$|E

25|$|Fungal prions are {{considered}} {{by some to be}} epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. PSI+ and URE3, discovered in yeast in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion. Prions can have a phenotypic effect through the sequestration of protein in aggregates, thereby reducing that protein's activity. In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop codons, an effect that results in suppression of nonsense mutations in other genes. The ability of Sup35 to form prions may be a conserved trait. It could confer an adaptive advantage by giving cells the ability to switch into a PSI+ state and express dormant genetic features normally terminated <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> codon mutations.|$|E
25|$|Stop {{signs are}} used globally. However, most {{countries}} see fewer {{of them than}} North America and South Africa, because all-way stops are never used and may even be legally prohibited. In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> signs on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Australia, stop signs are restricted to situations wherein coming to a dead stop is actually necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At {{the vast majority of}} minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent road markings are used. Finally, at the busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by (mini) roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.|$|E
500|$|Twenty of the proteinogenic {{amino acids}} are encoded {{directly}} by triplet codons in {{the genetic code}} and are known as [...] "standard" [...] amino acids. The other two ("non-standard" [...] or [...] "non-canonical") are selenocysteine (present in many prokaryotes {{as well as most}} eukaryotes, but not coded directly by DNA), and pyrrolysine (found only in some archea and one bacterium). Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons; for example, selenocysteine is encoded <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> codon and SECIS element. N-formylmethionine (which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts) is generally considered as a form of methionine rather than as a separate proteinogenic amino acid. Codon–tRNA combinations not found in nature {{can also be used to}} [...] "expand" [...] the genetic code and form novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non-proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the most}} basic sense, {{headlight}} flashing {{is a way of}} attracting attention, for any of a number of purposes. [...] In this way, it can be perceived as the visual equivalent of blowing the horn, again for any of a number of reasons. [...] This equivalency is underscored by some car owner's manuals, which identify the steering column control lever which allows headlight flashing as the [...] "optical horn". Headlight flashing can be used simply to let other drivers know of one's presence, or as a response to acknowledge the presence or actions of other drivers. Some drivers flash their headlights as a signal that they are yielding the right of way to another driver, for example at an intersection controlled <b>by</b> <b>stop</b> signs.|$|E

He said that he does not condone the actions of either organisation: [...] "Does it mean I agree with Hamas and what it does? No. Does it mean I agree with Hezbollah and what they do?
