40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable model of a particle interacting with a harmonic oscillator bath. Our goal is to understand the effects of non-Markovian processes on the relaxational dynamics and to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with approximate Markovian and Non-Markovian quantum kinetics. There are two different cases that are studied in detail: i) a quasiparticle (resonance) when the renormalized frequency of the particle is above the frequency threshold of the bath and ii) a stable renormalized `particle' state below this threshold. The time evolution of the occupation number for the particle is evaluated exactly using different approaches that yield to complementary insights. The exact solution allows us to investigate {{the concept of the}} formation time of a quasiparticle and to study the difference between the relaxation of the distribution of bare particles and that of quasiparticles. We derive a non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation (energy conserving) are obtained from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different coarse-graining assumptions. The relaxational dynamics predicted by the non-Markovian, Markovian and <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximations</b> are compared to the exact result.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of relaxation and thermalization in an exactly solvable model {{with the goal of}} understanding the effects of off-shell processes. The focus is to compare the exact evolution of the distribution function with different approximations to the relaxational dynamics: Boltzmann, non-Markovian and Markovian quantum kinetics. The time evolution of the distribution function is evaluated exactly using two methods: time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix and by solving the Heisenberg equations of motion. There are two different cases that are studied in detail: i) no stable particle states below threshold of the bath and a quasiparticle resonance above it and ii) a stable discrete exact `particle' state below threshold. For the case of quasiparticles in the continuum (resonances) the exact quasiparticle distribution asymptotically tends to a statistical equilibrium distribution that differs from a simple Bose-Einstein form as a result of off-shell processes. In the case ii), the distribution of particles does not thermalize with the bath. We study the kinetics of thermalization and relaxation by deriving a non-Markovian quantum kinetic equation which resums the perturbative series and includes off-shell effects. A Markovian approximation that includes off-shell contributions and the usual Boltzmann equation are obtained from the quantum kinetic equation in the limit of wide separation of time scales upon different coarse-graining assumptions.

40|$|The Hall {{coefficient}} (R_H) of high-Tc cuprates in {{the normal}} state shows the striking non-Fermi liquid behavior: R_H follows a Curie-Weiss type temperature dependence, and |R_H|>> 1 /|ne| at low temperatures in the under-doped compounds. Moreover, R_H is positive for hole-doped compounds and is negative for electron-doped ones, although each of them has a similar hole-like Fermi surface.

We consider seriously the vertex corrections for the current which are indispensable to satisfy the conservation laws, which are violated within the conventional <b>Boltzmann</b> transport <b>approximation.</b> The obtained total current J_k takes an enhanced value and is no more perpendicular to the Fermi surface due to the strong AF fluctuations. By virtue of this mechanism, the anomalous behavior of R_H in high-Tc cuprates is neutrally explained.

40|$|Electronic {{devices are}} vital for our modern life. Semiconductor devices {{are at the}} core of them. Semiconductor devices are governed by the {{transport}} and behavior of electrons and holes which in turn are controlled by Fermi-Level or the Quasi-Fermi Level. The most frequently used approximation for the population of electrons and holes based on the <b>Boltzmann</b> <b>approximation</b> of Fermi-Dirac distribution. However when the Fermi-level is closer to the majority carrier band edge, by less than 3 kT, it causes significant errors in the number of the carriers. This in turn causes errors in currents and other quantities of interest. In heavily doped semiconductors, it is desirable to use Fermi-Dirac Integral itself. However this is a tabulated function and therefore approximations are developed. Most of the approximation are mathematically cumbersome and complicated and they are not easily differentiable and integrable. Although several approximations have been developed, some with very high precision, these are not simple nor are they sufficiently useful in semiconductor device applications. In this thesis after exploring and critiquing these approximations, a new set of approximations is developed for the Fermi-Dirac integrals of the order 1 / 2. This analytical expression can be differentiated and integrated, still maintaining high accuracy. These new approximation {{is in the form of}} an exponential series with few terms using Prony’s method. Application of this approximation for semiconductor device calculations are discussed.

We then demonstrate that the SO(3) _q symmetry in de Sitter space further constrains the anisotropy tensor to be of spheroidal form.

After one phonon is identified, a scan is initiated to test all phonon combinations that will satisfy the conservation equations.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of electrons, protons, and other charged particles {{can be an}} expensive computation. On the one hand, the small mean free path of a charged particle makes direct simulations very costly. On the other hand, the cross sections are very singular making a deterministic calculation difficult to impossible. Nevertheless, the accurate computation of high energy charged particle densities is an important task for many engineering calculations. In this thesis, {{a variety of methods}} for computing these densities and distributions are assessed. Among these methods are the well-known Fokker-Planck and Fermi approximations. These methods are known to be particularly bad for electrons. It is shown in this thesis that they are in fact very poor for all charged particle transport. Specifically, it will be seen that the Fokker-Planck method and the Fermi approximation that can be derived from it allow for higher order spatial and angular modes to creep into the solutions for shallow and deep penetrations alike. On the other hand, the true physics only requires a few modes at deeper penetrations. Also, for shallow penetrations, most of the modes of the actual solution to the transport equation are incorrectly approximated by the Fokker-Planck approximation. It has been realized in recent years that the Fokker-Planck approximation is simply a leading order term in an asymptotic approximation. This realization with some clever manipulation of mathematical operators allows one to obtain higher order approximations to the scattering operator. The Fokker-Planck operator is then simply a specific case of this general framework. This general framework is explained in great detail. The inability of these higher order approximations to capture the true physics in some situations is assessed. Finally, hybrid methods will be introduced with parallels made to the well known <b>Boltzmann</b> Fokker-Planck <b>approximation.</b> It is seen that the higher order approximations used in place of the Fokker-Planck approximation can make the method more robust, more accurate, and more efficient. Also, parallels between the hybrid methodology and naturally occuring physics that is associated with very heavy ions incident on light targets will be seen. A general framework for approximating the solutions to these types of equations by using a lab frame analysis of the relevant physics will be introduced.

40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{theory for}} the viscoelastic behaviour of suspensions of rigid rods with excluded volume interactions is presented, which is valid in the asymptotic limit of {{very long and}} thin rods. Stresses arising from translational and rotational Brownian motion and direct interactions are calculated for concentrations up to (L/D) (with L the length; D, {{the thickness of the}} rods; and their volume fraction). It is argued that for very long and thin rods, contributions to the stress arising from hydrodynamic interactions vanish asymptotically with increasing aspect ratio relative to the single particle contribution. As will be discussed, this is supported by calculations of Shaqfeh and Fredrickson (Phys. Fluids A 2 (1990) 7), although convergence to negligible hydrodynamics interactions with increasing aspect ratio is very slow (for aspect ratios larger than ≈ 50, the contribution of hydrodynamic interactions to the stress is at most ≈ 20 %). It is argued that the pair-correlation function is in good approximation given by the Boltzmann exponential of the pair-interaction potential. The neglect of hydrodynamic interactions {{and the use of the}} <b>Boltzmann</b> exponential <b>approximation</b> for the pair-correlation function allows the microscopic evaluation of stresses in terms of concentration and the orientation order parameter tensor to within a Ginzburg–Landau expansion up to third order, without having to resort to thermodynamic arguments. The orientational order parameter tensor in turn is obtained from an equation of motion that is derived from the N-particle Smoluchowski equation. The resulting expression for the stress tensor and the equation of motion are similar to, but also in some respects significantly differing from, the well known theory due to Doi, Edward and Kuzuu. Analytic expressions are derived for linear and leading order non-linear, viscoelastic response functions. It is found that the zero shear viscosity varies linearly in concentration. The Huggins coefficient vanishes like the square of the shear-rate. Such a linear concentration dependence of the zero shear viscosity for very long and thin rods is also found in simulations by Claeys and Brady (J. Fluid Mech. 251 (1993) 443) and Yamane et al. (J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 54 (1994) 405) for the long rods, but is in contradiction with the Berry–Russel theory (J. Fluid Mech. 180 (1987) 475), where interactions are treated in an approximate, orientationally pre-averaged fashion. In addition, we find a Maxwellian frequency dependence of response functions at zero shear-rate. Highly non-linear viscoelastic response functions at higher shear-rates are computed numerically. Among other things, we find normal stress differences that do not change sign as a function of shear-rate and higher order harmonic response functions that are qualitatively different for the paranematic and nematic states...|$|R
