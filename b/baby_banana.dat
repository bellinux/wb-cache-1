40|$|To {{determine}} {{the change in}} the ripening stage and quality through associated variables such as firmness and peel color is a useful tool for predicting the behavior and involvement of the product stored at different changing conditions. The change in O 2 and CO 2 concentration, pulp firmness and peel color were measured in a test of modified atmosphere packaging for <b>baby</b> <b>banana</b> to develop a mathematical model to represent the change in firmness and color as a function of temperature, mixture of gas and time. The fruits were packaged at three temperatures (11, 13 and 17 °C) and a range of combinations of steady state concentrations of modified atmospheres (5. 3 to 15. 7 kPa O 2 and 0 to 11. 0 kPa for CO 2), local atmospheric pressure of 74. 9 kPa (0. 74 atm) and 80 % relative humidity constant in polyethylene bags (HDPE) micro-perforated for a period of 30 days. The model considers the product respiration rate by an Michaelis-Menten equation of noncompetitive inhibition, and takes into account the transfer of gases through packaging film and through micro-perforations of this; the change of firmness is considered through a first-order model, and depending on the concentration of both O 2 and CO 2 by Michaelis-Menten equations; color change (in Hunter Lab coordinates) was considered separately for each color coordinate, representing the coordinate L* using an increase-logistic model, a* by a zero-order model and b* by first-order model, all temperaturedependent by Arrhenius functions. The predictive capability of the developed model is appropriate, explaining 97. 0 % of the modified atmosphere effect on the loss of firmness, 90. 6 % of {{the change in the}} coordinate L*, 88. 9 % of the change in a* and 96. 7 % of the change in b*...|$|E

5|$|More subtle Jewish {{references}} are {{also included in}} {{other aspects of the}} Rugrats franchise. In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared to pour <b>banana</b> <b>baby</b> food on his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely harm the young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a primal covenant in Jewish studies.|$|R

But as Tommy tries {{to take care of}} him, Dil selfishly drinks all of the milk and keeps the large blanket for himself, which leads to the blanket tearing in half and Tommy falling into a puddle of mud. Tommy finally snaps and very nearly pours <b>banana</b> <b>baby</b> food on Dil for the monkeys to take him away, but Tommy's rage and the storm's lightning and thunder scare Dil so much that he sees the error of his ways. They reconcile and sleep peacefully.|$|R
40|$|Background: East Java is a {{province}} with good economical growth and adequate health facilitation, thus it’s to be lamented {{that we still}} find many health problems, especially toddlers’ malnutrition. Methods: This study observed social construction and mothers’ action on toddlers’ malnutrition problems. It was an observasional study with qualitative approach.  The study was performed in 2012 in Sampang and Bojonegoro. Result: The exclusive breastfeeding had not been applied yet, and there was too early in giving solid food to <b>babies</b> (honey, coconut, <b>banana).</b> Mothers realized that their children have undernutrition status {{at the time of}} health examination. Mother who put the social status of their family above anything else, having children with malnutrition {{is considered to be a}} shameful problem, so she will look for the health services to solve the problem. Many mothers felt confident about the growth of their children based on their past experiences and did not consider that malnutrition on child was a problem, and they would keep away from health services. Conclusion: A family, especially the mother, has built up social contruction about her undernutrition child. The social costruction will influence the response of family (mother) to the child. Recommendation:It is important to give health education with considering social construction to make positive behavior changes...|$|R
5000|$|The Spacemonkeyz {{appear to}} be first {{referenced}} before the album in the [...] "Tomorrow Comes Today" [...] video. During the video, in the background, a poster can be seen with three pictures of monkeys with spacesuits and the caption [...] "Laugh now but one day we'll be in charge". The artwork is a famous piece of artwork by Banksy, the visual artist who worked with Damon Albarn for Think Tank's artwork and Demon Days producer Danger Mouse in an attack against Paris Hilton. While the band were on hiatus in Beverly Hills, after touring for their debut album, they took a break from writing a script for their unfinished movie to appear at the Isle of MTV concert off the coast. After the show, Murdoc was asked to sign a record he didn't recognize, {{which turned out to}} be the Spacemonkeyz album. It appears that 2D never locked Kong Studios up properly before leaving on tour, and the three chimps entered and hijacked the master tapes in an attempt to contact Laika herself, who is supposedly their leader. After discovering the record, Gorillaz shot one or two photos with the monkeys and then they disappeared. Murdoc is still angry at them for doing the album, despite the extra income he gets from it. He maintains that Dr. Wurzel, his archenemy, is behind the incident and complains about getting monkey feces out of the carpets at Kong.Before the release of the album, the mix of Tomorrow Comes Today (<b>Bañana</b> <b>Baby)</b> was released in the single of Tomorrow Comes Today in February 2002.|$|R
