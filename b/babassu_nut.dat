30|$|This {{explains}} the lower value {{found for the}} temperature of maximum mass loss for <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> biomass, compared to the Eucalyptus wood {{found in the literature}} (Poletto et al. 2012; Protásio et al. 2013 c), since the mesocarp presents a relevant participation in <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> (Figures  2 and 3).|$|E
30|$|The <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell showed high {{basic density}} and {{suitable}} lignin {{content for the}} sustainable production of bioenergy and charcoal technically capable of replacing coke in Brazilian steel plants. This can contribute decisively in the economic development of extractive communities, who survive from the <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> collection, by marketing a product with higher added value.|$|E
30|$|<b>Babassu</b> <b>nut</b> {{residues}} {{presented a}} significant energy potential mainly {{due to their}} high energy density, compared to various biomasses commonly used for power generation in Brazil.|$|E
30|$|The <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residue (or shell) {{consists}} {{of all three}} constituent layers of the fruit (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp). These layers correspond to approximately 93 % of the total fruit (Dias et al. 2012; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária 1984; Emmerich and Luengo 1996). Therefore, for each ton of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut,</b> there are 930  kg of residues. However, despite this large supply of lignocellulosic residue, most of this biomass is inappropriately discarded (Dias et al. 2012), which may bring negative impacts to the environment.|$|E
30|$|Babassu is {{considered}} the largest native oil resource worldwide and occurs naturally in Brazil. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the potential of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp) for bioenergy use, especially for direct combustion and charcoal production. The material was collected in the rural area of the municipality of Sítio Novo do Tocantins, in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. Analyses were performed considering jointly the three layers that make up the <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell. The following chemical characterizations were performed: molecular (lignin, total extractives and holocellulose), elemental (C, H, N, S and O), immediate (fixed carbon, volatiles and ash), energy (higher heating value and lower heating value), physical (basic density and energy density) and thermal (thermogravimetry and differential thermal analysis), besides the morphological characterization by scanning electron microscopy. <b>Babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues showed a high bioenergy potential, mainly due to their high energy density. The use of this biomass as a bioenergy source can be highly feasible, given their chemical and thermal characteristics, combined with a low ash content. <b>Babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell showed a high basic density and a suitable lignin content for the sustainable production of bioenergy and charcoal, capable of replacing coke in Brazilian steel plants.|$|E
30|$|Additionally, {{images of}} <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> {{fragments}} were obtained in natural scale, through {{a digital camera}} in order to demonstrate the typical morphological characteristics of the residual biomass analyzed.|$|E
30|$|The energy densities were {{obtained}} by multiplying the HHV and LHV by the average basic density of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell, as performed by (Protásio et al. 2013 a) for other lignocellulosic materials.|$|E
30|$|For {{the wood}} of Eucalyptus clones, at ages 34, 42, 68 and 90  months, some authors {{reported}} the following average levels of total extractives: 3.10 %, 4.16 %, 3.28 %, 4.33 %, respectively (Neves et al. 2011; Santana et al. 2012; Protásio et al. 2013 b; Pereira et al. 2012), which were lower than that observed for the <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> biomass. Therefore, in order to burn this residue in boilers, gasifiers or other energy conversion mechanisms, the presence of extractives in <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> can facilitate the ignition of biomass, due to the decrease in its activation energy.|$|E
40|$|Brazil is {{the only}} country in the world that uses large scale {{charcoal}} in steel-making blast furnaces. Meantime, the monoculture plantations of Eucalyptus are not able to meet the demand for charcoal from the steel industries. Therefore, research is necessary, in order to use lignocellulosic residues for the production of charcoal with technological properties which are suitable for the reduction of iron ore. Given the above, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the quality of charcoal which was made with <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell and designed for utilization in the steel industry in the function of the final carbonization temperature. All three layers of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp) were used together. The initial temperature of the test was 100 ºC and the final temperatures were: 450 ºC, 550 ºC, 650 ºC, 750 ºC and 850 ºC. For the charcoals produced, the following properties were determined: apparent relative density, energy density and fixed carbon stock, in addition to chemical compositions (immediate and elemental) and heating values (higher and lower). Charcoal made of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell showed high values of apparent density and energy density, and has a potential to replace coal and wood charcoal in the steel industry. The effect of the final carbonization temperature was expressed for all characteristics evaluated, except for the nitrogen content. <b>Babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell must be carbonized at temperatures higher than 550 ºC, so that the charcoal produced can be used in steel-making blast furnaces...|$|E
30|$|However, {{the superiority}} of the basic density in <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell is a great advantage, because it maximizes energy densities (HHV or LHV basis), i.e. the {{analyzed}} biomass has more energy stored per unit volume compared to the sugar cane bagasse, to the residues from the processing of coffee beans and to the wood of Eucalyptus spp. clones (Protásio et al. 2013 a; Protásio et al. 2012 a). Therefore, a greater efficiency and economic viability in the transport of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> are expected, if that biomass needs to be used outside the producing regions to generate heat or electricity, as well as for charcoal production.|$|E
30|$|In addition, the starch {{present in}} the mesocarp, {{approximately}} 70 % (Nogueira and Lora 2003), may also {{have contributed to the}} degradation of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> biomass at lower temperatures. Teixeira 2008 found a high content of volatile material in the mesocarp of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> (~ 95 %) and stated that this component of the fruit provides a very quick burning with a low carbonization yield, {{at the expense of the}} endocarp, which presented lower emissions of volatile materials (83.40 %) and a higher fixed carbon content (15.16 %), being more suitable for burning and carbonization, in relation to the other constituents of the fruit.|$|E
30|$|Given the above, the {{objective}} {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential for bioenergy use of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp), especially considering direct combustion and charcoal production, through the analysis of their chemical, physical, energy and thermal characteristics.|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the most}} used range of wood {{carbonization}} in Brazil (400 - 500 °C) the total cumulative mass loss {{observed in the}} thermogravimetric essay for <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell was approximately 77 %. As for Eucalyptus clones, Santos et al. (2012) observed a total mass loss of 85 % at this temperature range, that is, 10.4 % higher than {{the result of this}} study. Similarly, Protásio et al. 2013 c observed a total mass loss of 82 % up to 500 °C for Eucalyptus sawdust. This highlights the carbonization potential of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell, considering the quality and yield of charcoal which, combined with the high density of this biomass, will surely provide a charcoal that meets the specifications of blast furnaces in steel plants.|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> oil on ischemia/ reperfusion-induced {{leukocyte}} adhesion and macromolecular leakage in the microcirculation: 1, and interleukin 6 were found. Conclusions: Our {{findings suggest}} that unrefined babassu oil reduced microvascular leakage and protected against Barbosa et al. Lipids in Health and Disease 2012, 11 : 15...|$|E
30|$|García et al. 2012 {{reported}} that SO 2 emissions are negligible in biomass fuels. In the analyzed residues, only traces of this element were detected, {{which is a}} great advantage for the energy use of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues, especially for charcoal production, since sulfur is a contaminant of pig iron and affects its mechanical properties.|$|E
30|$|The high {{content of}} K 2 O found for <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell, {{compared}} to other mineral oxides, {{may be due to}} the importance of potassium for biomass production and maintenance of osmotic balance in plants. This element also provides the plant with resistance to adverse conditions, such as low water availability and high temperatures.|$|E
30|$|It is {{possible}} to observe the similarity of the higher heating value (HHV) and the lower heating value (LHV) in the <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> shell with other biomasses used in Brazil as bioenergy sources. It is possibly due to similarities in the chemical composition, especially in the contents of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen of these fuels, as discussed earlier.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{elemental}} {{chemical composition}} of the analyzed biomass (Figure  4), the ratios N/C (0.03), H/C (0.12) and O/C (0.93) were determined, {{as well as the}} empirical formula of the analyzed <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues: CH 1.48 O 0.70 [*]N 0.02. The smaller the ratios O/C and N/C, the better the thermal properties of the fuels.|$|E
30|$|The {{nitrogen}} content of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> biomass {{was higher than}} that {{reported in the literature}} for sugar cane bagasse (N: 0.50 %) (Paula et al. 2011; Protásio et al. 2013 a) and wood of Eucalyptus clones (N: 0.07 to 0.25 %) (Protásio et al. 2013 a,[b]; Neves et al. 2011, 2013; Reis et al. 2012; Santana et al. 2012).|$|E
30|$|For the {{determination}} of the basic density of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues, 31 fragments were randomly taken from the batch collected. The method of immersion in water was used, according to the guidelines of NBR 11941 (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas - ABNT 2003). The dry mass of each fragment ranged from 10 to 40 grams, and the average was 24 grams.|$|E
30|$|Differences {{among the}} {{percentages}} of nitrogen {{reported in the literature}} and <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues may be explained by the different soil conditions, water stress, metabolism and physiology of each species. The N uptake in the soil is predominantly performed in the form of nitrate, so the local edaphoclimatic conditions are prevalent in the percentage of this element in plant biomass.|$|E
30|$|However, other {{lignocellulosic}} residues {{used for}} energy generation in Brazil, {{such as the}} residues from the processing of coffee beans and corn harvest present contents of N[*]+[*]S equal to 2.3 % (Protásio et al. 2012 a,[b]; Protásio et al. 2013 a) and 2.2 % (Protásio et al. 2013 a), respectively, which are higher than those found for <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> biomass in approximately 72 %.|$|E
30|$|A {{representative}} {{fragment of}} the analyzed biomass, {{from which a}} 1.5  cm × 1.5  cm × 1.0  cm (2.25  cm 3 volume) sample was removed, was used to observe the various layers of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> (epicarp, mesocarp and endocarp). In order to avoid charging effects in the microscope chamber, the sample was subjected to metallization by sputtering with the deposition of a gold film on its surface.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that coal, widely used in thermal power plants {{throughout}} the world, presents nitrogen and sulfur contents of up to 2.12 % and 6.29 %, respectively (Ward et al. 2008), which are much higher than the ones presented by <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues, and this fact reinforces the advantage of use of this biomass as an energy source. Demirbas 2001 a reported that biomass combustion produces 90 % less sulfur than coal.|$|E
30|$|<b>Babassu</b> <b>nut</b> {{fragments}} {{are formed}} by three distinct layers: a) the outer one, which is fibrous and thin (epicarp); b) the intermediate one, which is fibrous, {{with a high}} starch concentration (mesocarp) and c) the internal one, which is woody and very resistant (endocarp), in which kernels are inserted (Dias et al. 2012; Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária 1984; Teixeira 2008; Nogueira and Lora 2003; Emmerich and Luengo 1996; Teixeira and Carvalho 2007; Teixeira 2005).|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of extractives (components of low molecular weight) in <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues (Figure  4) in higher amounts than in Eucalyptus wood can promote biomass flammability at lower temperatures, {{due to their}} higher volatility and, then, speed up the thermal degradation process, {{as well as the}} {{presence of}} a lower crystalline cellulose content (Grønli et al. 2002; Guo et al. 2010; Poletto et al. 2012; Protásio et al. 2013 c; Shebani et al. 2008).|$|E
30|$|Concerning {{the current}} {{availability}} of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues in Brazil, Dias et al. (2012) estimated, {{based on a}} kernel production of 106, 055 tons (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística – IBGE 2010), a total of 1, 409, 016 tons. On the other hand, (Teixeira 2008) estimated a Brazilian potential of 6.8 million tons of fruits/year; Maranhão is the state with the highest potential (92 %), since improvements {{on the process of}} silvicultural operation are made.|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{the slower}} burning of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> {{residues}} can be advantageous for cooking food, since burning appliances (stoves) {{widely used in}} the North and Northeast of Brazil by rural communities have a low efficiency {{in the use of}} the heat produced by the oxidation of biomass, due to the lack of technology for refining and improving the performance of the stoves. It is known that about 11.0 % of the biomass produced in Brazil is intended for residential consumption (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética – EPE 2012).|$|E
30|$|The basic {{difference}} between the types of lignin {{is the amount of}} methoxyl groups and the amount of C-C bonds on the aromatic ring. The absence of methoxyl groups in the structure of coumaryl lignin (formed by the trans-p-coumaric alcohol) enables a higher lignin condensation, due to an increase in C-C bonds with another coumaryl unit. Thus, it is expected that <b>babassu</b> <b>nut</b> residues enable a higher yield and quality of charcoal, when compared to Eucalyptus wood, which is widely cultivated in Brazil for this purpose.|$|E
30|$|It is {{possible}} to observe an initial mass loss (stage I) for the pyrolysis of <b>babassu</b> <b>nut,</b> corresponding to an evaporation of water of 9.6 %, followed by an intense mass loss (60.2 %) mainly attributed to holocellulose (stage II). The onset and endset temperatures of this stage were 280 °C and 342 °C, respectively. The peak of maximum mass loss was found at 303 °C and it is lower than those reported by Poletto et al. 2012 and Protásio et al. 2013 c for Eucalyptus wood, at 364 °C and 354 °C, respectively.|$|E
