5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the Readers would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the average}} {{duration}} of a Central Committee meeting decreased, and fewer meetings were held, many Central Committee members {{were unable to}} speak. Some members consulted the leadership beforehand, to ask to speak during meetings. During the May 1966 Central Committee plenum, Brezhnev openly complained that only one member had asked him personally to <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> The majority of speakers at Central Committee plenums were high-standing officials.|$|E

25|$|During this time, Maathai was {{recognized}} with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan {{government did not}} appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the Goldman Environmental Prize in San Francisco and the Hunger Project's Africa Prize for Leadership in London. CNN aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to Rio de Janeiro for the UN Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.|$|E
500|$|Primrose was {{described}} as [...] "one of the most colourful, interesting and forceful characters in Edmonton's civic life for may years." [...] His NWMP command {{was described}} as a [...] "model to the Force", while his police career had been described to have [...] "won the confidence and respect of the public to an exceptional degree." [...] Donald E. Cameron, who delivered the eulogy at the funeral remarked of Primrose, [...] "Colonel Primrose never sought for himself or for his men more than that their record of service should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for itself. Somewhat austerely he clung to the tradition of the service that duty faithfully discharged its own reward." [...] An obituary published shortly after his death described him as [...] "courageous, outspoken and firm in dealing with his criminals." [...] John W. McDonald, Mayor of Macleod also stated, [...] "Col. Primrose was one of the outstanding officers of the force. … He was a good citizen and a good police officer and a man of many admirable qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the Petition by the House of Lords, Charles sent a message to the Commons [...] "forbidding them to meddle with affairs of state", something that produced a furious debate. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced that he had been commanded to interrupt any Member of Parliament who should insult or cast aspersion on a Minister of State, such as the Duke of Buckingham. This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared {{that he did not know}} whether he would <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the cause of all our miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall never go out with honour, or sit with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the cause of all our disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E

500|$|After his {{selection}} {{as a vice}} presidential candidate, Biden was criticized by his own Roman Catholic Diocese of Wilmington Bishop Michael Saltarelli over his stance on abortion, which goes against the church's pro-life beliefs and teachings. [...] The diocese confirmed that even if elected vice president, Biden would not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> at Catholic schools. [...] Biden was soon barred from receiving Holy Communion by the bishop of his original hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, because of his support for abortion rights; however, Biden did continue to receive Communion at his local Delaware parish. [...] Scranton became a flash point in the competition for swing state Catholic voters between the Democratic campaign and liberal Catholic groups, who stressed that other social issues {{should be considered as}} much or more than abortion, and many bishops and conservative Catholics, who maintained abortion was paramount. Biden said he believed that life began at conception but that he would not impose his personal religious views on others. Bishop Saltarelli had previously stated regarding stances similar to Biden's: [...] "No one today would accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.' Likewise, none of us should accept this statement from any public servant: 'I am personally opposed to abortion but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The other {{threat to}} the {{security}} of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them. I do not agree with the extremists of either the left or the right, but I think they should <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and to publish, both because they themselves have, and ought to have, rights, and once their rights are gone, the rights {{of the rest of us}} are hardly safe … ...|$|E

2500|$|Wilfried Martens (CD) {{criticized the}} French-speaking {{side of the}} country for misinterpreting a [...] "sign of goodwill" [...] made by Leterme. Karel de Gucht (Open VLD) said {{that they do not have}} a veto right about which Fleming can become prime minister. He also added that they overreacted. [...] "Who takes away his {{position}} as prime minister, turns him into a political martyr. I do not feel like competing against a political martyr during the next election. Why should he not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak?</b> The campaign waged against him...is unacceptable." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the council}} ended, a {{representative}} (Marc Morano) from the Institute {{broke into a}} press briefing being given by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was reporting on his meeting with the Pope. He interrupted the Secretary-General and the moderator, asking that global-warming skeptics <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> After a few minutes, he was escorted from the premises by Vatican officials. In response to the papal encyclical “Laudato Si'”, which outlined the Church’s moral case for addressing climate change, and in anticipation of Pope Francis’ September 2015 visit to the United States, Gene Koprowski, director of marketing for the Institute, suggested that the Pope's pronouncements on climate change indicate that “pagan forms are returning to the Church this day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Using a {{press release}} issued by the Archdiocese of Detroit, the Catholic Diocese of Scranton issued this {{statement}} {{in response to a}} planned speaking engagement of Voris in that diocese: [...] "The Diocese of Scranton has determined that Mr. Voris will not <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> in a Diocesan or parish facility. After these engagements were scheduled, the Diocese became aware of concerns about this individual’s views regarding other religious groups. In videos posted on the Internet, Mr. Voris makes comments that certainly can be interpreted as being insensitive to people of other faiths. The Catholic Church teaches us to respect all people, regardless of their faith tradition. Although the Diocese shares Mr. Voris’ support of efforts to protect human life, his extreme positions on other faiths are not appropriate and therefore the Diocese cannot host him." ...|$|E

50|$|Though Cowell {{had given}} Bower some 200 hours {{of access to}} him, Bower {{subsequently}} said that Cowell had tried to restrict his access to sources. In Bower's presence, Cowell told his friend Sinitta that she <b>was</b> not <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Bower, and as compensation for not <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> Sinitta, Bower <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Cowell's mother.

Cowell's fellow entertainment manager, Simon Fuller, also refused to cooperate with Bower after apparently finding out that a colleague of Cowell's was not supporting the book.|$|R
2500|$|Simpson {{reportedly}} {{demanded that}} he <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{to his mother}} before he would surrender. The chase ended at 8:00p.m. at his Brentwood home, [...] later, where his son, Jason, {{ran out of the}} house, [...] "gesturing wildly", and 27 SWAT officers awaited. After remaining in the Bronco for about 45 minutes, Simpson was allowed to go inside for about an hour; a police spokesman stated that he spoke to his mother and drank a glass of orange juice, causing reporters to laugh. Shapiro arrived, and Simpson surrendered to authorities a few minutes later. In the Bronco the police found [...] "$8,000 in cash, a change of clothing, a loaded [...]357 Magnum, a passport, family pictures, and a fake goatee and mustache." [...] Neither the footage of the Bronco chase nor the items found in the Bronco were shown to the jury as evidence in the trial.|$|E
2500|$|These {{developments}} made it {{more likely}} that the NLRB would be the one to decide the fate of the strike. [...] Chairman Gould believed that General Counsel Feinstein was delaying the ULP investigation (perhaps to give negotiations a chance to work), but was troubled when Feinstein allegedly suggested that he become the Board's chief spokesperson. Because the Board and the General Counsel are legally independent entities by law, Gould refused to let Feinstein take the lead. [...] Feinstein asked that he <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to the entire Board on the issue. [...] Truesdale and NLRB member James Stephens voiced considerable concern over this proposed meeting, as issues in the strike were likely to come before the Board and since the General Counsel and Board were supposed to be at arm's length. When Feinstein became upset at their comments, Gould suggested that he approach the Board's members himself. [...] Feinstein did so, and won a meeting with the Board on March 8. But four of the five members of the Board expressed their dissatisfaction with Feinstein's proposal, and it was dropped.|$|E

40|$|We model {{organizational}} {{decision making}} as costless pre-play communication. Decision making is called authoritarian {{if only one}} player <b>is</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> and consensual if all players <b>are</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak.</b> Players <b>are</b> assumed to have limited cognitive capacity and we characterize their behavior under each decision making regime for two di¤erent cognitive hierarchy models. Our results suggest that author-itarian decision making is optimal when players have conicting preferences over the set of Nash equilibrium outcomes, whereas consensual decision making is optimal when players have congruent preferences over this set. The intuition is that author-itarian decision making avoids conict, but sometimes creates insu ¢ cient mutual trust to implement socially optimal outcomes...|$|R
40|$|This brief essay – based {{partially}} on remarks made as {{a member}} of a "diversity panel" at a recent Florida Philosophical Association meeting and partially on the reception of those remarks – concerns the rhetorical spaces from which one <b>is</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> as a woman in philosophy. I identify two gendered locations from which women <b>are</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about the diversity problem in philosophy: 1) the happy woman of reason and 2) the unhappy feminist philosopher. Drawing on Marilyn Frye's analysis of the double-bind as a symptom of oppression and Sara Ahmed's reflections on the figure of "the feminist killjoy", I argue that both gendered locales undermine one’s ability to bring about transformative change in the discipline...|$|R
