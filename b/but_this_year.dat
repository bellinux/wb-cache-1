Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for {{the celebration of the}} Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time since}} the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E

500|$|Zeta's Lad trainer John Upson {{was among}} those {{trainers}} who were particularly angry, feeling, correctly as it transpired, that this was his only {{chance to have a}} leading contender in a National. Before the race Upson had said: [...] "I'm not someone who always thinks their horse is going to win, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> I just have a feeling." [...] The horse was in mid-division taking the water jump but was instantly pulled up as jockey Robbie Supple, riding in his third National, realised the race was not on. Upson later revealed: [...] "The reason I really blew my top was, that once the initial fiasco had happened, there was the starter standing there saying, 'Right, I'm disqualifying everything, apart from the nine that didn't go. I'll start the race again with nine runners.' At that stage I just thought the world had gone completely mad. The adrenaline was going and I was jumping up and down." ...|$|E
500|$|Liam Lacey, also {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{described}} Iyall's voice as [...] "sultry [...] sexy", while Mason called it [...] "powerful". Her style {{has sometimes been}} compared to Chrissie Hynde, vocalist for the Pretenders. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post acknowledged the similarity, but also noted the influence of other singers in [...] "Never Say Never" [...] where Iyall mixed the [...] "aggressive bitchiness of , the coy confrontational tactics of Patty Donahue of the Waitresses and the slack sensuality of Debbie Harry of the earliest Blondie." [...] Iyall used to find the comparison annoying, but eventually warmed to it: [...] "When people said I sounded like her, I'd [...] say, 'Oh yeah, thanks a lot.' <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> I've {{fallen in love with}} [...] Learning To Crawl so now I don't care if [...] people want to make comparisons." [...] After a live show in 1982, [...] Niester contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the [...] "vocal range of an automobile horn". Billboard writer Kathy Gillis wrote after a concert two years later that Iyall exhibited a [...] "dramatic range that, while not extreme in either direction, was touching." ...|$|E

500|$|Television {{critics were}} more {{favorable}} than {{not in their}} response to [...] "Mash Off". Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone felt that the series returned to form in the episode, and commented: [...] "We've said it before and we'll say it again: we like our Glee with just enough ridiculousness, and this week had it." [...] Entertainment Weekly journalist Abby West noted that she loved {{the fact that it}} [...] "was a bullying episode that snuck up on us". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal opined that [...] "Mash Off" [...] {{was one of the best}} installments of Glee, and cited the episode's storylines as highlights: [...] "The mash-up episodes every season can be hit or miss, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> was perfected to the nth degree." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that there was plenty of [...] "airy fun to be found" [...] in [...] "Mash Off", but added that [...] "underneath all the silly fake mustaches and snappy quotes about root-beer fountains and robot teachers beat a very dark baboon heart. In the end, that murky, telltale undercurrent burst to the fore, like a ... slap in the face, leaving us gasping and a little confused." [...] Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson stated that it was [...] "surprisingly good", and that [...] "Mash Off" [...] was a [...] "solid hour of television that was bursting with fantastic musical numbers and some really gratifying narrative developments". Michael Slezak of TV Line said that the episode contributed to a revitalization of the quality of the show's third season.|$|E

50|$|Spring {{has arrived}} in the oriental enclave of Gensokyo, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>year's</b> spring is just too strong to believe.
