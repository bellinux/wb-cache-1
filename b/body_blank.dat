40|$|The {{literature}} suggests links between people’s understandings of nutrition and their actual dietary habits, where knowledge of good practice translates into low {{body mass index}} (BMI). In order to investigate a similar effect in preschool children, a sample of 25 four year-olds will take part in structured interviews devised to assess {{their knowledge of the}} three processes of digestion, absorption and egestion. Data will be analysed quantitatively to give performance scores, which will be compared with children’s body mass index. If links are found there are potential consequences for early years biology education, where the enhancement of nursery children’s knowledge of the digestive system could contribute towards positive health outcomes. Key words: early years; knowledge of nutrition; body mass index. INTRODUCTION AND PRIOR RESEARCH The English primary science national curriculum includes concepts of human nutrition (Department for Education, 2013), firstly because of their relevance to healthy living, aiming to promote normal growth during childhood, as well as addressing the issue of an increasingly overweight population. Secondly, aside from what constitutes nutritious eating in the sense of ‘healthy’ and ‘less-healthy’ foods, aspects of the physiology of digestion are introduced. Physiology concepts are typically taught at a basic level, although children are required to grasp a number of abstract ideas in order to conceptualise the digestive system in a holistic, meaningful way. The ‘journey of food’ through the human body is used to give context to the processes of digestion (food is broken down into simpler forms), absorption (the body extracts nourishment from food) and egestion (once nourishment has been extracted, waste leaves the body). There has been a limited amount of previous research focused on young children’s ideas of these three processes. When Osborne et al. (1992) asked English primary children to draw what happens to food inside their bodies, 5 - 7 y/o tended to depict the interior of the body as a mostly empty vessel storing bits of ingested food – the hollow bag model of digestion. Food was not contained in discrete internal organs but instead was distributed within the hollow bag of the body, including arms and legs. When Teixeira’s (1998) 4 - 6 y/o small Brazilian sample drew the journey of a bar of chocolate through the body, some of the older children produced hollow bag models, though others had the food moving from the mouth to a distinct abdominal area (tummy) before being distributed to the legs, which caused stretching of the legs, and an increase in the child’s height. When the child bent over at the waist some of the food moved to the arms, which grew in turn. It has been long established that younger primary children are rarely aware that the body transforms food into simpler forms by the process of digestion (e. g. Gellert, 1962). They understand that food is chewed and divided up into smaller pieces, but have not yet constructed the idea that food is changed chemically, being broken down into smaller components that are capable of being absorbed by the body (Osborne et al., 1992; Teixeira, 1998). They believe instead that food retains its identity within the body, which is compatible with a hollow bag model. Regarding the ultimate fate of food, Teixeira’s 4 y/o tended to hold a fixed container model, where as well as keeping its original identity all ingested food never leaves the body. Gellert (1962) found that some US primary children thought defecation was merely a process to stop the body from bursting, and {{in the same way as}} Garcia-Barros et al. ’s (2011) 4 - 7 y/o Spanish sample, did not relate ingested food to egested faeces. A common idea displayed by learners of a variety of ages is that solid foods and liquid drinks take separate routes through the digestive system, and then exit at different orifices (Giordan & Vecchi, 1988; Garcia-Barros et al., 2011). Adult obesity is globally on the rise and strongly linked with premature illness and death (De Onis et al., 2010); in addition, being an overweight child is a reliable predictor of adult obesity (Steinberger et al., 2001). Preschool overweight and obesity is dramatically on the increase with an estimated 43 million cases worldwide, with a further 92 million at risk (De Onis et al., 2010). Hypothesised causes of preschool obesity have included diet and a lack of physical exercise, particularly the adoption of sedentary lifestyles, e. g. spending excessive amounts of time watching TV (Han et al., 2010). Governments spend millions per annum on health education initiatives aimed at improving nutrition knowledge, although evidence for their effectiveness is equivocal. For example, some researchers have found that nutrition knowledge is indeed linked to good dietary habits (e. g. De Vriendt et al., 2009), while others report no association with obesity (e. g. O'Brien & Davies, 2007). Measures of nutrition knowledge utilised by these studies have usually been limited to aspects such as correctly interpreting food labels, understanding dietary recommendations, or knowing which foods are ‘healthy’ or otherwise. Participants’ knowledge of the physiology of digestion is rarely assessed. The current study aims to explore this knowledge in a sample of preschool children and test for possible associations with body mass index (BMI) in order to assess whether there could be a causative relationship, as argued by authors such as De Vriendt and colleagues. Research Questions 1. 	How do preschool children conceptualise digestion, absorption and egestion as processes occurring within their own bodies? 2. 	Is there a link between these understandings and preschool children’s body mass index? METHOD A sample of 25 children aged 4. 0 years (+/- 2 months) will be accrued on an opportunity basis from a number of local early years settings; this age represents a chronological mid-point in nursery education. Each child will be welcomed singly into a quiet room and take part in a structured interview, the format of which is based on a method that has previously been used effectively by the team with children of the same age group (Allen, 2015). Sat at a table, the child will sort a variety of real foods into a rank order that specifies the degree to which they are ‘good for you’. Using the top ranked food as a reference, they will be asked to draw onto an A 3 -sized <b>body</b> <b>blank</b> what they think happens inside their body once they have eaten this food. This procedure will be repeated using their bottom ranked food. The drawing process will be video recorded and guided by a number of structured questions that enable the child to talk about their ideas of the processes of digestion, absorption and egestion. A researcher will annotate the drawing as the child draws and explains each process. Finally, bioelectrical impedance scales and a stadiometer will be used to measure the child’s body mass, height (in order to calculate BMI) and estimate percent body fat content. ANALYSIS The drawings and video evidence will be analysed by a method similar to that utilised by Reiss and Tunnicliffe (2000), where the accuracy of children’s drawn and verbal data can be numerically assessed with respect to scientific accuracy. This involves first ranking the data, then allocating each child numerical scores for their knowledge and understanding of the three processes of digestion, absorption and egestion, and an overall performance score. These scores will then be compared statistically using Pearson’s correlation coefficient r, in the search for possible links with BMI. RESULTS, DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS At the time of writing, data collection has not yet taken place therefore no results are presented. Subsequent discussion will involve describing the nature of four year-olds’ ideas about how the body deals with food, including whether they believe healthier foods are processed differently, which are aspects of preschool science education that have not been covered in such detail in previous studies. If associations between this knowledge and BMI are discovered then this might have potential consequences for early years biology education. Next steps would involve further investigations on a larger scale, and recommending that improving knowledge of the digestive system in the nursery could have positive health benefits for children.

40|$|A {{procedure}} for S/S {{of salt and}} ash from a waste incinerator by aqueous asphalt emulsions was developed.

The French feminist theory of l’écriture féminine {{with its emphasis on}} textuality of gender has been applied to prove that the Afro-American woman creates her Self while writing and her text becomes the essence of her identity since any other opportunity of emotional, intellectual and spiritual evolution has been denied to her. It is explained that the black woman revolves against the boundaries of the hierarchical system, into which she had been placed, silenced and transformed into an object of male manipulation. The analysis of the novel suggests that the liberation of the black woman from the male construct coincides with the progress of her self-creation. Eva disrupts the rationalistic discourse, subverts the phallologocentric order, and establishes a dialogue of gap and silence. The black narrator’s text transforms the traditional canon of woman as ground, her <b>body</b> as the <b>blank</b> page and subjugates the black male body to secure her ciphers on it as her own text.

The data from these tests have been extrapolated beyond the necking strain by double Voce extrapolation. Punching experiments have been performed in an excenter driven press equipped with position and force measurement devices. The experiments result in load curves for the different steel qualities and gives information about the characteristic zones of the sheet edges. The results from simulations have been evaluated by comparisons with experiments concerning load curves, characteristic zones of the sheet edge, work done during the operation, maximum forces and stroke to failure. A good compliance with experiments was found concerning maximum forces, characteristic zones and work done during the operation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|At {{the centre}} of {{discourse}} of Dance in South Africa {{is the notion of}} Other. The form and approach in Contemporary Dance in South Africa in the 21 st century has been shaped by cultural forces such as apartheid and colonialism. This thesis sets out a phenomenological study of Othering in Dance in South Africa through a hermeneutical unpacking of 'Older dancing'. Its critical question grapples with the notion of age as a new marker of alterity in Dance and asks: How does dancing the Other bring new ways of seeing bodies? The lived experiences of four categories in Older dancing: dancers, choreographers, directors and dance critics, in and outside of South Africa since the 2000 s, will be analysed. My own position in each of the categories above has allowed me to participate in Contemporary Dance and the performing arts field in South Africa for over 45 years. A partial history of Contemporary Dance in South Africa is explicated in order to provide paradigmatic frames for this study. The philosophical enquiry of this thesis has foregrounded Dance Studies as a discrete research field in order to highlight dance and the body itself, and to reassert an enviable position of dancing bodies as research instruments and knowledge producers. A hermeneutical narrative analysis was deployed following twelve interviews that were conducted over 4 years (2012 - 2014). Seven South African and five non-South African 'voices' were analysed and coded against four primary lines of enquiry in Experience: notions of cultural inscription and dancing <b>bodies</b> as <b>blank</b> slates; questions of (in) visibility and frailty of older persons, wisdom and (in) dependent older dancers and the ontologies of marginalisation for Older dancing within concert theatre Dance. This suggested a thesis of wider Body-space reading and continuum for Dance that could be useful in understanding epistemology of prejudice. Recommendations that flow from this study will relate to Dance Studies in South Africa that is already moving away from its anthropological roots in tribal dances, experimentations with multicultural dance, towards unpacking intersectionality, public art and the contested label African dance. It provides Body-space as a further theoretical tool with which to observe dancing and bodies as states of becoming that will be of interest to Dance Studies, Performance Theory and Cultural Studies...|$|R
40|$|AIMS: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if genetic variation in the pain-modulating gene DREAM and its pathway genes influence susceptibility to reporting musculoskeletal pain in the population. METHODS: Pairwise tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in DREAM, PDYN and OPRK 1 were genotyped in a UK population-based discovery cohort in whom pain was assessed using <b>blank</b> <b>body</b> manikins at three time points. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed at the first time point. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to test for association between SNPs and the maximum number of pain sites reported (0 - 29) across the three time points. Significantly associated SNPs (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) were subsequently genotyped for validation in a cohort of European men with pain assessed at two time points. RESULTS: Thirty-five SNPs were genotyped in 1055 subjects, of whom 83 % reported pain, in the discovery cohort. SNPs in each gene were associated with the maximum number of pain sites reported, were independent of symptoms of anxiety and depression and had a significant cumulative effect (p[*]=[*] 7. 0 [*]×[*] 10 (- 5)). Significantly associated SNPs were successfully genotyped in 1733 men, 76 % of whom reported pain, in the validation cohort, but did not show significant association with the number of pain sites. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation in the DREAM pathway genes was associated with the extent of pain reporting in a population-based cohort. These findings were not replicated in a single independent cohort; however, given the potential of this pathway as a therapeutic target, further investigation in additional cohorts is warranted. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{determine}} the influence of short term exposure to mechanical factors on regional musculoskeletal pain.  METHODS—Full time newly employed workers were recruited from 12  occupational groups and information collected by questionnaire. Subjects indicated on a <b>blank</b> <b>body</b> manikin any low back, shoulder, wrist or forearm or both, or knee pain which had occurred during the past month and had lasted more than 1  day. Data were also collected with a previously validated questionnaire on working postures, manual handling activities, and repetitive movements of the upper limb. The relations between mechanical factors and each area of pain were calculated as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). Adjustment was made for age and sex.  RESULTS— 1081 subjects (median age 23; interquartile range 20 - 27) were recruited to the study (a participation rate of 91 %). 261  (24 %) reported low back pain, 221  (20 %) shoulder pain, 93  (9 %) wrist or forearm pain, and 222  (21 %) knee pain. Several specific manual handling activities were found to be associated with low back, shoulder, and knee pain. Carrying weights of more than 50  lbs (23  kg) on one shoulder was the factor which was most strongly associated with low back pain (OR 2. 4  (95 % CI 1. 5  to 3. 8)), shoulder pain (OR 3. 1  (95 % CI 1. 9  to 4. 8)), and knee pain (OR 3. 5  (95 % CI 2. 2  to 5. 5)), whereas forearm pain was most strongly associated with repetitive movements of the wrists (OR 1. 8  (95 % CI 1. 04  to 3. 1)). By contrast very few postures were associated with regional pain, although bending forwards in an uncomfortable position for at least 15  minutes was associated with shoulder pain (OR 1. 6  (95 % CI 1. 2  to 2. 2)) and kneeling for at least 15  minutes was associated with knee pain (OR 1. 8  (95 % CI 1. 2  to 2. 6)). Exposure to mechanical factors was most strongly associated with pain at multiple sites rather than with pains in individual regions.  CONCLUSIONS—Even among workers with only short term exposure to mechanical factors, musculoskeletal pain is increased.    Keywords: epidemiology; manual handling; questionnair...|$|R
40|$|I explore, in both fictional and {{historical}} works the complex construction and {{representation of the}} "Jew" as both Spanish and colonial other in the Iberian Diaspora. Following different converso female figures my dissertation travels between England, Spain, Italy, and ends across the Atlantic in New Spain. By moving converso Jews from the margin to the center and analyzing this subgroup through the narrower lens of female identity and practice, my dissertation demonstrates the need to re-think the boundaries of Iberia in the Early Modern world as well as female contribution {{to the preservation of}} Jewish rituals. I examine how a series of texts engage with the issues of religious and gender identity. Male authors use female protagonists to explore their relationships to a changing society and burgening modern world. They use the female <b>body</b> as a <b>blank</b> space to project and inscribe social ideals. At the same time, these women use their bodies and bodily practices to speak back and create identity. I explore in detail the material practices surrounding the body including clothing, food, and language. These practices reveal the center of female power and the importance of the home in the continuity of tradition and maintenance of Jewish ritual and converso identity. I show in Chapter 1 how Isabel from La espanola inglesa is a projection of feminine ideals, how in Chapter 2 La Celestina and La Lozana Andaluza in Chapter 3 use their body to speak back against ideals of female subservience, and Isabel de Carvajal in Chapter 4 uses her body to observe crypto-Jewish religious practices. As these figures all struggle with boundaries and liminal spaces, I show crypto-Jewish practice to be a hybrid combination of Jewish and Catholic traditions. As I analyze the female protagonists from La espanola inglesa, La Celestina, La Lozana Andaluza, and the Inquisition manuscripts of Isabel de Carvajal, an alternative discourse is created which challenges patriarchal and hegemonic centers of power. Located on different corners of the Sephardic Diaspora in the Early Modern period, these figures reveal different ways of belonging and aspects of identity that normally go unnoticed. Thesis (Ph. D.)
