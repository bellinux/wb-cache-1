40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} {{characterization}} of three novel members of the KRAB-domain-containing C 2 H 2 zinc finger family (ZNF 133, 136 and 140). KRAB (Krüppel-associated box) is an evolutionarily conserved protein domain found N-terminally {{with respect to the}} zinc finger repeats that encodes the DNA binding domain. ZNF 133 and ZNF 140 have both the KRAB A- and KRAB <b>B-boxes</b> present at their N-terminus, whereas ZNF 136 contains only the KRAB A-box. We have previously demonstrated that the KRAB domains derived from ZNF 133 and ZNF 140 are potent transcriptional repression domains [Margolin et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 4509 – 4513]. The KRAB domain from ZNF 136, containing only subdomain A, is a considerable weaker suppression domain; however, when fused to the heterologous KRAB B subdomain of ZNF 10 (KOX 1) the two subdomains form a KRAB domain which induces repression as potently as previously reported KRAB domains...|$|R

50|$|The microtubule-associated E3 ligase MID1 (EC) {{contains}} a type 1 <b>B-box</b> zinc finger domain.

40|$|TRIM {{proteins}} are a {{group of}} highly conserved proteins participating {{in a variety of}} biological processes such as regulation of development, apoptosis, and innate immunity. However, the functions of these proteins in the mollusk are still poorly understood. In the present study, a TRIM 9 homolog (named ChTRIM 9) was first identified from a transcript-ome library in the Hong Kong oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis. The full-length cDNA of ChTRIM 9 is 2928 bp and has a predicted Open Reading Frame ORF) encoding 721 amino acids, encoding a putative 80. 2 kDa protein. SMART analysis indicated that ChTRIM 9 contains the three typical TRIM domains, a RING finger, two <b>B-boxes,</b> and a coiled-coil domain in the N-terminal region, whereas the C-terminal region contains a SPRY domain. qRT-PCR,analysis revealed a ubiquitous presence of ChTRIM 9, with the highest expression in the gills. Upon bacterial challenge in vivo, the ChTRIM 9 transcripts in hemocytes were significantly down-regulated, indicating its involvement in signal transduction in immune response of oysters. Furthermore, ChTRIM 9 was found to be localized mainly in the cytoplasm, and its over-expression inhibited the transcriptional activity of the NF-kappa B gene in HEK 293 T cells, demonstrating its negative role in regulating NF-kappa B signaling.

40|$|During {{asymmetric}} {{stem cell}} division, both the daughter stem cell and the presumptive intermediate progenitor cell inherit cytoplasm from their parental stem cell. Thus, proper specification of intermediate progenitor cell identity requires an efficient mechanism to rapidly extinguish {{the activity of}} self-renewal factors, but the mechanisms remain unknown in most stem cell lineages. During asymmetric division of a type II neural stem cell (neuroblast) in the Drosophila larval brain, the Brain tumor (Brat) protein segregates unequally into the immature intermediate neural progenitor (INP), where it specifies INP identity by attenuating {{the function of the}} self-renewal factor Klumpfuss (Klu), but the mechanisms are not understood. Here, we report that Brat specifies INP identity through its N-terminal <b>B-boxes</b> via a novel mechanism that is independent of asymmetric protein segregation. Brat-mediated specification of INP identity is critically dependent on the function of the Wnt destruction complex, which attenuates the activity of β-catenin/Armadillo (Arm) in immature INPs. Aberrantly increasing Arm activity in immature INPs further exacerbates the defects in the specification of INP identity and enhances the supernumerary neuroblast mutant phenotype in brat mutant brains. By contrast, reducing Arm activity in immature INPs suppresses supernumerary neuroblast formation in brat mutant brains. Finally, reducing Arm activity also strongly suppresses supernumerary neuroblasts induced by overexpression of klu. Thus, the Brat-dependent mechanism extinguishes the function of the self-renewal factor Klu in the presumptive intermediate progenitor cell by attenuating Arm activity, balancing stem cell maintenance and progenitor cell specification...|$|R

40|$|Most {{proteins}} of the TRIM family (also {{known as}} RBCC family) are ubiquitin ligases that share a peculiar protein structure, characterized by including an N-terminal RING finger domain closely followed {{by one or}} two <b>B-boxes.</b> Additional protein domains found at their C termini {{have been used to}} classify TRIM proteins into classes. TRIMs are involved in multiple cellular processes {{and many of them are}} essential components of the innate immunity system of animal species. In humans, it has been shown that mutations in several TRIM-encoding genes lead to diverse genetic diseases and contribute to several types of cancer. They had been hitherto detected only in animals. In this work, by comprehensively analyzing the available diversity of TRIM and TRIM-like protein sequences and evaluating their evolutionary patterns, an improved classification of the TRIM family is obtained. Members of one of the TRIM subfamilies defined, called Subfamily A, turn to be present not only in animals, but also in many other eukaryotes, such as fungi, apusozoans, alveolates, excavates and plants. The rest of subfamilies are animal-specific and several of them originated only recently. Subfamily A proteins are characterized by containing a MATH domain, suggesting a potential evolutionary connection between TRIM proteins and a different type of ubiquitin ligases, known as TRAFs, which contain quite similar MATH domains. These results indicate that the TRIM family emerged much earlier than so far thought and contribute to our understanding of its origin and diversification.

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{discovered}} that TRIM 28 interacts with EZH 2 and regulates its activity {{in breast cancer}} cells. EZH 2, the major H 3 K 27 tri-methyltransferase, is over expressed in multiple subtypes of breast cancer; however, whether EZH 2 plays {{an active role in}} breast cancer progression or treatment resistance is unknown. Here, we determined EZH 2 -interacting proteins in MCF 7 cells by immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and detected TRIM 28 with a high confidence score. TRIM 28 is a transcription co-regulator with an N-terminal tri-partite RING finger, <b>B-boxes</b> and a coiled-coil domain (RBCC) and a C-terminal PHD/Bromo domain. Domain mapping revealed that the RBCC domain of TRIM 28 interacts with EZH 2, and the pre-SET region (Cysteine-rich domain) of EZH 2 interacts with TRIM 28. Transcriptome profiling and intersection of EZH 2 - and TRIM 28 -regulated genes indicated co-regulation of differentiation and morphogenesis pathways, as well as co-activation of the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway (CXCR 4, CXCL 12, EGFR, KIT). TRIM 28 depletion in MCF 7 cells decreased EZH 2 recruitment and CXCR 4 gene expression, in parallel with decreased mammosphere formation. TRIM 28 regulation of EZH 2 association with SWI/SNF complex might contribute to this process. Collectively these data indicate that EZH 2 and TRIM 28 regulate breast cancer stem cell maintenance by transcriptional regulation of CXCR 4 gene expression. In part two, TRIM 28 is overexpressed in a human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) model of breast cancer progression; interestingly, TRIM 28 is heavily phosphorylated (pS 824 /pS 473) in the more aggressive stages of this model. Furthermore, ectopic expression of TRIM 28 WT and phosphorylation defective forms in HMEC cells indicates that TRIM 28 promotes cell proliferation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Genome-wide TRIM 28 binding profile analysis revealed transcription factor binding motifs, including TCF 4 and RBP-J (a Notch effector), at TRIM 28 binding sites. The promoter of AXIN 2, which encompasses a TCF 4 binding motif, is a direct transcriptional activation target of TRIM 28. Collectively, we demonstrated a mechanism of regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation by TRIM 28 in a phosphorylation dependent manner via a TCF 4 binding motif...|$|R

40|$|The interferon-inducible p 53 -target gene TRIM 22 (Staf 50) is {{a member}} of the TRIM (TRIpartite Motif) family. The TRIM family is a family of RING (Really Interesting New Gene) proteins, defined through a {{tripartite}} motif, containing a RING-domain, one or two <b>B-boxes</b> and a Coiled-coil-domain. The TRIM proteins are involved in diverse biological functions, such as apoptosis, cell-cycle- progression and viral defence. Interferons (IFNs) are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral, anti-proliferative, proapoptotic and immunmodulatory functions. Similar to TRIM 22, many TRIM proteins are upregulated in response to IFNs, and many are involved in defence towards viruses, including TRIM 22. TRIM 22 has been shown to restrict HIV- 1, hepatitis B and encephalomyocarditis virus. p 53 is probably one of the most important tumour suppressor genes, and is positioned in the centre of signalling pathways that prevent proliferation and survival of potentially malignant cells. So far only TRIM 22 and TRIM 19 (PML) have been shown to be upregulated in response to p 53, but recently several TRIM proteins have been shown to interact with and regulate p 53. In my thesis, I have characterised the subcellular localisation and the functions of TRIM 22. In paper I I show that endogenous TRIM 22 localises to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore, TRIM 22 colocalises with the centrosomes irrespective of cell-cycle-phase, and with the endoplasmatic reticulum in primary cells and in cell-lines. In paper II I show that overexpressed TRIM 22 suppresses translation through direct or indirect interaction with the translation initiation factor eIF 4 E and disruption of the eIF 4 F-complex. My data suggest that TRIM 22 may suppress translation of a subset of mRNAs, particularly dependent on eIF 4 F for their translation. In paper III I show overexpressed TRIM 22 to induce either repressed proliferation or cell-death depending on cellular context. Taken together, my data show cell-death-inducing, antiproliferative, translation-inhibitory effects of TRIM 22, consistent with a role both as a tumour suppressor downstream of p 53 -signalling, and with immunomodulation downstream of IFNs. However, many new questions have been raised and further studies are warranted to understand all aspects of the function of TRIM 22...|$|R
