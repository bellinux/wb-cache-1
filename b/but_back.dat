5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, {{who was able to}} move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to more sympathetic characters. How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|Theophilos now {{undertook}} {{a serious effort}} to relieve Sicily: he assembled a large army and placed it {{under the command of}} his son-in-law, the Caesar Alexios Mousele. Mousele arrived in Sicily in spring 838, in time to relieve the fortress of Cefalù from a Muslim attack. Mousele scored a number of successes against Muslim raiding parties <b>but,</b> <b>back</b> in Constantinople, his enemies launched accusations of contacts with the Arabs and designs on the throne. Furthermore, the death of his infant wife, Maria, cut his link to Theophilos, and the Emperor sent the archbishop of Syracuse, Theodore Krithinos, to recall the Caesar to Constantinople in 839.|$|E
5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little hope of finding him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
25|$|Alderman was {{available}} for international selection from the 1988-89 season onwards. He was overlooked {{for the first two}} tests <b>but</b> <b>back</b> for the third, taking 4-68 and 3-78. In the 4th test he took 0-17 and 0-6 as Australia focused on spin. He did not play in the 5th test.|$|E

25|$|Necker, {{conspicuous}} by {{his absence}} from the royal party on that day, found himself in disgrace with Louis, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in the good graces of the National Assembly. Those of the clergy who had joined the Assembly at the church of Saint Louis remained in the Assembly; forty-seven members of the nobility, including the Duke of Orléans, soon joined them; by June 27, the royal party had overtly given in, although {{the likelihood of a}} military counter-coup remained in the air. The French military began to arrive in large numbers around Paris and Versailles.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} Australians {{were able to}} learn from this series {{and were able to}} {{transform}} themselves into better players as a result. David Boon's Test career was written off after this series. Dean Jones lived up to his promise, while Steve Waugh, after a long period of time, finally began to deliver on his ability and was one of Australia's most important players in the 1990s. Australia's bowlers, notably Geoff Lawson, Merv Hughes and Craig McDermott, all returned to form and were integral parts of future teams that defeated England in 1989, 1990–91, 1993, and 1994-95. Bruce Reid's performances improved markedly, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> injuries limited his Test career.|$|E

500|$|To {{achieve a}} more {{cinematic}} atmosphere, Back to Earth was not filmed {{in front of}} a studio audience. Some previous Red Dwarf episodes had been shot in that way ("Bodyswap" [...] and all of the seventh series), <b>but</b> <b>Back</b> to Earth represented {{the first time that a}} laughter track was not added before broadcast. It was also the first episode of Red Dwarf to be filmed in high definition.|$|E
500|$|The Cardinals {{acquired}} Freese {{before the}} 2008 season. He made his MLB debut on Opening Day 2009 {{due to an}} injury to starting third baseman Troy Glaus. [...] Despite suffering his own injuries {{in the minor leagues}} and in his first two MLB seasons, Freese batted [...]297 with 10 home runs and 55 RBIs during the Cardinals' 2011 World Series championship season. [...] The next season, he batted [...]293 with 20 home runs and was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game. [...] Freese authored a 20-game hitting streak in 2013, <b>but</b> <b>back</b> injuries limited his effectiveness, and the Cardinals traded him to the Angels following the season. He played for the Angels for two seasons before signing with the Pirates in March 2016.|$|E
500|$|Montcalm {{was taken}} aback to learn of the British deployment, and his {{response}} has been regarded as precipitate. Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they {{had nowhere to go}} <b>but</b> <b>back</b> down the Foulon, and would have been under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. If we give him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E

500|$|According to IGN, Scar, Simba and Mufasa {{have since}} become [...] "household names {{thanks to the}} [...] {{enormous}} popularity... <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in 1994 who could have predicted that these characters would enter the lexicon of Disney's most popular creations?" [...] Scar {{is considered to be}} among Disney's greatest villains. Desmond Ryan of The Philadelphia Inquirer reviewed Scar as [...] "the most vivid villain in Disney features in generations." [...] On a broader scale, Scar is often revered {{as one of the greatest}} animated villains of all-time. Entertainment Weekly included the character in the article [...] "10 Over-the-top Animated Movie Villains", explaining, [...] "you could only expect over-the-top when you pair such a grasping, conniving character with Jeremy Irons' seductive voice." [...] Likewise, Digital Spys Alex Fletcher wrote of Scar in his article [...] "Who is Disney's greatest ever villain?" [...] that [...] "The scene in which he lets Mufasa... fall into a stampede of wildebeests left lasting emotional trauma on an entire generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Third Way {{contributor}} Graham Cray {{wrote that}} the song [...] " [...] more directly a culture which consists of a cacophony of voices and images but which has neither soul nor direction." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes noted that the lyrics were ambiguous in whether they took place in reality or fantasy, which he likened to the overarching theme of the album. Author David Kootnikoff believed that [...] "the pop melody conceals the lyric's dark theme about a victim of physical abuse who reasons her pain away with the line 'When he hurts you, you feel alive.'" [...] Mark Brown of The Orange County Register described it as [...] "the desperate tale of an abused woman with nowhere to go <b>but</b> <b>back</b> to her home." [...] He compared it to U2's 1987 song [...] "Running to Stand Still", saying [...] "That same sort of descriptive but distanced narrative is what made [...] so powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mostly positive {{responses from}} a number of critics. David Fricke of Rolling Stone assigned the track four out of five stars, deeming it [...] "just a bright, strident vocal and crisply strummed guitar. But when Armstrong’s bandmates fall in around him, Green Day sound the way you originally loved ’em, and refreshed: heavier and hardened from their time in the trenches <b>but</b> <b>back</b> in the garage, ready for rapture". Scott Shetler of PopCrush also rated the song four out of five stars and compared it to the song [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] from the album American Idiot, calling it [...] "a much shorter and slightly more accessible version" [...] of that song. He also added, [...] "That’s good news for Green Day fans and for those who miss rock music on Top 40 radio". However, the song did not receive an entirely positive response from NME, who stated, [...] "That crunchy guitar riff, that meandering melody, that by-the-numbers solo– it all comes off rather ‘meh’, rather safe, and rather middle-ground to these ears".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television critics. The Guardian published three separate reviews. Gareth McLean stated [...] "rare is the returning British drama {{that gets you}} giddy <b>but,</b> <b>back</b> for its seventh series and resolving last year's big cliffhanger, Spooks returns triumphant," [...] adding [...] "it's no secret that Ros is back, Adam is leaving and new boy Lucas North has been rescued from a Russian prison, but how it all plays out is a delight." [...] Vicky Frost from the media blog Organgrinder felt that although the storyline was decent, [...] "it did seem to be about three different episodes stuffed into one." [...] She also noted the it was generally [...] "ridiculous, but it isn't nearly as ridiculous - or ridiculously bad - as its spin-off [...] was." [...] Leigh Holmwood however, believed [...] "it was good to see the spy drama return for a seventh series with a high octane episode mixing Islamic terrorism and Russian counter espionage, {{even if it did}} overdo the 'for Queen and country' bit." [...] Holmwood also stated he was [...] "tempted to watch the second episode," [...] which was broadcast a day after the first episode on BBC One.|$|E
