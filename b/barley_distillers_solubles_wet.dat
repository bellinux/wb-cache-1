40|$|A {{feeding trial}} was {{conducted}} with 790 -lb yearling heifers fed an average of 121 days to evaluate replacing cracked corn and supplemental urea with wet distillers grains or condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles.</b> <b>Wet</b> <b>distillers</b> grains were evaluated at 16 %, 28 % and 40 % of diet dry matter. Condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles</b> were added at 6. 5 % of diet dry matter. Control diets were supplemented with urea {{or a combination of}} urea and soybean meal. Feeding 16 % wet distillers grains or condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles</b> increased gain of heifers compared with those fed the control urea diet. Increasing the amount of wet distillers grains tended to decrease feed intake and reduce gain. The calculated apparent net energy based on gain of the heifers was greatest for the heifers fed 16 % wet distillers grains. The apparent energy of the wet distillers grains declined as the quantity fed was increased. The calculated net energy values were 1. 09 and 1. 35 Mcal/lb of dry matter for the average of the three concentrations of wet distillers grains and condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles.</b> These results confirm the high energy values of wet distillers grains relative to cracked corn as observed in a previous steer feeding trial...|$|R

Experiment 2 evaluated isolating the protein from distillers grains using a feedstuff from the wet milling ethanol industry to determine the impacts of protein on the feeding value of WDGS in finishing performance of cattle. Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated the effects of protein from distillers grains with the diets used in Exp. 2 on site of digestion, ruminal VFA concentration and pH. In Exp. 1, replicating <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles</b> with proportions of high-protein distiller grains, corn bran, and condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles</b> {{did not result in}} similar performance as cattle fed <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles.</b> Cattle consuming the CaO treated corn stover and byproducts were less efficient than cattle fed the composite with corn bran.

40|$|In 2008, the dry-grind ethanol {{industry}} produced 23 {{million metric}} tons of dried <b>distillers</b> grains with <b>solubles</b> (DDGS). Currently DDGS is sold as a feedstock but due to its quality and handling issues, competing with other feed products is challenging. Pellet mills {{have been used in}} the past to enhance DDGS handling and prevent particle segregation during transportation. The current drawback to pelleting DDGS is the high capital and maintenance costs. Instead of using expensive pellet mills, the use of wet granulation has been proposed to enhance DDGS densification and handling while minimizing costs. ^ A lab scale drum granulation process was used to manufacture granules of DDGS by adding condensed <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles</b> (CDS) to <b>wet</b> <b>distillers</b> grains (WDG) under varying formulation and process conditions. A full factorial experimental design was used to test all combinations of factor levels which included CDS binder addition (30, 35, and 40 % (wt/wt)), CDS solids content (22 and 38 %, wet basis), screen size opening (3. 175 and 6. 35 mm), and residence time (1, 2. 5, 5, and 10 min). Measured response variables included mean particle size, bulk density, true density, granule yield (3. 35 - 1. 68 mm), and porosity. Results from the experiment indicated that as binder addition increased between 30, 35, and 40 % mean particle size of the final granules increased to 2. 08, 3. 15, and 4. 45 mm, respectively. As binder solids content increased, the bulk density increased due to the increased amount of dry matter in the final granular product. Porosity decreased as solids content increased mainly due to greater shrinkage of the granules during the drying process. Screen size opening also affected nucleation which influenced the final size and yield of the granules produced. Compression testing of wet granule compacts indicated that increasing CDS binder addition and increasing solids content enhanced granule plasticity. Growth was observed for granules prepared from high binder additions, and low solids content while minimal growth occurred for material prepared from the high solids content CDS. The highest granular yields (~ 80 %) were observed at residence times between 2. 5 and 10 minutes with 35 % binder addition using the high solids content CDS and the small screen size opening. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{supply of}} corn milling co-products from ethanol {{production}} has increased rapidly {{over the last}} several years. Based on United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) projections of corn ground for ethanol production, approximately 38 million tons of distillers grains would have been produced in the 2009 - 10 marketing year, with 40 million tons projected for the 2010 - 11 marketing year. While supply has grown, so too has demand from both domestic and international users. Cattle feeders in particular have found <b>wet</b> <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles</b> (WDGS), modified <b>wet</b> <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles</b> (MWDGS) and dried <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles</b> (DDGS) to be excellent feedstuffs that can lower cost of gain through performance efficiencies and lower ingredient costs.

DDGS flowability problems often create nuisance in storage and transportation.

Finishing diets containing DGS to supply up to 8 % of diet DM as fat may be fed without depressing cattle performance. However, feeding diets containing 8 % diet fat with corn oil depresses cattle performance. The difference in rumen metabolism {{of these two}} fats is due to physical protection of DGS fat from interaction with rumen microbes.

40|$|Integrating {{crop and}} {{livestock}} systems leads to opportunities to utilize land resources; however, crop producers focus on grain yields and ground cover, while livestock producers see opportunity to graze corn residue or annual forages. After wheat harvest or corn silage harvest, above ground forage production for brassica mixes and oats {{is greater than}} forage oats or oat production after high moisture corn harvest. Grazing steers on forage crops after grain harvest provides moderate gains. While annual forages provide good quality forages, corn residue grazing and utilization is still a cost-effective feedstuff for cattle producers. In the short term, grain yields do not differ for treatments that were baled, grazed, or not baled or grazed. Residue ground cover after grazing is greater than after baling. An alternative way to utilize the baled corn residue is treating corn residue with CaO; however, the energy value needs to be improved, so addition of components such as <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles</b> or crude glycerin could apply. Treating corn residue with CaO and utilizing <b>distillers</b> <b>solubles,</b> crude glycerin, and treated corn residue {{as a replacement for}} distillers grains in a brome hay diet reduced steer ADG. Combining protein, solubles and glycerin components with treated corn stover does not provide the same performance response as modified <b>distillers</b> grains plus <b>solubles.</b> Finding ways to integrate livestock and crop production is a way to become better stewards of the resources available.
