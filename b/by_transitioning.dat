25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated <b>by</b> <b>transitioning</b> instead to 100% renewable energy. Research that has been published in Energy Policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support. It would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldn't utilize bioenergy. Other changes involve use of electric cars {{and the development of}} enhanced transmission grids and storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{first country}} to propose 100% {{renewable}} energy was Iceland, in 1998. Proposals {{have been made}} for Japan in 2003, and for Australia in 2011. Albania, Iceland, and Paraguay obtain essentially all of their electricity from renewable sources (Albania and Paraguay 100% from hydroelectricity, Iceland 72% hydro and 28% geothermal). Norway obtains nearly all of its electricity from renewable sources (97 percent from hydropower). Iceland proposed using hydrogen for transportation and its fishing fleet. Australia proposed biofuel for those elements of transportation not easily converted to electricity. The road map for the United States, commitment by Denmark, and Vision 2050 for Europe set a 2050 timeline for converting to 100% renewable energy, later reduced to 2040 in 2011. Zero Carbon Britain 2030 proposes eliminating carbon emissions in Britain by 2030 <b>by</b> <b>transitioning</b> to renewable energy. In 2015, Hawaii enacted a law that the Renewable Portfolio Standard shall be 100 percent by 2045. This is often confused with renewable energy. If electricity produced on the grid is 65 GWh from fossil fuel and 35 GWh from renewable energy and rooftop off grid solar produces 80 GWh of renewable energy then the total renewable energy is 115 GWh and the total electricity on the grid is 100 GWh. Then the RPS is 115 percent.|$|E

500|$|Iwata {{helped lead}} a {{revitalization}} of Nintendo's handheld business <b>by</b> <b>transitioning</b> {{the company from}} the Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS, which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games. The idea for using two screens on a single device originated with Yamauchi before his retirement, while Miyamoto suggested {{the use of a}} touchscreen. Miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of the device and its prototypes. The Nintendo DS proved to be a highly profitable system and {{went on to become the}} second-best selling video game console of all time with more than 154million units, inclusive of subsequent iterations, sold by September2014. In June2004, [...] Iwata sought a conference with Dr. Ryuta Kawashima about a game that could appeal to non-gamers. This project would later become , released in May2005. Iwata personally oversaw development of the Brain Age series, even foregoing a public appearance on the day of the Nintendo DS's release in Japan on December2. Miyamoto supported Iwata's work with the series and sent one of his protégés, Kouichi Kawamoto, to help develop the game. The Brain Age series is partially credited with launching the popularity of the Nintendo DS, and the series as a whole sold over 30million copies by December2008.|$|E
500|$|Domingo Faustino Sarmiento {{served as}} President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868–1874, {{becoming}} president despite the maneuverings {{of his predecessor}} Bartolomé Mitre. [...] According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency [...] "marks {{the advent of the}} middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation. [...] The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun." [...] Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone, not just the few. Sarmiento's tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found New England, specifically the Boston-Cambridge area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was [...] "the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America." [...] He described Boston as [...] "The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient Puritans ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which in the future will supplant her." [...] Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones <b>by</b> <b>transitioning</b> Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.|$|E

On the July 26 edition of sports writer Chris Featherstone's Pancakes and Powerslams podcast, Aldis cited the lack of financial compensation and creative challenge GFW would offer him as his reasons for not signing.

2500|$|Season three saw the {{directing}} {{debut of}} one of the show’s developers, Miles Millar, who got to direct the episode [...] "Memoria". Welling describes Millar’s style as very succinct, to which he credits to Millar’s background of writing for all of the characters on the show. As Welling explains, Millar managed to capture the same effect as other directors, but with fewer words. Millar’s visual style, at least for this episode, tended to lean more to applying [...] "extreme lighting" [...] to the scenes, to create silhouettes of the characters. Miles Millar was inspired by the film Kings Row when he filmed the scene for Lex’s birthday party as a child. In the scene, a camera pulls back from a flashback transition to reveal a young Lex sitting alone at a large table full of food and gifts. Instead of using the same techniques that were employed in previous episodes for transitioning between the present and the past, Millar decided to shift between the two time frames <b>by</b> <b>transitioning</b> between the older Lex and the younger Lex. This required Rosenbaum to rely more on Millar’s direction, so that the emotional level was matched between himself and the young actor portraying Lex, Wayne Dalglish. One particular scene seemed to provide Millar with the most trouble, mainly because of the constraints of the film division at Warner Bros. In the scene, Jor-El and Lara are placing the infant Kal-El into his spaceship during Krypton’s final moments. At the time, Warner Bros. was working on a new Superman film, and {{it was going to be}} an origin story. This affected how much Smallville could actually show. The film department prohibited Millar from showing Krypton, or Jor-El and Lara. As a result, Millar took inspiration from a comic book written by Jeph Loeb. In Loeb’s book, Jor-El and Lara are depicted as just a pair of hands holding on to each other after they place Kal-El into his spaceship.|$|E
