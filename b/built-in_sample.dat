50|$|In 2005, Guitar Center {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Simmons trademark and began marketing affordable Chinese-manufactured electronic drums (commercialized under other names in the world) under the Simmons name and original logo.

50|$|Version 2.0 of the {{software}} adds MIDI recording capabilities with a simple sequencer {{and is able to}} map the keys of a MIDI instrument to any tuning in tandem with the <b>built-in</b> microtonal <b>sampler.</b> This also opens up {{the software}} to use as a microtonal instrument.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{computer}} memory-based samplers, musicians used tape replay keyboards, which store recordings on analog tape. When a key is pressed the tape head contacts the moving tape and plays a sound. The Mellotron {{was the most}} notable model, used {{by a number of}} groups in the late 1960s and the 1970s, but such systems were expensive and heavy due to the multiple tape mechanisms involved, and the range of the instrument was limited to three octaves at the most. To change sounds a new set of tapes had to be installed in the instrument. The emergence of the digital sampler made sampling far more practical. Bruce Haack built a digital sampler which he demonstrated on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood in 1967. The home made synthesizer device included a <b>built-in</b> <b>sampler</b> which recorded, stored, played back and looped sounds controlled by switches, light sensors and human skin contact.|$|R
40|$|Version 2. 11 - Time Warp' 3 rd Nov, 2016 (view commits) This {{release is}} {{the biggest and most}} adventurous release yet. There are as many (invisible) {{modifications}} and improvements to the internal systems as there are new external features that you can see and play with. The aim was to create a solid foundation for new and exciting features both in this release and in preparation for future releases. We also open our arms to welcome two new Core Team members - Luis Lloret and Adrian Cheater. Both have made generous and substantial contributions to this release. Thank-you. Sadly we also say farewell to Jeremy Weatherford. Please extend your kind thoughts and gratitude to Jeremy for all of his contributions - in particular for turning the Windows release from a possibility into a reality. Luckily Luis has kindly stepped in to maintain the Windows installer. The main visible feature is the new scope visualisers. The overall audio output can now be visually monitored by one of three wave form visualisers. Firstly there is the individual left and right channels, next is a single mono scope which is mixed down from the stereo channels using RMS and finally there is a Lissajous scope which displays phase differences between the left and right channels. Typically the mono output will be most useful. Use the preferences pane to hide and show each of these scopes. All of them may be viewed at the same time if necessary. Thanks to Adrian Cheater for the core work behind this feature. We now have support for multi-channel input (up to 16 channels) via the new sound_in* synths for systems that have audio in. This opens up the possibility to use Sonic Pi as an FX unit for vocals, guitars and any other audio source. Another exciting new feature is the sample opt onset: - which lets you play a specific percussive part of a sample. This uses an automatic onset detection algorithm to determine all the points in the sample that go from quiet to loud quickly such as a drum, synth or bass hit. For example, this allows you to take a complex drum sample and trigger each of the individual drums in your own order and to your own timing. Finally, translations are now crowd-sourced and small or large contributions for any language can be made here: [URL] If your language isn't yet available or you would like to improve things, please join in the effort. Thanks to Hanno Zulla for making this possible. Breaking Changes sample now supports the opt path: which enables the sample's path to be overridden. use_sample_pack is now deprecated and no longer available. Consider using the new filter system. See documentation for sample for more details. current_sample_pack is now deprecated and no longer available. inspect has been removed. (Standard printing now calls Object#inspect by default) load_sample now only loads the first matched sample. load_samples now loads all matched samples. Remove SuperCollider server automatic reboot system as it was badly conflicting with machines that went into a 'sleep state' (for example, when a laptop is closed). The fn reboot is still supported and may still be triggered manually if required. Calls to play, synth and sample now consume all their arguments before testing to see if the synth should be triggered. This ensures all declared rands are consumed. This change might therefore potentially modify your random stream consumption. Consider using rand_back or rand_skip to re-align the stream if necessary. New threads now start with a fresh set of tick counters and a new random stream. It is no longer possible to use lambdas as values for synth defaults. This is because synth defaults are shared across thread boundaries and there is now a new safety system that only allows immutable/serialisable values to be used. Unfortunately Ruby has no notion of a 'pure' function and each lambda captures over its environment and therefore may contain free variables pointing to mutable data. A replacement system for describing a simple set of pure functions is being designed. New Fns reset - resets the user's thread locals (such as ticks and rand stream index) to the snapshot of the state as recorded {{at the start of the}} current thread. clear - clears all the user's thread locals to a blank state. time_warp- allows whole blocks of code to be shifted forward or backwards in time up to the value of current_sched_ahead_time. rand_look - generate a random number without consuming a rand by looking ahead in the random stream. rand_i_look - generate a random integer without consuming a rand by looking ahead in the random stream. run_file - Runs the contents of file at path as if it was in the current buffer. run_code - Runs the contents of the specified string as if it was in the current buffer. Numeric#clamp - max and minimum bound (will clamp self to a value = - 1 *other set_recording_bit_depth! - set the bit depth for WAV files generated by recording the audio. Default is 16 bits, and can now be set to one of 8, 16, 24 and 32. Larger bit depths will result in better quality audio files but also much larger file sizes for the same duration. scsynth_info - obtain information about the running audio synthesis server SuperCollider such as the number of available busses and buffers. Synths & FX New synth :tech_saws - an implementation of a slightly modified supersaw. New synth :sound_in - reads audio from the sound card. New synth :sound_in_stereo - reads audio from the sound card. All FX now have a pre_mix: opt. This allows the audio flow to completely bypass a given FX (unlike mix: which passes the audio through the FX but modifies the amplitude afterwards). Teach control to manipulate the last triggered synth by default. For example, control amp: 3 will set the amp: opt of the last triggered synth to 3. However, control foo, amp: 3 will still specifically control synth foo. Samples New opt slice: - lets you play a specific slice of a sample. The default number of slices is 16 which may be changed with the num_slices: opt. Sample is divided equally into the number of slices without regard for audio content and onset points. The slice: opt also works with pick for triggering random sample slices: sample :loop_amen, slice: pick. New opt onset: - lets you play a specific percussive part of a sample. Uses automatic onset detection to determine the points in the sample that go from quiet to loud quickly. Unlike slice:, onset: does not necessarily divide a sample into equal onsets - some onsets will be smaller or bigger than others and the number of onsets is determined by the algorithm and isn't known in advance. GUI New scope visualisers. Allow files to be dragged from the OS into the text area. This inserts the file/folder name as a string. GUI now remembers the last directory you saved or opened a file to/from as the default location for next time. Swap align button for a scope button. Given that alignment now happens automatically, a specific button seems somewhat redundant. Instead we now have a button for toggling the visibility of the scope(s). Loading multiple samples simultaneously is now much faster. Preferences have been slightly re-organised. Preferences now has a Master volume slider which controls Sonic Pi's audio amplitude independently from the system volume. All buttons now display status message + shortcut where available. Enable app transparency slider for Windows. Dark and light theme colours have been slightly polished and unified to use the same logic. On multi-screen systems, fullscreen mode now defaults to the app's current screen. Documentation Translations are now crowd-sourced. See: [URL] Improve docstring for live_loop. Add 3 new MagPi articles on amplitude modulation, performance and practice techniques. Add missing pulse_width: opt to flanger FX doc. Improvements Improve log messages written to ~/. sonic-pi/log Improve booting on Mac in the case that the audio card's rate can't be determined. Massively improve boot stability on Windows. Improve error message for play_chord when notes isn't list like. The number of samples that may be loaded at any one time has been increased from 1000 to 4000. However, memory limitations still apply (4000 1 MB samples will require 4000 MB of free system memory) pick now returns a lambda if no list is given as the first argument (which makes it useful for using with sample's onset: and slice: opts. Audio server is now paused when app is not in use - reducing CPU load and battery consumption. Error messages now report names matching the editor tabs such as buffer 0. Bugfixes Decrease duration of :loop_tabla so that it correctly loops. (Length reduced to 10. 674 seconds). Enforce UTF- 8 encoding of all incoming text. Fix :reverb FX's mix: opt to ensure it's in the range 0 to 1. sample nil now no longer plays a sample - it was incorrectly defaulting to the first <b>built-in</b> <b>sample</b> (:ambi_choir) pick's skip: opt now works as expected: pick(5). drop(1) == pick(5, skip: 1) sample now prints a 'no sample found' message with both sample nil and sample [] rather than incorrectly playing the first built-in wav file. Limit :piano synth to notes less than 231 as higher values crash the audio server...|$|E

5000|$|Zone Intelligence {{allows for}} up to three samples to be {{assigned}} to different positional locations on a pad for a more realistic sound. With pad layering, up to nine different samples can be triggered via different strike velocities and positions, selecting samples from a 3 by 3 matrix. The samples can also be further manipulated by applying positive or negative values on a matrix (routed to both position and dynamic), simultaneously affecting the following aspects of the sound: volume, pitch, brightness, panning, noise element, and sample start point. All or any of these aspects of the sound, are both programmable and continuously variable dependent upon strike position and strike velocity and were user programmable in the extreme.The SDX is the first Simmons kit since the SDS-7 to support cymbal sounds, using pads called [...] "Symbals" [...] which simulate the swaying motion of real cymbals with a swivel rod. The SDX include a <b>built-in</b> <b>sampler</b> with a floppy disk drive, internal SCSI hard disk drive and optional external SCSI ZIP or Syquest drives as the methods of data storage. The SDX introduced a new way of modifying sounds. Rather than knobs and switches, it features a 9" [...] monochrome CRT screen with a GUI controlled by a trackball, similar to the early Mac OS. SDX OS allows users to fully modify sounds with an easy-to-use interface. It also features a full 64-track real-time sequencer with the ability to nondestructively quantize recordings and sync them to MIDI.|$|R
40|$|A {{broadband}} optical reflectometer with <b>built-in</b> thermal <b>sample</b> {{control was}} developed to study the linear properties of planar silica-gallium interfaces in the continuous range from 450 nm to 1650 nm with increasing and decreasing temperature in the range 12 °C to 36 °C, across the solid to melt phase transition. Transient pump-probe reflectivity measurements revealed the dynamics of a silica-gallium interface reflectivity change in the visible part of the spectrum for the first time. Reflectivity rise times of a few ps were observed and the accumulative nature of the reflectivity change with pump energy was seen. Recovery times of 1. 2 µs just below melting were recorded for pump pulse duration of 0. 4 µs. Thermal and non-thermal mechanisms of the reflectivity change have been identified and related to {{the properties of the}} interface...|$|R
50|$|For his CD PERFECT GENTLEMAN (2004) Randy {{amassed a}} {{collection}} of cheap yard-sale organs. He used their <b>built-in</b> drum <b>samples</b> to create rhythm tracks; he then utilized these rock, jazz, waltz, swing, bossa nova, dixie, cha-cha, and rhumba beats to fashion songs ranging from simply-structured folk and country ballads to torch songs, lampoons, spirituals, and satires. By editing, manipulating, and overlapping the beats from these various 1970s organs Randy transformed the crude and kitschy samples into more polished and developed sounds. At times, though, he just placed a sound 'as is' into a new context. The characters who inhabit these songs often seek to gain mastery over their chronic pathologies, {{or at least to}} acknowledge them. These characters include an anti-prophet who asks only that he be given as big a funeral as Jesus and Moses, an overweight middle-aged man who carries around a picture of his shirtless teen-aged self in order to lure women, and the ghosts of Edith Wharton and Alexander Hamilton.|$|R
40|$|A small, lightweight, {{portable}} apparatus {{based on}} an electrochemical sensing principle has been developed for monitoring low concentrations of ethylene in air. Ethylene {{has long been known}} to be produced by plants and to stimulate the growth and other aspects of the development of plants (including, notably, ripening of fruits and vegetables), even at concentrations as low as tens of parts per billion (ppb). The effects are magnified in plant-growth and -storage chambers wherein ethylene can accumulate. There is increasing recognition in agriculture and related industries that it is desirable to monitor and control ethylene concentrations in order to optimize the growth, storage, and ripening of plant products. Hence, there are numerous potential uses for the present apparatus in conjunction with equipment for controlling ethylene concentrations. The ethylene sensor is of a thick-film type with a design optimized for a low detection limit. The sensor includes a noble metal sensing electrode on a chip and a hydrated solid-electrolyte membrane that is held in contact with the chip. Also located on the sensor chip are a counter electrode and a reference electrode. The sensing electrode is held at a fixed potential versus the reference electrode. Detection takes place at active-triple-point areas where the sensing electrode, electrolyte, and sample gas meet. These areas are formed by cutting openings in the electrolyte membrane. The electrode current generated from electrochemical oxidation of ethylene at the active triple points is proportional to the concentration of ethylene. An additional film of the solid-electrolyte membrane material is deposited on the sensing electrode to increase the effective triple-point areas and thereby enhance the detection signal. The sensor chip is placed in a holder that is part of a polycarbonate housing. When fully assembled, the housing holds the solid-electrolyte membrane in contact with the chip (see figure). The housing includes a water reservoir for keeping the solid-electrolyte membrane hydrated. The housing also includes flow channels for circulating a sample stream of air over the chip: ethylene is brought to the sensing surface predominately by convection in this sample stream. The sample stream is generated by a <b>built-in</b> <b>sampling</b> pump. The forced circulation of sample air contributes to the attainment of a low detection limit...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} noniterative {{sampling}} approach {{by combining the}} inverse Bayes formulae (IBF), sampling/importance resampling and posterior mode estimates from the Expectation/Maximization (EM) algorithm to obtain an i. i. d. sample approximately from the posterior distribution for problems where the EM-type algorithms apply. The IBF shows that the posterior {{is proportional to the}} ratio of two conditional distributions and its numerator provides a natural class of <b>built-in</b> importance <b>sampling</b> functions (ISFs) directly from the model specification. Given that the posterior mode by an EM-type algorithm is relatively easy to obtain, a best ISF can be identified by using that posterior mode, which results in a large overlap area under the target density and the ISF. We show why this procedure works theoretically. Therefore, the proposed method provides a novel alternative to perfect sampling and eliminates the convergence problems of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We first illustrate the method with a proof-of-principle example and then apply the method to hierarchical (or mixed-effects) models for longitudinal data. We conclude with a discussion. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
50|$|With the {{financial}} {{benefit of the}} royalties that came from working with these other synthesizer manufacturers, E-mu designed the Audity, their first non-modular synthesizer, showing it at the 1980 AES Convention. With a price of $69,200 (over $200,000 in 2009 terms when adjusted for inflation), only one machine was ever produced. At that same convention, Wedge and Rossum saw the Fairlight CMI and the Linn LM-1. Recognizing the trend of digital samplers, they realized that E-mu had the technology to bring a lower-priced sampler to market. The Emulator debuted in 1981 at a list price of $7,900, significantly less than the $30,000 Fairlight. Following the Emulator, E-mu released the first programmable drum machine with <b>samples</b> <b>built-in</b> priced below $1,000, the E-mu Drumulator. The Drumulator's success {{was followed by the}} Emulator II and III, the SP-12 drum sampler, and the Emax series of samplers.|$|R
