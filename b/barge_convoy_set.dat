50|$|Between 29 August and 4 September, various Japanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol {{boats were}} able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, {{including}} most of the 35th Infantry Brigade, much of the Aoba (4th) Regiment, {{and the rest of}} Ichiki's regiment. General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on 31 August Express run, was placed in command of all Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. A <b>barge</b> <b>convoy</b> took another 1,000 soldiers of Kawaguchi's brigade, under the command of Colonel Akinosuke Oka, to Kamimbo, west of the Lunga perimeter.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{continued}} to experience problems in delivering sufficient supplies {{to sustain their}} troops on Guadalcanal. Attempts to use only submarines {{the last two weeks}} in November failed to provide sufficient food for Hyakutake's forces. A separate attempt to establish bases in the central Solomons to facilitate <b>barge</b> <b>convoys</b> to Guadalcanal also failed because of destructive Allied air attacks. On 26 November, the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced a food crisis. Some front-line units had not been resupplied for six days and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations. The situation forced the Japanese to return to using destroyers to deliver the necessary supplies.|$|R
40|$|The {{peculiarities of}} the European inland {{waterway}} transport are analyzed, and a novel design of a pushboat for <b>barges</b> <b>convoys</b> is proposed and optimized for the Rhine-Danube corridor. To this aim, a hybrid parallel electric propulsion system is adopted with the perspective to define an eco–friendly vessel. The present work is to be intended as the early-stage in the proof-of-concept (POC) for commercial technologies useful for the electrification of pushboats employed in inland waterway navigation. Specifically, the optimal design solution is highlighted by evaluating of proper attribute weights, which determine the degree of closeness among possible solution and the design target. In particular, CASM methodology to minimize CAPEX and OPEX of a pushboat is adopted...|$|R

Four or five of the barges may have been sunk.The attack {{seems to have been}} due to suspicions that some of the barges carried weapons.

500|$|In {{spite of}} the successes of the {{destroyer}} runs, Kawaguchi insisted that as many soldiers of his brigade as possible be delivered to Guadalcanal by slow <b>barges.</b> Therefore, a <b>convoy</b> carrying 1,100 of Kawaguchi's troops and heavy equipment in 61 barges, mainly from the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry Regiment {{under the command of}} Colonel Akinosuka Oka, departed the northern coast of Santa Isabel Island on 2 September. On 4–5 September, aircraft from Henderson Field attacked the <b>barge</b> <b>convoy,</b> killing about 90 of the soldiers in the barges and destroying much of the unit's heavy equipment. Most of the remaining 1,000 troops were able to land near Kamimbo (...) , west of the Lunga perimeter over the next few days. By 7 September, Kawaguchi had 5,200 troops at Taivu Point and 1,000 west of the Lunga perimeter. Kawaguchi was confident enough that he could defeat the Allied forces facing him that he declined an offer from the 17th Army for delivery of one more infantry battalion to augment his forces. Kawaguchi believed that there were only about 2,000 U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal.|$|R

40|$|The real lock {{operations}} with ships and <b>barge</b> <b>convoys</b> areconsidered {{dependent on the}} transport technologies applied, ormore precisely, the kinds of ships/convoys requiring thelockage. The fleet can be divided as follows: (1) groups of singleships, (2) pushed and pulled tows of barges and (3) differentcombinations of previous systems (1) and (2). The groups ofships and tows passing through the lock have extremely stochasticcharacteristics thus forming various arrivals and setvicetime patterns. It means that uniform navigation or strongscheduling between locks and lock operations are not possibleeven though highly sophisticated equipment is at disposal. Therefore, in this paper an analytical method was developedusing bulk queuing systems for the analysis and planning oflock requirements supporting it with numerical example. Thedeveloped methodology {{can be applied to}} determine the meanqueue length of ships - convoys at lock anchorage, withoutblocking behaviour between upstream and downstream navigationfor single-lane traffic...|$|R

40|$|A {{modal shift}} from road {{transport}} towards inland water or rail transport {{could reduce the}} total Green House Gas emissions and societal impact associated with Municipal Solid Waste management. However, this shift will take place only if demonstrated {{to be at least}} cost-neutral for the decision makers. In this paper we examine the feasibility of using multimodal truck and inland water transport, instead of truck transport, for shipping separated household waste in bulk from collection centres to waste treatment facilities. We present a dynamic tactical planning model that minimises the sum of transportation costs, external environmental and societal costs. The Municipal Solid Waste Service Network Design Problem allocates Municipal Solid Waste volumes to transport modes and determines transportation frequencies over a planning horizon. This generic model is applied to a real-life case in Flanders, the northern region of Belgium. Computational results show that multimodal truck and inland water transportation can compete with truck transport by avoiding or reducing transhipments and using <b>barge</b> <b>convoys...</b>|$|R
