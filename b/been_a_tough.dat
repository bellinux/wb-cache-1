5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton {{said it had}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> {{race for}} him because his car did not feel {{as good as he}} hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E

25|$|Each native LDL {{particle}} enables emulsification, i.e. surrounding/packaging all {{fatty acids}} being carried, enabling these fats {{to move around}} the body within the water outside cells. Each particle contains a single apolipoprotein B-100 molecule (Apo B-100, a protein that has 4536 amino acid residues and a mass of 514 kDa), along with 80 to 100 additional ancillary proteins. Each LDL has a highly hydrophobic core consisting of polyunsaturated fatty acid known as linoleate and hundreds to thousands (about 1500 commonly cited as an average) esterified and unesterified cholesterol molecules. This core also carries varying numbers of triglycerides and other fats and {{is surrounded by a}} shell of phospholipids and unesterified cholesterol, as well as the single copy of Apo B-100. LDL particles are approximately 22nm (0.00000087in.) to 27.5nm in diameter and have a mass of about 3 million daltons. Since LDL particles contain a variable and changing number of fatty acid molecules, there is a distribution of LDL particle mass and size. Determining the structure of LDL has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> task because of its heterogeneous structure. The structure of LDL at human body temperature in native condition, with a resolution of about 16 Angstroms using cryo-electron microscopy, has been recently described.|$|E
500|$|During {{the podium}} {{interviews}} conducted by Jackie Stewart, Lewis Hamilton conceded it had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> race, saying: [...] "The Ferraris {{gave us a}} real good run for our money and out there it was really difficult {{to look after the}} tyres in these conditions, behind backmarkers and all sorts, but fortunately I was able to keep the car together, keep the tyres as healthy as possible and pull it through." [...] Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment with not being able to win, but said he was [...] "very happy how the team is working" [...] and highlighted the big step forward Ferrari had made over the winter. Nico Rosberg was disappointed about the brake failure costing him second place, but added that he was very happy with the car altogether.|$|E
500|$|Cuomo {{was embarrassed}} by Pinkerton's {{reception}} and the confessional {{nature of its}} songs. In August 1997, he wrote: [...] "This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> year. It's not just {{that the world has}} said Pinkerton isn't worth a shit, but that the Blue album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the [...] video. I'm a shitty songwriter." [...] In 2001, he told Entertainment Weekly: [...] "It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front {{of hundreds of thousands of}} people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|Swift has {{performed}} the track on the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift {{has performed}} the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief. Swift's first televised performance of [...] "Change" [...] {{was at the}} 2010 Academy of Country Music Awards, where she, donning a sparkly evening gown, sang on an elevator suspended from the crowd. She then came down, where she was joined by a teenage choir, and finished the performance by surfing the crowd. Swift performed [...] "Change" [...] on the first North American leg of the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a sparkly silver and black dress with black, leather boots. She noted, [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> year", and commenced singing throughout the stage as images of victims of economic and natural disasters were projected on the video screens. As the song approximated, its last refrain, she said, [...] "Things turn back around." [...] Then, scenes of triumph appeared on the video screens. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter attended the May 22, 2009 concert in Los Angeles, California at the Staples Center and commented, [...] "It was overly simplistic and a bit naive, but still {{hard not to be}} moved." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times said Swift offered the audience with optimistic thinking with the performance in the August 27, 2009 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar scored his 100th {{international}} hundred on 16 March 2012, at Mirpur against Bangladesh in the Asia Cup. He {{became the}} first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first ODI hundred against Bangladesh. He said [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> phase for me... I was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever I went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. Nobody talked about my 99hundreds. It became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99hundreds." [...] Despite Tendulkar's century, India failed to win the match against Bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.|$|E

Bush told reporters: First of all, the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision. Secondly, I haven't {{spent a lot of time}} talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor. I didn't ask them during the time and I haven't asked them since. I'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person, and I've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said, I did it. Would we have had this, you know, endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter? But it's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> issue for a lot of people in the White House, and it's run its course and now we're going to move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Project {{costs were}} between US$1.2 and $1.3 million, necessitating ABC's {{financial}} support (and with it, their demand of a safety harness). [...] "I'd dare say that {{never in the}} history of the circus industry has there been one event that costs this much," [...] said Wallenda. [...] The production was a serious financial strain on Wallenda. [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> situation all around", he said a week before the event, blaming the lingering fight over the safety harness for inhibiting sponsorship deals. [...] When production costs ran over the original estimate of $1 million, he appealed to the public for help using the fundraising website Indiegogo. [...] He eventually met his goal of $50,000. [...] Additionally, Niagara Falls, Ontario, mayor Jim Diodati asked local businesses to chip in, saying he hoped to raise $250,000. [...] Ultimately, he helped generate about $200,000 of support from local business associations. [...] The main causes of the overrun were the need to produce two custom cables – one for the performance and a shorter one for practice – and the need to hire a new helicopter company to set up the cable at the last minute, after the original one discovered they did not hold the necessary licenses. [...] After the event, Wallenda said he had probably lost money on the event; however, he added, it was [...] "clearly worth it" [...] in the long term. [...] With all but one bill accounted for, Wallenda said he lost less than $50,000 on the event. [...] The fundraising, combined with several contractors lowering their bills, helped him get close to budget. [...] "I think people still have the impression that Nik Wallenda is going to walk away from this thing making millions of dollars, but that's not the case," [...] he commented.|$|E
