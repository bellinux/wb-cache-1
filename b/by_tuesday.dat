25|$|After {{returning}} from Quebec, Canada with a cargo of timber, the ship set sail from Limerick on Friday, 15 November 1850. On the ship {{at the time}} were 195 passengers and a crew of 21, including the captain John Wilson and first mate William Thompson. The ship sailed down the Shannon River and on the 17th, anchored at Carrigaholt for the night. On the 18th, the ship left the river and sailed past Loop Head into the Atlantic. After a full day of sailing, a fierce winter storm struck, blowing the ship back towards the Clare coast. The captain's attempts to steer the brig back up the Shannon were futile, as the gale had destroyed the sails and two of the three masts were lost. <b>By</b> <b>Tuesday</b> 19 November all attempts at keeping the ship away from the shore ended in failure and at around 11pm that night, she was blown into Kilkee Bay.|$|E
25|$|Haig's typed diary – {{probably}} {{based on}} notes prepared in April - describes Petain as “almost unbalanced and most anxious”, claiming that after attending a French Cabinet meeting in Paris, {{where he had}} been ordered to “cover Paris at all costs”, he threatened to retreat on Paris, leaving the British right flank uncovered. Tim Travers argues that Petain said at the meeting that he would only retreat on Paris if Haig retreated on the Channel Ports, and that Major-General Clive reported from the meeting that Petain had come away satisfied that Haig would not break contact. In a postwar exchange of letters with Haig Petain denied that he had ordered a retreat on Paris or had threatened Haig that he might, a recollection which Herbert Lawrence appears to have supported. Petain appears not to have discovered until 25 March that Michael was an all-out effort, but nonetheless was, according to other eyewitness accounts, in a state of despair <b>by</b> <b>Tuesday</b> 26 March. Sheffield's view is that Haig and Lawrence, on the long drive back to GHQ from their meeting with Petain may simply have misunderstood his intentions, and that any factual errors in Haig's diary for this period were honest if mistaken recollections.|$|E
25|$|On Monday, the Air National Guard {{and those}} at Keesler Air Force Base airlifted {{patients}} to Jackson and other more inland locations. Volunteers searched for those injured and dead, {{as well as}} helping refugees. When many of the evacuees returned <b>by</b> <b>Tuesday,</b> Governor John Bell Williams declared martial law, blocking highways into the area and leading to a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. The governor also opened Camp Shelby, dormitories within the University of Southern Mississippi, and the Robert E. Lee Hotel to serve as shelters for those who lost homes. Sections of Bay St. Louis and Pass Christian were evacuated. Survivors were found for days after the storm, with 35 trapped by high water north of Bay St. Louis rescued on Thursday. Army engineers disposed of 25 tons of dead animals, mostly cows, during the week following Camille. One week after the storm, Keesler-based air planes sprayed malathion at low altitudes to kill the thriving insect population. Martial law would be lifted on 27 August. The federal and state military presence would continue for several weeks. During the evening of 8 September, President Nixon visited the Biloxi-Gulfport Regional Airport and gave a speech to elevate the spirits of local residents struggling with the storm's aftermath. During the rebuilding process, stricter building codes were enforced by local governments. In 1973, hurricane hunters and their associated reconnaissance aircraft relocated to Keesler Air Force Base when their previous headquarters at Ramey, Puerto Rico, closed.|$|E

500|$|This storm became {{impressive}} {{as it moved}} into the Ohio Valley during the 13th. However, as additional energy moved into {{the eastern part of}} the country, a new area of low pressure developed near the North Carolina coast late on the 13th. This allowed mainly light snow to overspread the region from south to north during the early morning hours of the 13th. Low pressure developed in the southern Plains on Monday the 12th as a cold front pushed southward across the Northeast. [...] <b>By</b> <b>Tuesday</b> the 13th, the storm moved eastward across the lower Mississippi Valley while the cold front became stationary in the Carolinas. [...] On the night of the 13th, the primary low moved into the far eastern Ohio Valley while a secondary low developed on the stalled front in the Carolinas.
