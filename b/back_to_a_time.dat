In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths. However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'.|$|E

500|$|Morgan Jeffery of Digital Spy {{awarded the}} story {{four out of}} five stars, writing that it flowed better than Cross' last episode, [...] "The Rings of Akhaten", and allowed for the {{exploration}} of several themes. While he was positive towards the way the story was tied <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> traveller, he felt that the ending was [...] "perhaps less interesting than what's come before, simply because it feels more familiar", though it was still [...] "solid". IGN's Mark Snow gave the episode a score of 8.4 out of 10. He praised the smaller scope and focus on character, but wrote [...] "the left-field genre detour didn't completely convince, and felt jarringly underwhelming considering the spooky set-up, but at least it tried something unique". Jordan Farley of SFX gave [...] "Hide" [...] {{four out of five}} stars. Farley felt that the science fiction element left too many answers, but said that it excelled as a love story.|$|E

The lintel is both an intricate narrative of daily life in the palace, as well as a documentation of the 749 AD K'atun jubilee, which had been celebrated by Itzam K'an Ahk II. According to the artifact, the celebration was attended by many dignitaries, including local nobles such as a b'aah sajal named K'an Mo' Te' who had served K'inich Yo'nal Ahk II, as well as the [...] "interregnum" [...] ruler of Yaxchilan, Yopaat Bahlam II. According to Martin and Grube, the importance of Panel 3 is its relevance to Piedras Negras's history. At the time, the Maya center had fallen behind when compared to Yaxchilan. As such, K'inich Yat Ahk II's erection of the lintel seems to be an attempt by the ajaw to harken <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when Piedras Negras was in a position of superiority. To this day, many archaeologists and Mayanists consider Panel 3 to be a masterpiece of Maya art due to it elucidating the life of Itzam K'an Ahk II and his servants, as well as providing information regarding rare grammatical structures in the Mayan glyphs.|$|E

Lipshutz commented on the song's similarity to [...] "Tik Tok", writing, [...] "Instead of straying from the 'TiK ToK' formula, 'We R Who We R,' ... smartly maximizes [...] most appealing qualities."

[...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "companion piece" [...] to Pink's [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] citing their similar subject matter and close releases. Nitsuh Abebe from NY Magazine complimented the song's chorus and trance pop elements. Abebe wrote that the song embodied a [...] "hollowed-out, free-of-yourself feeling", commenting that almost all electronic dance music imbues feelings [...] "that are almost spiritual, that sense of being subsumed and out-of-body". Melinda Newman of HitFix called the song [...] "incredibly stupid, but it has the main ingredients to make it a global hit: an insistent beat and positive lyrics that promise to suspend time and keep us 'forever young,' or better yet, transport us <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when we felt like we were." [...] Newman referred to herself as one of the singer's biggest detractors, but wrote [...] "I like one of her songs--or at least begrudgingly admire its crass charms."

2500|$|By {{looking back}} to Book XV of Ovid's Metamorphoses, Shakespeare also gives a modern view (one that {{includes}} minutes) of an ancient view of time, one that provides a contrast to the more mechanized time of the 1590s.

2500|$|The {{statutes}} creating mechanic's liens usually {{give them}} a higher priority with respect to other interests in the title than the law gives most real property security interests. [...] Among other things, priority is the attribute that determines which of several competing security claims will have the first claim to the funds of a foreclosure sale. [...] In this context, the priority of a mechanic's lien is determined either {{by the time the}} lien attaches to the title to the property or by the point in time to which it [...] "relates back." [...] With some exceptions, the lien attaches or relates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> prior to the time that any notice of it appears in the public records. In many states, this is specified as the time when the first visible construction commences on the building site. [...] In others, it is when the contract is executed for the work to be done. [...] In still others, each contractor or supplier's lien attaches at the time when it commences its own work. [...] Therefore, persons dealing with the owner of the title to the property risk having their interests unexpectedly subject to mechanic's liens of which they had no knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|According {{to various}} authors, the 1959 and 1960 ICJ reports date <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when that {{organization}} {{was funded by}} the CIA. A. Tom Grunfeld asserts that the United States took advantage of the Dalai Lama's leaving Tibet by prodding its clandestinely funded Cold War International Commission of Jurists to prepare propagandistic reports attacking China. In his 1994 book The International Commission of Jurists, Global Advocates for Human Rights, Howard B. Tolley Jr. explains how the ICJ was created and bankrolled by the CIA from 1952 to 1967 as an instrument of the Cold War without most ICJ officers and members knowing about it. The connection between the CIA and the early ICJ is also mentioned by Dorothy Stein in her book People Who Count. Population and Politics, Women and Children, published in 1995. She accuses the Commission of growing out of a group created by American intelligence agents whose purpose was dissiminating anti-communist propaganda. This contrasts with the official overview of the International Commission of Jurists, which is [...] "dedicated to the primacy, coherence and implementation of international law and principles that advance human rights" [...] and the [...] "impartial, objective and authoritative legal approach to the protection and promotion of human rights through the rule of law" [...] while providing [...] "legal expertise at both the international and national levels to ensure that developments in international law adhere to human rights principles and that international standards are implemented at the national level." ...|$|E

Chris True from AllMusic had reviewed the album, and highlighted the song as an album standout. But {{as a separate}} rating, they gave the single three stars out of five. In the review of The Best of Kylie Minogue (2012), Tim Sendra highlighted it as an album standout. Hunter Felt from PopMatters gave it a positive review, stating [...] "something about Kylie’s innocent yet forceful vocals and the sheer catchiness of the song itself [...] So the song became a beloved secret, and I never bothered to try to tune my friends in on “I Could Be So Lucky”, or, crazier yet, proclaim that this “has-been” would be a critical and commercial darling {{in a few years}} time." [...] However, he did say the song was cliché. However, Mark Edwards from Stylus Magazine gave it a scathing remark by saying [...] "Listening to the first tracks on Ultimate Kylie, you want to skip straight through, because early songs like “I Should Be So Lucky” and “Locomotion” are unlistenable—horribly naff, squeaky songs" [...] and criticized Stock, Aitken and Waterman songs they produced in the 80's by stating [...] " [...] transport the listener <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when every single in the UK charts was either written by Stock, Aitken and Waterman or sung by an Aussie soap star, or both."
