Here we give evidence that the magnetic-based leaf patch clamp pressure (LPCP) probe is a non-invasive and online-measuring method that can elucidate short- and long-term temporal and spatial dynamics of leaf water status of trees with high precision in real time. Measurements were controlled remotely by telemetry and data transfer to the Internet. Concomitant measurements using the pressure chamber technique (frequently applied for leaf water status monitoring) showed that both techniques yield in principle the same results despite of the high sampling variability of the pressure chamber data. There {{was a very good}} correlation between the output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the <b>balancing</b> <b>pressure</b> values (on average r 2 Â =Â  0. 90 Â Â±Â  0. 05; nÂ =Â  8), i. e. the external pressure at which water appears at the cut end of a leaf under pressure chamber conditions. Simultaneously performed direct measurements of leaf cell turgor pressure using the well-established cell turgor pressure probe technique evidenced that both techniques measure relative changes in leaf turgor pressure. The output pressure signals of the LPCP probe and the <b>balancing</b> <b>pressure</b> values were inversely correlated to turgor pressure. Consistent with this, the <b>balancing</b> <b>pressure</b> values and the cell turgor pressure values could be fitted quite well by the same firm theoretical backing derived recently for the LPCP probe (Zimmermann et al., 2008).

The positioning of gate valves is carried out using optimization approaches to guarantee the network reliability that can be significantly reduced by WNP owing to the closure of several pipes by means of gate valves, decreasing topologic and energy redundancy. Anyway, starting from the optimal positioning of remote controlled gate valves, obtained with SWANP software, the paper investigates the effectiveness of dynamic control, in order to face hydraulic failure in fire estinguishment. The proposed methodology, based on heuristic optimization algorithm, finds the optimal layouts minimizing the number of valves to be opened and maximizing the system performance.

30|$|The {{formation}} of abnormally low-pressure hydrocarbon reservoirs in petroliferous basins has {{a close relationship}} with tectonic uplift and the consequent erosion. In order to understand abnormally low-pressure reservoirs and to provide a scientific basis for exploration and development, we established, through numerical simulation and theoretical analysis, a set of equations for the formation pressure in a closed system influenced by uplift-erosion, discussed the relationship between the genesis of abnormal pressure and uplift-erosion, and put forward the concept of <b>balance</b> <b>pressure</b> (Pb). The results showed that abnormally high pressure coefficient may form when the current formation pressure was higher than Pb, and abnormally low pressure may form when the current formation pressure was lower than Pb. In the Santanghu Basin, the current formation pressure of abnormally low pressure reservoirs is lower than Pb, so tectonic uplift-erosion leads to the decrease of the pressure coefficient. There is a positive correlation between the pressure drop caused by the decrease of fluid temperature and the rebound of rock porosity and strata erosion. Calculation results indicated that the reservoir pressure of Jurassic strata in the Santanghu Basin was decreased by 11.6 – 17.1 MPa due to tectonic uplift-erosion during the Late Yanshanian period.|$|E
