The script {{was written by}} Frank Quattrochi, a Hollywood screenwriter, and was originally set in the United States. Gordon sent it to his brother Richard, also a film producer. Richard enjoyed reading it, but had it re-written to be set in London. He would serve as producer on the film. Ian Curteis was hired to direct The Projected Man, which would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> theatrical film, as all of his previous work had been in television.

5|$|Gillan {{had been}} {{contacted}} by Episode Six's manager Gloria Bristow, {{who worked for}} Helmut Gordon, original manager of The Detours, later to become the Who. He replaced original lead singer Andy Ross, who left to get married, and joined keyboardist and singer Sheila Carter, guitarists Graham Carter and Tony Lander, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Harvey Shields. Gillan considers Episode Six to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> truly professional band, and in their early days were sponsored and championed by Tony Blackburn, who occasionally accompanied Gillan on stage. Later, as well as performing concerts in the UK, Episode Six also toured Germany and Beirut., and had regular appearances on the BBC Light Programme. During his time with Episode Six, Gillan began writing songs together with Glover, forming an ultimately long lasting partnership. After a strained tour of Beirut, Shields left the band and was replaced first by John Kerrison, then by Mick Underwood. Underwood had previously played in The Outlaws with Ritchie Blackmore, and it was via him that Ian was put in touch with to form Deep Purple in 1968. Gillan originally declined the position of lead singer in the band, though by 1969, after having released nine singles, none of which charted in the UK, and finding their style of music too restrictive for him, he decided to leave Episode Six.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Bachchan {{starred in}} Varma's Sarkar Raj, the romantic comedy Dostana, and the superhero film Drona. The {{following}} year, Bachchan produced and appeared in Paa (2009), a comedy-drama {{which won the}} National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. In the same year, he also starred in the Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra-directed satire Delhi-6 (2009). Bachchan then suffered a brief setback in his career as he starred in another series of films that performed poorly at the box-office, including Ratnam's drama Raavan (2010), and the action thriller Game (2011). His supporting role in the comedy Bol Bachchan (2012), opposite Ajay Devgan, proved to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> box-office success since Paa. He followed this with three more supporting appearances in commercially successful films: Dhoom 3 (2013), opposite Aamir Khan, the action heist comedy Happy New Year (2014), opposite Shah Rukh Khan., and the 2016 film Housefull 3 opposite Akshay Kumar.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{had made}} his {{first-class}} debut for Victoria before World War II as a specialist batsman not known for aggressive play. After the outbreak of war, Miller was deployed to England as a Royal Australian Air Force fighter pilot, flying in combat missions. While playing for military teams, he began to bowl more often, and was selected for Australian Services cricket team, a military outfit, {{to play in the}} Victory Tests against a full-strength England. During this series, Miller gained prominence with a series of hard-hitting displays and some rapid fast bowling against established Test batsmen such as Len Hutton. Miller topped the batting averages and took ten wickets and was hailed for his attacking play. He went on to make his Test debut in March 1946 in a one-off match against New Zealand, but this fixture was not given Test status until 1948. The 194647 Test series against the touring Englishmen would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> Ashes one, and Miller was expected to play a prominent role with both bat and ball, especially in countering the visitors' powerful batting.|$|E

5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E
5|$|Payne ran {{for reelection}} in 1876 but was {{defeated}} by Republican Amos Townsend. He remained involved in politics, however, and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1880. Tilden, while not officially a candidate, wielded a heavy influence over the convention. Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign, leading some delegates to defect to other candidates, while others stayed loyal to their old standard-bearer. Tilden did tell some of his close supporters that, {{if he did not}} run, Payne would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second. With that, many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne, at least until Tilden decided to enter the race. Although Tilden ultimately declined to be nominated, Payne's chances were hindered when Ohio's delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman. Although Payne place third on the convention's first ballot, on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock, who was nominated.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Brimsek {{finished first}} {{in the league in}} wins again and he was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team. This would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> of six berths to the NHL Second All-Star Team. The Bruins were eliminated in the playoffs by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, New York Rangers, in the semi-finals. In 1940–41, Brimsek backstopped the Bruins to their third consecutive first-place finish in the league. The Bruins made it to the 1941 Stanley Cup Finals and were matched up with the Red Wings. The Red Wings fell in four games in a best-of-seven series giving Brimsek his second and last Stanley Cup victory. For his efforts during the regular season, Brimsek was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team {{for the second year in}} a row. Continuing on the previous season's success, Brimsek won the Vezina Trophy and was named to the NHL First All-Star Team for the second time in his career. However, Brimsek's team could not replicate their playoff success as they were eliminated by the Red Wings in the semi-finals.|$|E
