5|$|After the WTO {{phased out}} {{quantitative}} quotas on textile in 2004 under the Agreement on Textile and Clothing(ATC). Egyptian textile and garment producers feared that their industry would be threatened <b>by</b> <b>global</b> competition from China and India. The flood of similar articles {{from these two}} nations to the United States could edge out Egyptian exports, and possibly result {{in the loss of}} 150,000 job opportunities. This was estimated to cost some of the $3.2 billion in US foreign direct investment in Egypt. Further, Egypt was in search of sources for increased economic growth and trade to provide jobs for its rapidly growing labor force.|$|E

5|$|Fossils {{from the}} Pleistocene {{suggest that this}} species bred further south in Europe in the cool periods between glaciations than it does now. Its {{sensitivity}} to changing climate {{as well as to}} water table levels and the speed of vegetation growth has led to suggestions that its range is affected <b>by</b> <b>global</b> warming, and the ruff might act as an indicator species for monitoring climate change. Potential threats to this species may also include outbreaks of diseases to which it is susceptible such as influenza, botulism and avian malaria.|$|E
5|$|Large scale {{changes in}} weather {{patterns}} {{may also have}} been caused <b>by</b> <b>global</b> dimming.

5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, plankton, or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms of size. It is thought this radiation was caused <b>by</b> <b>global</b> climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E

5|$|Dawson Creek {{was last}} {{home to a}} Junior A hockey team in the 1980s when the Dawson Creek Kodiaks of the Peace-Cariboo Junior Hockey League spent time at the {{equivalent}} level. While the Kodiaks ended operations in 1990, a new Junior A team was proposed in 2006 <b>by</b> <b>Global</b> Spectrum, the contracted management company responsible for operating the city's new South Peace Community Multiplex which included the EnCana Events Centre, capable of hosting ice hockey events with a seating capacity of 4,500 people. The objective was to create an anchor tenant which could help fill the Multiplex's schedule with several dozen home games per year. The company recruited several Dawson Creek-based businessmen to form a non-profit society (eventually named the DC Rage Society) that would fund the start-up of the team. To add credibility to their application, Dawson Creek resident Rob Bremner, who was the {{head coach of the}} Junior A-level Vernon Vipers when they won the 1996 Royal Bank Cup, was appointed the General Manager of the team and tasked with recruiting potential players.|$|E

5|$|Evidence of {{violence}} and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered {{by members of the}} Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated <b>by</b> <b>global</b> climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the market}} {{turbulence}} of the 1990s financial crises and September 11 {{attacks on the}} U.S. in 2001, financial integration intensified among developed nations and emerging markets, with substantial growth in capital flows among banks and in the trading of financial derivatives and structured finance products. Worldwide international capital flows grew from $3 trillion to $11 trillion U.S. dollars from 2002 to 2007, primarily {{in the form of}} short-term money market instruments. The United States experienced growth in the size and complexity of firms engaged in a broad range of financial services across borders {{in the wake of the}} Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 which repealed the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, ending limitations on commercial banks' investment banking activity. Industrialized nations began relying more on foreign capital to finance domestic investment opportunities, resulting in unprecedented capital flows to advanced economies from developing countries, as reflected <b>by</b> <b>global</b> imbalances which grew to 6% of gross world product in 2007 from 3% in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature was obtained from Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced <b>by</b> <b>global</b> trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E

From March 2009, BBC Southern Counties Radio became BBC Sussex on 104.5FM & BBC Surrey on 104FM. Due to the positioning of their transmitters, when broadcasting separately both stations cover Crawley stories.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have noted}} that fires appear in cycles {{associated}} {{with those of the}} hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer {{due to the lack of}} lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected <b>by</b> <b>global</b> climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of charcoal have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 BCE.|$|E
5|$|The {{incentive}} to use 100% renewable energy for electricity, transport, or even {{total primary energy}} supply globally, has been motivated <b>by</b> <b>global</b> warming and other ecological {{as well as economic}} concerns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that there are few fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet most of total global energy demand. In reviewing 164 recent scenarios of future renewable energy growth, the report noted that the majority expected renewable sources to supply more than 17% of total energy by 2030, and 27% by 2050; the highest forecast projected 43% supplied by renewables by 2030 and 77% by 2050. Renewable energy use has grown much faster than even advocates anticipated. At the national level, at least 30 nations around the world already have renewable energy contributing more than 20% of energy supply.|$|E
