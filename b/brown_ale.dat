5|$|While {{a variety}} of beers are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle <b>Brown</b> <b>Ale,</b> Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut <b>Brown</b> <b>Ale.</b> Beer in the North is usually served with a thick head which accentuates the nutty, malty flavours preferred in Northern beers. On the non-alcoholic side, the North – in particular, Lancashire – was {{the hub of the}} temperance bar movement which popularised soft drinks such as dandelion and burdock, Tizer and Vimto.|$|E

50|$|North American <b>brown</b> <b>ales</b> {{trace their}} {{heritage}} to American home brewing adaptations of certain northern English beers, and the English influence on American Colonial Ales.|$|R
50|$|They {{range from}} deep amber to brown in colour. Caramel and {{chocolate}} flavours are evident. <b>Brown</b> <b>ales</b> from northeastern England {{tend to be}} strong and malty, often nutty, while those from southern England are usually darker, sweeter and lower in alcohol. North American <b>brown</b> <b>ales</b> are usually drier than their English counterparts, with a slight citrus accent and an aroma, bitterness, and medium body due to American hop varieties. Fruitiness from esters are subdued. When chilled to cold temperatures, some haziness may be noticed.|$|R
50|$|These sweet, {{heavy-bodied}} <b>brown</b> <b>ales</b> {{represent a}} style which {{originated in the}} British Isles. The Caledonian theme is usually heavily emphasized with tartan and thistles appearing on labels. Examples include Gordon's, Scotch de Silly and Achouffe McChouffe.|$|R

Some {{of the more popular}} cheeses are Cheddar, Red Leicester and Wensleydale together with Blue Stilton. Many Anglo-Indian hybrid dishes, curries, have been created such as chicken tikka masala and balti.

5|$|The company {{merged with}} Newcastle Breweries in 1960, forming Scottish & Newcastle, {{a group with}} market value of £50 million. William McEwan Younger, the son of William Younger, was the {{chairman}} and managing director. The company dedicated itself to the free trade, and promoted its brands to an extent not previously witnessed in the British brewing industry. McEwan's Export {{became one of the}} three core brands of the new company, alongside Newcastle <b>Brown</b> <b>Ale</b> and Younger's Tartan Special. Scottish & Newcastle became the dominant force in brewing across Scotland and the North of England. From the 1960s, the company began to style itself MacEwan's in export markets, in order to make pronunciation easier. The company's McEwan's Strong Ale was the highest gravity beer on general sale throughout the world. McEwan's Export was alternatively sold as India Pale Ale or Scotch Ale overseas. William McEwan Younger retired in 1970.|$|E

25|$|Edwin Vaux (1844–1908) was {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} Vaux brewing family of Sunderland, and the family name frequently appears among the lists of Durham Volunteer Artillery officers. Among them was Major Ernest Vaux, who volunteered for the Imperial Yeomanry during the 2nd Boer War and commanded the Maxim gun detachment of the 5th Imperial Yeomanry, winning a Distinguished Service Order (DSO). The family brewery introduced Double Maxim <b>brown</b> <b>ale</b> in 1901 to celebrate the detachment's return and the beer is still brewed in Sunderland. Ernest Vaux later commanded a Territorial battalion of the Durham Light Infantry throughout World War I.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, Belhaven has {{introduced}} a burst of new beer launches as the craft beer movement has developed a great appetite for new styles of beer. Launches since 2015 include Intergalactic Dry-Hopped Lager, Bridge to Nowhere Pale Ale and Twisted Grapefruit IPA. Many of these beers are hoppier and often stronger than the more traditional beers historically associated with Belhaven. In the past, stouts, porters, <b>brown</b> <b>ales,</b> 20/- to 110/- ales (rising at 10/- increments) as well as periodic specials celebrating anniversaries and royal events were brewed at Belhaven. Even further back, harvest ales and 2d ales were the brewery's standby.|$|R
50|$|Most beer {{authorities}} {{trace the}} origins of Berliner Weisse to an unknown beer being produced in Hamburg which was copied and developed by the 16th century brewer Cord Broihan. Broihan's beer, Halberstädter Broihan, became very popular, and a version was being brewed in Berlin by the Berlin doctor J.S. Elsholz in the 1640s. An alternative possibility, given by Protz among others, is that migrating Huguenots developed the beer from the local red and <b>brown</b> <b>ales</b> as they moved through Flanders into Northern Germany. Some sources, such as Dornbusch, give the date 1572 as being the earliest record of the beer being brewed in Berlin.|$|R

2500|$|Gallowgate End (officially the Newcastle <b>Brown</b> <b>Ale</b> Stand), at the {{southern}} end of the ground, named unofficially for its proximity to the old City gallows, and officially after the long association with the club of sponsor Scottish and Newcastle Breweries; ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{geographical}} limitations can {{be quite}} strict. [...] "Newcastle Brown Ale" [...] was restricted to being brewed {{in the city of}} Newcastle upon Tyne in England. However, having obtained this protection for their product, the brewery decided in 2004 that it would move across the river Tyne to Gateshead. As Gateshead is technically a separate town—albeit only the width of a river apart—it does not fall within the required geographical restriction. The brewery then applied to the European Union authorities to have the geographical restriction revoked. If the restriction had not been revoked, the brewery would have been forced either to move back to Newcastle, or stop calling its beer [...] "Newcastle" [...] <b>brown</b> <b>ale.</b> Ultimately, the brewery's application to revoke the geographic restriction was approved. Similarly, Stilton cheese can only be produced in the three English counties of Derbyshire, Leicestershire, and Nottinghamshire. Stilton village is in the traditional county of Huntingdonshire, now a district of Cambridgeshire, so Stilton cheese cannot be produced in Stilton (although it is unclear whether the cheese was ever produced there. Quenby Hall in Leicestershire claims to be the first producer).|$|E

50|$|In 2009, ABC {{released}} the newest version of Laughing Skull, changing {{it from a}} bohemian pilsner to a well-balanced amber ale.

60|$|He drank another draught of ale {{and grew}} merry. Then ale called for ale, and Skallagrim drained cup on cup, singing as he drained, till at last heavy sleep overcame him, and he sank drunken {{on the ground}} there by the barrel, while the <b>brown</b> <b>ale</b> trickled round him.|$|E
60|$|Thus he shouted, and all crowded around, laughing, {{while the}} <b>brown</b> <b>ale</b> flowed; {{and they called}} Little John a brave fellow, each {{swearing}} that he loved him as his own brother; for when one has entertainment with nothing to pay, one loves the man that gives it to one.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, the Pittsburgh Brewing Company {{acquired}} the Queen City Brewing Company (1901-1976) of Cumberland, Maryland. The Queen City Brewing Company was {{also known as}} the Old German Brewing Company and included the Cumberland Brewing Company (1890-1958), which was purchased by the brewery in 1958. At its peak, the Queen City brewery produced over 250,000 barrels of beer a year in Cumberland. The company prospered during the 1950s and 1960s; however, labor disputes and declining sales caused the Queen City Brewing Company to close in December 1974, transferring its Old German, Old Export, Heritage House, Old Dutch, <b>Brown</b> Derby, Gamecock <b>Ale,</b> and American brands to the Pittsburgh Brewing Company. The Queen City brewery was demolished in April 1975, ending a combined 152 years of brewing in Cumberland, Maryland. In January, 1974, the Pittsburgh Brewing Company {{acquired the}} Augustiner, Mark V, Robin Hood and Gambrinus brand names from August Wagner Breweries, Inc., Columbus, Ohio.|$|R
60|$|Then Gizur looked. The {{moonlight}} {{poured into}} the little room, and by it he saw the great shape of Skallagrim. His head was thrown back, his mouth was wide. He snored loudly in his drunken sleep, and all about him ran the <b>brown</b> <b>ale,</b> for the spigot of the cask lay upon the floor. In his left hand was a horn cup, but in his right he still grasped his axe.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{they left}} the chamber where they had sat so long, and at the yard pump the Tavern Knight {{performed}} a rude morning toilet. Thereafter, on a simple fare of herrings and <b>brown</b> <b>ale,</b> they broke their fast; and ere that meal was done, Kenneth, pale and worn, with dark circles round his eyes, entered the common room, and sat moodily apart. But when later Hogan went to see to the dispatching of his messenger, Crispin rose and approached the youth.|$|E
