Two different empirical strategies are implemented using the per capita operating expenditures of 90 French local jurisdictions (the départements) for an 8 -year period. The first strategy focuses directly on the impact of the electoral margin, the fragmentation of the majority and the concentration of the opposition on the annual budget growth rates. The second strategy regresses the present expenditures on last year's expenditures over several subsamples. Both empirical strategies lead to the following conclusions. First, the less powerful a majority in terms of seats and fragmentation, the lower the annual fluctuations of the budget. Second, highly powerful majorities are not always associated with the highest <b>budgetary</b> growth <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} "market-preserving {{federalism}} " {{stresses the importance}} of decentralization and incentives of government on market development. Using a panel data set, we investigate the central-provincial relationship during China's reform process. We find much stronger correlations between local government budgetary revenue collection and its budgetary expenditure under the implementation of "fiscal contracting system " compared with the pre-reform period. We also find that more fiscal decentralization and stronger fiscal incentives — the latter measured in terms of higher (ex ante) marginal local <b>budgetary</b> revenue retention <b>rate</b> — implies faster development of non-state enterprises and more reform in state-owned enterprises, while the Party's control over appointment has opposite effects. However, the Party's control is effective in restricting local government's investment but ineffective in curbing local credit expansion, suggesting that the Party's control had played some, but limited, role in helping macroeconomic stability.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on incentives and Chinese economic reform. In the first essay, I collect a unique dataset of Chinese municipalities from 1978 to 2007 to evaluate {{the impact of a}} Special Economic Zone experiment with incentives including property rights protection, tax breaks and a preferential land policy for foreign investors. Guided by a theoretical model, I find the SEZ policy: 1) increases per capita foreign direct investment by 58 %; 2) does not crowd out domestic investment and 3) increases TFP growth rate by 0. 6 percentage points. The results suggest that SEZs not only bring capital, but also more advanced technology. In the second essay, I evaluate the fiscal incentive - the marginal sharing rate of fiscal revenue faced by Chinese provincial governments. In 1994, China engaged in a fiscal reform which set marginal sharing <b>rates</b> of <b>budgetary</b> taxes across provinces to a uniform level. Exploiting heterogeneity in the pre-reform <b>budgetary</b> sharing <b>rate,</b> I find that provinces with lower pre-existing <b>rates</b> collect more <b>budgetary</b> taxes; at the same time less extra-budgetary revenue after 1994 relative to those with higher starting level. The results suggest that Chinese provincial governments treat the budgetary tax and extra-budgetary revenue as substitutes. The third essay studies the impact of Chinese municipal governments' fiscal sharing rate on the local economy. The fiscal regime change in 2002 largely reduced the local sharing rate of enterprise income tax. I find that municipal governments respond to this change by allocating more resources including land and capital into the real estate sector, leading to social conflicts between local governments and farmers whose lands were taken with low compensation. The results imply that regional decentralization has to be matched with well-designed incentives to benefit {{the majority of the population}} within the jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic {{computable general equilibrium}} model in which optimizing agents evade taxes by operating in the underground economy. The cost to firms of evading taxes is that they find themselves subject to credit rationing from banks. Our model simulations show that {{in the absence of}} budgetary flexibility to adjust expenditures, raising tax rates too high drives firms into the underground economy, thereby reducing the tax base. Aggregate investment in the economy is lowered because of credit rationing. Taxes that are too low eliminate the underground economy, but result in unsustainable budget and trade deficits. Thus, the optimal rate of taxation, from a macroeconomic point of view, may lead to some underground activity.

This is particularly so in mid- 1999, amid claims from Washington that the past two years' dangers of financial meltdown and deflation were averted and finally extinguished through a combination of policy measures and good fortune: slightly looser Federal Reserve monetary policy adopted in September 1998, in the immediate wake of the successful public-private bailout of the Long Term Capital Management hedge fund; a new $ 90 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) insurance scheme announced the following month; the convening of key countries in a Forum on Financial Stability; the lack of financial contagion (contrary to expectations) in the wake of Brazil's January 1999 currency meltdown; the long-awaited revival (however infirm) of the Japanese economy; new plans for somewhat more transparent <b>budgetary</b> and exchange <b>rate</b> systems in emerging markets; and a decision at the G- 8 Cologne meeting in June 1999 to sell 10 % of the IMF's gold to fund partial debt relief for the poorest Third World countries.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{macroeconomic}} and budgetary impact of tax reforms in a New Keynesian two-country model. Our results show that both income and consumption unilateral tax rate reductions do not constitute a "free lunch", {{in the sense that}} they have negative budgetary consequences for the country which implements them. In addition, the degree of self-financing implied by our model is in the 8 Â½- 24 percent range. Since the degree of self-financing estimated in previous literature was larger, we conclude that in our model not only the "lunch" is not "free", but is also not that "cheap". A comparison of alternative (income-tax versus consumption-tax based) fiscal stimulus packages shows that consumption tax cuts imply a larger short-run impact on domestic output but the income tax cuts stimulate the domestic economy more in the long run. We also look at the implications of a revenue-neutral tax reform in which consumption taxes are increased to compensate for lower income tax collection.

In some cases, {{the consistency of the}} indices based on the interpretation of central banks statues used for measuring the degree of central bank independence is controversial, particularly for some of the indices. Moreover, the correlations between central bank independence and macroeconomic performance variables are not always confirmed, the causal relationship between central bank independence and inflation is controversial, and the higher disinflation costs, {{as a result of a}} higher sacrifice ratio correlated with the degree of independence is controversial, too. The effects of central bank independence upon macroeconomic performances focalized upon the {{empirical evidence}} of inflation, output or economic grouth and the disinflation costs. This is due to the lack of studies vis - á - vis of relationship between central bank independence and macroeconomic performances regarding some variables like interest <b>rates</b> and <b>budgetary</b> deficits. Specialists consider inflation and output as the main determinats of the social welfare. The economic literature regarding this fact suggests that the central bank is seen as a free lunch institution. This hypothesis sustains that independent central banks will have social benefits in terms of lower inflation rates, but without any costs in terms of the real macroeconomic performances as a higher output volatility or a lower economic growth. In this article we provide a qualitative analyses regarding the relationship between central bank independence and macroeconomic performances. For this purpose the authors' used the new index for measuring central bank independence and inflation targeting based on three pillars: political and legal central bank independence, central bank governance and conduct of monetary policy, central bank transparency and accountability. For estimating the connections between the evolution of central bank independence and macroeconomic performances we used five macroeconomic variables: GDP in constant prices, Harmonised Price Consumer Index, unemployment <b>rate,</b> <b>budgetary</b> deficit and current account deficit. Both measuring the degree of central bank independence and evaluating the average levels of the macroeconomic variables were analysed in the period 1990 - 2009, within 20 less developing countries.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the correlation}} between social security budget and the main macroeconomic indicators (like GDP, monthly average gross earnings, unemployment) in Romania during the period 2000 – 2009. Romania faces a more severe economic recession than originally anticipated. Although the implementation of anti-crisis program was able to lead to normalization of financial conditions, the contraction of economic activity is higher than initial projections. Because of the great policy debate in Romania {{about the impact of}} the reduction of pensions and salaries and increases of taxations on the reduction of budget deficit, we have explained in our paper the basic sides of the balanced budget debate. There are three basic sides to the balanced budget debate. The traditionalists argue for a reduction of the budget deficit since it harms the economy. Another group holds the Ricardian view of government debt in believing that there is no real harm done to the economy by the national debt. A third group claims one way or another that the budget deficit is not an adequate measure of fiscal policy. We will argue which of these views is most reasonable, based on a study case. � � The study is based on official data published by the National Institute of Statistics, with the specification that they are transformed into real values in order to assure the data comparability. The methodology used is the correlation analysis, the factorial analysis and the regression analysis, in order to evaluate the impact of some macroeconomic policies on the budget deficit. Three hypotheses on macroeconomic policies are discussed in the paper and their influences on the budget deficit. The main problem in Romania was that the macroeconomic policies didn't give enough attention to budget deficit in order to keep it under control. This is the main cause of the actual unfavourable economical situation in Romania, with a huge budget deficit, with a decrease in economic activity, with increases of inflation and unemployment. � � Among the variables used in the study we mention: total incomes, total expenditure, <b>budgetary</b> deficit, unemployment <b>rate,</b> monthly average net earnings, average number of pensioners and social allowance recipients, monthly average pension of pensioners and social allowance recipients, economically active population, monthly average inflation rate. � � By analysing {{the correlation between}} all the studied variables we observe that there is a strong correlation between monthly average pension and monthly average net earnings. Increases in the level of earnings will determine the increase of budget deficit. At first view the macroeconomic policy adopted by the actual government in Romania (the cut with 25 % of salaries in the budgetary system, VAT increase) will have as a result the decrease of budget deficit. Since the monthly average net earnings is correlated with unemployment and inflation rate, the reduction of the general level of earnings will determine the increase of unemployment and inflation. Therefore this policy should be applied with caution, taking in parallel measures to compensate its adverse effects. The impact of some of the macroeconomic policies on budget deficit is studied using two regression functions. After an econometric analysis we shall conclude about the influence of the dependent variables of these functions on the Romanian budgetary deficit. social security budget; gross domestic product; correlation coefficient; regression analysis. ...|$|R
