40|$|AbstractAlthough {{a lot of}} {{interface}} crack {{problems were}} previously treated, few solutions are available under arbitrary crack lengths and material combinations. In this paper the stress intensity factors of an edge interface crack in a <b>bonded</b> <b>strip</b> are considered under tension with varying the crack length and material combinations systematically. Then, the limiting solutions are provided for an edge interface crack in a bonded semi-infinite plate under arbitrary material combinations. In order to calculate the stress intensity factors accurately, exact solutions in an infinite bonded plate are also considered to produce proportional singular stress fields {{in the analysis of}} FEM by superposing specific tensile and shear stresses at infinity. The details of this new numerical solution are described with clarifying the effect of the element size on the stress intensity factor. It is found that for the edge interface crack the normalized stress intensity factors are not always finite depending upon Dunders’ parameters. This behavior can be explained from the condition of the singular stress at the end of <b>bonded</b> <b>strip.</b> Convenient formulas are also given by fitting the computed results...|$|R

40|$|A {{conventional}} bond is a {{debt instrument}} {{consisting of a}} series of periodic coupon payments plus the repayment of the principal at maturity. As the name suggests, a zero-coupon bond has no coupon payments. It has only a single payment consisting of the repayment of the principal at maturity. The zero-coupon bond is sold at a discount and then redeemed for its face value at maturity. The return to the investor is the difference between the face value of the bond and its discounted purchase price. In this article, the author examines the investment characteristics of zero-coupon bonds. In particular, a type of zero-coupon bond known as a <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> is discussed. A <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> is created by stripping coupon payments from conventional <b>bonds.</b> The <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> market in Canada has grown substantially since the late 1980 s and is now an integral part of Canadian fixed-income markets. As well, the opportunity to trade in the <b>strip</b> <b>bond</b> market improves the liquidity and efficiency of Canadian fixed-income markets, thus helping to reduce the overall cost of borrowing to the government. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} and analyzes {{the results of}} an experimental research on masonry walls tested first in unreinforced condition and then in FRP reinforced condition. The specimens were three real-scale perforated brick walls. The experimentation consisted in collapse testings under increasing lateral load and constant vertical load. The reinforced condition consisted in strengthening the masonry walls with Carbon Fiber-Reinforced-Polymeric <b>strips</b> <b>bonded</b> onto the masonry surface. The CFRP reinforcement was applied by using three different techniques. The first technique involved epoxy <b>bonding</b> of <b>strips</b> (common application). The second technique involved the <b>bonding</b> of <b>strips</b> with epoxy resin and strengthening the bond with studs (FRP studs embedded into the masonry and connected with the strips). The third technique consisted in the epoxy <b>bonding</b> of <b>strips</b> under vacuum (i. e., using a special vacuum-packed system to push the resin into the masonry as deep as possible). This research aimed at investigating the differences in the structural behaviors of tested perforated masonry walls due to these three different CFRP application techniques. Actually, the experimental results prove that the application technique influences both the load-carrying capacity and the ultimate horizontal displacement of the perforated tested masonry walls. The comparison between the experimental results and code provisions showed that, as regards the debonding of CFRP strips, the latter underestimate the former excessively...|$|R

In the emerging market world, financial crises are seen more often than not. An obvious question is whether these events, each associated with a particular country, spread to other countries, regardless of economic fundamentals at that specific point in time. That is, if the ‘simultaneous’ movements that we observe in spreads across emerging market economies are linked to economic fundamentals. We find that the correlation across countries is regionally dominated.

40|$|CONTACT M. J. JAFFAR Department of Applied Mathematical Studies, University of b e d s, U K * This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the sliding (full slip) contact between a rigid cylindrical punch and an elastic strip of finite thickness. The strip is either in adhesion with a rigid foundation (<b>bonded</b> <b>strip)</b> or resting on a rigid foundation (unbonded strip). It is assumed that the sliding takes place in one direction on the entire contact surface. The tangential traction q(x) is related to the pressure p(x) by Coulomb’s law q(x) = *pp(x) where p is a coefficient of friction. A numerical scheme is developed to reduce the governing integral equation to a system of linear equations. The values of these unknowns will determine the full solution. Results are presented {{for a wide range of}} p, Poisson’s ratio v, and the depth parameter y (contact halfwidth to depth ratio) and show good agreement with existing results. ...|$|R
