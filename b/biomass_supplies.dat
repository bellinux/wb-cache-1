40|$|Modern {{bioenergy}} {{systems have}} significant potential to cost-effectively substitute fossil energy carriers with substantial GHG emissions reduction benefits. To mobilise large-scale <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies,</b> {{large volumes of}} biomass feedstock need to be secured, and competitive feedstock value chains {{need to be developed}} and optimised, based on identification of appropriate combinations of feedstock and conversion technologies. This makes assessments of biomass resource availability a critical part of the biomass value chain. Given the global distribution of biomass production regions and markets as well as the nature of raw biomass, pre-processing biomass {{plays an important role in}} improving biomass supply chain economics. Logistics and transport are key costs components in the biomass value chain and major investments in infrastructure and capacity are required to realise large scale <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies.</b> Establishing this infrastructure is gradual and takes time, which also applies to the mobilisation of large volumes of biomass. These two aspects are interrelated and region specific due to the unique settings for biomass feedstock production and local infrastructure. Given this context, there is need for examining the entire biomass supply value chain so as to understand the many elements involved in bioenergy mobilisation. Thus, the main objective of this thesis was to design sustainable biomass energy supply chains to enable competitive mobilisation of large scale <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies</b> for both the short and long term. With regards to resource assessments, the analysis showed that, under strict sustainability criteria, substantial volumes of biomass exist which could – if efficiently mobilized – contribute significantly to renewable energy production. Currently, it is more cost-effective to ship densified solid biomass, e. g pellets, from low cost biomass production regions of the world for final large scale conversion in the major biofuel markets. Early biomass conversion to secondary energy carriers in the supply chain is only cost effective where infrastructure already exists for low cost transport to the market. Thus in the short term, wood pellets are expected to play an important role as the internationally traded solid biomass commodity. In the near future, torrefied pellets may become the dominant and preferred internationally traded solid biomass commodity as the technology is commercialised. Overall, advanced biofuels are attractive against fossil fuels both economically and also in terms of GHG reductions. At current conditions, advanced biofuels can be delivered from about 12. 5 $/GJfuel and reduce GHG emissions by at least 60 %- the threshold of minimum GHG emission saving set in the EU renewable energy directive for biofuels. However, advanced biofuel technologies are being developed and their successful commercialisation of will depend on overcoming several technical and economic challenges. Increasing operational scale, rapid deployment and technological learning are key to biofuel cost reduction. In addition, a large, stable supply of biomass feedstock needs to be guaranteed. To better understand the biomass resource base and implementation possibilities, more scientific research needs to be conducted in developing countries to improve the quality of biomass resource assessments and investigate implementation business models...|$|E

This paper investigated technical, social, economic, and environmental barriers to the development and innovation of supply chains, taking into account a large range of parameters influencing the performances of <b>biomass</b> systems at <b>supply</b> chain scale. An assessment framework was developed that combined economic optimization of a supply chain with a holistic and integrated sustainability assessment. The framework was applied to a case-study involving miscanthus biomass in the Burgundy region (Eastern France) to compare alternative <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain scenarios with different annual biomass demand, crop yield, harvest timing and densification technologies. These <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain scenarios were first economically optimized across the whole supply chain (from field to plant gate) by considering potential feedstock production (from a high-resolution map), costs, logistical constraints and product prices. Then sustainability assessment was conducted by combining recognized methodologies: economic analysis, multi-regional input-output analysis, emergy assessment, and lifecycle assessment. The analysis of the case study scenarios found that expanding <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> from 6, 000 to 30, 000 tons of dry matter per year did not impact the profitability, which remained around 20 € per ton of biomass procured. Regarding environmental impacts, the scenario with the lowest feedstock supply area had the lowest impact per ton due to low economies of scale.

It is also important that forest sustainability in biomass supply regions not be threatened. A number of studies have examined the carbon implications of energy production from forest biomass. Conclusions are wide ranging, from those that claim carbon emissions stemming from energy production from trees can be worse than when burning coal, to determinations that wood-based bioenergy offers large carbon mitigation benefits.

One of the obstacles cellulosic ethanol must overcome in order to contribute to transportation energy demand is the infrastructure required to produce and distribute the fuel. Given a nascent cellulosic ethanol industry, locating cellulosic ethanol refineries and creating the accompanying infrastructure is essentially a greenfield problem that may benefit greatly from quantitative analysis. This study models cellulosic ethanol infrastructure investment using a mixed integer program (MIP) that locates ethanol refineries and connects these refineries to the <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies</b> and ethanol demands in a way that minimizes the total cost.

40|$|Biomass is {{the major}} source of energy in most {{developing}} countries. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies</b> and the environmental impacts resulting from their use. Use of residues could contribute to ensuring sustainable supply of biomass energy. This study presents findings of an evaluation of the energy potential of agricultural and forest residues in Uganda using census data of the year 2008 / 2009. Annual productions of crop and forest residues were estimated using residue-to-product ratio (RPR) method. Energy potential of each residue class was then determined basing on their respective lower heating values. The biogas generation potential of each animal category was used to evaluate the energy potential of animal manure. Results showed that the total energy potential of the residues amount to 260 PJy- 1, which is about 70 % of gross biomass energy requirement of Uganda for the year 2008. Crop residues had the highest contribution of about 150 PJy- 1, followed by animal residues with a potential of 65 PJy- 1. Maize residue is the predominant crop residue with energy potential of 65 PJy- 1 followed by beans and banana, each at 16 PJy- 1.

The purpose of the paper is to propose a mathematical framework for the optimal design of <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Design/methodology/approach An integrated mathematical framework that models biomass production, transportation and warehousing throughout the nodes of a <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain is presented. Owing to conflicting objectives, weights are imposed on each aspect, and a 0 - 1 weighted goal programming mixed-integer linear programming (WGP MILP) programming model is formulated and used for all possible weight representations under environmental, economic and social criteria. Findings The results of the study show that emphasis on the environmental aspect, expressed with high values in the environmental criterion, significantly reduces the level of CO 2 emissions derived from the transportation of biomass through the various nodes of the supply chain. Environmental and economic criteria seem to be moving in the same direction for high weight values in the corresponding aspect. From the results, social criterion seems to move to the opposite direction from environmental and economic criteria.

Model collaboration consists of aligning and harmonizing input data and scenarios, model comparison and/or model linkage. Improved collaboration between existing modeling approaches can help assess (i) the causes of differences and similarities in model output, which is important for interpreting the results for policy-making, and (ii) the linkages, feedbacks and trade-offs between different systems and impacts (e. g. economic and natural), which is key to a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> and demand.

Worldwide, about 150 cofiring plants are in operation. In Germany, the potential for biomass cofiring in coal plants is about 28 TWhel per annum, assuming a 10 % replacement of coal combustion by biomass. In this paper, we study the economic potential of biomass cofiring in hard coal power plants in Germany. To this end, we identify suitable biomass input fuels, investment and operating costs, and profitability of cofiring investments. In a sensitivity analysis, we check for the robustness of the results gained, and in a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) uncertainties are explicitly taken into account. We find that both regional and international <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies</b> are relevant, and that the cost effectiveness of cofiring is strongly affected by prices for biomass, coal and CO 2 permits, while investment and operating costs only have a modest influence. According to our calculations, power generation costs attributable to biomass combustion for a plant put into operation in 2020 are between 70 - 75 € MWhel- 1, while the average costs of biomass fuel from various sources and markets are calculated to be around 4. 1 € GJ- 1.

40|$|Biomass is a {{renewable}} energy resource; however, its exploitation raises concerns about {{its ability to}} sustain the growing demand and its negative impacts on the environment, particularly in developing countries. These concerns are more prominent on the African continent where high population growth rates is leading to high rates of deforestation due to expansion of agricultural land and increased demand for bioenergy. Use of traditional and inefficient bioenergy technologies and appliances also exacerbate the problem. This paper presents {{a review of the}} efforts and progress made by different organisations in promoting improved bioenergy technologies in Uganda. The study was based on an extensive review of available literature on improved bioenergy technologies introduced in the country. It was found that there is high level of wastage of biomass resources since an estimated 72. 7 % of the population use traditional cooking stoves with efficiency estimated to be less than 10 %. Inefficient cooking stoves are also blamed for indoor air pollution and respiratory illness reported amongst its users. Modern bioenergy technologies such as biomass gasification, cogeneration, biogas generation, biomass densification, and energy-efficient cooking stoves have been introduced in the country but have certainly not been widely disseminated. The country should pursue policies that will accelerate proliferation of more efficient bioenergy technologies {{in order to reduce the}} negative environmental impacts of bioenergy utilisation and to ensure sustainability of <b>biomass</b> <b>supplies.</b> © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Particle Swarm Optimization is a {{very well}} {{established}} evolutionary optimization technique that has shown great potential for the solution of various optimization problems. In this paper, a real-life application, namely a <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain where optimal biomass flows from sources to energy production plants must be suitably defined, is tackled by using a variant of PSO recently introduced by the authors. In particular, {{the performance of the}} variant herein proposed is investigated by applying the model to the strategic planning of the <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The optimization problem is non-linear with binary and continuous decision variables and is based on a previous formalization regarding the biomass strategic planning, but with the addition of integer decision variables for plant technologies selection. The model has been applied to the mountain community of Val Bormida (Savona district, Italy) ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of fossil}} fuels and their related impact on the {{environment}} and global warming have encouraged societies to pursue more sustainable and renewable alternatives, e. g., forest-based bio-oil. Thus, a vital need to decrease the level of greenhouse gas emissions and the tendency of nations to reduce their dependency on imported oil have created a new mission for society: To increase the robustness of the environmental and economic aspects of woody <b>biomass</b> to bio-oil <b>supply</b> chains. Prior studies have focused on developing novel methods and approaches for improving single stages of <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Others have focused on ameliorating <b>biomass</b> <b>supply</b> chain performance from a systems perspective for a host of different biomass types, e. g., agricultural residues and forest residues, and logistics issues, e. g., transportation distance and storage. Bio-oil can be produced from woody biomass through the fast pyrolysis process, among different methods. Mobile processing has been developed in recent years to facilitate bio-oil production from woody waste and to reduce overall bio-oil supply chain cost, however, questions surrounding the environmental an...|$|R
