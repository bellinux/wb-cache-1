25|$|Relatively speaking, Bucks County {{experiences}} warm/hot {{and humid}} summers with chilly/cold and somewhat snowy winters. Episodes of high humidity (dew point >= 70°F) occur every year during {{or close to}} the summer months, very occasionally reaching extreme (dew point >= 75°F) levels. When high-to-extreme humidity combines with air temperatures in the mid-upper 90's, dangerous heat index values of >= 105°F can sometimes result. Winter minimum air temperatures occasionally fall into the single-digits to slightly below-0°F. When the coldest temperatures combine with higher winds, wind chill values can sometimes plummet below-0°F to as cold as -20°F. Spring and fall are comparatively tranquil. The climate cools as one moves from the lower elevation, dense suburban areas in southern <b>Bucks,</b> <b>to</b> the higher elevation, rural areas of northern Bucks. Precipitation is fairly well-distributed throughout the year. The average seasonal snowfall, which can potentially occur from as early as October to as late as April, is around 2 feet in extreme southern Bucks, and around 3 feet in the highest elevations of far northern Bucks. The fall foliage season typically peaks in mid-October in northern Bucks, mid-late October in central Bucks, and late-October / early-November in southern Bucks. These dates correlate with the typical date of first freeze. Peak spring foliage usually occurs {{during the month of}} April, which correlates with the typical date of last freeze.|$|E

500|$|The stadium legs of {{the tour}} {{received}} more consistent praise than the arena shows. Critics noted that while the show and its setlist were largely the same as before, the tour mostly benefited from the increased scale.

[...] Gundersen also made the comparison to Oz, saying {{that even though the}} band was dwarfed by the setting, their adventurous musicianship still shone through. She concluded that the group had [...] "deliver a brilliant high-wire act" [...] between mocking and exploiting rock music clichés, a comparison also made by stage designer Willie Williams. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said of the outdoor American leg, [...] "Zoo TV is the yardstick by which all other stadium shows will be measured." [...] David Fricke of Rolling Stone said that the band had [...] "regained critical and commercial favor by negotiating an inspired balance between rock's cheap thrills and its own sense of moral burden". He praised the band for [...] "retool themselves as wiseacres with heart and elephant <b>bucks</b> <b>to</b> burn". Fricke noted that the increased visual effects for the [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg increased the shows' [...] "mind-fuck" [...] factor. Many critics described the tour as [...] "post-modern".

40|$|In the {{computerized}} <b>bucking</b> <b>to</b> demand procedure buck-ing is done {{according to a}} given price list and demand matrix, which defines the demands for different log length-diameter class proportions. To achieve as good a log length-diameter distribution as possible, the computer compares demand and actual output <b>to</b> appropriately di-rect <b>bucking.</b> A comparison has been made with a vari-able called distribution level, which, however, is unable to distinguish between error that {{is close to the}} optimum log length-diameter class proportion and error that is fur-ther away. In addition, the distribution level does not distinguish between log length-diameter classes, even though error in one class can be far more undesirable than in another.
