25|$|Excavation {{began in}} 1972 and was {{intermittent}} until the lead archaeologist, Ehud Netzer's, death in 2010. Netzer worked at Herodium {{on behalf of}} the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Although there is much of the palace left to unearth, Netzer was the premier historian and had the most experience and knowledge of Herodium, so construction stopped in late 2010. Many archaeologists suspect that mosaic floors and frescoes were common throughout the palace, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> more work to reveal them, because over two thousand years have passed since its construction.|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} from The Honolulu Advertiser {{called it}} [...] "A smart script," [...] with [...] "slick production values {{and maybe a}} splash of nostalgia got the remake of Hawaii Five-O placed on the CBS prime-time lineup this fall, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> more than beefcake and a remixed theme song to keep the show on the air." [...] The piece {{also pointed out that}} times have changed since the original series left the air, citing other shows that were set in Hawaii which have come and gone. It expressed a hope that the producers will succeed in bringing a new life to the title with this remake. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly graded the episode B+, calling it an [...] "unexpected pleasure," [...] and praised Caan for being [...] "terrific as the moody but excellent" [...] Danno. Tucker also believed that Kim and Park [...] "play off each other nicely." [...] Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times felt that the script was [...] "neatly balanced between action, clever banter and serious issues," [...] adding that it [...] "seems poised to hold its own in the modern age." [...] McNamara also liked O'Loughlin's performance, stating that his [...] "limpid-eye woodenness" [...] worked well for the role. Hanh Nguyen of Zap2it stated that it was [...] "damn entertaining" [...] and [...] "visually stimulating," [...] and enjoyed the chemistry between McGarrett and Danny.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007, the Quebec Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, Benoît Pelletier, {{expressed}} his opinion {{that it was}} [...] "not impossible {{that we might have}} to reconsider the role of the monarch, the lieutenant governor, and the governor general... I'm not saying that the monarchy must be abolished, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> some thought, especially on its usefulness and relevance.

2500|$|SWANCCs {{implications}} for {{the scope of the}} federal wetlands permitting program are certain to be significant, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> years of litigation before they are fully clear. A key source of confusion is the aforementioned disconnect between the decision's narrow holding and broad rationale. The latter appears to preclude any effort by the Corps to assert jurisdiction over isolated waters, including isolated wetlands, on the basis of linkages with interstate commerce other than the interstate flight of migratory birds. (The Corps asserted such non-migratory-bird linkages after the litigation commenced, noting that SWANCCs municipal landfill is clearly of a commercial nature and, when aggregated with similar activity elsewhere, would substantially affect interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declined to consider this argument, pointing out that landfill activity is a [...] "far cry" [...] from the [...] "waters of the United States" [...] to which the CWA extends.) Plainly, the degree of section 404 program contraction occasioned by SWANCC will depend on which aspects of the decision shape the government's response.|$|E

60|$|There is, however, {{a strange}} {{arbitrariness}} about this elongation of reflection, which prevents {{it from being}} truly felt.

40|$|AbstractBased on the SMP failure {{criterion}} which takes {{into consideration the}} influence of middle principal stress of clayey stuff, considering stress conditions on gob and roadway, the formula of the coal pillar width is inferred.
