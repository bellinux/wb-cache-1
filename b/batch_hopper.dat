After measuring, the belt feeder transports the aggregates into mixing device. Meanwhile, stabilizing powders like lime, cement and others are transferred from powder material warehouse to the <b>batch</b> <b>hopper</b> by spiral conveyor, and then moved to the belt feeder by powder material feeder. All the ingredients {{are going to the}} mixing device for final processing. At last, the feeding belt conveyor is waiting for the final product to deliver it to the storage warehouse.|$|E

This is the Phase III of the ongoing program. Earlier Phases 1 and II successfully demonstrated feeding into pressures up to 35 kg/cm{sup 2 } (500 psi). The final report for those phases was submitted in April 2005. Based on the previous work done in Phases I & II using Powder River Basin coal provided by the PSDF facility in Wilsonville, AL, a Phase III feeder system was designed and built to accomplish the target of feeding the coal into a pressure of 70 kg/cm 2 (1, 000 psi) and to be capable of feed rates of up to 550 kilograms (1, 200 lbs) per hour. The drive motor system from Phase II was retained for use on Phase III since projected performance calculations indicated it should be capable of driving the Phase III pump to the target levels. The pump & motor system was installed in a custom built test rig comprising an inlet vessel containing an active live-wall hopper mounted on weigh cells in a support frame, transition into the pump inlet, transition from pump outlet and a receiver vessel containing a receiver drum supported on weigh cells. All pressure containment on the rig was rated to 105 kg/cm{sup 2 } (1, 500 psi) to accommodate the final pressure requirement of a proposed Phase IV of the program. A screw conveyor and <b>batch</b> <b>hopper</b> were added to transfer coal at atmospheric pressure from the shop floor up into the test rig to enable continuous feeding up to the capacity of the receiving vessel. Control & monitoring systems were up-rated from the Phase II system to cover the additional features incorporated in the Phase III rig, and provide closer control and expanded monitoring of the entire system. A program of testing and modification was carried out in Stamet's facility in CA, culminating in the first successful feeding of coal into the Phase III target of 70 kg/cm{sup 2 } (1, 000 psi) gas pressure in March 2007. Subsequently, repeated runs at pressure were achieved, and comparison of the data with Phase II results when adjusted for scale differences showed further power reductions of 40 % had been achieved from the final Phase II pressure runs. The general design layout of a commercial-scale unit was conducted, and preliminary cost estimates made...|$|E
