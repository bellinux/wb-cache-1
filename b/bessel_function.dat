25|$|For a {{circular}} aperture, the diffraction-limited image spot {{is known as}} an Airy disk; the distance x in the single-slit diffraction formula is replaced by radial distance r and the sine is replaced by 2J1, where J1 is a first order <b>Bessel</b> <b>function.</b>|$|E
25|$|Independently, {{as a third}} {{meaning of}} the term, {{the shape of the}} Airy disk {{resulting}} from the wave diffraction on a circular aperture is sometimes also denoted as the Airy function (see e.g. here).

25|$|The {{most common}} type of {{single-mode}} fiber has a core diameter of 8–10 micrometers and is designed for use in the near infrared. The mode structure depends on the wavelength of the light used, so that this fiber actually supports a small number of additional modes at visible wavelengths. Multi-mode fiber, by comparison, is manufactured with core diameters as small as 50 micrometers and as large as hundreds of micrometers. The normalized frequency V for this fiber should be less than the first zero of the <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> J0 (approximately 2.405).|$|E
25|$|In 1739, Leonhard Euler {{solved the}} {{ordinary}} differential equation for a forced harmonic oscillator and noticed the resonance phenomenon. In 1742, Colin Maclaurin discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating spheroids. In 1742, Benjamin Robins published his New Principles in Gunnery, establishing {{the science of}} aerodynamics. British work, carried on by mathematicians such as Taylor and Maclaurin, fell behind Continental developments as the century progressed. Meanwhile, work flourished at scientific academies on the Continent, led by such mathematicians as Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, Laplace, and Legendre. In 1743, Jean le Rond d'Alembert published his Traite de Dynamique, in which he introduced the concept of generalized forces for accelerating systems and systems with constraints, and applied the new idea of virtual work to solve dynamical problem, now known as D'Alembert's principle, as a rival to Newton's second law of motion. In 1747, Pierre Louis Maupertuis applied minimum principles to mechanics. In 1759, Euler solved the partial differential equation for the vibration of a rectangular drum. In 1764, Euler examined the partial differential equation for the vibration of a circular drum and found one of the <b>Bessel</b> <b>function</b> solutions. In 1776, John Smeaton published a paper on experiments relating power, work, momentum and kinetic energy, and supporting the conservation of energy. In 1788, Joseph Louis Lagrange presented Lagrange's equations of motion in Mécanique Analytique, in which the whole of mechanics was organized around the principle of virtual work. In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier states the law of conservation of mass. The rational mechanics developed in the 18th century received a brilliant exposition in both Lagrange's 1788 work and the Celestial Mechanics (1799–1825) of Pierre-Simon Laplace.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we offer some log-concavity {{properties}} of certain <b>functions</b> related to <b>Bessel</b> <b>functions</b> {{of the first}} kind and modified <b>Bessel</b> <b>functions</b> {{of the first and}} second kind, by solving partially a recent conjecture on the log-convexity/log-concavity properties for modified <b>Bessel</b> <b>functions</b> of the first kind and their derivatives.
