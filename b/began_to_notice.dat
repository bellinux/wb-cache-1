On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken into at least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E

Later model runs on March 28 only increased forecasters' confidence that a major severe-weather event would occur the following day.|$|E

When he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E
5|$|During 1925, Kilner {{was awarded}} a benefit match and had an {{improved}} batting record for the season but critics <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> a decline in his bowling. He was effective on pitches which favoured spin bowlers, {{but not on the}} flatter pitches prevalent in the dry summer of 1925. Cricket journals, such as The Cricketer, criticised his tendency to bowl leg theory—a tactic regarded as negative and overly defensive—when confronted with batting-friendly conditions. He took 131 wickets at 17.92, finishing second in the Yorkshire averages and helping his team to their fourth successive County Championship. He scored 1,068 runs at an average of 30.51 with two centuries. This gave him the third double of his career. Kilner's popularity with the crowds peaked in 1925, when over three days, 71,000 people attended his benefit match against Middlesex. It raised £4,106 (the equivalent of around £175,000 in 2008), to set a new record for benefit proceeds. There were no Test matches in 1925, but Kilner was once again selected for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, scoring 59 in his only innings and taking five wickets in the match, as well as some end of season matches for the MCC's team from the previous winter.|$|E

Williams secured a grant from the CDC to fund the NTFAP.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s {{researchers}} <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> {{a large number}} of early deaths and lung problems in asbestos-mining towns. The first such study was conducted by Dr. H. Montague Murray at the Charing Cross Hospital, London, in 1900, in which a postmortem investigation of a young man who had died from pulmonary fibrosis after having worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile factory, discovered asbestos traces in the victim's lungs. Adelaide Anderson, the Inspector of Factories in Britain, included asbestos in a list of harmful industrial substances in 1902. Similar investigations were conducted in France and Italy, in 1906 and 1908, respectively.|$|E

Little is known of Quantrill's journey out west, except that he excelled at the game of poker. He racked up piles of winnings by playing the game against his comrades at Fort Bridger but flushed it all on one hand the next day, leaving him dead broke.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Suzanne Rogers was {{diagnosed}} with a rare muscle disorder called Myasthenia Gravis. This disease affected her facial muscles and the medication she needed made her feel ill, with her face appearing swollen while also suffering hair loss. Rogers was forced to quit the show after 11 years when the effects of the disease became increasingly worse. Her entire appearance changed, and she did not return to the show for a year. Rogers, wanting to educate viewers about the disease, approached executive producer Betty Corday about her character being diagnosed with the disease. Corday agreed, and a storyline played out with Maggie learning she has myasthenia gravis. The actress went into remission in 1995, and has remained in remission since.

25|$|During the Nazi rise {{to power}} in the 1930s many artists fled Europe to the United States. By the early 1940s the main {{movements}} in modern art, expressionism, cubism, abstraction, surrealism, and dada were represented in New York: Marcel Duchamp, Fernand Léger, Piet Mondrian, Jacques Lipchitz, André Masson, Max Ernst, André Breton, were {{just a few of}} the exiled Europeans who arrived in New York. The rich cultural influences brought by the European artists were distilled and built upon by local New York painters. The climate of freedom in New York allowed all of these influences to flourish. The art galleries that primarily had focused on European art <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> the local art community and the work of younger American artists who had begun to mature. Certain artists at this time became distinctly abstract in their mature work. During this period Piet Mondrian's painting Composition No. 10, 1939–1942, characterized by primary colors, white ground and black grid lines clearly defined his radical but classical approach to the rectangle and abstract art in general.|$|E
25|$|Acts {{was read}} as a {{reliable}} history of the early church well into the post-Reformation era. By the 17th century, however, biblical scholars <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>notice</b> that it was incomplete and tendentious—its picture of a harmonious church is quite at odds with that given by Paul's letters, and it omits important {{events such as the}} deaths of both Peter and Paul. The mid-19th-century scholar Ferdinand Baur suggested that Luke had re-written history to present a united Peter and Paul and advance a single orthodoxy against the Marcionites. (Marcion was a 2nd-century heretic who wished to cut Christianity off entirely from the Jews). Baur continues to have enormous influence, but today there is less interest in determining Luke's historical accuracy (although this has never died out) than in understanding his theological program. In How Jesus Became Christian Canadian religious historian Barrie Wilson has renewed Baur's charge that Acts is a work of historical revisionism whose main purpose was to link Paul's new and separate Christ religion to Jesus and Judaism.|$|E

The team will drive the No. 53 Dodge Viper GTS-R in the GT-am class. The team was first among the reserves for the event, and the entry gives Keating the opportunity to accomplish the feat of winning both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans events in the same year. This {{will be the first}} 24 Hours of Le Mans for both Keating and Miller, while Jeroen will be earning his 10th consecutive start in the event. Jeroen finished fourth in class in qualifying, and so the team had good position {{for the start of the}} race. Bleekemolen continued the strong start with his opening shift in the car, leading for most the third hour, and Keating continued to maintain a top-four position during the second shift.
