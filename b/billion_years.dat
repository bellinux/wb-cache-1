5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 <b>billion</b> <b>years,</b> the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over about half a <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b> It will then expand more rapidly over about half a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago). For the first <b>billion</b> <b>years,</b> any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago, basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago, Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E

5|$|Most {{stars are}} between 1 billion and 10 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old. Some stars {{may even be}} close to 13.8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old—the {{observed}} age of the universe. The oldest star yet discovered, HD 140283, nicknamed Methuselah star, is an estimated 14.46 ± 0.8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> old.

5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago. No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few <b>billion</b> <b>years.</b> The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> ago. The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common.

50|$|More {{research}} is needed before the Maniitsoq structure can be definitely confirmed as an impact crater because present diagnostic tools used to identify impacting in the upper crust are inadequate for giant, deeply eroded structures.
