5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity of the organism.|$|E

25|$|Hitherto the New Telecom Policy was {{announced}} in 1999, only the Government-owned BSNL and MTNL were allowed to provide land-line phone services through copper wire in India with MTNL operating in Delhi and Mumbai and BSNL servicing all {{other areas of the}} country. Due to the rapid growth of the cellular phone industry in India, landlines are facing stiff competition from cellular operators. This has forced land-line service providers to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and improve their quality of service. Land-line connections are now also available on demand, even in high density urban areas. India has over 31 million main line customers.|$|E
25|$|Indium {{is another}} rare {{element in the}} boron group. Even less {{abundant}} than gallium at only 0.000005% (0.05 ppm), it is the 61st most common element in the earth's crust. Very few indium-containing minerals are known, all of them scarce: an example is indite. Indium is found in several zinc ores, but only in minute quantities; likewise some copper and lead ores contain traces. As {{is the case for}} most other elements found in ores and minerals, the indium extraction process has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> in recent years, ultimately leading to larger yields. Canada is the world's leader in indium reserves, but both the United States and China have comparable amounts.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergence}} {{of high school}} education in the Philippines, however, did not occur until 1910. It was borne out of rising numbers in enrollment, widespread economic depression, and a growing demand by big businesses and technological advances in factories and the {{emergence of}} electrification for skilled workers. In order to meet this new job demand, high schools were created and the curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for professional white collar or skilled blue collar work. This proved to be beneficial for both the employer and the employee; the investment in human capital caused employees to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient,</b> which lowered costs for the employer, and skilled employees received a higher wage than those employees with just primary educational attainment.|$|E

25|$|In 1995 ODOT began {{efforts to}} <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> {{as well as}} be more customer-friendly. At the time ODOT {{employed}} 7,800employees. By 2000 {{the total number of}} employees had been reduced to 6,031, a 22.6% decrease in 5years. This move reduced the increase in payroll expenditures to 0.78% per year. In addition, non-payroll budgets were limited to a 2% annual increase since 1995. Since the Ohio Department of Transportation is managed by separate districts, district budgets were redesigned to allow any operational efficiencies to remain within the district. This allowed each district to reinvest into their own roads and bridges, provided they are able to spend less than their budget. A comprehensive set of measures and objectives have been adopted in order to oversee each district's performance.|$|E
25|$|The Chinese {{government}} has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> in its Internet regulations since the 20th {{anniversary of the}} Tiananmen protest. On June 3, 2013, Weibo quietly suspended usage of the candle icon from the comment input tool, which netizens used to mourn the dead on forums. Some searches related to the protest on Chinese website services no longer come up with blank results, but with results {{that the government had}} “carefully selected.” These subtle methods of government censorship may cause netizens to believe that their searched materials were not censored. The government, however, is inconsistent in its enforcement of censorship laws. Netizens reported that searches of some censored terms on Chinese web services still resulted in blank pages with a message that says “relevant laws, regulations and policies” prevent the display of results related to the searches.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E

25|$|Sleep {{studies of}} KLS show varying results {{based on the}} amount of time the patient is observed. Slow wave sleep is often reduced at the {{beginning}} of episodes, and REM sleep is reduced near the end. Conversely, REM sleep is often normal at the beginning, and slow wave sleep is often normal by the conclusion. Stage two non-rapid eye movement sleep is often interrupted during KLS. Studies also show that stage one and three non-rapid eye movement sleep <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> when the episodes end. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test has yielded inconsistent results when given to KLS patients. In many cases, hours are spent in a withdrawn sleep-like state while awake during episodes. Most sleep studies have been performed while subject are near the end of their episodes. Some patients experience brief insomnia and become very happy and talkative after the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Managed {{care plans}} are widely {{credited}} with subduing medical cost inflation {{in the late}} 1980s by reducing unnecessary hospitalizations, forcing providers to discount their rates, and causing {{the health care industry}} to <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and competitive. Managed care plans and strategies proliferated and quickly became nearly ubiquitous in the U.S. However, this rapid growth led to a consumer backlash. Because many managed care health plans are provided by for-profit companies, their cost-control efforts created widespread perception that they were more interested in saving money than providing health care. In a 2004 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a majority of those polled said they believed that managed care decreased the time doctors spend with patients, made it harder for people who are sick to see specialists, and had failed to produce significant health care savings. These public perceptions have been fairly consistent in polling since 1997.|$|E

Fish is an {{integral}} part of the Maldivian diet and it is a common sight to see office workers in formal white shirts and ties on bicycles after work taking skipjack home to eat. Trolleys packed full of fresh tuna or skipjack are carted around in door to door sales. Tuna however is the most important fish, and in recent years in the Maldives the industry has <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient,</b> using tuna waste and residue to be processed into fishmeal, an animal food supplement, further contributing to the economy.

The 2014 analysis found that 60% of Americans, up from 45% in 2009, live in regions where an all-electric car produce fewer [...] equivalent emissions per mile {{than the most}} efficient hybrid. The UCS study found several reasons for the improvement. First, electric utilities have adopted cleaner sources of electricity to their mix between the two analysis. The 2014 study used electric-utility emissions based on EPA's 2010 estimates, but since coal use nationwide is down by about 5% from 2010 to 2014, actual efficiency in 2014 is better than estimated in the UCS study. Second, electric vehicles have <b>become</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient,</b> as the average 2013 all-electric vehicle used 0.33 kWh per mile, representing a 5% improvement over 2011 models. Also, some new models are cleaner than the average, such as the BMW i3, which is rated at 0.27 kWh by the EPA. An i3 charged with power from the Midwest grid would be as clean as a gasoline-powered car with about , up from [...] for the average electric car in the 2012 study. In states with a cleaner mix generation, the gains were larger. The average all-electric car in California went up to [...] equivalent from [...] in the 2012 study. States with dirtier generation that rely heavily on coal still lag, such as Colorado, where the average BEV only achieves the same emissions as a [...] gasoline-powered car. The author of the 2014 analysis noted that the benefits are not distributed evenly across the U.S. because electric car adoptions is concentrated in the states with cleaner power.|$|E
