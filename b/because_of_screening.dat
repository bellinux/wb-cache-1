Analysis of balance-sheet data indicates that while newly insured thrifts undertook less risk than their uninsured counterparts, possibly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> by deposit-insurance authorities, moral hazard emerged gradually.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate {{interference effects}} in transport across a single incompressible strip {{at the edge}} of the quantum Hall system by using a Fabry-Perot type interferometer. We find the interference oscillations in transport across the incompressible strips with local filling factors ν_c= 1, 4 / 3, 2 / 3 even at high imbalances, exceeding the spectral gaps. In contrast, there is no sign of the interference in transport across the principal Laughlin ν_c= 1 / 3 incompressible strip. This indicates, that even at fractional ν_c, the interference effects are caused by "normal" electrons. The oscillation's period is determined by the effective interferometer area, which is sensitive to the filling factors <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> effects. Comment: Final version.

These phase separation temperatures are considerably lower (approximately 6, 000 - 10, 000 K) than those found from calculations using free electron perturbation theory, and suggest that H-He solutions should be stable against phase separation in the metallic zones of Jupiter and Saturn...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to light is common to many forms of life, but eyes {{themselves}} — structures that break up environmental light according to its direction of origin — are only found in animals. At its simplest, an eye might consist of a small number of light-responsive receptors in a pigmented pit, which shadows some receptors from light in one direction, and others from a different direction (Figure 1 A). This definition distinguishes an eye from an organ with a single photoreceptor cell, which may indeed be directional <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> pigment, but which does not allow for spatial vision — the simultaneous comparison of light intensities in different directions. An alternative starting point for an eye would be for each receptor to have its own pigmented tube (Figure 2 A), the assemblage forming a convex cushion.

40|$|Dimensional {{arguments}} lead to {{say that}} N excitons {{in a sample of}} volume V behave as bosons for λ N a_x^ 3 /V ≪ 1, a_x being the exciton radius and λ a dimensionless factor. The Mott criterion, which is based on the disappearance of all exciton bound states <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening,</b> gives λ≃ 1. Since excitons feel each other through both Coulomb interaction and Pauli exclusion between their electrons and holes, criteria based on the underlying fermionic character of the exciton should be even more relevant. Two significant quantities are the boson departure 1 - [B,B^†] and boson number B^† B, where B^† is the exciton creation operator. Their expectation values in the N-exciton state are close to their boson values for λ∼ 100 and λ∼ 50, respectively. By contrast, the expectation value of B^N (B^†) ^N in the vacuum state is close to N! for 25 N^ 2 a_x^ 3 /V ≪ 1 only. This surprising N^ 2 dependence comes from the intrinsic N-body character of Pauli exclusion. Consequences of these new criteria on the Bose condensation of excitons are discussed.

40|$|Background: Clinical {{features}} of hepatocellular carcinoma patients are changing <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening.</b> Aim: To examine the clinical {{features of}} hepatocellular carcinoma patients in Hong Kong {{and validity of}} different staging systems. Methods: A total of 223 Chinese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were studied. Results: Seventy-eight percent of hepatocellular carcinoma patients had chronic hepatitis B (43 % diagnosed by screening). Hepatitis B positivity, weight loss, jaundice, encephalopathy, alpha-fetoprotein level, portal vein thrombosis, extrahepatic metastasis, and treatment were shown to be independent factors affecting survival. Of chronic hepatitis B patients, hepatitis B virus DNA levels (P = 0. 001) and portal vein thrombosis (P = 0. 008) were independent factors affecting survival. Seventy-six percent of chronic hepatitis B patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were hepatitis B e antigen negative. Screening patients had hepatocellular carcinoma detected at an earlier stage and better survival (median survival: 21 vs. 4 months, P < 0. 0001). All staging systems had good stratification of survival. Prognosis and median survival generated were different {{when compared with the}} US data. Conclusions: Chronic hepatitis B was {{the most common cause of}} hepatocellular carcinoma in Hong Kong. High-risk chronic hepatitis B patients should be followed irrespective of the hepatitis B e antigen status. Hepatitis B virus DNA levels at the time of diagnosis are an important survival predictor. Screening detected hepatocellular carcinoma at an earlier stage and prolonged survival. Staging systems should be validated in different populations. © 2006 The Authors. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|One of hight energy {{experiment}} {{main goal}} {{is the study}} of nuclear matter under extreme conditions. Ultra- relativistic Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per binary nucleon-nucleon collision could generate high enough temperature and energy density to form a new state of matter, the quark gluon plasma (QGP), where quarks and gluons would be free from strong interactions. The J/ψ is a heavy particle made of charm quarks (c ̄). The study of its production has been suggested c a QGP probe. J/ψ suppression was initially expected if a QGP was formed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>screening</b> between charm quarks within a dense colored medium. Lots of J/ψ measurements have been made at SPS (CERN) and RHIC (BNL). They have allowed to point out this suppression but also showed the presence of additional mechanisms, which lead to a more difficult interpretation of the results. The PHENIX experiment {{is the only one of}} RHIC experiments to be able to measure the J/ψ at positive √ rapidity via its disintegration into two muons. In 2007, RHIC collided Au ions at sN N = 200 GeV in the center of mass, which allowed to increase by a factor four the available statistics for J/ψ studied compared to previous published results. Such statistics, combined with the installation of new detectors in PHENIX, helped to increase previous measurements precision, and to measure new observables such as the azimuthal asymmetry of J/ψ production. This manuscript presents today understanding of quarkonia production, and the use of this probe in QGP study. The analysis that leads to the first measurement of J/ψ azimuthal anisotropy at positive rapidity in Au+Au collisions at 200 GeV per nucleon-nucleon collisions is detailed. This measurement should help understand J/ψ production mechanism, especially concerning the level of c quark recombinaison into J/ψ...|$|E
