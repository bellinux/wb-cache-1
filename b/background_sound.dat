He discounts the <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> as being music, since his analysis did not produce any sounds like percussion, a heavy bass or synthesizers. Further, he adds, there are none of the background sounds, like glasses clinking and others talking, that one would associate with a nightclub.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound mixing}} department's {{inspiration}} for the [...] "Edina hum" [...] (the frequency hiding the deformities of the townsfolk) came from executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Supervising sound editor Paul Curtis later recalled Pinkner's asking for it to sound like [...] "100-year locusts back east", consequently what the crew [...] "basically...ended up with were bugs". They also layered {{in a variety of}} machine sounds. Sound effects editor Bruce Tanis remarked that because the <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> lasted the entire episode, it had to be handled [...] "thoughtfully".|$|E

40|$|Verbal {{short-term}} memory capacity is reduced significantly during certain <b>background</b> <b>sounds.</b> Remembering {{a series of}} digits is significantly impaired by speech or music with prominent staccato passages whereas, for example, music with prominent legato passages does not disturb performance in comparison to silence. This so-called Irrelevant Sound Effect (ISE) occurs although the <b>background</b> <b>sounds</b> are irrelevant {{with respect to the}} digit sequences to be remembered. Until now, a multitude of cognitive psychological experiments explored the ISE and collected behavioral performance data during different sound conditions. The talk presents an algorithm which models performance data in ISE experiments, i. e. the detrimental impact of <b>background</b> <b>sounds</b> on memory performance. The database of this algorithm is about 50 <b>background</b> <b>sounds</b> and corresponding performance data, which have been collected in cognitive psychological experiments at the KU Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. The algorithm is based on the instrumental measuring of the hearing sensation fluctuation strength and is able to emulate the performance results in about 90 % of cases within the interquartile ranges. The algorithm will be discussed within the scope of cognitive {{short-term memory}} models, which claim to explain the ISE and with respect to practical implications. ...|$|R
500|$|Reviewers {{variously}} appreciated and {{disliked the}} voice acting. Game Revolution and Computer Games said the acting ranged from adequate to good, while CGW said the voices were inappropriate and [...] the 12th century European voices sounding like modern Americans, {{but that the}} modern-era featured better actors. ArsTechnica said the acting was inconsistent but was better than that of Deus Ex. The weather effects, <b>background</b> <b>sound,</b> and moody music were said to blend together well and help immerse the player in the game's world. CGW said the sound quality was sometimes poor.|$|E
500|$|... "Fitter Happier" [...] {{is a short}} musique concrète {{track that}} {{consists}} of sampled musical and <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> and spoken-word lyrics recited by a synthesised voice from the Macintosh SimpleText application. The voice belongs to [...] "Fred", a synthesised voice included with Macintosh computers. Yorke wrote the lyrics [...] "in ten minutes" [...] {{after a period of}} writer's block {{while the rest of the}} band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics [...] "the most upsetting thing I've ever written", and said it was [...] "liberating" [...] to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor. The band considered using [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} was {{therefore}} the first BBC radio comedy to use stereophonic techniques. Adams later {{said that before}} Hitchhiker's, stereo was deemed impossible for radio comedy and after it was made compulsory. Producer Geoffrey Perkins recalled that the technology available in 1978 for mixing sound effects at the BBC's Paris Theatre radio studio was limited. The production had one eight track tape recorder at their disposal {{and so many of}} the effects in the programme were mixed [...] "live" [...] with tape loops of <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by Radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main [...] "humanoid" [...] characters. Allegedly, Moore recorded most of his performance in a cupboard and met the other actors only after the first session was complete.|$|E

2500|$|The disco sound {{often has}} several components, a [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] beat, an eighth note (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) hi-hat pattern {{with an open}} hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, syncopated {{electric}} bass line. In most disco tracks, string sections, horns, electric piano, and electric rhythm guitars create a lush <b>background</b> <b>sound.</b> Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and lead guitar is less frequently used in disco than in rock. Many disco songs use electronic synthesizers, particularly in the late 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|... "Certainly, {{the fact}} that the game was going to be set ten years after the first BioShock {{established}} the atmosphere of BioShock 2," [...] he recalled. [...] "I really wanted the ambience to sell {{the fact that}} Rapture was constantly falling apart around the player." [...] In addition to lots of creaking and groaning sounds to accentuate the setting's disrepair, Kamper and the audio team added non-diegetic sounds that grow in frequency the closer the player gets {{to the end of the}} game to convey the mounting insanity of the Splicers. The Big Sister's sound effects were created by layering sounds from birds, hyenas, and Kamper's wife doing impressions of a dolphin. The audio team spent a great deal of time on immersing the player in their role of a Big Daddy through the audio—everything from the sound of the footsteps to the sounds for impacts and water drips on the player's armor was used to sell the player on who their character was. Audio programmer Guy Somberg created a <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> system that allowed the team to layer stereo sounds together depending on the player's location, combined with mono sound effects for certain areas. [...] "This allowed us to quickly iterate on our ambiences and implement them into the levels with ease, and helped create the randomness I was looking for in the background effects," [...] Kamper recalled. Multiplayer sounds were handled by Digital Extremes, who along with Kamper's team had to make sure their sounds cohered not only with each other's work, but with the sounds of the first game.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: A scoping review {{focused on}} <b>background</b> <b>sounds</b> and adult {{hearing-aid}} users, including aspects of aversiveness and interference. The {{aim was to}} establish the current body of knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and to suggest possible future directions for research. Design: Data were gathered using a systematic search strategy, consistent with scoping review methodology. Study sample: Searches of public databases between 1988 and 2014 returned 1182 published records. After exclusions for duplicates and out-of- scope works, 75 records remained for further analysis. Content {{analysis was used to}} group the records into five separate themes. Results: Content analysis indicated numerous themes relating to <b>background</b> <b>sounds.</b> Five broad emergent themes addressed the development and validation of outcome instruments, satisfaction surveys, assessments of hearing-aid technology and signal processing, acclimatization to the device post-fitting, and non-auditory influences on benefit and satisfaction. Conclusions: A large proportion of hearing-aid users still find particular hearing-aid features and attributes dissatisfying when listening in <b>background</b> <b>sounds.</b> Many conclusions are limited by methodological drawbacks in study design and too many different outcome instruments. Future research needs to address these issues, while controlling for hearing-aid fitting...|$|R

[...] They believe that [...] "quiet" [...] is a desirable condition of low <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> level, but what they are really searching for is the freedom from the acoustical distractions that ultimately cause annoyance. The only way to achieve true quiet would be to maintain a low <b>background</b> <b>sound</b> level with no transient sounds; a condition that requires complete isolation from all activity sounds. A better definition of [...] "quiet" [...] would be the absence of distracting sounds, not the absence of all sound. This is the definition used in sound masking.|$|E
