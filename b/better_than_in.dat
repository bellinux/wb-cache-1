5|$|After Iso died in 1881, Kanō began {{training}} in Kitō-ryū with Iikubo Tsunetoshi (Kōnen). Iikubo was expert in kata and throwing, and fond of randori. Kanō applied himself thoroughly to learning Kitō-ryū, believing Iikubo's throwing techniques {{in particular to}} be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> the schools he had previously studied. It is Iikubo who issued Kanō's only verified jūjutsu rank and teaching credential, namely a certificate of Menkyo (not Menkyo kaiden) in Nihonden Kitō Jūdō, dated October 1883.|$|E
5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh {{after being}} sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 {{in his last}} match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball, and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four.|$|E

National Road 78 between Banlung and the Vietnam border was built between 2007 and 2010; the road was expected to increase trade between Cambodia and Vietnam. There is a small airport in Banlung, but commercial flights to Ratanakiri have long been discontinued.|$|E

So, from Table 15, {{it is clear}} that out of seven algorithms, in all cases except CLPSO and TLBO, SGO is showing better result; however, with CLPSO and TLBO, SGO is showing equivalent result. From the last column of Table 15, {{it is also clear that}} SGO sometimes reaches to optimal solution.|$|R
5|$|Bondfield's brother Frank had {{established}} himself in London some years earlier as a printer and trades unionist, and in 1894, having saved £5, {{she decided to}} join him. She found London shopworking conditions no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> Brighton, but through Frank her social and political circles widened. She became {{an active member of}} the National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen, and Clerks (NUSAWC), sometimes missing church on Sundays to attend union meetings. Her political and literary education was centred on the Ideal Club, where she met Bernard Shaw, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb. Under the influence of these socialist luminaries, she joined the Fabian Society and later the Independent Labour Party (ILP).|$|E
5|$|He went to Rhodesia in April 1979 as {{the sole}} Norwegian {{observer}} of the general election, {{after he had been}} invited by the Rhodesian Department of Information. He admitted {{at the same time that}} he for years had corresponded with the Rhodesian government about how he considered various institutions and individuals in Norway, particularly in the news media. The relationship was initiated after Gjems-Onstad had written a letter of sympathy to Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith some years ahead. When in Salisbury, he met with Smith, Foreign Minister P. K. van der Byl and Head of the Military Peter Walls. Eager to participate with the government army during the Rhodesian Bush War, he was authorised by Walls to patrol with Rhodesian Security Forces around a garrison near Lake Kariba for two days. While he earlier had written he did not think democracy and human rights was optimal in the country—he considered Botswana to be one of the better countries—he considered rule of law to be <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> countries the Norwegian government had supported financially, such as Idi Amin's Uganda.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we show that if a life has new <b>better</b> <b>than</b> used <b>in</b> {{expectation}} (NBUE) ageing property and if the mean life is finite then the moment generating function exists and is finite. In fact, the moment generating function is shown to be bounded above by that of the exponential distribution with the same mean. Analogous results are also proven for two much bigger families of life distribution, namely, the new <b>better</b> <b>than</b> renewal used <b>in</b> expectation (NBRUE) and the renewal new is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> used <b>in</b> expectation (RNBUE) and the renewal new <b>better</b> <b>than</b> renewal used <b>in</b> expectation (RNBRUE), provided that the life has finite two moments.

Local people working for the OT were paid and did so voluntarily, they were only employed in the islands. The OT set a pay rate of 60% over normal civilian workers wages for Channel Island workers.

Other companies, such as Sonic Research, TC Electronic, and Planet Waves, sell highly accurate LED-based true strobe tuners. Other LED tuners have a 'strobe mode' that emulates {{the appearance of}} a strobe. However, the accuracy of these tuners in strobe mode, while sufficient for most tuning, is no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> any other mode, as they use the same technique as any basic tuner to measure frequency, only displaying {{it in a way that}} imitates a strobe tuner.|$|E

25|$|Operation Barga (and West Bengal's land {{reforms in}} general) {{have been criticized}} for their small scope and {{inability}} to solve all the major problems. This criticism has been mainly due to policies not accounting for the high landmass-population ratio in Bengal (the highest in the country), the small and highly segregated land holding patterns and failure of the Government to develop agri-industrial markets for farm produce. These failures, critics contend, have distributed poverty rather than creating prosperity. They point out that in spite of these measures, Bengal’s agricultural infrastructure and financial situation is no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>in</b> most other states.|$|E

25|$|While prisoners’ labour was {{voluntary}} at the beginning, it very quickly became mandatory, organised into kommandos. The Ministry of War even set daily work quotas.

The loss of Massie triggered a mini-collapse with Australia losing 4 for 13 {{over the next few}} overs before captain Billy Murdoch added a much-needed 29, but the last four wickets then fell for eight runs.
