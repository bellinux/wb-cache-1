50|$|Thus, in 1930, {{studying}} the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect,</b> Ștefan Procopiu discovered a circular effect of magnetic discontinuity. In 1951, this effect was named Procopiu Effect. This discovery had important {{applications in the}} development of the memory of computers.|$|E
50|$|Barkhausen's work in {{acoustics}} and magnetism {{led to the}} discovery, {{which became}} the main piece of experimental evidence supporting the domain theory of ferromagnetism proposed in 1906 by Pierre-Ernest Weiss. The <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect</b> {{is a series of}} sudden changes in the size and orientation of ferromagnetic domains, or microscopic clusters of aligned atomic magnets (spins), that occurs during a continuous process of magnetization or demagnetization. The <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect</b> offered direct evidence for the existence of ferromagnetic domains, which previously had been postulated theoretically. Heinrich Barkhausen discovered that a slow, smooth increase of a magnetic field applied to a piece of ferromagnetic material, such as iron, causes it to become magnetized, not continuously but in minute steps.|$|E

This material features extremely good electro-acoustical properties, but wears away fairly rapidly with a consequent deterioration of performance. Some higher end recorders featured heads made from ferrite, which features excellent electro-acoustical properties while being a very hard material which resists wear. Its two main disadvantages are that it is brittle and easily damaged, {{and that it has}} a much higher noise output due to the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect.</b> In more recent years, more exotic materials have appeared, some involving ceramics, which offer the best of both of the traditional materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetic}} Barkhausen Noise (BN) is {{well suited}} to evaluate the effects of mechanical stresses of ferromagnetic materials, e. g. the indirect detection of residual stress states. The most common causes for the occurrence of residual stresses are manufacturing processes, such as casting, welding, machining, forming, heat treatment, etc., consecutive repairs and design changes, and installation or assembly and overloads during the operating life of a construction. A significant calibration effort based {{on a set of}} reference values and/or test samples is needed for these measurements, which require {{a great deal of time}} and material resources. Additionally, it is impossible to determine the stress states of different components (σ xx and σ yy) at the surface. Therefore, a new auto-calibration method was developed to analyze two-dimensional stresses. A fixed calibration function based on defined parameters (determined experimentally) was applied. To adjust the auto-calibration function to the experimental reference values by varying functional parameters, a large number of measurement points were used. We present a method that can calculate, based on the multi-dimensional stress state at the measuring point, the stress components σ xx and σ yy for two perpendicular magnetization directions using the <b>Barkhausen</b> Noise <b>effect...</b>|$|R
40|$|Among {{the several}} unique {{phenomena}} observed during the irreversible domain wall motion in a ferromagnet, the <b>Barkhausen</b> and AE-type <b>effects</b> have been extensively studied {{due to their}} sensitivity to the material properties and residual stress state [1, 2]. Between these two effects, the former {{is based on the}} abrupt motion of domain walls over pinning sites and the latter is based on the progressive rearrangement of domain structure following the magnetization process. A series of acoustic noise events, which occurs almost simultaneously with the magnetic Barkhausen noise, provides a separate methodology with unique capabilities and is the base of the magnetoacoustic emission (MAE) technqiue. The practical application of the ∆E-type effect to NDE residual stress measurement involves measuring ∆F(B) /F, fractional changes in frequency of phase-locked acoustic waves as a function of net magnetic induction, and the method has been called the low-field magnetoacoustic (MAC) technique by some of us [3]...|$|R
5000|$|The {{detector}} produced electronic {{noise that}} was {{heard in the}} earphone as a [...] "hissing" [...] or [...] "roaring" [...] sound in the background, somewhat fatiguing to listen to. [...] This was Barkhausen noise due to the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect</b> in the iron. [...] As the magnetic field in a given area of the iron wire changed as it moved through the detector, the microscopic domain walls between magnetic domains in the iron moved {{in a series of}} jerks, as they got hung up on defects in the iron crystal lattice, then pulled free. Each jerk produced a tiny change in the magnetic field through the coil, and induced a pulse of noise.|$|E
5000|$|He {{discovered}} in 1919 an effect named after him, the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect,</b> which provided {{evidence for the}} magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism. [...] When the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing, the magnetization of the material changes {{in a series of}} tiny discontinuous jumps, which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron. It was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron, as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice. The energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets. This effect is widely used in research, and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains.|$|E
50|$|It is {{well known}} that various types of {{transient}} dynamics, such as quenches, exhibit spontaneous long-range behavior. In case of quenches across phase transitions, this behavior is often attributed to the proximity of criticality. At the same time, other quenches, not across a phase transition, are also known to exhibit long-range characteristics with the best known examples being the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect</b> and other realizations of the concept of crackling noise. It is intuitively appealing that theoretical explanation for the scale-free behavior in quenches must be the same disregard whether the quench is across a phase transition or not. STS offers such an explanation. Namely, transient dynamics is essentially a composite instanton and TS is intrinsically broken within instantons. Even though TS breaking within instantons is not exactly the phenomenon of the spontaneous breakdown of a symmetry by a global ground state, this effective TS breaking must also result in a scale-free behavior. This understanding is supported by the fact that condensed instantons lead to appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions. This picture of transient dynamics explains computational efficiency of the digital memcomputing machines.|$|E
5000|$|When an {{external}} magnetizing field through {{a piece of}} ferromagnetic material is changed, for example by moving a magnet toward or away from an iron bar, the magnetization of the material changes {{in a series of}} discontinuous changes, causing [...] "jumps" [...] in the magnetic flux through the iron. These can be detected by winding a coil of wire around the bar, attached to an amplifier and loudspeaker. The sudden transitions in the magnetization of the material produce current pulses in the coil, which when amplified produce a sound in the loudspeaker. This makes a crackling sound, which has been compared to candy being unwrapped, Rice Krispies, or the sound of a log fire. This sound, first discovered by German physicist Heinrich Barkhausen, is called <b>Barkhausen</b> noise. Similar <b>effects</b> can be observed by applying only mechanical stresses (e.g. bending) to the material placed in the detecting coil.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} the magnetization reversal processes on classes of complex spin networks with antiferromagnetic interactions along the network links. With slow field ramping the hysteresis loop and avalanches of spin flips occur due to topological inhomogeneity {{of the network}} without disorder. We study in detail properties of the magnetization avalanches, hysteresis curves and density of domain walls and show {{how they can be}} related to the structural inhomogeneity of the network. The cut-off size of the avalanches on the scale-free trees increases with the number of nodes, indicating that a true criticality of the hysteresis loop might occurs on this class of networks. We also study finite temperature effects on the hysteresis curves in these spin-networks.

5000|$|Due to BTW's metaphorical {{visualization}} of their model as a [...] "sandpile" [...] on which new sand grains were being slowly sprinkled to cause [...] "avalanches", {{much of the}} initial experimental work {{tended to focus on}} examining real avalanches in granular matter, the most famous and extensive such study probably being the Oslo ricepile experiment. Other experiments include those carried out on magnetic-domain patterns, the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>effect</b> and vortices in superconductors. Early theoretical work included the development of a variety of alternative SOC-generating dynamics distinct from the BTW model, attempts to prove model properties analytically (including calculating the critical exponents), and examination of the necessary conditions for SOC to emerge. One of the important issues for the latter investigation was whether conservation of energy was required in the local dynamical exchanges of models: the answer in general is no, but with (minor) reservations, as some exchange dynamics (such as those of BTW) do require local conservation at least on average. In the long term, key theoretical issues yet to be resolved include the calculation of the possible universality classes of SOC behaviour and the question of whether it is possible to derive a general rule for determining if an arbitrary algorithm displays SOC.|$|E
40|$|A careful {{examination}} of the magnetization of a ferromagnetic material reveals {{that it is a}} discontinuous process; when subject to a varying magnetic field, a ferromagnetic material is magnetized in discrete bursts as domain boundaries overcome pinning at defects in the crystal lattice. This discrete behavior manifests itself as high frequency “noise” superimposed upon a measurement of magnetic flux and is commonly referred to as the <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>Effect.</b> Several important microstructural properties of steel also depend on lattice defect structure, i. e., mechanical hardness, ferrite content, material fatigue, and internal stress state, and investigators have successfully correlated <b>Barkhausen</b> <b>Effect</b> parameters with these properties [1 – 3].

40|$|Tool {{center point}} {{calibration}} is a known problem in industrial robotics. The {{major focus of}} academic research is to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of next generation robots. However, operators of currently available robots are working {{within the limits of}} the robot´s repeatability and require calibration methods suitable for these basic applications. This study was conducted in association with Stresstech Oy, which provides solutions for manufacturing quality control. Their sensor, based on the <b>Barkhausen</b> noise <b>effect,</b> requires accurate positioning. The accuracy requirement admits a tool center point calibration problem if measurements are executed with an industrial robot. Multiple possibilities are available in the market for automatic tool center point calibration. Manufacturers provide customized calibrators to most robot types and tools. With the handmade sensors and multiple robot types that Stresstech uses, this would require great deal of labor. This thesis introduces a calibration method that is suitable for all robots which have two digital input ports free. It functions with the traditional method of using a light barrier to detect the tool in the robot coordinate system. However, this method utilizes two parallel light barriers to simultaneously measure and detect the center axis of the tool. Rotations about two axes are defined with the center axis. The last rotation about the Z-axis is calculated for tools that have different width of X- and Y-axes. The results indicate that this method is suitable for calibrating the geometric tool center point of a Barkhausen noise sensor. In the repeatability tests, a standard deviation inside robot repeatability was acquired. The Barkhausen noise signal was also evaluated after recalibration and the results indicate correct calibration.

Ej – Magnetization curves, hysteresis, <b>Barkhausen</b> {{and related}} <b>effects</b> Abstract – We obtain a general formula for the {{distribution}} of sizes of “static avalanches”, or shocks, in generic mean-field glasses with replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) saddle points. For the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin-glass it yields the density ρ(ΔM) of the sizes of magnetization jumps ΔM along the equilibrium magnetization curve at zero temperature. Continuous RSB allows for a power-law behavior ρ(ΔM) ∼ 1 /(ΔM) τ with exponent τ = 1 for SK, related to the criticality (marginal stability) of the spin-glass phase. All scales of the ultrametric phase space are implicated in jump events. Similar results are obtained for the sizes S of static jumps of pinned elastic systems, or of shocks in Burgers turbulence in large dimension. In all cases with a 1 -step solution, ρ(S) ∼ Se−AS 2.

A Fast Fourier Transform was performed on the noise data by means of a library routine on a mainframe computer and the results plotted as the power spectra of the data. The recorded voltage profile of the noise was also plotted. The system was verified by use of grain oriented silicon iron samples.

We {{have studied}} the {{magnetization}} {{of a system of}} γ-Fe 2 O 3 (0. 68 vol. %) nanoparticles isolated in an SiO 2 amorphous matrix placed in an alternating magnetic field with a frequency of 640 Hz and in the temperature range of (77 – 300) K. Compared to temperatures closer to 300 K (where the system has a superparamagnetic behaviour), at lower temperatures, the magnetization has a dynamic hysteresis loop due to the magnetization’s phase shift between the field and the magnetization. The delay of the magnetization (attributed to the Néel relaxation processes) increases with the decrease of temperature. It has been shown that the relaxation time resulting from the Néel theory is determined by an effective anisotropy constant (Keff) that takes into account the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, as well as the shape, surface and strain anisotropies. In the following we will show that the surface and strain anisotropy components have the most significant influence. When the temperature decreases from 300 to 77 K, the relative increase of the saturation magnetization of the nanoparticles is much higher than that of the (spontaneous) saturation magnetization of bulk γ-Fe 2 O 3. This increase is due to the increase of the mean magnetic diameter of the particles attached to the core of aligned spins, from 10. 16 nm to 11. 70 nm, {{as a result of the}} modification of the superexchange interaction in the surface layer.

40|$|Most {{structural}} {{components are}} made of ferromagnetic steel. The mechanical properties of steel {{are determined by the}} microstructure, texture, residual stress state, and texture are influenced, for example, by a heat treatment or hardening process. Microstructural changes are changes in the dislocation density, the phase content, and grain size. These microstructural changes determine essentially the mechanical technological properties of steels, for instance, yield strength, hardness, toughness, and residual stresses. Knowledge of micro- and macroresidual stresses is necessary to evaluate the stress condition of a component. From the various kinds of residual stresses, residual stresses of the first kind can arise due to forming under applied mechanical stress or due to the different colling rates of different cross-sections of homogeneous materials. Residual stresses of the second kind forms due to the different thermal expansion coefficients between precipitates and matrix in a two phase material. Residual stresses of a third kind appear when the lattice parameter of the second phase particles embedded coherently in the matrix and the lattice parameter of the matrix are different. Destructive test procedures for determination of microstructure state and mechanical properties, ie, mechanical hardness, need a sample preparation. X-ray techniques are well known for residual stress and texture determination, but they are time consuming and therefore expensive. With the understanding of ferromagnetic properties, especially micromagnetic theory, we are able to explain interactions between lattice imperfections and Bloch walls. Most of these studies were performed on single crystals and unalloyed polycrystalline materials. Since these studies, micromagnetism has been a most successful tool to design new magnetic nondestructive techniques. Since the early 1940 s, there have been basic investigations on microstructure and residual stress analysis by magnetic techniques. Since the 1950 s and 1960 s, when the theoretical bases of micromagnetism were laid, nondestructive methods have been derived from irreversible, magnetostrictive active Bloch wall movements. Most micromagnetic nondestructive techniques started in the 1960 s. At the end of the 1960 s, developments began on the evaluation of microstructure and stress states by means of the inductive <b>Barkhausen</b> noise <b>effect.</b> Further investigations were carried out by Pawlowski and Rulka and Tiitto. This research resulted in development of the first prototype testing devices and industrial applications. Developments since 1980 use the micromagnetic multiparameter NDE-approach for materials characterization. This technique enables a nondestructive materials characterization even under rough environmental conditions, also in the industrial praxis. Electromagnetic techniques are able to indicate nondestructively and quickly changes of residual stresses, texture, microstructure states, and mechanical properties, and are, therefore, very useful tools for materials characterization and damage assessment of in-service engineering components.
