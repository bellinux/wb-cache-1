500|$|Green {{considers}} herself nerdy: [...] "When {{people first}} meet me, they find me very cold... I keep myself at a distance, and I think that's why I'm so drawn to acting. It {{allows me to}} wear a mask". She lives alone and, by her own account, leads a low-key life when she's not working. When asked in an interview what people would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find out about her, she responded [...] "I guess people would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find out that I am {{a bit of a}} homebody. [...] I do not like clubbing or going to wild parties. [...] After a day of shooting, I love to come home and relax by the fire with a glass of wine and a good book. [...] Boring, huh?" [...] She has expressed interest in taxidermy and entomology. She collects preserved skulls and insects.|$|E
500|$|The {{second and}} third manifestos, An Open Letter to Sir Nicholas Serota and Remodernism respectively, {{were sent to the}} {{director}} of the Tate, Nicholas Serota.

500|$|The {{negative}} views towards Wollstonecraft persisted {{for over}} a century. The Rights of Woman was not reprinted {{until the middle of}} the 19th century and it still retained an aura of ill-repute. George Eliot wrote [...] "there is in some quarters a vague prejudice against the Rights of Woman as in some way or other a reprehensible book, but readers who go to it with this impression will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find it eminently serious, severely moral, and withal rather heavy".|$|E
500|$|Röyksopp {{is known}} for its {{elaborate}} concert performances. Marc Hogan of Pitchfork Media said that [...] "Those who have heard Röyksopp's two albums... won't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn the Norwegian duo's live set is much better and more raucuous than hunching next to the speakers at yer local Crate & Barrel". When performing live, the duo often appear in eccentric outfits. Ari Stein, of Electronic Beats, said, that during one particular live set, [...] "Röyksopp returned with two separate encores, one which included Berge playing [...] "Eple" [...] with a space suit capsule on his head".|$|E
500|$|Bob has no {{lines of}} {{dialogue}} {{during the first}} half of [...] "Krusty Gets Busted"; the character's only communication takes the form of a slide whistle. This was designed to make Bob appear simplistic, so that when he finally spoke, viewers would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear his sophisticated vocabulary. An early version of the script for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead selected Kelsey Grammer. For Bob's voice, Grammer performed an impression of theatre actor and director Ellis Rabb. Grammer had once worked for Rabb, whose [...] "lamenting tones became [...] foundation for Sideshow Bob".|$|E

500|$|Charles Taylor from Salon.com stated, [...] "t's {{agreeable}} {{and often}} funny, and adults who take {{their kids to}} see it might <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find themselves having a pretty good time." [...] Elvis Mitchell from The New York Times gave it a positive review, praising the film's use of [...] "creative energy", saying [...] "There hasn't been a film in years to use creative energy as efficiently as Monsters, Inc." [...] Although Mike Clark from USA Today thought the comedy was sometimes [...] "more frenetic than inspired and viewer emotions are rarely touched to any notable degree," [...] he also viewed the film as [...] "visually inventive as its Pixar predecessors." ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Levine has stated: [...] "verything that's {{written and}} {{performed}} {{and put together}} pretty much comes from us. I just think people would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> know that we’re a self-contained unit. We’re a band that does their own thing. There’s no puppet master." [...] However, in {{an article about the}} songwriter and producer Benny Blanco, it is revealed {{that at least some of}} the band's songs, such as [...] "Moves like Jagger," [...] are the product of efforts by, or collaborations with, professional songwriters and producers. In the same article, Levine says, [...] "It's almost as if [...] has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He's about the collaboration. And he's so good at nailing down who does everything best." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison, meanwhile, {{struggled}} {{to keep up with}} the demands of Henry Clay and others who sought offices and influence in his administration. Harrison's old age and fading health were no secret during the campaign, and the question of the presidential succession was on every politician's mind. The first few weeks of the presidency took a toll on Harrison's health, and after being caught in a rainstorm in late March he came down with pneumonia and pleurisy. Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent word to Tyler of Harrison's illness on April 1; two days later, Richmond attorney James Lyons wrote with the news that the president had taken a turn for the worse, remarking that [...] "I shall not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear by tomorrow's mail that Gen'l Harrison is no more." [...] Tyler determined not to travel to Washington, not wanting to appear unseemly in anticipating the president's death. At dawn on April 5, Webster's son Fletcher, Chief Clerk of the State Department, arrived at Tyler's plantation with a letter from Webster, informing the new president of Harrison's death the morning before.|$|E

500|$|... "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] was lauded {{by music}} critics. Parisien called the song [...] "a year-long banger", complimenting its {{instrumentation}} and melody. Steve Morse, editor of The Boston Globe, wrote that Carey sang {{with a lot}} of soul. According to Barry Schwartz from Stylus Magazine, [...] "to say this song is an instant classic somehow doesn't capture its amazingicity; it's a modern standard: joyous, exhilarating, loud, with even a hint of longing." [...] Schwartz praised the song's lyrics as well, describing them as [...] "beautifully phrased," [...] and calling Carey's voice [...] "gorgeous" [...] and [...] "sincere." [...] Kyle Anderson from MTV labeled the track [...] "a majestic anthem full of chimes, sleigh bells, doo-wop flourishes, sweeping strings {{and one of the most}} dynamic and clean vocal performances of Carey's career". While reviewing the 2009 remix version, Becky Bain from Idolator called the song a [...] "timeless classic" [...] and wrote, [...] "We love the original song to pieces—we blast it while decorating our Christmas tree and lighting our Menorah." [...] In his review for Carey's Merry Christmas II You, Thomas Connor from the Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "a simple, well-crafted chestnut and one of the last great additions to the Christmas pop canon". Shona Craven of Scotland's The Herald, said, [...] " [...] a song of optimism and joy that maybe, just maybe, hints at the real meaning of Christmas." [...] Additionally, she felt the main reason it was so successful is the subject [...] "you" [...] in the lyrics, explaining, [...] "Perhaps what makes the song such a huge hit is the fact that it's for absolutely everyone." [...] Craven opened her review with a bold statement: [...] "Bing Crosby may well be turning in his grave, but no child of the 1980s will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see Mariah Carey's sublime All I Want For Christmas Is You bounding up the charts after being named the nation's top festive song." [...] In a 2006 retrospective look at Carey's career, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker said, the [...] "charming" [...] song was one of Carey's biggest accomplishments, calling it [...] "one of the few worthy modern additions to the holiday canon". Dan Hancox, editor of The National, quoted and agreed with Jones' statement, calling the song [...] "perfection". In 2010, Rolling Stone ranked [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] fourth on its Greatest Rock and Roll Christmas Songs list, calling it a [...] "holiday standard." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1999, Callaghan told The Oldie Magazine that {{he would}} not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> be {{considered}} as Britain's worst Prime Minister in 200 years. He also admitted in this interview that he [...] "must carry the can" [...] for the Winter of Discontent.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the ninth}} {{episode of the}} [...] of Sex and the City, [...] "Sex and the Country" [...] (2001), Carrie goes with her new boyfriend Aidan to his cottage, and informs her friends that it reminds her of Animal Farm, and would not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear an {{outburst}} of [...] "four legs good, two legs bad!" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{think that}} a lot of fans would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> know just how much of a free hand we have been given in the making of this movie. I know how easy it is to see every {{decision}} to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always much more to do with pacing and rhythm in the film itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Further {{extensive}} modifications {{were made}} for the second voyage of HMS Beagle. Darwin noted in his journal in April 1833 that [...] "It blew half a gale of wind; but it was fair & we scudded before it. — Our decks fully deserved their nickname of a [...] "half tide rock"; so constantly did the water flow over them", but John Lort Stokes who was on all three survey expeditions praised the Beagle: [...] "The reader will <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn that she belongs to that much-abused class, the '10-gun brigs'—coffins, as they are not infrequently designated in the service; notwithstanding which, she has proved herself, under every possible variety of trial, {{in all kinds of}} weather, an excellent sea boat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late August 1995, after expressing to Sting that {{he wanted}} to leave the WWF, Luger got a call from WCW Vice-President Eric Bischoff to set up a meeting about a {{contract}} and Luger possibly [...] "jumping ship". Bischoff was initially reluctant to make the offer, as he did not care for Luger personally or professionally, but relented due to both Sting's urging, and the idea that his appearance would make a big splash. Bischoff offered Luger only $150,000 a year, 20% of what he was making when he left WCW three years earlier, in a deliberate attempt to have him turn down the offer (and, according to Bischoff, [...] "at least tell Sting that I tried"), only to <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see that Luger accepted the offer.|$|E

2500|$|Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore {{appointed}} Tareq in 2000 to {{a three-year}} term on the Virginia Wine Board. At {{the conclusion of}} that term, Virginia Governor Mark Warner nominated Tareq {{as chairman of the}} Virginia Wine Tourism Office. Tareq was one of 15 board members of the Virginia Tourism Corporation, a [...] "board that shapes Virginia's tourism policy", appointed by Gov. Tim Kaine in 2006. Kaine told MSNBC:Tareq had served on the state's wine board under both Gov. Gilmore and Gov. Warner, and when his term on the wine board finished, he and the tourism board wanted him on that board because he's a great promoter—you won't <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear me say that.During his time in office the Virginia Wineway, Loudoun Wine Trail, Blue Ridge Wineway and Virginia Wineries Alliance were created, attracting, according to a USDA study, 980,000 wine tourists to the state, of which 336,000 visited Piedmont wineries.|$|E
2500|$|Lee {{eventually}} became the consensus {{candidate of the}} federalists, overcoming competition from like minded men including relative Ludwell Lee, William Fitzhugh, Martin Pickett, {{as well as two}} friends - Leven Powell and Dr. David Stuart. Opposing him for the anti-federalists was state Senator John Pope. Though there is little primary material describing the tenor of this first election, what does exist hints at a hard fought and sometimes dirty campaign. John Pope was called [...] "contemptible" [...] in a letter from John Murray to Horatio Gates, and William Allason writing to John Woodcock described the contest: [...] "I understand one makes very free with the other's Reputation [...] by wch. I would not <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear of their having Exchanged a few dry blows." [...] Lee eventually outpolled Pope, defeating him nearly 4 to 1 in Fairfax County alone, which included the vote of George Washington.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly {{noticed a}} {{connection}} between Daniel and Imogen in their first scenes together and Phillipps told him that something could happen between them in the future. He continued, [...] "Imogen gets into twists and gets very worked up about things and Daniel just doesn't get it. He finds it really funny and thinks that Imogen is super sweet. He doesn't get why she finds stuff so frustrating, but he really loves that about her as well." [...] Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, {{but it was too}} big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed [...] "a great chummy friendship", so he thought Daniel would <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> learn that Imogen has feelings for him.|$|E
