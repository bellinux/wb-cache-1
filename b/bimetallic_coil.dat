50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular meat thermometers are used to aid in cooking meat to a safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a <b>bimetallic</b> <b>coil,</b> or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Conversion {{of solar}} energy to {{mechanical}} power {{through the use}} of thermostatic bimetals and linear Fresnel lenses was found to be both theoretically and experimentally feasible. Using linear Fresnel lenses to concentrate sunlight on <b>bimetallic</b> <b>coils</b> caused a simple sun powered motor to produce rotational shaft power. However, continuous rotational motion could not be sustained. Efficient energy transfer through the Fresnel lenses and the ability of the bimetal to absorb and dissipate solar energy were determined to be critical factors limiting motor operation. Several developments were suggested by the experiment which may improve overall energy efficiency of the motor and possibly create continuous rotational motion. Both thermostatic bimetals and linear Fresnel lenses appear to have a promising future in the field of solar energy conversion. Further research may reveal many practical applications for the sun powered motor and its component parts...|$|R
40|$|A {{passive solar}} array {{orientation}} device, called a thermal heliotrope, is described, and several terrestrial applications are illustrated. The thermal heliotrope {{consists of a}} <b>bimetallic</b> helical <b>coil</b> {{that serves as the}} motor element, producing torque and angular displacement. A control mechanism in the form of one or more shades completes the basic device. In comparison with electromechanical tracking systems, the thermal heliotrope is electrically passive, has relatively few parts, and is low cost. After describing the principle of operation and several models built for space applications, the design considerations for several terrestrial thermal heliotrope units are presented. It is suggested that the use of the thermal heliotrope for solar array orientation could significantly reduce array cost, thereby increasing the competitive economic posture of solar arrays for terrestrial applications. The thermal heliotrope modified for terrestrial use is readily adaptable to orient solar energy concentrators, such as furnaces and stills...|$|R
40|$|A {{vacuum chamber}} for the VW SASE FEL undulatory at the TESLA Test Facility (TTF) was designed, a {{prototype}} was built and tested, and seven complete chambers were manufactured. The chambers use the aluminum extrusion technology {{developed for the}} insertion device vacuum chambers of the Advanced Photon Source. Each chamber is 4. 5 m long with a beam aperture of 9. 5 mm and an external thickness of 11. 5 mm. Three of the chambers include ports for integral beam position monitors (10 horizontal and vertical pairs) inserted into the chambers, {{and all of the}} chambers include grooves for mounting correction <b>coils.</b> <b>Bimetallic</b> flanges (stainless steel to aluminum) are welded {{to the ends of the}} chamber for connection to the beamline.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{undertaken}} by Michigan Technological University and Special Metals Corporation to develop creep-resistant, coking-resistant oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) tubes {{for use in}} industrial-scale ethylene pyrolysis and steam methane reforming operations. Ethylene pyrolysis tubes are exposed {{to some of the}} most severe service conditions for metallic materials found anywhere in the chemical process industries, including elevated temperatures, oxidizing atmospheres and high carbon potentials. During service, hard deposits of carbon (coke) build up on the inner wall of the tube, reducing heat transfer and restricting the flow of the hydrocarbon feedstocks. About every 20 to 60 days, the reactor must be taken off-line and decoked by burning out the accumulated carbon. This decoking costs on the order of $ 9 million per year per ethylene plant, accelerates tube degradation, and requires that tubes be replaced about every 5 years. The technology developed under this program seeks to reduce the energy and economic cost of coking by creating novel bimetallic tubes offering a combination of improved coking resistance, creep resistance and fabricability not available in current single-alloy tubes. The inner core of this tube consists of Incoloy(R) MA 956, a commercial ferritic Fe-Cr-Al alloy offering a 50 % reduction in coke buildup combined with improved carburization resistance. The outer sheath consists of a new material - oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Alloy 803 (R) developed under the program. This new alloy retains the good fireside environmental resistance of Alloy 803, a commercial wrought alloy currently used for ethylene production, and provides an austenitic casing to alleviate the inherently-limited fabricability of the ferritic Incoloy(R) MA 956 core. To provide mechanical compatibility between the two alloys and maximize creep resistance of the bimetallic tube, both the inner Incoloy(R) MA 956 and the outer ODS Alloy 803 are oxide dispersion strengthened materials produced using mechanical alloying technology. To minimize cost, the bimetallic tube is produced by direct powder co-extrusion. This technology has potential for domestic energy savings of up to 4. 1 trillion BTU/year (4. 3 x 1015 J/year) and a reduction of 370, 000 tons (340, 000 tonnes) of CO 2 emissions in short-residence-time ethylene furnaces. This represents an energy savings and CO 2 emissions reduction of about 3. 3 %. If the technology is also applied to other types of ethylene pyrolysis furnaces, total energy savings and CO 2 emissions reductions could increase by up to five times. The work involved: Developing powder and consolidation processing protocols to produce an oxide-dispersion strengthened variant of Alloy 803 exhibiting creep strength comparable to Incoloy? Alloy MA 956, Developing a direct powder co-extrusion protocol for fabricating co-extruded bimetallic Incoloy? Alloy MA 956 / ODS Alloy 803 tubes, Characterizing the properties of the ODS Alloy 803 material, the welding characteristics of the bimetallic tubes, and the coking characteristics of the Incoloy? MA 956 alloy, and Documenting the potential energy savings and user requirements for these bimetallic pyrolysis furnace tubes. The project demonstrated that oxide dispersion strengthened Alloy 803 can be produced successfully using conventional mechanical alloying technology. The oxide dispersion strengthened <b>bimetallic</b> radiant <b>coil</b> technology explored under this program has significant potential for energy savings and productivity improvements for domestic ethylene producers. In today's competitive market, however, domestic furnace manufacturers and ethylene producers appear reluctant to pay any cost premium for higher-performance coil materials offering either higher temperature capabilities or longer service life. Interest in oxide dispersion strengthened radiant coils is likely to increase if furnace and ethylene producers begin to focus more on increasing tube wall temperatures to improve productivity...|$|R
