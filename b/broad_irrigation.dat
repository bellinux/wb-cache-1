At a time when most cities dumped their untreated wastes directly into rivers and the sea, Mansergh advised treatment of Melbourne's sewage by <b>broad</b> <b>irrigation</b> with a capacity large enough able to deal with the expansion in population expected over 50 years. The system he conceived and which was implemented in only slightly modified form began with a water closet at every property which delivered the sewage by gravity through a network of underground sewers of increasing diameter to a steam pumping station at Spotswood where it was forced up wrought iron rising mains to Brooklyn to begin its 25 kilometre journey along the Main Outfall Sewer to the sewage farm at Werribee.|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} characteristics of six heavy metals and metalloid in soil of Zhuji Lipu copper mining area, Zhejiang Province, was studied by using geostatistics approaches combined with GIS. These elements included Pb, As, Cr, Cu, Zn and Ni. The statistical analyses showed that concentrations {{of these elements}} were lognormal distribution. Concentrations of Pb, As, Cu, Zn and Ni were strongly correlated with each other indicating that these elements in soils may be from the same pollution source. However, accumulation of Cr was unique with its geometric mean being close {{to that in the}} control soil. This indicates that Cr content was mainly influenced by soil factors. The Kriging method was applied to estimate the unobserved points. The Kriging interpolation maps reflected significant {{spatial distribution}} of these elements as influenced by both pollution and geological factors. The present study indicated that GIS based geostatistics method could accurately analyze the spatial variation of heavy metals and metalloid in the mining area. Overall, higher concentrations of heavy metals and metalloid were found in the center of both the north and south sides. The content of copper in the south was significantly higher than that in the north due to paddy field land uses. In addition, the terrain of four terraces tilted to the center and the <b>broad</b> <b>irrigation</b> accident occurred in the 4 th trench in the south of sampling area were also contributed to the higher concentrations of these elements...|$|E
40|$|This Research Report {{chronicles the}} {{evolution}} of thinking on water productivity in the research agenda of IWMI and in the <b>broader</b> <b>irrigation</b> literature over the past 20 years. It describes {{the origins of the}} concept and the methodological developments, its operationalization through applied research, and some lessons learned over the two decades of research. This report further highlights how a focus on agricultural water productivity has brought greater attention to critical water scarcity issues, and the role of agricultural water management in supporting broader development objectives such as increasing agricultural production, reducing agricultural water use, raising farm-level incomes, and alleviating poverty and inequity. Yet, reliance on a single-factor productivity metric, such as agricultural water productivity defined as “crop per drop,” in multi-factor and multi-output production processes can mask the complexity of agricultural systems as well as the trade-offs required to achieve desired outcomes. The findings from this retrospective underscore the limitations of single-factor productivity metrics while also highlighting opportunities to support more comprehensive approaches to address water scarcity concerns and, ultimately, achieve the broader development objectives.

50|$|The total planned {{budget of}} Rs.2069 crore(2378 crore later) was {{allocated}} to seven <b>broad</b> areas: <b>irrigation</b> and energy (27.2%), agriculture {{and community development}} (17.4%), transport and communications (24%), industry (8.4%), social services (16.64%), land rehabilitation (4.1%), and for other sectors and services (2.5%). The most important feature of this phase was active role of state in all economic sectors. Such a role was justified at that time because immediately after independence, India was facing basic problems—deficiency of capital and low capacity to save.|$|R
50|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of the area were the Tkai'waichash-hlama, a band or tribe of Native American people who lived along Cowiche Creek. The area was settled {{in the late nineteenth}} century by farmers who relied upon crops that did not require irrigation, such as wheat, barley, rye, and grazing cattle. Homesteading in Cowiche was difficult since fields had to be cleared of volcanic rock before they could be tilled and there was little rainfall in summer. In 1906, construction began on the Tieton Irrigation Project, a division of the <b>broader</b> Yakima Project. <b>Irrigation</b> water became available in 1907, and shortly thereafter, orchards began to replace wheatfields.|$|R

Soybean farmers, {{initially}} in the USA {{and more}} recently in Argentina, rapidly accepted these varieties. Roundup Ready soybeans were commercialised in South Africa in 1999. Since then Roundup Ready maize, canola and cotton have also been induced in the USA. The introduction of Roundup Ready technology {{may be viewed as}} a disruptive technology. This innovative technology emerged 25 years after the discovery of the non-selective herbicide (glyphosate) that is now selective in maize, cotton, soybeans and other crops. This means that the crops are now (due to genetic modification) tolerant to this herbicide, but that weeds remained susceptible. In light of the introduction of Roundup Ready maize into the South African market in 2004, and the subsequent influence thereof on the South African maize herbicide market, the objectives of this research is to: evaluate the influence of Roundup Ready maize on the South African maize herbicide market; determine which benefit, contributed by Roundup Ready maize, is ranked to be the most and to be least important as perceived by maize growers; propose strategies to maximize Roundup Ready maize adoption amongst maize growers; and to propose strategies for the sustainable marketing of conventional herbicide program in conjunction with Roundup Ready maize programs. A total number of 260 respondents were telephonically interviewed, covering I 98 415 hectares which represents 7 % of the total maize plantings in South Africa. The most significant results are that: > 60 % of the respondents believe that weed infestation have a fair to serious influence on maize yield; 60 % of respondents apply herbicides on the total soil surface; > 60 % of the respondents rely on triazine containing herbicides; the dominant weed types in the West are <b>broad</b> leaf weeds, <b>irrigation</b> area is grasses and East is a 50 / 50 split between these two types; more than 50 % of the respondents have weed control costs exceeding R 2 OO/hectare; less than 80 % respondents believe that their current weed control program's efficacy is more than 90 %; respondents believe that the use of residual herbicides will decrease with 37. 6 % due to Roundup Ready maize; 95 % of first users of Roundup Ready are satisfied. The biggest perceived benefit is the broad spectrum of weed control; 8 % of respondents indicated that they will already plant Roundup Ready maize in 2004 / 05; > 75 % of the respondents will plant RR/YG, but price is the major influence factor; and demand for Roundup Ready maize and the stacked hybrid is relatively elastic. The following recommendations were derived: weed control costs increase in the order - dry land West 60 % of the respondents believe that weed infestation have a fair to serious influence on maize yield; 60 % of respondents apply herbicides on the total soil surface; > 60 % of the respondents rely on triazine containing herbicides; the dominant weed types in the West are <b>broad</b> leaf weeds, <b>irrigation</b> area is grasses and East is a 50 / 50 split between these two types; more than 50 % of the respondents have weed control costs exceeding R 2 OO/hectare; less than 80 % respondents believe that their current weed control program's efficacy is more than 90 %; respondents believe that the use of residual herbicides will decrease with 37. 6 % due to Roundup Ready maize; 95 % of first users of Roundup Ready are satisfied.

The following recommendations were derived: weed control costs increase in the order - dry land West < dry land East < irrigation and also low <fair < serious infestation. Due to these differences, marketing need to be focused on segments in which the greatest customer value can be created and sustained over time; the positioning should be along the benefits as perceived by the maize growers. These include, firstly, the broad-spectrum weed control (main benefit), secondly the control of difficult weeds and thirdly flexibility of the programme; the demographics section reflected that the Roundup Ready growers are < 50 years of age and have higher education levels and are subsequently more receptive than later adopters or non-adopters. Marketing efforts should be directed at these two categories; the growth stage will be entered next season (05 / 06), in which sales will start climbing quickly. Stacked hybrid (RR/YG) need to be released in this stage to drive the growth. The early adopters will continue to buy and will be followed by late adopters. The marketing objective now is to create product awareness and to get as many growers as possible to test the technology. A total of 95 % of first time users are satisfied and will use the technology again. High intensify sales promotion to create awareness and perception of optimum weed control programme; price elasticity of demand should be taken into account when new prices are set. Due to the bigger demand than supply (seed shortage) that is expected over the next two to three years, both companies could ignore this elasticity and maintain value-based pricing. Demand for the stacked hybrid is relatively elastic. The recommended technology fee should be R 500 /bag. The fee for the Roundup Ready maize should remain R 270 /bag; the perception of Roundup Ready growers is that the use of residual herbicides in maize production will decrease by 44. 6 % due to the introduction of this technology. This will come mainly at the expense of atrazine and atrazine-containing products. The focus needs to move to the promotion of high qualify acetanilide herbicides as part of the Roundup Ready weed control programme to ensure success. Residual herbicides will also be a valuob 1 e tool in resistance management. Master...|$|R
