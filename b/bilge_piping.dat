25|$|In March2015, {{the ship}} was brought to Vigor Industrial's dry dock in Portland, Oregon for maintenance, {{including}} repairs to the Azipod units. During the refit, maintenance was performed on its bow thrusters and stabilizers, {{as well as the}} Azipod units, ballast and <b>bilge</b> <b>piping</b> were replaced, a low-resistance silicone paint aimed at increasing fuel efficiency was applied to the hull, and the release mechanisms for the lifeboat tenders were upgraded. The Norwegian Stars dining and entertainment spaces were also renovated and digital signage, first introduced on the Norwegian Breakaway, was installed.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{two years}} later, {{beginning}} on 17March 1986, Iowa underwent her overdue InSurv inspection {{under the supervision}} of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley. The ship failed the inspection. Among many other deficiencies, the ship was unable to achieve her top speed of [...] during a full-power engine run. Other problems discovered included hydraulic fluid leaks in all three main gun turrets, totaling [...] per turret per week, Cosmoline (anticorrosion lubricant) which had not been removed from all the guns, deteriorated <b>bilge</b> <b>piping,</b> frequent shorts in the electrical wiring, pump failures, unrepaired soft patches on high-pressure steam lines, and frozen valves in the ship's firefighting system. [...] Bulkeley personally recommended to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), Admiral James Watkins, and the Secretary of the Navy, John Lehman, that Iowa be taken out of service immediately. Lehman, who had advocated bringing the Iowa-class ships out of mothballs, did not take the ship out of service, but instructed the leaders of the Atlantic Fleet to ensure that Iowas deficiencies were corrected.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a plethora of {{research}} papers published on the microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) of carbon and stainless steels in which the association between the presence of various microbes and drastically increased corrosion rates have been demonstrated. MIC attack has been observed {{in a wide variety}} of situations including the <b>bilges,</b> <b>piping</b> and tanks of maritime vessels. This paper will present results of recent tests carried out on bilge waters from Australian naval vessels to investigate the potential for MIC in these waters. The work undertaken has included the use of test kits to identify the presence of MIC related bacteria in bilge waters and the use of sampled bilge water in laboratory tests (including SEM/EDS, weight loss, and pit depth measurements) on a range of steel compositions...|$|R
