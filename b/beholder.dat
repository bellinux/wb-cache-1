5|$|On February 10, 2017, Santa Anita {{announced}} that it was renaming the Vanity Stakes, which she won in 2016, as the <b>Beholder</b> Mile Stakes. <b>Beholder</b> won 14 races at Santa Anita during her career.|$|E
5|$|As a yearling, <b>Beholder</b> was {{consigned}} by the Clarkland Farm to {{the sale}} at Keeneland in September 2011, where she was bought for $180,000 by B. Wayne Hughes' Spendthrift Farm. At age two, the filly was sent into training with California-based trainer Richard Mandella.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beholder</b> (foaled May 9, 2010) is an American Thoroughbred race {{horse and}} {{multiple}} Eclipse Award winner. She was purchased as a yearling by B. Wayne Hughes of Spendthrift Farm. She had an early {{reputation for being}} difficult to handle, but trainer Richard Mandella worked extensively with the fractious young horse, gradually developing her from a temperamental front-runner into a seasoned veteran who could be placed in strategic positions.|$|E

50|$|Based on Tom Wham's {{depiction}} in {{the first}} edition Monster Manual, TSR artist Keith Parkinson characterized its popular appearance with plate-like armored scales and arthropod-like eyestalks. Jeff Grubb cites Keith Parkinson's artwork as {{the inspiration for the}} beholder-kin created for the Spelljammer campaign setting. The <b>Beholder's</b> xenophobia towards other subraces of <b>Beholders</b> was added after Jim Holloway submitted multiple designs for the <b>Beholder's</b> spelljamming ship and Jeff Grubb decided to keep them all and used xenophobia to explain the differences in design style.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s, after Per Bak Jensen {{had joined}} the {{teaching}} staff at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, {{it was clear that}} photography had been accepted as an art form.

25|$|Reisser's works {{want to put}} the <b>beholder</b> under a spell and meanwhile, {{following}} the creative, dionysian body of thought, search for the transgression of limits. On the contrary the works are full of clarity, orderliness and structure. The transgression of limits that is reached through the works becomes a self-discovery and the works ultimately become self-portraits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beholders</b> {{served as}} living {{artillery}} during the Daelkyr incursion, using the terrible {{power of their}} eyes to shatter whole goblin armies. In Eberron, <b>beholders</b> do not reproduce naturally and have not created a culture of their own—they are simply the immortal servants of the daelkyr. Most continue to serve their masters, commanding subterranean outposts of aberrations or serving as the hidden leaders of various Cults of the Dragon Below. Others lead solitary lives, contemplating mysteries or studying the world. Such lone <b>beholders</b> may manipulate humanoid communities, but their actions are rarely driven by a desire for personal power.|$|R

25|$|Also in 1994, Koshiro co-composed a {{well known}} soundtrack for the Mega-CD version of Eye of the <b>Beholder,</b> a dungeon crawl {{role-playing}} video game ported {{over from the}} original by Japanese developer Opera House and published by Sega. That same year, his soundtrack for Beyond Oasis utilized a late romantic style of music, which he later also utilized for Legend of Oasis (1996), Merregnon (2000), and Warriors of the Lost Empire (2007).|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} two Knightmare {{computer}} games released: {{the first was}} in 1987, released on the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64; and the second Knightmare game in 1991, released on the Amiga and Atari ST. A PC version was proposed for 1995, but the plan was abandoned when the series finished. The latter game was an RPG similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye Of The <b>Beholder</b> games which, whilst well received at the time, had {{very little to do}} with the TV series besides the fantasy setting.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) {{are just as important}} as the whole. Yet, the total image, greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the <b>beholder.</b> The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter.|$|E

25|$|According to this theory, coolness is a subjective, dynamic, socially-constructed trait, {{such that}} coolness {{is in the}} eye of the <b>beholder.</b> People {{perceive}} things (e.g., other people, products or brands) to be cool based on an inference of “autonomy”. That is, something is perceived to be cool when it follows its own motivations. However, this theory proposes that the level of autonomy that leads to coolness is constrained - inappropriate levels of autonomy, such that the autonomy is too high or opposes a legitimate norm, do not lead to perceptions of coolness. The level of autonomy considered appropriate is influenced by individual difference variables. For example, people who think of societal institutions and authority as unjust or repressive perceive coolness at higher levels of autonomy than those who are less critical of social norms and authority.|$|E
25|$|Picasso was {{resolved}} {{to undo the}} continuities of form and field which Western art had so long taken for granted. The famous stylistic rupture at right {{turned out to be}} merely a consummation. Overnight, the contrived coherences of representational art - the feigned unities of time and place, the stylistic consistencies - all were declared to be fictional. The Demoiselles confessed itself a picture conceived in duration and delivered in spasms. In this one work Picasso discovered that the demands of discontinuity could be met on multiple levels: by cleaving depicted flesh; by elision of limbs and abbreviation; by slashing the web of connecting space; by abrupt changes of vantage; and by a sudden stylistic shift at the climax. Finally, the insistent staccato of the presentation was found to intensify the picture's address and symbolic charge: the <b>beholder,</b> instead of observing a roomfuI of lazing whores, is targeted from all sides. So far from suppressing the subject, the mode of organization heightens its flagrant eroticism.|$|E
25|$|After {{navigating}} a {{gauntlet of}} traps they face and kill Karne, and then advance {{to find the}} guild master, the <b>beholder</b> Xantam (Tony Jay). He reveals the guild {{is only a small}} part of a much greater whole. They fight and kill him, and Jherek asks them to enter a portal which Xantam was guarding. The portal transports them to the Sunset Mountains, whereupon they head to a dwarf mining village, which is being oppressed by drow elves. They light a signal fire atop a nearby mountain, calling for aid from neighboring dwarven clans, and then enter the mines to rout the drow. After killing the drow priestess, they rescue a dwarven Harper, who tells them of another portal in the mountains. He also tells them that troops and monsters are planning to use the portals to move from the mountains into Baldur's Gate, attacking the city from within. The adventurers head to the portal, finding it guarded by the ice dragon Ciraxis. They slay him and pass through the portal into the Marsh of Chelimber.|$|E

25|$|Like many medieval {{works of}} art, the Madonna {{displays}} {{a very complex}} iconography. The statue shows the Virgin in a rather plain gown, while the oversized Christ child figure in her lap wears a precious pontifical gown. The size is meant to illustrate the importance of Christ as redeemer. In contrast Mary is depicted in a serving role, in accordance with Luke 1:38: And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. At {{the same time she}} embodies the Seat of Wisdom as the Throne of Solomon is described in 1 Kings 10:18: Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. Sitting on her lap is the Christ child, whose ornate chasuble betokens his significance as ruler of the heavens, the book his role as herald of the faith. Bearing in mind other medieval portrayals of Christ as teacher, it may be supposed that the child’s lost right arm was originally raised in a gesture of blessing. However, Christ’s face is turned towards his mother, while from any position Mary’s look seems directed towards the <b>beholder.</b> Thus Mary may arguably not only be interpreted as a passive devotee but also assumes the role of mediator between the people and the Redeemer.|$|E
25|$|To Spain and the Teutonic {{countries}} of Europe {{we look for}} the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent altar-piece in Schleswig cathedral was carved by Hans Bruggerman, and consists, like many others, {{of a number of}} panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from Beauvais, there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being {{a good example of the}} style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and Alonso Cano and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the <b>beholder.</b> Triptychs and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the Lord's Supper, and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni& applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.|$|E
500|$|In her 2016 debut, Stevens {{was once}} again in the saddle, and <b>Beholder</b> won the Adoration Stakes {{for the second time in}} {{succession}} at Santa Anita Park on May 8, the day after the 2016 Kentucky Derby. This was her seventh straight victory in 16 wins overall, of which 14 were stakes wins. On June 4, <b>Beholder</b> appeared to be facing a much sterner task when she took on the 2015 American Champion three-year-old filly Stellar Wind in the Grade I Vanity Mile at Santa Anita. In a slowly run race, Stevens tracked the early leader, Lost Bus, before taking the lead on the turn and winning [...] "effortlessly" [...] by one and a half lengths from Stellar Wind. With this Grade I win, <b>Beholder</b> tied the record of John Henry in winning a Grade I race for five years in a row. However, Stellar Wind turned the tables on <b>Beholder</b> in the 2016 Clement L. Hirsch Stakes, held on July 30, edging <b>Beholder</b> by a half-length in a stretch duel.|$|E

500|$|Three weeks later, <b>Beholder</b> {{faced an}} all-star field in {{her return to}} the Pacific Classic on August 20. [...] The field {{included}} her first showdown with 2014 horse of the year California Chrome, as well as Dortmund, whose only career defeats had been to California Chrome and American Pharoah. She also faced Imperative and Hoppertunity, both of whom she had defeated in the previous year's race. [...] <b>Beholder</b> was third favorite on the morning line behind Chrome and Dortmund. California Chrome got the number one post position in the nine-horse field, viewed as an unfavorable draw for him, while <b>Beholder</b> obtained a favorable post at number seven, with Dortmund to her outside. Mandella felt she had trained strongly since her previous loss {{and was ready to}} go. [...] <b>Beholder</b> broke cleanly and remained second, stalking California Chrome, who led throughout the entire race. [...] She stalked the pace closely until the mile pole, at which point the stallion pulled ahead of the field and won by five lengths. [...] <b>Beholder</b> finished [...] lengths ahead of third-place Dortmund. [...] Stevens described her race as a [...] "gutty performance" [...] and Mandella stated, [...] "she ran really good, just second best." [...] Both jockey and trainer expressed respect for the performance of the winner.|$|E
500|$|In October {{she started}} the 2-5 {{favorite}} for the Zenyatta Stakes at Santa Anita. After leading {{for most of the}} way she was headed in the final furlong and beaten a neck by Stellar Wind with the pair finishing more than eleven lengths clear of the other three runners. On November 4, in what was scheduled to be her final racecourse appearance before her retirement, <b>Beholder</b> made her first appearance in the Breeders' Cup since 2013 when she once again contested the Distaff at Santa Anita. Stellar Wind was again challenging, but the odds-on favorite was the undefeated three-year-old Songbird. <b>Beholder,</b> coming off three losses, was third in the betting odds. From the outside post position of the eight-horse field, <b>Beholder</b> tracked the leaders before moving alongside Songbird on the final turn. The pair engaged in a prolonged struggle in the straight before <b>Beholder</b> prevailed by a scant nose in a photo-finish. Stevens described the race by saying, [...] "I've been in battles before, but never the length of the stretch [...] [...] [...] definitely {{a quarter of a mile}} of just a street fight." [...] With her win, she tied Goldikova as one of only two horses to have ever won three Breeders' Cup Championships in the history of the series.|$|E
500|$|After a {{break of}} almost four months, <b>Beholder</b> {{returned}} in the Torrey Pines Stakes over one mile at Del Mar on September 1, {{where she was}} ridden {{for the first time}} by Gary Stevens. She started the 1–10 favorite and led all the way, winning from second-place finisher Wittgenstein. Four weeks later, <b>Beholder</b> was matched against older fillies and mares in the Grade I Zenyatta Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita. She led from the start and won, with the six-year-old veteran Authenticity in second. Mandella called the winner [...] "a filly that really likes the fight" [...] while Stevens said that [...] "I haven't gotten close to the bottom of her yet". On November 1, <b>Beholder</b> contested the Breeders' Cup Distaff over nine furlongs at Santa Anita. The field was a very strong one, including Royal Delta who had won the race for the last two years, Princess of Sylmar, Authenticity, and Close Hatches. Although <b>Beholder</b> showed some anxiety in the starting gate, she had a clean start. Mandella had been training her so that instead of always being a front-runner, she could be [...] rated behind other horses and conserve energy. His strategy was a success as <b>Beholder</b> tracked the leaders before moving up into second place half a mile from the finish. She took the lead two furlongs out and went clear of the field to win by [...] lengths over Close Hatches, with Royal Delta fourth and Princess of Sylmar last of the six runners. After the race, Mandella said, [...] "I’ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all." [...] With her Distaff win, she became the first horse to win both the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies and the Distaff in consecutive years.|$|E
