25|$|On 10 October 1891 (aged 35), {{taking her}} stage name from her father's birthplace, {{she made her}} opera debut in the first English {{production}} of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, as Lola, at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London. (This was under Arditi, and opposite Francesco Vignas as Turiddu: the new opera was a sensation.) A performance was given before H.M Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in November 1891. She achieved a success, and followed it with a greater one in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice later in the same year. Shaw witnessed some early appearances in London, for instance in May 1892 an encored performance of Welsing's setting of Love's Philosophy, and in July in a Miscellaneous Concert (with Ellen Terry, Josef Hollmann, etc.). She had won Shaw's admiration in a performance of Schubert's Erlkonig, but now he found her he found her insufficiently versatile, over-specialized, with a fixed vocal colour owing to over-emphasis of the dramatic lower register: and recommended that she should permit instead the simple <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in {{the upper part of}} her voice to be heard, when she should take high rank as a singer.|$|E

60|$|Besides this {{difficulty}} with which I have struggled {{and made a}} shift to pass it ever, there is one remaining, which is insuperable to all translators. We are bound to our author's sense, though with the latitudes already mentioned; for I think it not so sacred as that one iota must not be added or diminished, on pain of an anathema. But slaves we are, and labour on another man's plantation; we dress the vineyard, but the wine is the owner's. If the soil be sometimes barren, then we are sure of being scourged; if it be fruitful, and our care succeeds, we are not thanked; for the proud reader will only say--the poor drudge has done his duty. But this is nothing to what follows; for being obliged to make his sense intelligible, {{we are forced to}} untune our own verses that we may give his meaning to the reader. He who invents is master of his thoughts and words: he can turn and vary them as he pleases, till he renders them harmonious. But the wretched translator has no such privilege, for being tied to the thoughts, he must make what music he can in the expression; and for this reason it cannot always be so sweet as that of the original. There is a <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> as Segrais has observed, in some Latin words, which is wholly lost in any modern language. He instances in that mollis amaracus, on which Venus lays Cupid in the first AEneid. If I should translate it sweet-marjoram, as the word signifies, the reader would think I had mistaken Virgil; for these village-words, as I may call them, give us a mean idea of the thing; but the sound of the Latin is so much more pleasing, by the just mixture of the vowels with the consonants, that it raises our fancies to conceive somewhat more noble than a common herb, and to spread roses under him, and strew lilies over him--a bed not unworthy the grandson of the goddess.|$|E

40|$|Bitterroot Soundscape {{expresses a}} {{bittersweet}} sound {{world in which}} the line between tension and resolution is blurred. It explores the <b>beauties</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> that can exist without clear resolution or a sense of finality. While it is not overtly programmatic, without a dramatic storyline or a depiction of a specific picture, it does intend to convey in musical terms an aspect of the human experience that is symbolized in the title. ^ There is mostly traditional usage of instruments with extended techniques used for touches of color. Special techniques used include a variety of glissandi, harmonics, pitch bends, pizzicato, and various mufflings. The use of octatonic pitch material provides a preponderance of semitones which opens up the pitch pallet to a greater variety of color while limiting the scale from twelve to eight pitches. Since there are seven pedals on the harp, this scale allows all but one pedal to remain fixed during a given passage. ^ Bitterroot Soundscape is rooted in Western European classical traditions. The form being symmetrical and containing many sonata-allegro and concerto features has a foundation in Neoclassicism. Color, texture, and the avoidance of shocking extremes find their roots in Impressionism. The surface features in this work reveal eclectic influences ranging from Impressionism and Neoclassicism to Minimalism and textural composition. ^ Bitterroot Soundscape strives toward a natural expression of musical ideas avoiding synthetic, rigorous organization. An intuitive compositional process rooted in symmetry forms a natural expression <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> The ideals <b>of</b> Impressionism and the use of symmetry both have strong roots in nature and the emphasis here is on natural process resulting in a meaningful representation of the experience of being human. ...|$|R

50|$|The Clarinet Sonatas, Op. 120, Nos. 1 and 2 are a pair {{of works}} written for {{clarinet}} and piano by the Romantic composer Johannes Brahms. They were written in 1894 and are dedicated to the clarinetist Richard Mühlfeld. The sonatas stem from a period late in Brahms’s life where he “discovered” the <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sound</b> and tonal colour of the clarinet. The form of the clarinet sonata was largely undeveloped until {{after the completion of}} these sonatas, after which the combination of clarinet and piano was more readily used in composers’ new works. These were the last chamber pieces Brahms wrote before his death and are considered two of the great masterpieces in the clarinet repertoire. Brahms also produced a frequently performed transcription of these works for viola with alterations to better suit the instrument.|$|R

5000|$|The Sharawadji Effect, {{not to be}} {{confused}} with Sharawadgi, is a musical phenomena described by Claude Shryer as [...] "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex soundscape whose beauty is inexplicable."

Shryer also elaborated on searching for this [...] "state of awareness" [...] by the means of [...] "one tending an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> a given <b>sound</b> in an unexpected context.” The experience of the Sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One striking example of this effect is the appreciation <b>of</b> the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> rumbling thunder: those who are being directly exposed to the element would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment.

5000|$|There {{were only}} about a dozen American string quartets in 1964 when the Guarneri was born. Just 16 years later, there were over 250. While that growth cannot be {{attributed}} to any single cause, the Guarneri is frequently cited as a significant force assisting the boom. [...] For one thing, the members’ active work as teachers increased student interest in playing string quartets. One {{need look no further}} than Peter Wiley, who began his cello studies with Soyer, to see an example. The group’s teaching at Harpur, at University of Maryland, and particularly at Marlboro and Curtis certainly helped young musicians to develop an appetite for quartet music. James Reel quotes a Curtis student's thoughts:"There was always an excitement in the air at Curtis when they were about to show up," [...] recalls Lucy Chapman Stoltzman, who studied particularly with Steinhardt, often in lessons lasting more than two hours…"It was the pure <b>beauty</b> <b>of</b> their <b>sound</b> and legato, and the sense of the inner voices was so strong, the sense of every voice being important in the way you want it to be," [...] she says.
