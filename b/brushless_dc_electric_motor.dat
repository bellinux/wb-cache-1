It also purported to have a 20-minute flight time, which is nearly three times longer {{than most of the}} previous models. [...] It did not come in a [...] "plus" [...] variety (there is no H109+) which meant that it lacked the altitude hold function.|$|R

50|$|The company builds {{and sells}} an {{electric}} self-launching glider, the Lange Antares 20E. It uses lithium-ion batteries and a 42 kW <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> This unit was first flight tested on 7 May 1999, in a heavily modified DG-800 B.

50|$|Hall sensors are {{commonly}} used to time the speed of wheels and shafts, such as for internal combustion engine ignition timing, tachometers and anti-lock braking systems. They are used in <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> to detect {{the position of the}} permanent magnet. In the pictured wheel with two equally spaced magnets, the voltage from the sensor will peak twice for each revolution. This arrangement is commonly used to regulate the speed of disk drives.|$|R
50|$|Many {{of these}} devices use <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> with {{permanent}} magnets attached to the moving hub which turns around a fixed armature which offer high efficiency, good speed-torque characteristics and low weight. This motor is often built into the wheel itself, eliminating gears and drive belts. Many devices have a motor in the 250-500 watts range which provides good performance for an adult rider on the flat and on an incline, with sportier models using motors in excess of 1500 Watts.|$|R
50|$|The type {{of motor}} is not {{critical}} to a servomotor and different types may be used. At the simplest, brushed permanent magnet DC motors are used, owing to their simplicity and low cost. Small industrial servomotors are typically electronically commutated brushless motors. For large industrial servomotors, AC induction motors are typically used, often with {{variable frequency drives}} to allow control of their speed. For ultimate performance in a compact package, brushless AC motors with permanent magnet fields are used, effectively large versions of <b>Brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{stepper motor}} or step motor or {{stepping}} motor is a <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> that divides a full rotation {{into a number}} of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> (BLDC motors, BL motors) {{also known}} as {{electronically}} commutated motors (ECMs, EC motors), or synchronous DC motors, are synchronous motors powered by DC electricity via an inverter or switching power supply which produces an AC electric current to drive each phase of the motor via a closed loop controller. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings that control the speed and torque of the motor.|$|E
50|$|The global {{version of}} the Honda PCX is {{equipped}} with an idling stop system, which automatically shuts off the engine after few seconds of idle. This feature is not included on the US model due to safety concerns. To prevent excess wear on a separate starter motor, the Honda PCX uses its alternator by supplying power to the stator (see <b>Brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor).</b> As a result, engine start is completely muted.|$|E
40|$|Adopting a {{system-on-chip}} approach, {{this paper}} presents an integrated FPGA-based Electronic Speed Control (ESC) for driving <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> This allows for sensing, computation, and higher control bandwidth than traditional off-the-shelf ESCs (typically 50 Hz). In addition to a more compact and flexible package, this provides greater system awareness and facilitates a faster control loop rate, which are useful for agile robotic systems, such as UAVs. This design has been tested {{in conjunction with a}} custom, compact quadrotor system. It provides reduced payload and increased robustness compared to traditional controllers...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Ziehl-Abegg {{became the first}} {{company in the world}} to {{introduce}} EC-Motors (see <b>Brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor)</b> and use them for Ventilation Technology. [...] In the 1990s, the rotor blades were sickled and in 2006 they were equipped with a bionic profile, in order to minimize the noise emissions. In 2013, Ziehl-Abegg was also the first company in the world to develop a Bio-Fan made entirely of a Bio-Polymer (in this case castor oil).|$|E
50|$|The {{electric}} motorcycle {{is powered}} by a <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> producing the peak power of 3.6 kW at the speed of 80 km/h, though ratified at 1.0 kW. Power is supplied by five 12-volt nano-gel batteries capable of producing 60V, 20Ah of electricity. The motorcycle can be recharged by using an ordinary BS1363 240-volt, 13-amp power outlet, with the charging times of 3.5 hours (fast charging) or 8 hours (slow charging). Once fully charged, the CTric's traveling range is between 30-50 km.|$|E
50|$|The EM 42 is a fixed-shaft <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> (see Lange EA 42) {{running at}} 190-288 V, and drawing up to 160 A, the 42 kW motor can deliver up to 216 N.m of torque over a speed range of 160-1600 RPM {{with a total}} {{efficiency}} of 90%. Maximum continuous power is 38.5 kW, the motor weighs 29 kg, {{and the weight of}} power electronics is 10 kg. The motor turns a two-blade fixed-pitch propeller, LF-P42, constructed of composite materials, having a diameter of two meters.|$|E
50|$|At {{one time}} <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> used reed {{switches}} {{to sense the}} rotor's position relative to the field poles. This allows switching transistors {{to act as a}} commutator, but without the contact problems, wear and electrical noise of a traditional DC commutator. The motor design could also be 'inverted', placing permanent magnets onto the rotor and switching the field through the external, fixed coils. This avoided the need for any rubbing contact to provide power to the rotor. Such motors were used in low-power long-service-life items such as computer cooling fans and disk drives. As cheap Hall effect sensors became available, they replaced the reed switches and gave longer service lifetimes.|$|R

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>motors</b> {{are unique}} in many ways, {{especially}} when it comes to the power band. The exact characteristics vary greatly with the type of <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The maximum torque of a universal motor (vacuum cleaner, small machines, drills, starter motors) is reached instantly and falls for higher RPM. For induction motors connected to a fixed frequency AC source (most common in large applications), the maximum torque is usually just below the synchronous RPM, sinks to zero for this RPM and becomes negative above it (induction generator); at low RPM the torque is usually slightly lower. Synchronous motors can be used only at one to the AC source synchronous velocity. In modern applications, synchronous and induction motors with electronic control of the frequency are used, e.g., <b>Brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motors.</b> In this case, unless external limitations are applied, the maximum torque is achieved at low RPM.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{cars have}} {{traditionally}} used series wound DC motors, {{a form of}} brushed DC electric motor. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two {{of the types of}} DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of AC motor types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually induction motors or brushless AC electric motors which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{auxiliary}} power unit (APU) of Z-10 is centered on a new <b>brushless</b> <b>DC</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> designed by Huafeng Avionics (华烽航空电器) Co, a subsidiary of GAIC. The motor is characterized by its low voltage, high power, high rpm, and stable current; the entire development only took three months. In contrast to previous helicopter designs, the integrated APU also provides power to onboard avionics for Z-10, where early designs had separate systems for starting the main engine and powering onboard avionics. Such system has never been used on Chinese helicopters before, and its adaptation on Z-10 proved to be successful.|$|E
