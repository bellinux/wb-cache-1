40|$|Radiation tube burner {{systems are}} widely used as in-direct heating systems in heat {{treatment}} furnaces. Saving energy through improving the combustion and heat transfer process in the radiation tubes has become a pressing issue in the heat treatment industry {{over the last few}} years. The material structure during the process of heat treatment is predominantly determined by the temperature. The heat treatment processes usually require an even temperature distribution inside the furnace over a long duration to achieve the desired material properties. Due to the rising energy costs and the environmental concerns regarding the combustion emissions, reducing energy consumption has become a significant area of concern for the industry. This research is aimed at improving the combustion process in the radiation tubes to enhance the heat transfer to the heat treatment chamber, therefore achieving the objective of making energy savings. As a measure of improving the energy efficiency in the heat treatment furnace, Single End Radiant Tube <b>burners</b> (<b>SET)</b> were used to replace Vtube combustion systems. The energy efficiencies of the SET and V-tube combustion systems were experimentally verified in two full-scale working furnaces. This project carried out a quantitative analysis of the combustion and heat transfer processes in the radiation tubes and the heating chamber using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. One of the main objectives of the project was to optimize the design of the furnace heating system with the aid of validated CFD simulations. Experimental data obtained in the full-scale working furnaces were used for the validation of the CFD simulations and to provide the boundary conditions for the CFD cases. Experimental instruments were installed in two heat treatment furnaces to measure the fuel flow rates in the radiation tubes, their surface temperatures and the temperature distribution inside the heat treatment furnaces. The fuel flow rates were used to determine the energy efficiencies of the heat systems and the fuel inlet conditions for the CFD cases. The measurements of the outer surface temperatures of the radiation tubes were used to determine an average temperature as the boundary conditions for CFD simulations of the combustion process inside the <b>SET</b> <b>burner.</b> The temperature distributions inside the furnace heating chamber were examined by measuring the temperature at specific points using a thermocouple matrix. This temperature measurement provided data to validate the CFD simulations of heat transfer inside the furnace heating chamber. Three series of CFD simulations were carried out in this project. The cases in the first series of CFD simulations were based on the <b>SET</b> <b>burner.</b> The flow mixing, combustion and heat transfer process in the <b>SET</b> <b>burner</b> were analyzed in the baseline CFD case, and the influence of radiation models on the CFD simulations were investigated. The design parameters, such as the effect of the burner diameter, were also verified in the baseline CFD studies. Using the baseline case as a reference, a numerical study was carried out to explore the applications of advanced combustion technologies, such as high temperature air combustion (HiT AC) and two-stage combustion with preheated air in the SET. The results of the CFD simulations were used to determine the heat flux rates through the <b>SET</b> <b>burner</b> wall into the heating chamber, which were used as the boundary conditions for the CFD simulations of the heating chamber in the second series of CFD cases. A good agreement was found between the numerically predicted temperatures at specified points inside the furnace heating chamber and the experimentally measured temperatures at the same points. This demonstrated that the heat flux rates from the <b>SET</b> <b>burners</b> can be applied in CFD-aided design to optimize the operational conditions of similar or super-size furnaces with confidence. Finally, a case study of CFD-aided design was carried out in the third series of CFD simulations of the heat transfer process inside the super-size furnace chamber. CFD simulations were used to verify if six <b>SET</b> <b>burners</b> are sufficient to provide the required temperature distribution inside the chamber and provide optimum locations for the <b>SET</b> <b>burners.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{numerical simulation}} {{was carried out}} to study the pulverized-coal combustion process in a tangentially fired ultra-supercritical boiler. The realizable k-ε model for gas coupled with discrete phase model for coal particles, P- 1 radiation model for radiation, two-competing-rates model for devolatilization, and kinetics/diffusion-limited model for combustion process are considered. The characteristics of the flow field, particle motion, temperature distribution, species components, and NOx emissions were numerically investigated. The good agreement of the measurements and predictions implies that the applied simulation models are appropriate for modeling commercial-scale coal boilers. It is found that an ideal turbulent flow and particle trajectory {{can be observed in}} this unconventional pulverized-coal furnace. With the application of over-fire air and additional air, lean-oxygen combustion takes place near the <b>burner</b> <b>sets</b> region and higher temperature at furnace exit is acquired for better heat transfer. Within the limits of secondary air, more steady combustion process is achieved as well as the reduction of NOx. Furthermore, the influences of the secondary air, over-fire air, and additional air on the NOx emissions are obtained. The numerical results reveal that NOx formation attenuates with the decrease in the secondary air ratio (γ 2 nd) and the ratio of the additional air to the over-fire air (γAA/γOFA) was within the limits...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presents}} {{the assessment of}} a low emissions premixer/swirl burner configuration utilizing lean stratified fuel preparation. An axisymmetric, single- or double-cavity premixer, formed along one, two, or three concentric disks promotes propane-air premixing and supplies the combustion zone at the afterbody disk recirculation with a radial equivalence ratio gradient. The burner assemblies are operated with a swirl co-flow to study {{the interaction of the}} recirculating stratified flame with the surrounding swirl. A number of lean and ultra-lean flames operated either with a plane disk stabilizer or with one or two premixing cavity arrangements were evaluated over a range of inlet mixture conditions. The influence of the variation of the imposed swirl was studied for constant fuel injections. Measurements of turbulent velocities, temperatures, OH* chemiluminescence and gas analysis provided information on the performance of each <b>burner</b> <b>set</b> up. Comparisons with Large Eddy Simulations, performed with an 11 -step global chemistry, illustrated the flame front interaction with the vortex formation region {{under the influence of the}} variable inlet mixture stratifications.

The Pine Barrens, with its sandy soil, did not attract a permanent agriculture population (whose main interest would have been to establish permanent boundaries and clear the forests for fields). The area's sparse population encouraged a long-lasting attitude that forest fires should be set for local benefit—even on the lands of others.

5000|$|While Trumpeter was {{completing}} outfitting at New York Navy Yard {{only three}} days after her commissioning, sparks from a workman's <b>burner</b> <b>set</b> off a small fire on a line between the dock and the port side of the ship. An alert fire watch at the scene quickly extinguished the fire, and damage to the new destroyer escort was averted. On the 28th, she underwent dock trials and deperming and finished the month with underway trials in New York Harbor. Early in November, Trumpeter departed New York, setting her course for Bermuda. She moored in Port Royal Bay on the 6th and in the following weeks participated in extensive shakedown and indoctrination exercises. Antisubmarine tactics, convoy escort technique, gunnery, night illumination, cruising and screening exercises occupied her days. Each evening, she returned to Bermuda to anchor in Great Sound. Antisubmarine runs, practice fueling at sea, towing, mail-passing and emergency steering drills readied the new destroyer escort and her crew for the rigors of wartime Atlantic operations. At last, on 2 December, Trumpeter got underway for New York where she underwent alterations and voyage repairs. On 16 December, she departed New York and set her course northeast. The same day, she moored at Naval Air Station Quonset Point and reported for temporary duty with the Antisubmarine Development Detachment, Atlantic Fleet (ASDEVLANT). There she took part in testing newly developed antisubmarine gear until 17 January when she departed Narragansett Bay for New York. After repairs {{to one of her}} main propulsion generators, she resumed her duties at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, remaining there until 13 February when she detached from ASDEVLANT and made way for New York.

40|$|International audienceChemiluminescence of excited OH*, CH*, and C- 2 * {{radicals}} {{was investigated}} {{as a tool}} for combustion control. A parametric study in premixed methane/air flames is presented regarding the effects of pressure (1 to 10 bar) and equivalence ratio (0. 6 to 1. 1). The experimental geometry corresponds to a Bunsen-type burner, with pilot flames to achieve steady combustion at very lean conditions. The <b>burner</b> was <b>set</b> in a pressurized vessel to control ambient pressure. The chemiluminescence was spatially measured using an intensified CCD camera with interference filters centered on the three radical emission bands. A monochromator and a low-resolution spectrometer were used to obtain spectrally resolved data. The three diagnostic techniques show good agreement. The experimental results show that the chemiluminescence of the radicals investigated has different dynamics for given pressure and equivalence ratio conditions. The OH* radical seems more suitable for lean flames, while CH* and C- 2 * have a more monotonic behavior and stronger dynamics for richer flames. A numerical simulation with complex chemistry and transport modeling based on the PREMIX code was performed for two different kinetic schemes including OH* and CH*. A comparison is presented for integrated chemiluminescence (both spectrally and spatially), as well as for local excited radical concentration trends within the range of experimental conditions. Good qualitative agreement is found with the experimental results except for rich flames, where disagreements due to kinetic schemes are observed.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{computational}} fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling study was performed for the combustion of the brown coal in a large-scale tangentially-fired furnace (550 MW) under different operating conditions. The AVL Fire CFD code {{has been used to}} model the combustion processes. The mathematical models of coal combustion with the appropriate kinetic parameters were written and incorporated to the code as user defined functions. These models consist of pulverised coal (PC) devolatilization, char burnout, and heat and mass transfer. The simulation of the PC combustion was carried out using multi-step reaction chemistry mechanisms. The level of confidence of this numerical model was based on the previous validations of the lignite combustion in a lab-scale furnace, as well as the validation parameters of the present furnace at the standard existing conditions in terms of temperature values and species concentrations. Performance of the boiler under ten different operating conditions was investigated. The strategy of operation schemes for the first six combustion scenarios were based on the change of the out-of-service (turned off) burners under full load operation, while the rest cases were carried out at 20 % lower and 20 % higher loads than the standard operating conditions. The validated model was used to perform the following investigation parameters: furnace gas temperatures, species concentrations (O 2, CO and CO 2), velocity distributions, and char consumption. The predictions demonstrated that there are good temperature distributions in the furnace when the turned off <b>burners</b> are <b>set</b> in the opposite direction under full load operation. For higher aerodynamic effect, the numerical results showed improvements on the combustion characteristics in terms of species concentrations and char burnout rates in comparison with the standard operating case.

40|$|Landfill methane {{recovery}} {{associated to}} its conversion to carbon dioxide through combustion {{is a common}} greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in developed countries.

The development of reliable models specific for landfill gas combustion in porous burners can help understanding burner performance and {{the stability of the}} combustion process to fluctuations in methane concentration and flow rate. When considering porous burners, almost all the numerical studies apply the volume-average technique to the conservation equations and replace the complex structure of the surfaces that bound the phases by a fictitious model, in which each phase occupies the entire domain. This approach has produced valuable results but offers little detail as far as pore level characteristics are concerned.

40|$|A {{computational}} model for isothermal axisymmetric turbulent flow in a quarl <b>burner</b> is <b>set</b> up using the CFD package FLUENT, and numerical solutions {{obtained from the}} model are compared with available experimental data. A standard k-e model and and {{two versions of the}} RNG k-e model are used to model the turbulence. One of the aims of the computational study is to investigate whether the RNG based k-e turbulence models are capable of yielding improved flow predictions compared with the standard k-e turbulence model. A difficulty is that the flow considered here features a confined vortex breakdown which can be highly sensitive to flow behaviour both upstream and downstream of the breakdown zone. Nevertheless, the relatively simple confining geometry allows us to undertake a systematic study so that both grid-independent and domain-independent results can be reported. The systematic study includes a detailed investigation of the effects of upstream and downstream conditions on the predictions, in addition to grid refinement and other tests to ensure that numerical error is not significant. Another important aim is to determine to what extent the turbulence model predictions can provide us with new insights into the physics of confined vortex breakdown flows. To this end, the computations are discussed in detail with reference to known vortex breakdown phenomena and existing theories. A major conclusion {{is that one of the}} RNG k-e models investigated here is able to correctly capture the complex forward flow region inside the recirculating breakdown zone. This apparently pathological result is in stark contrast to the findings of previous studies, most of which have concluded that either algebraic or differential Reynolds stress modelling is needed to correctly predict the observed flow features. Arguments are given as to why an isotropic eddy-viscosity turbulence model may well be able to capture the complex flow structure within the recirculating zone for this flow setup. With regard to the flow physics, a major finding is that the results obtained here are more consistent with the view that confined vortex breakdown is a type of axisymmetric boundary layer separation, rather than a manifestation of a subcritical flow state...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed in a low-pressure flame by the technique of diode laser induced atomic fluorescence. The experiments were done in a near-stoichiometric flat-flame of premixed methane, oxygen and nitrogen, at a pressure of 5. 3 kPa. Indium atoms were seeded to the flame and probed using blue diode lasers; the lineshapes of the resulting fluorescence spectra {{were used to determine}} the flame temperature at a range of heights above the burner plate. The particular issues associated with the implementation of this measurement approach at low pressure are discussed, and it is shown to work especially well under these conditions. The atomic fluorescence lineshape thermometry technique is quicker to perform and requires less elaborate equipment than other methods that have previously been implemented in low-pressure flames, including OH-LIF and NO-LIF. There was sufficient indium present to perform measurements at all locations in the flame, including in the pre-heat zone close to the <b>burner</b> plate. Two <b>sets</b> of temperature measurements have been independently performed by using two different diode lasers to probe two separate transitions in atomic indium. The good agreement between the two sets of data provides a validation of the technique. By comparing thermocouple profiles recorded with and without seeding of the flame, we demonstrate that any influence of seeding on the flame temperature is negligible. The overall uncertainty of the measurements reported here is estimated to be +/- 2. 5 % in the burnt gas region...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{analyzes the}} combustion-excited Helmholtz resonance in a swirl burner/furnace system. Preliminary work showed {{the importance of}} variables such as air/fuel ratio, mode of fuel entry, and length of exhaust pipe attached to the exit of the furnace. Conditions were chosen (50 % axial, 50 % premixed natural gas and air, 600 -mm-long exit pipe, air/fuel ratio= 1. 53) that gave a clean, near sinusoidal pressure signal at the furnace exit. This signal {{was used as a}} trigger to enable phase-averaged axial and tangential velocities as well as temperatures to be taken throughout the furnace and into the exit pipe. The results show that a lifted flame core region exists over all of the oscillation cycle. Combustion excitation via the Rayleigh criteria comes via a periodic combustion wave of annular form located next to the furnace wall. The minimum pressure of the resonance causes a large inflow into the furnace with well-known swirltype flow patterns, which extinguishes the annular wall flame. The central flame core boundary is located in a low-velocity region between the forward and reverse flow regions. Conversely, the peak resonant pressure virtually stops the inflow into the furnace from the burner and allows the annular wall flame to propagate backward into the furnace. Complex coherent structures in the tangential radial direction are formed close to the junction of the swirl burner and the furnace. The influence of the precessing vortex core (PVC) in the swirl <b>burner</b> exhaust in <b>setting</b> up the resonance seems to be small; however, it does appear to further excite the resonance to higher amplitudes when its frequency is close to that of the Helmholtz oscillation...|$|R

The temperatures distributions of the furnace were investigated. The different type of the setting of fuel and air for gas burner will influence the heat distribution in the gas fired pyrolysis system. The results of the heat distribution of the furnace show similar pattern for 6 different setting but the temperature value were different.

The conversion of naptha to high octane aromatics requires high energy to initiate and sustain the reaction at temperatures of 850 - 950 oF.

40|$|In {{response}} to the serious challenge facing coal-fired electric utilities with regards to curbing their NO{sub x} and fine particulate emissions, Babcock and Wilcox and McDermott Technology, Inc. conducted a project entitled, ''Particulate Characterization and Ultra Low-NO{sub x} Burner for the Control of NO{sub x} and PM{sub 2. 5 } for Coal Fired Boilers. '' The project included pilot-scale demonstration and characterization of technologies for removal of NO{sub x} and primary PM{sub 2. 5 } emissions. Burner development and PM{sub 2. 5 } characterization efforts were based on utilizing innovative concepts in combination with sound scientific and fundamental engineering principles and a state-of-the-art test facility. Approximately 1540 metric tonnes (1700 tons) of high-volatile Ohio bituminous coal were fired. Particulate sampling for PM{sub 2. 5 } emissions characterization was conducted in conjunction with burner testing. Based on modeling recommendations, a prototype ultra low-NO{sub x} burner was fabricated and tested at 100 million Btu/hr in the Babcock and Wilcox Clean Environment Development Facility. Firing the unstaged burner with a high-volatile bituminous Pittsburgh 8 coal at 100 million Btu/hr and 17 % excess air achieved a NO{sub x} goal of 0. 20 lb NO{sub 2 }/million Btu with a fly ash loss on ignition (LOI) of 3. 19 % and burner pressure drop of 4. 7 in H{sub 2 }O for staged combustion. With the <b>burner</b> stoichiometry <b>set</b> at 0. 88 and the overall combustion stoichiometry at 1. 17, average NO{sub x} and LOI values were 0. 14 lb NO{sub 2 }/million Btu and 4. 64 % respectively. The burner was also tested with a high-volatile Mahoning 7 coal. Based {{on the results of}} this work, commercial demonstration is being pursued. Size classified fly ash samples representative of commercial low-NO{sub x} and ultra low-NO{sub x} combustion of Pittsburgh 8 coal were collected at the inlet and outlet of an ESP. The mass of size classified fly ash at the ESP outlet was sufficient to evaluate the particle size distribution, but was of insufficient size to permit reliable chemical analysis. The size classified fly ash from the inlet of the ESP was used for detailed chemical analyses. Chemical analyses of the fly ash samples from the ESP outlet using a high volume sampler were performed for comparison to the size classified results at the inlet. For all test conditions the particulate removal efficiency of the ESP exceeded 99. 3 % and emissions were less than the NSPS limits of {approx} 48 mg/dscm. With constant combustion conditions, the removal efficiency of the ESP increased as the ESP voltage and Specific Collection Area (SCA) increased. The associated decrease in particle emissions occurred in size fractions both larger and smaller than 2. 5 microns. For constant ESP voltage and SCA, the removal efficiency for the ultra low-NO{sub x} combustion ash (99. 4 - 99. 6 %) was only slightly less than for the low-NO{sub x} combustion ash (99. 7 %). The decrease in removal efficiency was accompanied by a decrease in ESP current. The emission of PM{sub 2. 5 } from the ESP did not change significantly {{as a result of the}} change in combustion conditions. Most of the increase in emissions was in the size fraction greater than 2. 5 microns, indicating particle re-entrainment. These results may be specific to the coal tested in this program. In general, the concentration of inorganic elements and trace species in the fly ash at the ESP inlet was dependent on the particle size fraction. The smallest particles tended to have higher concentrations of inorganic elements/trace species than larger particles. The concentration of most elements by particle size range was independent of combustion condition and the concentration of soluble ions in the fly ash showed little change with combustion condition when evaluated on a carbon free basis...|$|R
