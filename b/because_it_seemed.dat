5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E

50|$|Thirdly, the teleological {{explanation}} of adaptation is uncomfortable <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to attribute {{the action of}} a conscious mind when none is present; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test empirically.|$|R

25|$|When Marissa {{finds out}} about Bianca helping JR {{with trying to}} win her back, she asks Bianca about. Bianca tells Marissa she did it because Bianca could not do all those things for Marissa herself. Another reason was because it looked like Marissa was {{falling in love with}} JR again and <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like JR had changed. Marissa accuses Bianca of {{manipulating}} her and the situation. Bianca suggests that they should not see each other for a while and Marissa agrees.|$|E
25|$|As {{a supreme}} realist, Eakins {{appeared}} heavy and vulgar {{to a public}} that thought of art, and culture in general, largely {{in terms of a}} graceful sentimentality. Today he seems to us to have recorded his fellow Americans with a perception that was often as tender as it was vigorous, and to have preserved for us the essence of an American life which, indeed, he did not idealize — <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to him beautiful beyond the necessity of idealization.|$|E

25|$|It {{had seemed}} like the {{beginning}} of happiness, and Clarissa is still sometimes shocked, {{more than thirty years}} later, to realize that it was happiness; that the entire experience lay in a kiss and a walk, the anticipation of dinner and a book...What lives undimmed in Clarissa's mind more than three decades later is a kiss at dusk on a patch of dead grass, and a walk around a pond as mosquitoes droned in the darkening air. There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There has been no other. p98, 1999 Fourth Estate paperback edition.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form {{a certain kind of}} repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which seems very different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> so far fetched.|$|E
25|$|Soundings at {{the site}} were first made by Max Mallowan during his survey of the area. Agatha Christie, his wife, wrote that they chose not to {{continue}} {{at the site}} <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> to have Roman material. No trace of Roman occupation levels {{have been found in}} later excavations, however. Mallowan went on to excavate Chagar Bazar, another site to the south of Mozan/Urkesh. Excavations at Tell Mozan began in 1984 and have been conducted for at least 17 seasons up to the present time. The work has been led by Giorgio Buccellati of UCLA and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati of California State University, Los Angeles. The 2007 season was primarily dedicated to working on publication material, primarily excavation units A16, J1, J3 and J4. A small sounding was done in J1 to clarify the transition between Mittani and Khabur. The excavations have been assisted at various times by other groups including the German Archaeological Institute.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of the {{incident}} Eugene Chen, the foreign minister of China, hurried to Consul General Takao and expressed his regrets and said that China would take full responsibility to resolve the issue. Wuhan garrison commander Tang Shengzhi also came and expressed his regrets, and requested the withdrawal of the Japanese landing party since his army was now guarding the concession. The consul general respected China’s show of good faith and sought the evacuation of the landing party. <b>Because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> that the Chinese were showing their sincerity by stationing their army in the area surrounding the concession, keeping away the crowds with the cooperation of the jiuchadui, and putting up posters exhorting citizens to not loot or harm the Japanese, the landing party for a time returned to its base at Taisho Hall. However, the Chinese army itself engaged in looting and immediately the Japanese redeployed their landing force. Tang Shengzhi’s army which had entered Honganji was accused of looting the inner temple and was replaced by the army of He Jian, whose forces in turn withdrew from Honganji at the insistence of the Japanese landing party.|$|E
25|$|It's {{revealed}} that four days earlier, Jack West {{escaped from the}} Pit in the Ethiopian mine, rescued Pooh Bear from sacrifice and freed the Jewish slave-miners. In gratitude, the miners give him the sacred stones that Wolf had been using them to dig for - the Twin Tablets of Thutmosis, which contain the final incantation to activate the Machine when all the pillars are placed. Jack and Pooh travel to their old farm in Kenya, finding Horus (Jack's falcon) and the Adamson twins waiting; they'd come to the farm <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> like the best isolated safe place. They share with Jack {{the news that the}} Brotherhood has a mole in Wolf's unit, a marine code-named Switchblade, who plans to sabotage Wolf's effort to place the Second Pillar. Jack and the Adamsons head to Zanzibar, where an old friend of Jack's is hiding out, making a career after deserting the US army to attack gun-runners in Africa. Pooh leaves them at the airport to go north and rescue Stretch from the Mossad's torture chambers. Before he leaves, Jack gives him a GPS locator with which to signal Jack if he needs help.|$|E
500|$|At this time, as an {{adolescent}} in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, [...] "I knew I {{had to be}} in jazz. Two things decided me – the sound of a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, [...] "then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound.

500|$|Too {{small to}} form their own {{parliamentary}} group, the African deputies were compelled to join {{one of the larger}} parties in order to sit together in the Palais Bourbon. Thus, the RDA soon joined the French Communist Party (PCF) as the only openly anti-colonialist political faction and soon organised strikes and boycotts of European imports. Houphouët-Boigny justified the alliance <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed,</b> at the time, to be the only way for his voice to be heard: [...] "Even before the creation of RDA, the alliance had served our cause: in March 1946, the abolition of compulsory labour was adopted unanimously, without a vote, thanks to our tactical alliance." ...|$|E

500|$|The Fox Network {{executives}} {{had wanted}} the season premiere to be [...] "Homer Goes to College" [...] {{because it was}} an Animal House parody. However, the writers felt that [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] would be a better episode because of George Harrison's involvement. During the episode, Homer sings [...] "I am so smart! S-M-R-T... I mean S-M-A-R-T!" [...] while he lights his high school diploma (and the house) on fire. During the recording session, Dan Castellaneta was singing the song and accidentally misspelled [...] "smart".

40|$|It’s not implausible {{to think}} that {{whenever}} I have a justified noninferential belief that p, it {{is caused by a}} seeming that p. I believe that there’s a computer screen in front of me right now <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me that there is. I believe that I went for a walk this morning <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me that I did. I believe that two is greater than one <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me that two is greater than one. I believe that I’ve got a sore knee <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to me that I’ve got a sore knee. These seemings (or appearances, as I’ll sometimes call them) are distinct from my beliefs—an appearance that p often remains after I give up my belief that p. And the appearances seem to explain why I hold the beliefs: the justified beliefs just mentioned are held because of the seemings that cause them. It’s also tempting {{to think that}} something contributes to the justification of my belief only if I hold my belief because of that thing. (E. g., a belief isn’t justified by reasons unless one holds <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of those reasons.) Thus, given that many of our noninferential beliefs are justified and that we hold them because of appearances, one might be inclined to conclude that appearances play a crucial role—perhaps the only crucial role—in the justification of our noninferential beliefs.

[...] As a result of this, she was able to focus on Tsubasa's emotions towards her twin. Soon after beginning the manga's serialization, Ando created [...] "Tsubasa", a bonus chapter focusing on Arisa's pretending to be her elder sister; she continued to delay its publication, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> inappropriate to have a bonus story with Arisa appear when she was comatose in the main storyline.
