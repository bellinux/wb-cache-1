5|$|Using {{a program}} called Blendanal, similar to the Blender {{technique}} used to verify the planets discovered by Kepler, the astronomers observing HAT-P-33 hoped to rule out false positive alternatives that could explain the planet-like signal seen in HAT-P-33's light curve and radial velocity. The use of Blendanal ruled out the possibilities that the signal was caused by that of a hierarchical triple star or a mixture between a bright star and a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> in the background. The possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> whose secondary companion is too dim to be distinguishable from the brighter star could not be ruled out. However, the data indicated that the planet HAT-P-33b did indeed exist.|$|E

5000|$|The current {{nomenclature}} for {{double and}} multiple stars can cause confusion as <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> discovered {{in different ways}} are given different designations (for example, discoverer designations for visual <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> and variable star designations for eclipsing <b>binary</b> <b>stars),</b> and, worse, component letters may be assigned differently by different authors, so that, for example, one person's A can be another's C.

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence of a planet in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data {{ruled out the}} possibility that the detected radial velocity was caused by the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic <b>binary</b> <b>star,</b> supporting the possibility that the body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E
5|$|In close <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems one of {{the stars}} can lose mass to a heavier companion. Accretion-powered pulsars may drive mass loss. The {{shrinking}} star can then become a planetary-mass object. An example is a Jupiter-mass object orbiting the pulsar PSR J1719-1438. These shrunken white dwarfs may become a helium planet or carbon planet.|$|E

25|$|<b>Binary</b> <b>stars</b> {{that are}} both visual and spectroscopic {{binaries}} are rare, and are a valuable source of information when found. About 40 are known. Visual <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> often have large true separations, with periods measured in decades to centuries; consequently, they usually have orbital speeds {{too small to be}} measured spectroscopically. Conversely, spectroscopic <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> move fast in their orbits because they are close together, usually too close to be detected as visual binaries. Binaries {{that are both}} visual and spectroscopic thus must be relatively close to Earth.|$|R
5|$|Large lengths, such as {{the radius}} of a giant star or the semi-major axis of a <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system, are often {{expressed}} in terms of the astronomical unit — approximately equal to the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (150 million km or approximately 93 million miles). In 2012, the IAU defined the astronomical constant to be an exact length in meters: 149,597,870,700 m.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alpha is Delta Antliae, a <b>binary</b> <b>star,</b> 430 ± 30 light-years {{distant from}} Earth. The primary is a blue-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type B9.5V and magnitude 5.6, and the secondary is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9Ve and magnitude 9.6. Zeta Antliae {{is a wide}} optical double star. The brighter star—Zeta1 Antliae—is 410 ± 40 light-years distant and has a magnitude of 5.74, {{though it is a}} true <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes 6.20 and 7.01 that are separated by 8.042 arcseconds. The fainter star—Zeta2 Antliae—is 380 ± 20 light-years distant and of magnitude 5.9. Eta Antliae is another double composed of a yellow white star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 5.31, with a companion of magnitude 11.3. Theta Antliae is likewise double, most likely composed of an A-type main sequence star and a yellow giant. S Antliae is an eclipsing <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system that varies in apparent magnitude from 6.27 to 6.83 over a period of 15.6 hours. The system is classed as a W Ursae Majoris variable—the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former. Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1.94 times and a diameter 2.026 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has a mass 0.76 times and a diameter 1.322 times that of the Sun. The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material. The system is thought to be around 5–6 billion years old. The two stars will eventually merge to form a single fast-spinning star.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 2010, the Infrared Array Camera {{aboard the}} Spitzer Space Telescope {{was used to}} find the centroid, the point in space around which both of the Kepler-14 stars orbit.

50|$|Henri Boffin {{received}} his PhD in 1993 from the Université libre de Bruxelles {{for his work}} on the formation of barium stars and has since gone on to work on a variety of problems in the study of <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> Most recently, he has dedicated his time to the study of <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> in planetary nebulae, including discovering the <b>binary</b> central <b>star</b> of Fleming 1, and the use of optical interferometry to study mass-transfer.|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} stages of core-collapse may be divided into three phases. During a globular cluster's adolescence, the process of core-collapse begins with stars near the core. However, the interactions between <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> systems prevents further collapse as the cluster approaches middle age. Finally, the central binaries are either disrupted or ejected, resulting in a tighter concentration at the core.|$|E
5|$|A close <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system {{occurs when}} two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close binary system can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
5|$|A multi-star system {{consists}} {{of two or more}} gravitationally bound stars that orbit each other. The simplest and most common multi-star system is a <b>binary</b> <b>star,</b> but systems of three or more stars are also found. For reasons of orbital stability, such multi-star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit their host galaxy.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more than}} fifty years he spent all his free time observing the heavens, principally {{concerning}} himself with <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b> Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and Otto Wilhelm von Struve had catalogued a good number of <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> working at the Observatories of Dorpat and Pulkovo and using 23- and 38-cm telescopes. During the 1840s it was believed that essentially all the <b>binary</b> <b>stars</b> visible to the instruments of the day had been discovered. Burnham, with his 15 cm instrument, found 451 new ones from 1872 to 1877. A European astronomer, Baron Dembowski, helped him by measuring the newly discovered binaries. [...] The quality of Burnham's work opened the doors of observatories for him and he had access to more powerful instruments at Lick, Yerkes and other observatories. He is credited with having discovered 1340 <b>binary</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the stellar}} {{parameters}} were established, the Kepler science team ran models and fits {{to ensure that}} Kepler-5's transit event was not a false positive, such as an eclipsing <b>binary</b> <b>star.</b> Once the planetary nature of Kepler-5b was established, the Kepler team searched for the planet's occultation behind its star, hoping to find the temperature on its day side. They found both, {{and were able to}} set the equilibrium temperature of the planet. The use of speckle imaging using adaptive optics at the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California isolated the starlight of Kepler-5 from background stars.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29.

Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a <b>binary</b> <b>star,</b> where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

5|$|Cataclysmic or {{explosive}} {{variable stars}} {{are those that}} undergo {{a dramatic change in}} their properties. This group includes novae and supernovae. A <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> system that includes a nearby white dwarf can produce certain types of these spectacular stellar explosions, including the nova and a Type 1a supernova. The explosion is created when the white dwarf accretes hydrogen from the companion star, building up mass until the hydrogen undergoes fusion. Some novae are also recurrent, having periodic outbursts of moderate amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives.
