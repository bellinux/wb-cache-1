5|$|A merchant, José Ignacio Rezábal, {{attended}} the open cabildo but, {{in a letter}} to the priest Julián S. de Agüero, said that he had some doubts which were shared <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> close to him. He feared that, no matter which party prevailed in the open cabildo, it would take revenge against the other, the Mutiny of Álzaga being a recent precedent. He felt that the open cabildo would lack legitimacy if too many criollos were allowed to take part in it as a result of the aforementioned manipulation of the guest list.|$|E
5|$|In {{animated}} {{versions of}} Naruto, Sakura was voiced by Chie Nakamura. Early {{in the first}} series, the actors were told by Kishimoto that Sakura would end marrying Sasuke. However, most of them ended up having doubts as during the first anime Sasuke abandoned his teammates. As a result, by the second series, Nakamura was often asked <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> if her character would instead end with Naruto. When Sakura married Sasuke in the end, Nakamura was happy because Sakura stayed true to her feelings. In an interview, Kate Higgins, who does the voice acting for Sakura in the English dub, notes the development of Sakura in the series, remarking that she becomes a more complex character as she becomes more sensitive and caring.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} understand, it is immensely {{important}} {{for the person who}} understands to be located outside the object of his or her creative understanding—in time, in space, in culture.

This can present difficulties when de facto relationships are legally contested <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> usually other family members. Marriages rarely encounter such difficulties as they are generally regarded as immediate and incontrovertible.|$|E

As early as the 14th century, cracks seemed to grow in the facade of alchemy; and people became sceptical. Clearly, there needed to be a scientific method where experiments can be repeated <b>by</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> and results needed to be reported in a clear language that laid out both what is known and unknown.|$|E
