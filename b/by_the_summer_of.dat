5|$|A {{siege of}} the castle was started, but through papal {{intervention}} King Henry later entered on a more conciliatory path.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the {{assessment}} process for the ten routes, two remained. One was route 1, the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty-Foot Drain for most of its length, while the second was a new route, designated as route 11. Route 11 had become the preferred route <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>of</b> 2014. It involves widening the South Forty-Foot Drain from Donington to Surfleet, to a point near to the Black Hole Drove pumping station. A new lock would be needed at this location, but would connect to a new channel, rather than {{to the rest of the}} drain. It would pass under a new bridge on the A151, and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock. An environmental survey of other watercourses near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates.|$|E

By {{the first days of}} September, {{the main body of the}} relief forces approaching Smolensk numbered around 14,000. The Russian army, recently reinforced, numbered 25,000. Only when Cossack reinforcements, led by Timofiy Orendarenko and numbering between 10,000 and 20,000, arrived on 17 September would the Commonwealth army gain numerical superiority. The Cossacks under Orendarenko and Marcin Kazanowski would raid the Russian rear lines, freeing the Polish-Lithuanian units under Radziwiłł and Gosiewski to join the effort to break the siege.|$|E

Texas officials felt compelled {{by the fact that}} the Tyler administration appeared unequipped to mount an effective campaign for Texas annexation. With the 1844 general election in the United States approaching, the leadership in both the Democratic and Whig parties remained unequivocally anti-Texas. Texas-Mexico treaty options under consideration included an autonomous Texas within Mexico's borders, or an independent republic with the provision that Texas should emancipate its slaves upon recognition.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>of</b> 1906, Mahler {{had been}} {{director}} of the Vienna Hofoper for nine years.

Since 1899 this haven had been at Maiernigg, near the resort town of Maria Wörth in Carinthia, southern Austria, where Mahler built a villa overlooking the Wörthersee. In these restful surroundings Mahler completed his Symphonies No.4, No.5, No.6 and No.7 symphonies, his Rückert songs and his song cycle Kindertotenlieder ("Songs on the Death of Children").|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>summer</b> <b>of</b> 1911, a {{year before}} he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, he asked his mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
