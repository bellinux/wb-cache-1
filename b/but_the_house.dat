Beebe refuses to leave, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has been {{surrounded}} by five dogs; {{as they are}} killed they are seemingly endlessly replaced by others. The Old Man arrives, and insists {{the only way to}} rid the town of the dogs is burn down Beebe's house, which the trio do before fleeing. Back home in Seattle, Black refuses to sell his own home, telling his wife that they will move back into it together when their problems are resolved.|$|E
5|$|The Wyberghs {{were able}} to retain Clifton Hall, despite the {{challenges}} of the English Civil War, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> was caught up in the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745. In the early 19th century most of Clifton Hall was pulled down {{to make way for a}} new farmhouse, and only the pele tower survived. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage and operates as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|The {{legislative}} walkouts delayed {{progress on}} the budget passage for nearly two months, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives was able to begin working on it in committee in April. The body made several alterations to the bill, including a reapportionment of education funding based more heavily {{on the number of}} students at a school, and removing some public school funding to finance the new voucher system and charter schools.|$|E
5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured that insurance companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival {{house with}} a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade {{of the house is}} five bays wide with 6-over-6 sash and the main {{entrance}} has a Greek Revival portico supported by fluted Doric columns from top step. The simple single-panel door is surrounded by sidelights. The corners of the building have simple pilasters and four chimneys rising from the top. The rear of the house has a one-story veranda with a shallow hipped roof that is supported by square columns with a simple balustrade. The veranda has large 6-over-9 sash windows that extend almost a full story. In 1975, the area surrounding the property has undergone significant change, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is surrounded by trees and shrubs and a wrought iron fence that helps set it apart from the neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by their}} defeats in the judiciary, the Relief Party turned its {{attention}} to the gubernatorial election of 1824, where they backed General Joseph Desha. Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. The justices were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority. The vote was 2312.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell not to break anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E

5|$|In Ex parte Bollman (1807), the Court {{granted the}} writ to {{two members of}} the Burr conspiracy. Dr. Erick Bollman and Samuel Swartwout, having been apprehended in New Orleans, were transported to Charleston and then Baltimore on a navy vesselnotwithstanding the writs of habeas corpus issued by a {{territorial}} judge in New Orleans and a district judge in Charlestown. The United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia issued an arrest warrant for Bollman and Swartwout (who were already in military custody), slated the case for trial in D.C., and denied the prisoners bail; Judge William Cranch (also the Supreme Court's reporter of decisions) dissented in part on the ground that there was no probable cause for the arrest warrant as required by the Fourth Amendment. The Senate passed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> rejected, legislation that would have suspended the writ for three months and legalized Bollman and Swartwout's arrests. Nearly every member of Congress attended the oral arguments in the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{parliamentary}} reform plummeted {{after the}} launch of the French Revolution in 1789. Many English politicians became steadfastly opposed to any major political change. Despite this reaction, several Radical Movement groups were established to agitate for reform. A group of Whigs led by James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale and Charles Grey founded an organisation advocating parliamentary reform in 1792. This group, known as the Society of the Friends of the People, included 28 MPs. In 1793, Grey presented to the House of Commons a petition from the Friends of the People, outlining abuses of the system and demanding change. He did not propose any specific scheme of reform, but merely a motion that the House inquire into possible improvements. Parliament's reaction to the French Revolution was so negative, that even this request for an inquiry was rejected by a margin of almost 200 votes. Grey tried to raise the subject again in 1797, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> again rebuffed him by a majority of over 150.|$|E
50|$|Kyazehvo {{settlement}} was {{located on the}} northernmost shore of the island and had two houses in 1563. One more was built by 1876, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> were small and had almost no animals. Thirteen people lived there by 1905.|$|R

50|$|In the Second World War the {{mechanism}} was removed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> remained in <b>the</b> cathedral - it fortunately escaped damage. On 21 December 1951 the clock was {{put back in}} service, after the repair of war damage to the cathedral.|$|R
5|$|When Sir William Sharington {{purchased}} {{the remains of}} the Augustinian nunnery in 1540, after the dissolution, he built a country house on the cloister court. He retained the cloisters and the medieval basement largely unaltered and built another storey above, so that the main rooms are on the first floor. The house is constructed of ashlar and rubble stone, the roofs are of stone slates and there are many twisted, sixteenth century chimney stacks. The house is a blend of different styles but lacks a cohesive plan; the four wings of the house are built above the cloister passages, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> cannot be entered from the cloisters, and the cloisters cannot be seen from inside the house. The abbey underwent substantial alterations in the Gothic Revival style in the 1750s, under the ownership of John Ivory Talbot. The great hall was redesigned during this period, the architect being Sanderson Miller.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, Grant {{proposed}} to annex the independent largely black nation of the Dominican Republic, {{then known as}} Santo Domingo. Previously in 1868, President Andrew Johnson had attempted to annex the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives defeated two resolutions {{for the protection of}} the Dominican Republic and Santo Domingo and for the annexation of the Dominican Republic. In July, 1869 Grant sent Orville E. Babcock and Rufus Ingalls who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic President Buenaventura Báez for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of Samaná Bay for $2million. To keep the island nation and Báez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships, unauthorized by Congress, to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. Báez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869 offered by Babcock under federal State department authorization. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of Santo Domingo as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for Samaná Bay for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870 the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not informing Congress of the treaty or encouraging national acceptance and enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|Military failure abroad, and the {{associated}} fiscal pressure of constant campaigns, led to political discontent at home. The problems {{came to a head}} in the parliament of 1376, the so-called Good Parliament. The parliament was called to grant taxation, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons took the opportunity to address specific grievances. In particular, criticism was directed at some of the king's closest advisors. Chamberlain William Latimer and Steward of the Household John Neville were dismissed from their positions. Edward's mistress, Alice Perrers, who was seen to hold far too much power over the ageing king, was banished from court. Yet the real adversary of the Commons, supported by powerful men such as Wykeham and Edmund de Mortimer, Earl of March, was John of Gaunt. Both the king and the Black Prince were by this time incapacitated by illness, leaving Gaunt in virtual control of government. Gaunt was forced to give in to the demands of parliament, but at its next convocation, in 1377, most of the achievements of the Good Parliament were reversed.|$|E
