5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

25|$|In April 2007, an {{international}} {{team of researchers}} announced in the journal Nature Biotechnology an inexpensive and efficient way to convert types A, B, and AB blood into type O.

The removal of A and B antigens still {{does not address the}} problem of the Rh <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> antigen on the blood cells of Rh positive individuals, and so blood from Rh negative donors must be used.

25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>group</b> O (or <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> zero in some countries) {{individuals}} {{do not have}} either A or B antigens {{on the surface of}} their RBCs, and their blood serum contains IgM anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Therefore, a group O individual can receive blood only from a group O individual, but can donate blood to individuals of any ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> (i.e., A, B, O or AB). If a patient in a hospital situation needs a blood transfusion in an emergency, and if the time taken to process the recipient's blood would cause a detrimental delay, O negative blood can be issued. Because it is compatible with anyone, O negative blood is often overused and consequently is always in short supply. According to the American Association of Blood Banks and the British Chief Medical Officer’s National Blood Transfusion Committee, the use of group O RhD negative red cells should be restricted to persons with O negative blood, women who might be pregnant, and emergency cases in which blood-group testing is genuinely impracticable.|$|E
