Monkeys here are less common than in Scottburgh, but birds are abundant, including the hadeda ibis. Small wild cats like the genet and civet have been reported on rare occasions. Nile crocodiles found near Freeland Park and the lower Amahlongwa, 8 kilometres south, are not present in Umkomaas. Duiker abound and can be seen in Empisini.

40|$|Snakebites cause {{considerable}} {{human and}} livestock injuries {{as well as}} deaths worldwide, and particularly have a high impact in sub-Saharan Africa. Generating a basic platform {{of information on the}} characteristics of snakes and snakebites in various countries is relevant for designing and implementing public health interventions. This study was performed to identify types of snakes and some of the characteristics of snakebite cases in two communities, an agricultural and a pastoralist, in Arusha region, northern Tanzania. A total of 30 field visits were carried out in areas considered by local inhabitants to be potential microhabitats for snakes. Direct observation of snake types based on morphological features and a structured questionnaire were employed for data collection. A total of 25 live and 14 dead snakes were encountered. Among the dead ones, the following species were identified: two black-necked spitting cobras (Naja nigricollis); five puff adders (Bitis arietans), one common egg-eater (Dasypeltis scabra); two rufous-beaked snakes (Ramphiophis rostratus); two <b>brown</b> <b>house</b> <b>snakes</b> (Lamprophis fuliginosus); one Kenyan sand boa (Eryx colubrinus), and one black mamba (Dendroaspis polylepis). The frequency of snake encounters was significantly higher (χ (2) [*]=[*] 4. 6; p[*]=[*] 0. 03) in the pastoral than in the agricultural area; there were more snakebite cases in the former, but the differences were not statistically significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 7). A total of 242 snakebite victims attended at the Meserani Clinic, located in the study area, between the years 2007 to 2012. Of all cases, 146 (61. 6 %) and 96 (38. 4 %) were male and female patients, respectively. As for age distribution, 59. 1 % of snakebite victims were from the economically active age groups between 15 and 55 years. Snakebites are a threat to rural communities and public health in general. The burden of snakebites in Tanzania presents an epidemiologically similar picture to other tropical countries. Livestock keeping and agriculture are the major economic activities associated with snakebites. Community-based public education is required to create awareness on venomous snakes and predisposing factors to snakebites. These tasks demand integration of diverse stakeholders to achieve a common goal of reducing the impact of human suffering from these envenomings in Tanzania...|$|R

5000|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} are occasional prey for Verreaux's eagle-owls. Various snakes {{have been}} included in their diet ranging from the small, innocuous <b>brown</b> <b>house</b> <b>snake</b> (Boaedon fuliginosus) at 31 g to large and venomous Egyptian cobras (Naja haje) weighing over 454 g. Frogs were amongst the prominent prey recorded for suburban-breeding eagle-owls in South Africa, namely the African red toad (Schismaderma carens) and the guttural toad (Amietophrynus gutturalis). Unidentified frogs were fairly significant in the diet from Kenya. The largest herpetological prey known is the Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus), at a mean mature mass of 5850 g, these primarily diurnal reptiles can provide a fulfilling meal but can be hard to subdue even if ambushed unaware. Predation on fish has been reported but no fish have been observed firsthand in dietary studies. A surprisingly wide range of invertebrates {{have been reported in the}} diet for this species. In some cases, they may prey on insects as small as termites and even smaller invertebrates have been recorded in pellets such as orbatid mites and Sarcophaga flies, but are likely consumed incidentally while eating a larger item, either from carrion or the stomach of the prey itself. Unidentified scorpions, spiders and millipedes have also been reported in their foods. Most attacks on insects involve large ground beetles or dung beetles. Verreaux's eagle-owl has been known to feed on dung beetles among herds of African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) by night, boldly diving below the massive bovids’ legs, and will readily feed on beetles among elephant dung when available.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Although {{there have}} been {{numerous}} studies involving fish, birds, and mammals, {{little is known about the}} response of the cytochrome P 4501 A system of snakes to halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs). The present study describes the induction of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) in primary hepatocytes of the African <b>brown</b> <b>house</b> <b>snake</b> (Lamprophis fuliginosus). Hepatocytes were exposed in multiwell plates to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and four different non-ortho-substi-tuted coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs 77, 81, 126, and 169). Exposure to TCDD and PCB 126 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in EROD activity, with maximum inducible EROD activities of 177 6 56 (mean 6 SEM) and 101. 1 6 55 pmol/min/mg protein for TCDD and PCB 126, respectively. None of the other PCBs caused a measurable induction of EROD, which suggests reduced inducibility of snake hepatocytes compared to some vertebrate taxa. Median effective concentrations (EC 50 s) were 0. 16 6 0. 03 nM for TCDD and 8. 25 6 4. 14 nM for PCB 126. The relative potency (REP 20 – 80) range for PCB 126 was 0. 044 to 0. 046. Compared to results from in vitro systems using other vertebrate species, both the maximum inducibility and the REPs estimated for L. fuliginosus were within the same range as those reported for mammals and the more sensitive bird species but were greater than the values reported for most fish species. In conclusion, induction of EROD activity in primary hepatocytes appears to be a useful approach for evaluating the dioxin-like potencies of aryl hydrocarbon–receptor agonists in snakes.
