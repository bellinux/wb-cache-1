Real-time measurements using focused beam reflectance measurement (Lasentec FBRM) and near-infra red spectroscopy (Bruker NIR) were taken by inserting in-line probes into the fluidized bed.

40|$|Improved small-particle powders and powder-processing {{conditions}} {{have been developed}} for use in plasma spray deposition of thermal-barrier and environmental barrier coatings. Heretofore, plasma-sprayed coatings have typically ranged in thickness from 125 to 1, 800 micrometers. As explained below, the improved powders make it possible to ensure complete coverage of substrates at unprecedently small thicknesses of the order of 25 micrometers. Plasma spraying involves feeding a powder into a hot, high-velocity plasma jet. The individual powder particles melt in the plasma jet as they are propelled towards a substrate, upon which they splat to build up a coating. In some cases, multiple coating layers are required. The size range of the powder particles necessarily dictates the minimum thickness of a coating layer needed to obtain uniform or complete coverage. Heretofore, powder particle sizes have typically ranged from 40 to 70 micrometers; as a result, the minimum thickness of a coating layer for complete coverage has been about 75 micrometers. In some applications, thinner coatings or thinner coating layers are desirable. In principle, one can reduce the minimum complete-coverage thickness of a layer by using smaller powder particles. However, until now, when powder particle sizes have been reduced, the powders have exhibited a tendency to cake, clogging powder feeder mechanisms and feed lines. Hence, the main problem is one of synthesizing smaller-particle powders having desirable flow properties. The problem is solved by use of a process that begins with a spray-drying subprocess to produce spherical powder particles having diameters of less than 30 micrometers. (Spherical-particle powders have the best flow properties.) The powder is then passed several times through a commercial sifter with a mesh to separate particles having diameters less than 15 micrometers.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} the dry coating {{experiments}} were performed with two different processes using a high energy impact coater “Hybridizer” (Nara) {{and a high}} shear mixer “Cyclomix” (Hosokawa). Silica gel particles (d 50 = 55 µm) were coated with fine particles of magnesium stearate (d 50 = 4. 6 µm) at two different weight ratio of magnesium stearate, 5 % and 15 %. Several methods of characterization were used to study the effect of dry coating of the silica gel powder. The uncoated and coated silica gel particles were observed by environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM). The images have shown that a more uniform coating was obtained {{in the case of}} Hybridizer. The flowability of the different samples obtained with Hybridizer and Cyclomix have been characterized by measurements of the tapped and aerated densities. It has been shown that the flowability of silica gel treated in Hybridizer was not significantly affected whereas the flowability was reduced after treatment in the Cyclomix. The wettability of silica gel was determined by measurements of the contact angle between a water drop and a powder bed prepared for each sample. The results obtained have shown that the coating of silica gel powder by hydrophobic magnesium stearate in the two different devices, Hybridizer and Cyclomix, can improve its hydrophobic properties. The results of the different characterizations have been compared with those concerning the simple mixtures prepared by using a Turbula mixer. To investigate the stability and the ageing of silica gel particles after coating, three samples of silica gel coated with 15 % (w/w) of magnesium stearate in the Hybridizer device have been stored under different relative humidities (RH).

No significant variations of the contact angle and the volume of the drop were recorded for the sample stored under dry atmosphere (RH < 12 %). The ESEM observations of the different samples confirmed the results. A mechanism that can explain these ageing effects is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Fluidized bed coating (FBC) is {{a process}} where {{preheated}} material is dipped into a flowing liquid bed of powder. Although FBC has existed {{for more than half}} a century, however there is little knowledge about the fluidized bed design that gives excellent fluidization quality as well as reducing powder entrainment. The objectives of this thesis are to investigate the effect of two different types of distributor with different pressure drop on powder coating, hydrodynamics of fluidized bed coating process, and effect of flow rate on powder coating quality such as thickness, uniformity, reduced entrainment and current leakage. The understanding and research finding is the key to the design of an industrial scale fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>powder</b> coater. A pilot fluidized bed coater was designed and built to run the experimental work for the study on pressure drops and also coating experiments using epoxy powder on copper bars. Pure copper bars with a purity of 99. 99 % were used for coating. The quality of the coated samples such as the coating thickness and current leakage were evaluated. Continuous and repetitive dipping method was experimented to study on the coating thickness at different processing time. At a continuous dipping of 14 seconds, and with air flow rates of 3 LPM, 8 LPM and 12 LPM, the coating thickness achieved were 1079. 2 μm, 1275. 8 μm and 659. 2 μm respectively. Using repetitive method, overall coating thickness is lower than continuous coating at the same dipping time. The current leakage shows that low air flow rate for continuous dipping method has the lowest current leakage at the similar coating thickness at 720 μm compared to repetitive dipping method. Its leakage is 0. 53 mA compared to normal air flow rate at 0. 68 mA and high air flow rate at 0. 75 mA. Different dipping methods were studied to understand the difference between continuous dipping and repetitive dipping on the coating uniformity on the bar. It was found that continuous dipping gave a more uneven coating on the samples which can be observed through the large standard deviation error bar. Further study on the effect of different air distributor pressure drops was also carried out. Theoretically the pressure drop of distributor ratio against the bed height should be in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 3 to ensure a good bed rise with few bubbles. It was found that distributor B with a higher bed height of 0. 3 m gave a ratio within this range as compared to distributor A where only 0. 2 m and 0. 15 m bed height that gave the similar ratio...|$|E
40|$|Certain {{material}} {{systems are}} currently playing significant {{roles in the}} medical application areas. Classified as bio-polymers, polyethylene (PE), polyamide (PA), Poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), poly (lactic acid) (PLA), poly (glycolic acid) (PGA), and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) are notable examples. While these materials {{are known for their}} bio-compatibility characteristics, the bio-conductive nature promoting further growth and repairing the damaged parts is often lacking. Natural coral derived HA/calcium carbonate composites and synthetic calcium phosphates are known for bio-conductivity. As a natural consequence, medical materials used in particular for bone repair and replacement needs are a mixture of a biopolymer composite and a bio ceramic. The resulting bio-polymer composites loaded with bio-ceramics such as hydroxyapatite and calcium phosphate into different bio-polymer matrices combine the properties both phases and serve the purpose of the specific medical application. Several processing methods such as solvent casting or leaching, phase separation, foaming, gas saturation etc., are applied to put these polymer composites to service. However, most methods fail due to several drawbacks such as time and cost involved and more importantly, lack of flexibility to exactly reproduce complex shapes. In particular, achieving a complex shape is often a prerequisite condition in many medical applications. During the past two decades, the layered processing methods rapidly evolved from mere prototyping solutions to the more advanced technologies, commonly referred to as additive manufacturing. Considering the freedom these techniques offer to manufacture complex forms without any specific tooling or the alteration of the materials and processes, it became important to revisit the current processing techniques as applied to different biopolymers used for varying medical needs. The current research is an attempt in this direction, evaluating a selected combination of a bio-material and an additive processing technology. The specific medical application area targeted is in the bone repair and replacement tasks. Poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is selected as the base polymer considering its wider use in bone related applications. The β-form of the tri-calcium phosphate (β-TCP) is the bio-ceramic component to impart the bio-conductivity to the polymer composite. Selective laser sintering is the process, considering the ease of working with powder raw materials and the ultimate control over the micro and meso structures of the sintered substrates. The material consolidation mechanism involves localized heating by a fast moving laser beam. The first task is to match the material combinations with the laser energy so that the substrates absorbs sufficient energy from the laser to achieve the particle melting, fusion, and consolidation. Considering the absorptivity levels of the constituent powders, a CO 2 laser source is selected for the experimental investigations. Simulating the laser sintering process conditions required the development of both hardware and software systems and the integration of the same to achieve the overall experimental test <b>bed.</b> <b>Powder</b> feeding and envelope temperature control systems are added for further process controls. Establishing the viability of the material and process combination involved experimental evaluations in three significant stages. The neat PMMA powders are evaluated first for laser sintering with varying process parameters. Working ranges of laser energy densities for initial laser sintering experiments are established by differential scanning calorimetric results. Morphologies of sintered surfaces and porosity analyses are used to evaluate the intra-layer coalescence. Critical process parameters, laser power and scan velocities are gradually adjusted towards more optimum combinations based on these initial results. Further sintering trials and evaluation of the morphological, physical and mechanical characterization results allowed to establish the best process conditions and the overall effectiveness of neat PMMA for selective laser sintering. The same procedure is repeated in the second stage based on varying compositions of PMMA plus β-TCP composites. The final stage involved evaluation of the possible after-effects if any on the biological and the multi-layer responses of the sintered polymer composites based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), in-vitro analyses, and mechanical testing. Overall, the experimental results indicate the suitability of both neat PMMA and PMMA plus β-TCP polymeric materials for processing by selective laser sintering. Best combinations of critical process parameters, laser power and scan velocities could be established for both material systems. The laser interactions are proved to cause no detrimental effects either in the polymer chemistry or the biological nature of the materials further to sintering. Sufficient inter-layer coalescence is also evidenced, establishing the effectiveness of the material and process combination for manufacturing 3 D forms. Considering the significant attributes of the constituent material systems and the unlimited design freedom allowed by the laser sintering approach, the findings reported in this thesis are expected to pave ways for wider research interest as well as potential medical applications in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis {{was part of a}} larger collaborated project (LastForm Programme) to research engineering solutions for the rapid manufacture of large scale (0. 5 m – 5. 0 m in length) low, medium and high temperature tooling (from room temperature to 1000 C) for use in the automotive and aerospace industry. All research was conducted using small scale investigations but with a final discussion including implications of the work in future large scale planning. The aim of the work {{presented in this}} thesis was to develop current understanding about the sintering and melting behaviour of metal powders by Selective Laser Sintering (SLS). The powder used in the research was an argon atomised austenitic stainless steel of type 314 s HC. The powder was supplied in four batches, each differentiated by particle size distribution; - 300 + 150 m, - 150 + 75 m, - 75 + 38 m and - 38 m. The characteristics of each powder, in particular flow properties, differed considerably allowing powder handling and powder flow during melting to also be explored in this work. Three different environmental conditions were also investigated to asses the role of atmospheric and residual (powder) oxygen: (1) air atmosphere (control), (2) argon atmosphere and (3) argon atmosphere with argon percolation through the powder layer. In this, the design of an environmental control chamber and its integration into a research SLS machine was central to the work. Experimental studies of the selective laser sintering/melting process on room temperature stainless steel 314 s powder beds has been successfully carried out. The methodology was progressive; from tracks to layers to multiple layers. Single tracks were produced by melting the powder by varying laser power and scan speed. Results from experiments have been used to construct a series of process maps. Each map successfully charts the heating and melting behaviour of the irradiated powder. Behaviours can now be predicted with reasonable accuracy over a dense power and speed range, including laser powers up to 200 W and scan speeds up to 50 mm/s. The experiments also allowed melt pool geometries to be investigated. Three types of melt cross-section were categorised; flattened, rounded and bell shape. Flat tracks generally occurred at low speed (0. 5 mm/s) but also occurred up to 4 mm/s at lower power (77 W). Rounded tracks occurred between 1 mm/s and 4 mm/s and had a much larger area than expected. In the rounded track regime tracks sink well into the powder <b>bed.</b> <b>Powder</b> to either side of a track collapses into it, leaving a trench surrounding the track. The admission of extra powder is thought to be one cause of increased mass. However, a remaining question that still needs answering is what causes the change from a flattened to a rounded track. Values of laser absorptivity were also estimated from track mass per unit length data and from melting boundaries displayed within the process maps. The results showed that absorptivity changed considerably depending on the powder, process conditions and atmospheric conditions. Within an argon atmosphere an „effective‟ absorptivity from mass data was estimated to range from 0. 1 to 0. 65, the lower value at low speed scanning (0. 5 mm/s) and the higher value from high speed scanning (> 4 mm/s). These values were much higher than expected for a CO 2 laser. Melt pool balling was found to be a big problem, limiting the process speed at which continuous tracks could be successfully constructed (< 12 mm/s). Comparisons between a mathematical model developed in this work and experimental results suggested that balling within an air environment occurred when the ratio of melt pool length to width reached a critical value close to . Balling within an argon atmosphere was more difficult to model due to higher viscous melts caused by the take up of surrounding powder. Melted single layers were produced by varying laser power, scan speed, scan length and scan spacing or melt track overlap. Scan length proved to be a significant factor affecting layer warping and surface cracking. Provided the scan length remained below 15 mm, layer warping could be largely avoided. Multiple layer blocks were produced by melting layers, one on top of the other. They were constructed over a range of conditions by varying laser power, scan speed, scan spacing and layer thickness. Layer thickness was a crucial parameter in controlling the interfacial bond between layers, but the spreading mechanism proved to be the overriding factor affecting layer thickness and therefore the quality and density of the blocks. ...|$|E

The key flow properties {{of interest in this}} investigation were: flow function, effective angle of wall friction, wall adhesion, bulk density, stress ratio K and permeability. To simulate the real process and (very importantly) validate the model, a Dosator test-rig has been used to measure the forces acting on the Dosator during the filling stage, the force required to eject the dose and the dose weight.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{a summary of}} eight papers dealing with {{experimental}} studies on bed agglomeration, slag formation, formation of deposits and fine particulate matter during combustion of phosphorus-rich biomass fuels. The experimental procedures were performed in a bubbling fluidized bed (5 kW), two fixed bed appliances (20 and 15 kW) and in a powder burner (150 kW). The phosphorus-rich fuels studied (separately and in mixtures with typical woody or straw biomass fuels) included; rapeseed meal, rapeseed cake, wheat distillers dried grain with solubles (DDGS) and, oat grains. Phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 (PA)), kaolin (Al 2 Si 2 O 5 (OH) 4) and calcite (CaCO 3) were used as fuel additives. The bed materials used in fluidized bed experiments included, quartz (SiO 2) and, olivine ((Mg, Fe) 2 SiO 4). During fluidized bed combustion of the phosphorus-rich fuels; i. e. DDGS, rapeseed meal and, rapeseed cake, ash particles rich in K-Ca/Mg-phosphates were formed during combustion, leading {{to the formation of}} non-continuous bed particle layers and subsequently bed agglomerates. For woody fuels; i. e. logging residues, willow and, bark, K-compounds in gas/liquid phase reacted with the quartz bed material, and formed an inner bed particle layer rich in K-silicates. The melting behaviour of this layer was found responsible for the initiation of the bed agglomeration. The addition of a high enough amount of phosphorus to the woody fuels (by co-firing with a P-rich fuel or adding PA additive), to convert the available fuel ash basic oxides into phosphates, reduced the amount of K available for the reaction with the quartz bed material particles, thus preventing the formation of an inner reaction bed particle layer. The phosphate-rich ash particles formed during combustion adhered and reacted with the bed material forming non-continuous coating layers, and subsequently agglomerates. During combustion of straw fuels (rich in Si and K), partially molten K-silicates formed non-continuous bed particle layers and subsequently bed agglomerates. Adding phosphorus to the last fuel, changed the composition of the bed ash from being dominated by low melting temperature K-silicates, to a system dominated by crystalline K-Ca-phosphates. The phosphate-silicate ash particles formed during the combustion were found responsible for the initiation of the bed agglomeration process. No significant difference in the bed agglomeration tendency/characteristics was found between olivine and quartz bed materials when combusting the phosphorus-rich DDGS fuel. The bed agglomeration mechanism for this fuel in quartz bed therefore seems to be directly applicable in olivine beds, and can be described as direct adhesion of bed particles by partially molten K-Mg-phosphates in both bed materials. In fixed bed combustion of phosphorus-rich fuels, {{it was found that the}} relation between alkali and alkaline earth metals in the fuel ash has a key role in the slag formation. DDGS (rich in S, K, P and Mg), formed high amounts of molten material. Fuels with higher Ca content, i. e. rapeseed meal, showed low slagging tendency. The effect is attributed to the formation of low melting temperature K-Mg-phosphates, or more stable K-Ca/Mg-phosphates, respectively. The slag formed during combustion of woody and straw fuels, consisted mainly of K-rich silicates. The addition of phosphorus (by co-firing with a P-rich fuel or adding PA additive), promoted the formation of K-Ca/Mg-phosphates, thereby reducing the amount of K-rich-silicates formed during combustion. The formation and composition of deposits and fine particulate matter during combustion of phosphorus-rich fuels were also studied. In general, during fluidized bed and to a minor extent in fixed bed combustion, a reduction of fine particulate matter containing KCl as the main component was achieved by increasing the phosphorus content in woody or straw fuels. As a consequence, an increased amount of potassium was found in the coarse ash particle fractions principally as KMgPO 4, CaK 2 P 2 O 7, CaKPO 4, and KPO 3, while the levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue gases increased. It was found that the relationship between alkali and alkaline-earth metals (i. e., (K + Na) /(Ca + Mg)) in the overall fuel ash composition must be considered, since both Ca and Mg are needed for the formation of refractory ternary phosphate phases containing K. The addition of excessive amounts of phosphorus to P-poor fuels with high (K + Na) /(Ca + Mg) molar ratio resulted in the formation of low melting temperature alkali-rich phosphates, which increased the bed agglomeration tendency and release of alkali and phosphorus from the <b>bed.</b> <b>Powder</b> combustion of the DDGS-fuel resulted in the formation of high amounts of fine particulate matter and deposits rich in KPO 3. During fixed bed combustion of oat grains, slag rich in K-silicates and fine particulate matter rich in K-phosphates and KCl was formed. The result of using kaolin additive was that no slag was formed, and the effect on the formation of fine particulate matter was an increased content of condensed K-phosphates at the expense of K 2 SO 4 and KCl. Consequently, higher levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue gases were obtained. The addition of calcite increased the amount of slag formed. Phosphorus was captured to a higher degree in the slag and bottom ash, compared to the combustion of pure oat. The molten phase formed during combustion consisted of both phosphates and silicates and probably had a low melting temperature. The effect of the calcite additive on the fine particle emissions was that the content of KPO 3 decreased considerably, while the content of K 2 SO 4 and KCl increased. Consequently, the levels of HCl and SO 2 in the flue-gas decreased. A general observation was that phosphorus is the controlling element in ash transformation reactions during biomass combustion because of the high stability of ternary phosphate compounds.

40|$|A novel particle-based {{discrete}} element model (DEM) {{is developed}} {{to simulate the}} whole Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) process, which includes simplified powder deposition, recoating, laser heating, and holding stages. This model is first validated through the simulation of particle flow and heat conduction in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> and the simulated results are in good agreement with either experiment in the literature or finite element method. Then the validated model is employed to the DMLS process. The effects of laser power, laser scan speed, and hatch spacing on the temperature distributions in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> are investigated. The results demonstrate that the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> temperature rises as the laser power is increased. Increasing laser scan speed and laser hatch spacing will not affect the average temperature increase in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> since energy input is kept same. However, a large hatch spacing may cause non-uniform temperature distribution and microstructure inhomogeneity.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of droplets with powder {{is the key}} set of phenomena that determine many aspects of Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) including dimensional control and surface finish of the printed part. In the creation of structural ceramic parts by 3 D printing, fine powders {{on the order of}} 1 gm in size must be used. These powders are deposited as slurry and then dried to form a fairly hard cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> The purpose of this work is to understand the {{interaction of}} droplets with such cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>beds,</b> the integration of droplets with previously printed droplets, and to explore print styles which improve the dimensional control and surface finish. Single drop primitives were printed and removed from the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> and found to resemble discs with a flat top and a rounded bottom with a typical diameter of 180 Vtm and a thickness of 40 [tm. A number of different time domains are defined based on the interaction of droplets with cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>beds.</b> Critical times in defining these domains are: 1) the amount of time it takes for a droplet to splat and spread on the <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> 2) the amount of time it takes for the droplet to absorb into a <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> and 3) the amount of time it takes for an absorbed droplet to dry. Based on these time domains, doublets composed of two printhead droplets spaced 40 and 80 pm apart were printed at different interarrival times. At short interarrival times, the doublet appeared to be roughly equivalent to a single drop primitive but slightly larger. As the interarrival time increased the doublet became increasingly oblong. When printing continuous line segments high rate printing requires that droplets be placed as rapidly as possible. Line segments with varying drop deposition styles were investigated. In one style, droplets are deposited one after the other at high rate such that droplets are arriving before the previous droplets are absorbed into the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> Such line segments show evidence of binder rearrangement due to capillary effects {{on the surface of the}} <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> Two fundamental alternative styles were investigated where droplets are printed far enough apart that they interact with the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> and not with liquid on the surface of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> In the most successful of these styles, a line segment is created in either 2 or 4 passes of the printhead and droplets are always deposited in a symmetrical configuration with respect to previously deposited droplets. For example, in a first pass, droplets are deposited 200 microns apart and in a second pass droplets are once again deposited 200 microns apart but at a position intermediate to the droplets deposited on the previous pass. Such line segments showed straighter edges and narrower widths than those printed with single pass high frequency printing. by Vedran Knezevic. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a vibration-induced air inflow can cause vigorous bubbling {{in a bed}} of fine particles and report the mechanism by which this phenomenon occurs. When convective flow occurs in a <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> {{as a result of}} vibrations, the upper powder layer with a high void ratio moves downward and is compressed. This process forces the air in the powder layer out, which leads to the formation of bubbles that rise and eventually burst at the top surface of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> A negative pressure is created below the rising bubbles. A narrow opening at the bottom allows the outside air to flow into the <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> which produces a vigorously bubbling fluidized bed that does not require the use of an external air supply system...|$|R
50|$|In DMLS, <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> {{supports}} the parts {{and keep them}} held in place. However, support structures are explicitly required {{for most of the}} downward facing surfaces that make an angle less than 45 degrees with the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> This is {{because of the fact that}} <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> alone is not sufficient enough to hold the liquid phase of the metal that is created when laser is scanning the powder. Support structures are also required to restrict curling/warping of the melted powder due to high-temperature gradients. The overhangs having angles less than 45 degrees should be avoided if possible at the design stage. The main advantage of this is to reduce material usage and the post processing requirement of removing support structures from the designed components.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a study of the effect of glass {{microsphere}} (GMS) and potassium bromide (KBr) powder as an additive on the reflectance and transmittance of TrueForm TM acrylic-styrene co-polymer (TF) powder to CO 2 laser during selective laser sintering (SLS). Design/methodology/approach: GMSs and KBr powder were chosen because glass is opaque to CO 2 laser while KBr is transparent. The GMSs were treated with silane coupling agent and hydrofluoric acid to study the surface effect on the optical properties of TF/GMS blends. KBr powder was blend with TF powder in an attempt to modify the penetration depth of the laser in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> An integrating sphere was used to measure the reflectance of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> In the measurement of transmittance, a power meter was placed below the powder layer, which was supported by a KCl disc, to register the transmitted laser energy through the powder layer. Findings: For the TF/GMS blends, smaller GMSs gave a higher reflectance while the surface treatments had little effect. The transmittance of both the polymer and the blends were very low. Although bulk KBr is highly transparent to CO 2 laser, adding 30 vol% of KBr powder to TF hardly increased the transmittance of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> Research limitations/implications: Experiments were carried out on a modified laser engraving machine rather than a commercial SLS machine. The laser energy density used was lower than that for normal SLS processes and no significant changes of physical condition of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> were inflicted. The results only indicate the optical properties in the initial state. Practical implications: The effects of transparent and non-transparent fillers on the optical properties of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> are presented. Originality/value: This work furthers the understanding of heat absorption behavior of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> during SLS. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|An {{array of}} eight long Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rods (diameter: 12 mm; height: 300 mm) have been additively manufactured, {{vertically}} and {{perpendicular to the}} <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> by selective electron beam melting (SEBM). The purpose was to identify and understand the challenges of fabricating Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples or parts from a deep <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> (more than 200 -mm deep) by SEBM {{and the necessity of}} applying post heat treatment. The resulting microstructure and mechanical properties of these Ti- 6 Al- 4 V rods were characterized along their building (i. e., axial) direction by dividing each rod into three segments (top, middle, and bottom), both before (i. e., as-built) and after hot isostatic pressing (HIP). The as-built microstructure of each rod was inhomogeneous; it was coarsest in the top segment, which showed a near equilibrium α-β lamellar structure, and finest in the bottom segment, which featured a non-equilibrium mixed structure. The tensile properties varied along the rod axis, especially the ductility, but all tensile properties met the requirements specified by ASTM F 3001 - 14. HIP increased the relative density from 99. 03 pct of the theoretical density (TD) to 99. 90 pct TD and homogenized the microstructure thereby leading to highly consistent tensile properties along the rod axis. The temperature of the stainless steel substrate used in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> was monitored. The as-built inhomogeneous microstructure is attributed to the temperature gradient in the deep <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> Post heat treatment is thus necessary for Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples or parts manufactured from a deep <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> by SEBM. This differs from the additive manufacturing of small samples or parts from a shallow <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> (less than 100 -mm deep) by SEBM...|$|R

In order to investigate the effects of these factors, the percolation properties through the <b>beds</b> of coarse <b>powders</b> of glass beads and of bronze spheres were examined by using surface treated fine glass beads as percolating powders. For the glass beads, it may be concluded that the phenomenon of segregation occurs with the difference of the surface property between particles. I...|$|R
50|$|Selective Laser Melting (also {{known as}} Powder Bed Fusion) is an {{additive}} manufacturing procedure {{used to create}} intricately detailed forms from a CAD file.

In brief, a <b>bed</b> of metal <b>powder</b> is prepared, and the first slice of the CAD design is formed in the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> by a high energy laser sintering the particles together. After this first slice is generated, the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> moves downwards, and a new batch of metal powder is rolled {{over the top of}} the slice. The second layer is then sintered with the laser, and the process is repeated until all the slices in the CAD file have been processed.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Washburn {{capillary}} rise method {{is a standard}} technique for determining the wettability of powders expressed as a contact angle. The method requires the preparation of two identical <b>beds</b> of <b>powder.</b> One of these beds is used to follow the {{capillary rise}} with a perfectly wetting liquid (contact angle = 0) giving access to a bed structure parameter. The other bed is used with the liquid of interest (contact angle not equal 0) and the capillary rise data is analysed using the previously determined structure parameter to obtain the contact angle. In the experiments reported here {{we have used a}} centrifugal packing technique to prepare <b>beds</b> of <b>powder.</b> This gives reproducible packings and also allows a certain degree of control of the bed porosity. In addition the air permeability of the beds is also determined prior to the capillary rise experiments. The results show that the value of the contact angle of a powder determined by the Washburn method depends on the porosity of the <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> and that the structure parameter can be determined from the air permeability using the Kozeny-Carman expression.
