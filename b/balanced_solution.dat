5000|$|For law enforcement, {{framing the}} issue is simple. In this time of {{dazzling}} telecommunications and computer technology where information can have extraordinary value, the ready availability of robust encryption is essential. No one in law enforcement disputes that. Clearly, in today's world and more so in the future, the ability to encrypt both contemporaneous communications and stored data is a vital component of information security.As is so often the case, however, there is another aspect to the encryption issue that if left unaddressed will have severe public safety and national security ramifications. Law enforcement is in unanimous agreement that {{the widespread use of}} robust non-key recovery encryption ultimately will devastate our ability to fight crime and prevent terrorism. Uncrackable encryption will allow drug lords, spies, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their crimes and their conspiracies with impunity. We will lose {{one of the few remaining}} vulnerabilities of the worst criminals and terrorists upon which law enforcement depends to successfully investigate and often prevent the worst crimes.For this reason, the law enforcement community is unanimous in calling for a <b>balanced</b> <b>solution</b> to this problem.|$|E

The review concludes that dilutionalhyperchloraemic acidosis is a side effect, mainly observed aller the administration of large volumes of isotonic saline as a crystalloid.

Convincing evidence for clinically relevant adverse effects of dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis on renal function, coagulation, blood loss,the need lor transfusion, gastrointestinal function or mortality cannot be found.
