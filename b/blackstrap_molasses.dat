40|$|The use of <b>blackstrap</b> cane <b>molasses</b> in {{industrial}} ethanol production is characterised by fluctuations in fermentation efficiency {{due to its}} compositional variation. Crucial to optimisation of ethanol production is thorough knowledge of the constituents and properties of molasses which affect fermentation, in order to implement measures to diminish negative and augment positive impacts. These include both major and minor constituents. According to literature, aspects of fermentation media which affect yeast fermentation include nutritional availability, the presence of trace elements and growth factors such as vitamins, without which yeast proliferation is inhibited. High osmotic pressures, found in VHG (very high gravity) fermentations, have a detrimental effect on the fermentation process. Additionally, elevated concentrations of inorganic salts and ionic strength {{in industrial}} fermentation media have been implicated in negatively affecting fermentation. Based on these limited literature findings, the study addressed the effect of three cation constituents of molasses (K+, Mg 2 + and Na+), {{expressed in terms of}} overall concentration, osmotic pressure and ionic strength, on fermentation was investigated in molasses media and a sucrose-based media...|$|R

50|$|Commercial {{sugarcane}} is planted from stalk cuttings {{and placed}} in furrows about five feet apart. After approximately 12 months, the mature sugarcane is ready for harvest. Growers average four harvests each season from a single planting. Harvesting season lasts from late October through mid-March, approximately 150 days.The {{first step in the}} harvesting process is the highly controlled pre-harvest burning of the cane fields. Each field burn is individually permitted by the State of Florida Division of Forestry. Farmers are allowed to burn only when climatic conditions permit. Burning causes excessive leaves to be removed, preparing the way for the mechanical harvesters and then the processing of the cane. An added benefit to this practice is that it reduces the need for applications of pesticides.The Cooperative harvests an average of 500 acres per day using combine-style mechanical harvesters. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The harvesters contain rotating knives, which cut through the sugarcane {{at the base of the}} stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and excess foliage is removed by giant extraction fans.As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths and put into field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to a nearby transfer station and loaded onto semi-trailers for delivery to Glades Sugar House for grinding.Each semi contains about 19-tons of sugarcane. A load arrives at the mill site about every 45 seconds during daylight hours. Approximately 1,200 loads are delivered daily to keep the processing facility at peak capacity during harvest season.More than 61,000 acres are harvested each season, producing more than 2.4 million tons of sugarcane.ProcessingThe Glades Sugar House operates 24-hours a day throughout the 150-day annual harvest. The mill grinds as much as 26,000 tons of sugarcane per day or three million tons each season. One ton of sugarcane produces approximately 220 pounds of raw sugar. Experienced operators use technology-based equipment to separate the harvested raw cane into sugar, water, molasses and bagasse (the pulp, rind and fiber of the sugarcane stalk). Every part of the sugarcane stalk is used.Within 24 hours of harvesting, each load of sugarcane is cut and processed into raw sugar. Along the way the high-tech mill uses all of the plant’s by-products. Even the fibrous wood pulp that remains after the sugar cane has been repeatedly pressed, crushed and shredded is not wasted. This pulp, called bagasse, fuels the mill’s boilers, creating steam-generated electricity to power the mill. By using bagasse as a fuel, the Cooperative saves the equivalent of 31 million gallons of fossil fuel each year. The water that makes up 80 percent of the cane stalk is also recycled and re-used within the process. Combined, all of the state’s sugar producers save 113 million gallons of fuel oil or 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year. Processing involves separating the natural sugar juice from the stalk then concentrating the juice to produce raw sugar crystals and <b>blackstrap</b> <b>molasses,</b> which is sold primarily as animal feed. During the 2010-11 harvest season, the Cooperative produced more than 260,000 tons of raw sugar and 16 million gallons of black strap molasses.|$|E
