25|$|Some of {{the scales}} {{reviewed}} by Furnham and Steele (1993) relate to health in more specific domains, such as obesity (for example, Saltzer's (1982) Weight Locus of Control Scale or Stotland and Zuroff's (1990) Dieting Beliefs Scale), mental health (such as Wood and Letak's (1982) Mental Health Locus of Control Scale or the Depression Locus of Control Scale of Whiteman, Desmond and Price, 1987) and cancer (the Cancer Locus of Control Scale of Pruyn et al., 1988). In discussing applications of the concept to health psychology Furnham and Steele refer to Claire Bradley's work, linking locus of control to the management of diabetes mellitus. Empirical data on health locus of control {{in a number of}} fields was reviewed by Norman and Bennett in 1995; they note that data on whether certain health-related behaviors are related to internal health locus of control have been ambiguous. They note that some studies found that internal health locus of control is linked with increased exercise, but cite other studies which found a weak (or no) relationship between exercise behaviors (such as jogging) and internal health locus of control. A similar ambiguity is noted for data on the relationship between internal health locus of control and other health-related behaviors (such as <b>breast</b> <b>self-examination,</b> weight control and preventative-health behavior). Of particular interest are the data cited on the relationship between internal health locus of control and alcohol consumption.|$|E

Material and methods: The research {{was carried out in}} the Centre of Oncology Branch in Cracow. The survey comprised 60 hospitalized patients as well as 30 healthy subjects from the Małopolska region. The scientific method used was a specially designed questionnaire. Results : Women with a history of cancer demonstrate a health-oriented approach. The subjects known as the experimental group perform <b>breast</b> <b>self-examinations,</b> regularly visit a gynaecologist, are aware of the most severe mastectomy complication – lymphoedema, and recognize the impact of physical activity on it. Breast cancer operation survivors have a good knowledge of breast cancer and lymphoedema, however, existing shortcomings in practical issues are worrying. On the contrary, the control group neglects regular check-ups, evaluates its own knowledge as negligible and, most surprisingly, is not interested in the subject of breast cancer and lymphoedema, even though the subjects of the group believe that arm swelling is connected to all types of breast cancer surgeries. Conclusions : Breast cancer survivors have a good knowledge of their disorder but are still lacking some essential information. Respondents from the control group have a limited knowledge in the field of cancer and lymphoedema, are not interested in breast cancer matters and are not encouraged by gynaecologists to perform <b>breast</b> <b>self-examinations.</b> Educational prevention programs should develop a health-oriented approach among all women and emphasize their basic role in therapy...|$|R

30|$|The Malaysian Ministry of Health {{has been}} {{promoting}} BSE and annual breast examinations by trained health workers {{as part of}} breast health awareness campaigns since 1995 (Ministry of Health Malaysia 1999).

Studies conducted among different groups of women in Malaysia showed that monthly BSE practice ranged from 19.6 to 36.7  %, respectively (Akhtari-Zavare et al. 2015; Rosmawati 2010). Although early detection of breast cancer can increase the survival rate, many women miss early detection due to lack of knowledge and information about breast health awareness (Avci 2008). Also, as the American Cancer Society has proven, if breast cancer is detected at an early stage (stage I–II), a 100 – 93  % survival rate can be achieved, and this rate decreases to 72 – 22  % if breast cancer is diagnosed at later stages (III–IV) (American Cancer Society 2013).|$|R

For 18 – 55 -year-old English-speaking women visiting an urban emergency department, we aimed to: (1) Ascertain their knowledge regarding the applicability, purpose, and recommended intervals of three women's cancer screening and three contraceptive methods; and (2) Determine if patient age, race/ethnicity, medical insurance status, and current or recent usage of these methods are associated with greater or lesser knowledge about them.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the effects of coping information and self-affirmation on an individual’s response to threatening health information. A total of 202 women col-lege students read an essay containing threatening information about breast cancer. The essay described their population as being at risk for breast cancer and included both pictures of cancerous breasts and vivid descriptions of chemotherapy treat-ments. Participants were randomized into either the low-affirmation condition or the high-affirmation condition when they first arrived. In addition, half of the partici-pants were randomly assigned to receive coping information that described <b>breast</b> <b>self-examinations</b> as an effective method of detecting breast cancer and focused on the importance of early detection. Participants who received coping information scored lower on maladaptive behaviors (avoidance, hopelessness, religiosity), sug-gesting that coping information plays a role in decreasing maladaptive behaviors. No {{significant differences were found between}} the low-affirmation and high-affirmation conditions. Supplemental analyses indicated that vicarious exposure to breast cancer (having a friend, relative, or mother diagnosed with breast cancer) affected how indi-viduals interpret threatening health information.
