40|$|Abstract- This paper {{emphasizes}} on web marketing {{as an important}} tool for the marketers to offer goods and services. Products are now increasingly sold online and not just confined to local stores as in the traditional <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> mortar firms. The brick & click model helps web marketers by combining online capabilities with the traditional bricks-and-mortar firms. This paper will {{keep an eye on}} the <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> click model as an important tool for the marketers for technology driven consumers who want goods conveniently and easily at their doorsteps. With an increase in number of online users and products offered online the collaboration of a web marketer through partnership or joint venture as in <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> click firms prove more profitable in terms of wider coverage and economies of scale.

Four of the station's windows were smashed, but the Jarrett family asked the crowd to disperse. Later that day, two police {{officers}} were attacked with <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> paving stones at the Farm, and a police inspector was attacked in his car.|$|E
5|$|The Romans made durable {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for load-bearing walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic material that {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E

5|$|These {{industries}} {{collapsed in}} the aftermath of World War II due to the failure to introduce mechanisation, although the automated Chilton Tile Factory, which produced up to 5 million tiles each year, lasted until 1968.

5|$|While {{relaying}} the deteriorated {{floor of}} Akbari Gate in April 2007, three floors in the fort were unearthed {{belonging to the}} British, Sikh and Mughal period. The floor of the British, Sikh and Mughal periods were constructed with bricks, burnt <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> pebbles respectively. The latter either built during Jahangir's or Shah Jahan's era was the hallmark of Mughals.|$|E
5|$|All {{buildings}} have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and {{were supported by}} large stone columns. These stone columns {{can be seen in}} several buildings such as the Lovamahapaya (brazen palace). Drainage systems of these buildings are also well planned, and terra cotta pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the Kuttam Pokuna (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{experimental}} and modelling work on moisture transport in masonry, with {{special attention to}} the liquid transport across the interface between <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> mortar joint. Experiments and simulations reveal that two aspects need to be taken into account: (1) the dependence of moisture transport properties on the curing of the mortar; (2) the presence of a hydraulic interface resistance between <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> mortar. The resistance is due to imperfect contact between <b>brick</b> <b>and</b> mortar, causing a reduction in flow through the interface compared to the assumption of perfect hydraulic contact. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Although little-used by passengers, Brill {{station was}} {{valuable}} {{as a relatively}} rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also {{a small amount of}} coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of Brackley and Aylesbury. <b>Bricks</b> <b>and</b> tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of Waddesdon Manor, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.|$|E

Later period finds include 400 Demotic and Greek ostraca from a 2nd–1st century BC mercenary garrison.

5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, peas and beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century. In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.|$|E

5|$|At about 3:30 or 4:00 a.m., roughly {{five minutes}} after Engine Co. 22 evacuated, the {{building}} exploded. The explosion flattened six to eight buildings, blew in the fronts of the opposite houses on Broad Street, and wrenched shutters and doors from buildings at {{some distance from the}} immediate area. It propelled <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> other missiles through the air, threw many people down who had gone as far as Beaver Street, and spread the fire far and wide so that the whole neighborhood was set ablaze. The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{classes and}} {{vocational}} workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 {{loaves of bread}} a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in the orphanage, and a tree and plant nursery. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million <b>bricks</b> <b>and</b> 250,000 tiles annually.|$|E

Some minor structures have survived to the North West of the North station's site, including a road bridge over the rail line which served the station, a brick wall, and a concrete staircase. More obvious remains of the power stations are their three large sub-stations that still supply the local region. Much of this electrical power is generated in Scotland's Cockenzie power station, transported via a 275 kilovolt (kV) and a 400 kV connection.|$|E
