5|$|In September 1958 VAT, {{together}} with other Finnish companies, participated in the Thessaloniki International Trade Fair. The vehicles shown were one Vanaja VAK lorry and a mid-engined VLK550 <b>bus</b> <b>chassis.</b> Due to the AEC engines the Vanaja's did not raise interest among the potential Greek customers, as relations between the UK and Greece were bad at the time. The lorry was finally sold in Greece but the <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> returned to Finland and was sold to a bus operator which built a tourist bus body on it.|$|E
5|$|The company started {{producing}} <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> in 1950, and the superstructures {{were built}} {{by a number of}} Finnish coach builders. The last models were appreciated by a number of bus operators, and missed after production was stopped. All Vanaja <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> were fitted with air brakes by 1958, after the failure of hydraulic brakes on a Vanaja bus had led to one of the worst traffic accidents ever to have happened in Finland.|$|E
5|$|Vanajan Autotehdas {{was always}} a small company, {{employing}} about 400 people in 1968, and in the 1960s its market share was barely 5% in Finland. Almost all Vanajas were sold for the domestic market; only a few units were exported. Vanaja vehicles became known for their robust construction and high degree of customisation. The number of Vanaja <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> and lorries totalled 7,140 units; this consists of 260 lorry and 66 <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> models; for 116 lorry models {{only one or two}} units were produced. Vanajas had a good reputation and they are nowadays valued by vintage vehicle enthusiasts.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> were tested in a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Combining the {{strengths}} of the both companies was not successful in <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> production because of strategic mistakes by SAT. The Vanaja LK-series with a large, centrally mounted engine was discontinued, which led to the loss of the main customer, Väinö Paunu Oy. SAT offered Sisu chassis to replace the Vanaja models, but a number of bus operators, including TKL, rejected them.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 and 1981 {{the factory}} made tram bogies under licence from DÜWAG. The trams {{were made by}} Valmet {{for the city of}} Helsinki. <b>Bus</b> <b>chassis</b> {{production}} was officially discontinued in 1986, although in 1989 a small batch was made and later fitted with Ajokki coach bodies for delivery to a customer in the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Vanaja lorries and <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> {{produced}} totalled 7,140units. In addition, dozens of {{trailers and semi-trailers}} were produced and sold under the Vanaja brand in connection with lorries. In 1955, four Vanaja rail buses made in collaboration with coachbuilding firm Kiitokori were sold to the Finnish State Railways.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{fell into}} {{financial}} difficulties by {{end of the}} 1960s; {{this led to a}} merger with the other Finnish heavy vehicle producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab at the end of 1968. The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971, after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu terminal tractors, <b>bus</b> <b>chassis,</b> military vehicles and mobile crane chassis. The factory now belongs to Patriawhich produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriersand heavy-vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles.|$|E
5|$|VAT's {{positioning}} in the heavy-vehicle market strengthened in 1950 and {{the company}} started producing <b>bus</b> <b>chassis.</b> The same year, VAT introduced a new product familythe VK series. Production was disrupted by a three-month strike, {{as a result of}} which completion of some of the 150 state-ordered vehicles scheduled for delivery that year was delayed until the following year. Despite its difficulties VAT posted a profit of almost two million marks. By now, the company employed 106 workers.|$|E

5|$|About 260 {{models of}} lorry were produced, which were fitted with 35 types of engine, 20 {{different}} gearboxes, and 15 to 20 types of cabin. Many {{of the models}} were produced in small numbers, with 116 types only being represented by one or two units. Most of the differences came from special wheelbases that always needed approval from the authorities. In many cases, it is impossible even for experts to identify different models and years of production. There were 66 types of <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> produced, {{and the number of}} different body types built on them by various coach builders and operators is unknown.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>chassis</b> {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced ten more rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, <b>bus</b> <b>chassis,</b> terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was {{three to four years}} before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E

5|$|VAT {{delivered}} {{its first}} mid-engined <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> to Ajokki Oy coach works in April 1958. It was {{powered by a}} horizontally mounted 164-hp AEC diesel engine. The end customer was bus operator Väinö Paunu Oy, which also participated in the development work. In 1960, VAT introduced the VLK500 chassis with air suspension and dual-circuit air brakes. VAT returned to building rear-engined buses in 1966–67, but sales did not reach {{the level of the}} mid- and front-engined models. The company conducted a number of experiments with the construction; one example was a bus with a frameless structure in which the beams were replaced by a lighter solution.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{rebranding}} to Scania in 1968, Scania-Vabis {{had delivered}} {{a very limited}} number of CR76 chassis-frameworks (less actual bodywork) with transversally rear-mounted engine for external bodying, based on the complete bus with the same name. From 1968 it was also delivered as a standard <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> known as BR110.|$|E
25|$|A {{derivative}} of this free-flow style of travel were the hippie trucks and buses, hand-crafted mobile houses {{built on a}} truck or <b>bus</b> <b>chassis</b> to facilitate a nomadic lifestyle, as documented in the 1974 book Roll Your Own.
