40|$|Aims: For {{the study}} of transcorneal in vitro {{permeation}} of ophthalmic drugs, excised animal cornea or corneal epithelial cell culture are frequently used {{as a replacement for}} the human cornea. The main purposes of this study were to reconstruct a complete human organotypic cornea equivalent, consisting of all three different cell types (epithelial, stromal, and endothelial); to test the barrier function of this bio-engineered human cornea using three different model drugs (pilocarpine hydrochloride (PHCl), <b>befunolol</b> hydrochloride (BHCl), and hydrocortisone (HC)); and to determine its usefulness as an in vitro model for prediction of ocular drug absorption into the human eye...|$|E
