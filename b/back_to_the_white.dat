25|$|North on Quaker Road, across Rowanty Creek at the Lewis Farm, Chamberlain's men {{encountered}} the brigades of Brigadier Generals Henry A.

Chamberlain was wounded and almost captured during the ensuing back-and-forth battle. Chamberlain's brigade, reinforced by a four-gun artillery battery and regiments from the brigades of Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory and Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Alfred L. Pearson, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor, drove the Confederates <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Oak Road Line.

Warren ordered Chamberlain to hold his position but Chamberlain suggested to Griffin {{that they would be}} better off attacking the Confederates than remaining under fire and being picked off. Griffin approved the proposal and Chamberlain's brigade, along with the brigade commanded by Colonel (Brevet Brigadier General) Edgar M. Gregory, charged Hunton's brigade and drove them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Oak Road Line. Then Chamberlain's and Gregory's men crossed White Oak Road.

25|$|Before {{headlining}} {{their own}} tours, Mindless Behavior toured with many established musicians, such as The Backstreet Boys, Jason Derulo, Justin Bieber, {{and was an}} opening act for Janet Jackson during her Number Ones, Up Close and Personal tour. The group had become quite popular from appearing on BET's 106 & Park, and also headlined the first BET Closer to My Dreams Tour alongside Diggy Simmons, Lil Twist, Trevante and Jawan Harris. In 2011, Mindless Behavior headlined the Scream Tour with Diggy Simmons, which featured The OMG Girlz, Jacob Latimore, and Hamilton Park. The group also performed at the White House twice and were the first African American boy band to do so. Also in 2011, they performed at the prestigious White House Easter Egg Roll. In 2012, they were performers at Arthur Ashe Kids' Day. In 2013, the group performed for Wade's World Foundation, an organization by Dwyane Wade that provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health and social skills for children in at-risk situations. They were also welcomed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House to perform at the Kids Inaugural Ball.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{during the}} Third Age, a still {{weakened}} Sauron covertly established a stronghold at Dol Guldur. In {{response to this}} undetermined evil, the Valar sent five Maiar to Middle-earth. Taking the form of wizards, they were led by Saruman. Unsure {{of the origin of}} the evil power in Dol Guldur, the wizard Gandalf was sent to investigate. However, Sauron hid from Gandalf, waiting for four hundred years before returning. Around the same time, the One Ring was found by a Hobbit named Sméagol, who became utterly corrupted by it, living in the caves of the Misty Mountains, and physically transforming into a creature known as Gollum. For five hundred years, Gollum was consumed and corrupted by the Ring. Eventually, Gandalf was able to determine the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron. Gandalf reported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Council, but Saruman dissuaded them from moving against Sauron. Only when he learned the One Ring may be {{in the vicinity of the}} Gladden Fields did Saruman agree to attack Sauron, hoping to find the Ring himself. The Council drove Sauron from Dol Guldur, unaware that he knew the Ring had been found. Just prior to Sauron's departure, the Ring passed to another hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, who used it to assist in the victory of elves, men and dwarves at the Battle of the Five Armies. Sixty years later, Gollum was captured by orcs, and taken to Mordor, where he was tortured into revealing the owner and location of the Ring; Bilbo Baggins of the Shire. In the meantime, Bilbo had left the Shire to live in Rivendell, and upon the advice of Gandalf had (very reluctantly) given the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. With the information given him by Gollum, Sauron, still unable to take physical form, thus sent the Nazgûl to the Shire to retrieve the One Ring.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2009, Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, {{called on}} the Senate to approve Johnsen and several other nominees, and denounced the [...] "unprecedented delays in the {{consideration}} of qualified and noncontroversial nominations".

[...] With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest scattered to minor candidates. [...] Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. [...] After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio. [...] Grant received 306 votes on the final ballot, his supporters staying committed to their man to the bitter end. [...] Logan moved that the nomination be made unanimous, and it was, but those 306 Stalwarts were immortalized in Republican myth.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for the Resolute Desk was during the John F.

Kennedy Jr. playing under the Resolute Desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show the Resolute Desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it.
