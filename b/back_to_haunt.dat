5|$|While these {{specific}} failings came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the Empire in subsequent decades, {{perhaps the greatest}} weakness of the Peace of Augsburg was its failure {{to take into account}} the growing diversity of religious expression emerging in the evangelical (Lutheran) and Reformed traditions. Other confessions had acquired popular, if not legal, legitimacy in the intervening decades and by 1555, the reforms proposed by Luther were no longer the only possibilities of religious expression: Anabaptists, such as the Frisian Menno Simons (1492–1559) and his followers; the followers of John Calvin, who were particularly strong in the southwest and the northwest; and the followers of Huldrych Zwingli were excluded from considerations and protections under the Peace of Augsburg. According to the Augsburg agreement, their religious beliefs remained heretical.|$|E
5|$|A blocked {{field goal}} and extra-point attempt {{provided}} {{the margin of}} victory for the Miami Dolphins. Ex-Dolphin receiver Morris Owens came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> his old team with three touchdown catches. Starting quarterback Parnell Dickinson threw the first, then was replaced by recently acquired quarterback Terry Hanratty after injuring his ankle. When Hanratty proved ineffective, Steve Spurrier, who had not practiced during the week due to a swollen knee, came off the bench to throw the final two touchdowns. It took a final-minute, 55-yard Garo Yepremian field goal to clinch the game for the Dolphins, whose pass defense had been decimated by injuries. 192 of the Buccaneers’ 334 total yards came through the air. John McKay would later point to this game as {{the high point of}} the Buccaneers’ season. Dolphins linebacker Nick Buoniconti saw it differently, calling the narrow victory “a disgrace” and “the low point in Miami Dolphins’ history”.|$|E

The next evening she came to meet him with a smile as usual, but in her eyes was still that odd {{suggestion}} of lurking fear; and when, seated beside her, {{he put his hand on}} hers it seemed to him she shrank away from him. It was an unconscious movement. It brought <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him that <b>haunting</b> memory of hill and stream when some soft-eyed fawn, strayed from her fellows, would let him approach quite close to her, and then, when he put out his hand to caress her, would start away with a swift, quivering movement.|$|R
60|$|But he was ill at ease.

He gave up the raid for the day, and hurried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>haunted</b> house by the obscurest route he knew. His mother was gone; but she came back, by and by, with {{the news of the}} grand reception at Patsy Cooper's, and soon persuaded him that the opportunity was like a special Providence, it was so inviting and perfect. So he went raiding, after all, and made a nice success of it while everybody was gone to Patsy Cooper's. Success gave him nerve and even actual intrepidity; insomuch, indeed, that after he had conveyed his harvest to his mother in a back alley, he went to the reception himself, and added several of the valuables of that house to his takings.|$|R
60|$|It {{had been}} the {{intention}} of our young sailor to stay out all night, had the weather been promising. His wish was to ascertain how he might manage the boat, single-handed, while he slept, and also to learn {{the extent of the}} shoals. As the extraordinary fertility of the crater superseded the necessity of his labouring much to keep himself supplied with food, he had formed a plan of cruising off the shoals, for days at a time, in the hope of falling in with something that was passing, and which might carry him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the <b>haunts</b> of men. No vessel would or could come in sight of the crater, so long as the existence of the reefs was known; but the course steered by the Rancocus was a proof that ships did occasionally pass in that quarter of the Pacific. Mark had indulged in no visionary hopes on this subject, for he knew he might keep in the offing a twelvemonth and see nothing; but an additional twenty-four hours might realize all his hopes.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1999, Dench won the Tony Award for her 1999 Broadway {{performance}} {{in the role of}} Esme Allen in Sir David Hare's Amy's View.

25|$|As well as {{sharing the}} same seven actors, the trilogy was also written {{to use the same}} set: a flat in the London Docklands, where Ayckbourn himself owns a flat. Beyond that, there was no {{intentional}} link between the plays, and the only reason the name Damsels in Distress was chosen was that the plays all happened to include a female character in some sort of trouble. However, there were nonetheless a number of common themes that arose from the plays' settings: flats owned by well-to-do Londoners who know little of who their neighbours are or what they do; and seedy vices left behind from London's old East End coming <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> them. The plays also shared themes common to most Ayckbourn plays.|$|E

25|$|The {{conquest of}} Cuba was {{organized}} in 1510 by the recently restored Viceroy of the Indies, Diego Colón, {{under the command}} of Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, who became Cuba's first governor until his death in 1524. The new settlers did not wish to be under the personal authority of Colón, so Velázquez founded the city of Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa in 1511 and convoked a general cabildo (a local government council), which was duly authorized to deal directly with Spain. This legal move removed Velázquez and the settlers from under the authority of Colón, their nominal superior. It was a precedent that would come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> Velázquez during Hernán Cortés's conquest of Mexico. Other cities were later founded under Velázquez: Bayamo in 1513; Santísima Trinidad, Sancti Spíritus and San Cristóbal de La Habana in 1514; Puerto Príncipe and Santiago de Cuba in 1515. After the conquest of Mexico, Cuba experienced an exodus of settlers, and its population remained small for the next two centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{role and}} {{authority}} of the ulema declined after the rise of King Faisal {{even though they had}} helped bring him to the throne in 1964. Despite his piety and biological relationship through his mother to the AlasShaykh family, and his support for the pan-Islamic movement in his struggle against pan-Arabism, he decreased the ulema's power and influence. Unlike his successor, King Faisal attempted to ensure that the most radical clerics did not hold society's most powerful religious posts. He tried to block extremist clerics from gaining dominion over religious institutions such as the Council of Senior Ulema, the kingdom's highest religious body, or rising to high religious positions such as Grand Mufti, a politically recognized senior expert charged with maintaining the entire system of Islamic law. Still, {{at least some of the}} king's advisers warned early on that, once religious zealots were encouraged, they would come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> the kingdom. King Faisal rejected the ulema's opposition to aspects of his accelerated modernization attempts, sometimes even in matters considered by them to be major issues.|$|E
25|$|During this time, the Anglican Church assumed {{de facto}} {{administrative}} {{responsibility in the}} far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials and later the federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations – a decision which would come <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>haunt</b> it much later. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to, among other things, assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language: the merits and demerits of that system in a broad sense, such as they were, have latterly been entirely overwhelmed by {{the issue of the}} wholly reprehensible abuse of some of its child wards by sexually disordered mission personnel. At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga'a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 and was the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada's Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.|$|E
