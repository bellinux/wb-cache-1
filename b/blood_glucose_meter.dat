2500|$|Accuracy of glucose meters is {{a common}} topic of {{clinical}} concern. Blood glucose meters must meet accuracy standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). According to ISO 15197 Blood glucose meters must provide results that are within ±15% of a laboratory standard for concentrations above 100mg/dL or within ±15mg/dL for concentrations below 100mg/dL at least 95% of the time. However, {{a variety of factors}} can affect the accuracy of a test. Factors affecting accuracy of various meters include calibration of meter, ambient temperature, pressure use to wipe off strip (if applicable), size and quality of blood sample, high levels of certain substances (such as ascorbic acid) in blood, hematocrit, dirt on meter, humidity, and aging of test strips. Models vary in their susceptibility to these factors and in their ability to prevent or warn of inaccurate results with error messages. The Clarke Error Grid has been a common way of analyzing and displaying accuracy of readings related to management consequences. More recently an improved version of the Clarke Error Grid has come into use: It is known as the Consensus Error Grid. Older blood glucose meters often need to be [...] "coded" [...] with the lot of test strips used, otherwise, the accuracy of the <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> <b>meter</b> may be compromised due to lack of calibration.|$|E
