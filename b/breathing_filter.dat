A <b>breathing</b> <b>filter</b> exchanging heat and moisture prevents asthma induced by cold air. Allergy 1995 : 50 : 225 - 228. © Munksgaard 1995. In order {{to devise a}} protective aid against bronchial obstruction induced by cold air, we have tested a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter</b> with heat and moisture exchanging properties. Nine asthma patients, who all {{had a history of}} cold-induced asthma, took part in exercise tests on an ergometer bicycle at a temperature of approximately- 10 °C, without and with a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter.</b> Without a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter,</b> the maximum reduction in FEV, was, on average, 36 %. With the <b>breathing</b> <b>filter,</b> the maximum reduction in EEV, was, on average, 11 %. The difference was clearly significant (P< 0. 001). A further five cold-sensitive asthmatics performed similar exercise tests at- 10 °C on three occasions: 1) without and 2) with a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter</b> as above, and 3) with two breathing filters connected in parallel: one for inspiration and the other for expiration. Thus, no heat-moisture exchange could take place. The fall in EEV, after provocation without a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter</b> and with parallel breathing filters was similar but attenuated when rebreathing took place through the <b>breathing</b> <b>filter.</b> The results confirm the theory that in cold/exercise-induced asthma, it is indeed the heat and/or water loss from the airways that triggers airway narrowing, and that a heat and moisture exchanging filter has a considerable protective efi"ect and can be of value in the treatment of asthma...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: One of the {{problems}} that the delivery of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) via a helmet poses is the generation of noise. The objective of our study was to assess the effect that the use of filter has on sound pressure levels generated by the delivery of positive airway pressure at different gas flow rates. Materials and Methods: Sound pressure levels generated by neonatal helmet CPAP delivery were measured at different gas flows (20, 30, and 40 l/min) with and without a <b>breathing</b> <b>filter.</b> Noise intensity was measured by installing microphones in the inner ear of dummy heads wearing helmets. Results: The sound pressure level increased by 38 % at a gas flow of 40 l/min, as compared to a gas flow of 20 l/min { 74 dBA [interquartile range (IQR) 2, 2] vs 52 dBA (IQR 5, 9), respectively}. Using the <b>breathing</b> <b>filter</b> as a diffuser has a variety of effects on sound pressure levels according to the gas flow rate. Conclusion: The intensity of the noise generated by helmet delivery of positive airway pressure depends on the type of helmet used, gas flow, and use or not of a diffuser filter. Breathing filters with gas flows over 30 l/min might not be recommended since they would not attenuate but will rather amplify sound pressure...|$|E

Despite its prevalence, the cardiovascular effects of benzene have rarely been studied. Hence, we examined whether exposure to benzene {{is associated with}} increased CVD risk. The effects of benzene exposure in mice were assessed by direct inhalation, while the effects of benzene exposure in humans was assessed in 210 individuals with mild to high CVD risk by measuring urinary levels of the benzene metabolite trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MA). Generalized linear models {{were used to assess}} the association between benzene exposure and CVD risk. Mice inhaling volatile benzene had significantly reduced levels of circulating angiogenic cells (Flk- 1 +/Sca- 1 +) as well as an increased levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) compared with control mice <b>breathing</b> <b>filtered</b> air.

Although t,t-MA was not associated with plasma markers of inflammation or thrombosis, t,t-MA levels were higher in smokers and in individuals with dyslipidemia. In smokers, t,t-MA levels were positively associated with urinary metabolites of nicotine (cotinine) and acrolein (3 -hydroxymercapturic acid). Levels of t,t-MA were also associated with CVD risk as assessed using the Framingham Risk Score and this association was independent of smoking.

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} the duration of exposition of filters and their most optimum position in different types of respiratory circuits. Subjects and methods. Group 1 comprised patients receiving not more than 12 -hour artificial ventilation (AV) through a coaxial respiratory-circuit, without a humidifier, moisture accumulators, and a nebulizer. The filters were set between the intubation tube and the circuit. Group 2 included patients having more than 12 -hour AV through the disposal respiratory circuits including a nebulizer, a humidifier, and inspiratory and expiratory moisture accumulators.

Before regularly replacing a filter and/or a circuit, samples were taken for bacteriological tests from different portions of the circuit at various intervals: 4, 12, 24, 48, 96, 120, and 144 hours after initiation of AV, as well as before tracheal extubation in a patient. Results. The data obtained during the study have indicated that the <b>breathing</b> circuit <b>filters</b> afford a reliable protection from the entry of environmental microorganisms into the patient&# 8217;s respiratory tract. In Group 1, AV did not result in the occurrence of pneumonia or tracheobronchitis.

Ultrastructural aspects of leaf morphology were investigated by means of Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Polyciclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) extraction was conducted on dried leaves by sonication in dichloromethane; extracts were analyzed by HR-GC–MS, after clean up on Florisil columns. The target PAHs were those addressed by EU air quality directive 2008 / 50 /EC, i. e. benzo(a) pyrene, benz(a) antracene, benzo(b) fluoranthene, benzo(j) fluoranthene, benzo(k) fluoranthene, indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd) pyrene and dibenzo(a,h) anthracene. Since plants exposed to air pollutants experience physiological changes before exhibiting visible damage to leaves, the Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) was calculated considering the ascorbic acid, total chlorophyll, pH, and relative water contents for leaves collected in control and experimental sites. The project started in October 2010 and it is currently running. The expected results will provide valuable information for greenbelt designers and urban landscapers to select tolerant plant species for the urban green...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess and compare the humidification, heating, and {{resistance}} properties of three commercially available heat-moisture exchangers (HMEs). To mimic clinical conditions, a previously validated, new, realistic experimental set-up and measurement protocol was used. Prospective, comparative experimental study. Surgical Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Rotterdam. An experimental set-up consisting of a patient model, measurement systems, and ventilator and three different HME types. The air flow, pressure in the ventilation circuit, pressure difference over the HME, and partial water vapour pressure and temperature at each side of the HMEs were measured. Measurements were repeated every 30 min during the first 2 h and every hour up to 24 h for each HME at six different ventilator settings. The mean inspiratory and maximum expiratory resistance, flow-weighted mean absolute humidity and temperature outputs, and humidification and heating efficiencies of HMEs were calculated. The Dar Hygroster had the highest humidity output, temperature output, humidification efficiency, and heating efficiency values throughout the study (32. 8 +/- 21. mg/l, 32. 2 +/- 0. 8 degrees C, 86. 3 +/- 2. 3 %, and 0. 9 +/- 0. 01 %, respectively) in comparison to the Humid-Vent Filter (25. 3 +/- 3. 2 mg/l, 31. 9 +/- 0. 8 degrees C, 72. 2 +/- 5. 3 %, 0. 9 +/- 0. 02 %, respectively) and the Pall Ultipor BB 100 <b>breathing</b> circuit <b>filter</b> (23. 4 +/- 3 mg/l, 28. 3 +/- 0. 7 degrees C, 68. 8 +/- 5. 9 %, 0. 8 +/- 0. 02 %, respectively). The inspiratory and expiratory resistance of the HMEs remained below clinically acceptable maximum values (2. 60 +/- 0. 04 and 2. 45 +/- 0. 05 cmH 2 O/l per s, respectively). The Dar Hygroster filter was found to have the highest humidity and temperature output of all three HMEs, the Humid-Vent filter had a satisfactory humidity output only at low tidal volume flow rate and minute volume settings, whereas the Pall Ultipore BB 100 never achieved a sufficient humidity and temperature outpu...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the optimal configuration {{and performance of}} an adaptive feed forward neural network <b>filter</b> to predict <b>breathing</b> in respiratory motion compensation systems for external beam radiation therapy. Method and Materials: A two-layer feed forward neural network was trained to predict future breathing amplitudes for 27 recorded breathing histories. The prediction intervals ranged from 100 to 500 ms. The optimal sampling frequency, number of input samples, training rate, and number of training epochs were determined for each breathing history and prediction interval. The overall optimal filter configuration was determined from this parameter survey, and its accuracy for each breathing example was compared to the individually optimal filter setups. Prediction accuracy was also compared to breathing stability {{as measured by the}} autocorrelation of the breathing signal. Results: The survey of filter configurations converged on a standard setup for all examples of breathing. For 24 of the 27 breathing histories the accuracy of the standard filter for a 300 ms prediction interval was within a few percent of the individually optimized filter setups; for the remaining three histories the standard filter was 5 %– 15 % less accurate. Conclusions: A standard adaptive neural network filter setup can provide approximately optimal breathing prediction {{for a wide range of}} <b>breathing</b> patterns. The <b>filter</b> accuracy has a clear correlation with the stability of breathing...|$|R
