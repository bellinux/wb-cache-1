He pondered {{for a moment as}} to why a plate of silver coins would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert where no one else travels, and realised the Devil must have laid it out there to tempt him. Anthony continued walking along and saw a pile of gold in his way which the Devil had laid there to deceive him, but he ignored them and continued on his way.|$|E

By early autumn, Man Chong deduced that it was the harvest season, so the Wu soldiers and their families would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields collecting the harvest, and their strongholds would thus be undefended. He then sent his troops to launch a surprise attack on them, destroying their strongholds and burning down their crops. Cao Rui issued an imperial decree to praise Man Chong and award the spoils of war to Man Chong's troops.|$|E
25|$|The {{fifth day}} {{did not hold}} much enthusiasm as the {{scorecards}} might suggest, as India took off from where they started, from 362/6. India's tail wagged as they put on 47 runs {{for the loss of}} 4 wickets. Ajit Agarkar was the first man to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning to Andy Bichel, and then he was followed by Parthiv Patel, whose ill-fated, top-edged hook was caught by a diving Bichel off Gillespie. The two batsmen departed without India adding any run to their score. At 362/8, Zaheer Khan and Harbhajan Singh had a fine outing with the bat. Zaheer swatted a six and three boundaries in his 27 and Harbhajan hit 19 in his own inimitable fashion, as India pushed along to 409. They had obtained a lead of 86– a rarity in Australia against Australia itself. Moreover, this achievement was significant because India were written off before the match even began.|$|E

He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances, including [...] "the demands of family and work, lack of financial independence, an indifferent publishing environment." [...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When I was married, and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was the house) ... I never craved to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace." [...] He suggests that, as well as adverse material circumstances, Anderson's career was delayed, and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain [...] "diffidence regarding her gifts." [...] In her own essay entitled [...] "Starting Too Late," [...] Anderson complains that [...] "they are unwilling servants, those skills we learn too late." [...] She would perhaps have described success as such a skill. When asked about how winning awards had affected her life, she replied that: ...|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{news outlets}} started {{reporting}} on the concert tour supporting Rebel Heart. The Italian newspaper Torino Today reported Madonna was planning on returning to Turin with the tour on November 20 and 21, 2015. The tour was called the Rebel Heart Tour with appearances in North America, Europe, Asia and Oceania, beginning on September 9, 2015. Billboard reported that the tour would use arenas only, and would visit cities where Madonna had not performed previously. The initial itinerary had 25–30 shows in North America and 20–25 shows in Europe, with additional dates being revealed later on. This tour was the singer's first visit to Australia in more than 20 years, having last toured there with The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, and her first time performing in New Zealand and the Philippines. The tour's main stage was elevated and set {{up at the end}} of each arena, with a long catwalk extending from its middle to the center of the space. At the middle of the catwalk there was a circular stage, while the far end of the pathway ended in a heart-shaped stage. Designers working on the tour's wardrobe included: Jeremy Scott for Moschino, Alessandro Michele for Gucci and Alexander Wang, along with Fausto Puglisi, Prada, Miu Miu, Swarovski, Lebanese designer Nicolas Jebran, as well as Madonna's longtime collaborator Arianne Phillips. The tour generated positive critical reviews, many noting that Madonna appeared to be in a happy mood onstage. It grossed a total of $169.8 million from 82 shows, with over 1.045 million ticket sales. In March 2016, Madonna announced that the Sydney, Australia shows of March 19 and 20, 2016 would be filmed for a tour DVD release. Danny B. Tull and Nathan Rissman, who had both worked on Madonna's previous feature and tour films, will be directing it. In September 2016, Madonna revealed that she had finished watching a [...] "rough assembly" [...] of the tour's film, and it would <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> next two months.|$|E

What is all this other stuff?'". Franzen also hinted that the new novel would probably also be long, adding [...] "I've let go of any illusion that I'm a writer of 150-page novels. I need room to let things turn around over time and see them from the whole lives of other characters, not just the single character. For better or worse, one point of view never seems to do it for me." [...] In October 2014, during a discussion at Colgate University, Franzen read a [...] "self-contained first-person narrative" [...] that is part of a novel that he hopes will <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 2015.|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} 'Basic Training' the recruit is now {{attached to}} a Field Intelligence Bureau (FIB). His/her training here lasts for 1–2 years. He/she is given firsthand experience {{of what it was}} to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> figurative cold, conducting clandestine operations. During night exercises under realistic conditions, he/she is taught infiltration and exfiltration. He/she is instructed to avoid capture and if caught, how to face interrogation. He/she learns the art of reconnoitre, making contacts, and, the numerous skills of operating an intelligence mission. At the end of the field training, the new recruit is brought back to the school for final polishing. Before his deployment in the field, he/she is given exhaustive training in the art of self-defence mainly Krav Maga, and the use of technical espionage devices. He/she is also drilled in various administrative disciplines so that he could take his place in the foreign missions without arousing suspicion. He/she is now ready to operate under the cover of an Embassy to gather information, set up his own network of informers, moles or operatives as the task may require.

Many day boats {{are used for}} scuba-divers and also for other marine tourism activities such as fishing and whale-watching. In general, divers or passengers will spend only the daylight hours on a day boat, and do not sleep in them overnight. Dive boats which provide sleeping accommodation are generally referred to as [...] "live-aboard" [...] boats. Generally a professional crew operate the boat. The boat provides shelter from the weather {{and is likely to}} have various facilities such as a toilet (called the [...] "head") and a small kitchen (called a [...] "galley"), to cater for the guests and crew. Day-boats may have a saloon where divers can relax on upholstered benches, and one or more dining tables. Many day boats also have an uncovered sun-deck, and a shaded area, for divers wishing to <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open air. The boat will usually have a diving air compressor, oxygen first aid, a VHF radio, a GPS and possibly gas blending facilities. A day boat would generally be used to transport divers to multiple dive-sites (typically between one and three sites) during the same day, or multiple dives at the same site, with surface rest and refreshment periods between them.|$|E
