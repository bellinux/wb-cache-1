40|$|The three {{dimensional}} viscous time-mean {{flow in the}} Pratt and Whitney alternate {{design space}} shuttle main engine fuel turbine is simulated using the average passage Navier-Stokes equations. The migration of secondary flows generated by upstream <b>blade</b> <b>rows</b> and their effect {{on the performance of}} downstream <b>blade</b> <b>rows</b> is studied. The present simulation confirms that the flow in this two stage turbine is highly three dimensional and dominated by the tip leakage flow. The tip leakage vortex generated by the first blade persists through the second blade and adversely affects its performance. The greatest mixing of the inlet total temperature distortion occurs in the second vane and is due to the large leakage vortex generated by the upstream rotor. It is assumed that the predominant spanwise mixing mechanism in this low aspect ratio turbine is the radial transport due to the deterministically unsteady vortical flow generated by upstream <b>blade</b> <b>rows.</b> A by-product of the analysis is accurate pressure and heat loads for all <b>blade</b> <b>rows</b> under the influence of neighboring <b>blade</b> <b>rows.</b> These aero loads are useful for advanced structural analysis of the vanes and blades...|$|R

The {{two-dimensional}} flow-field {{through the}} stationary <b>blade</b> <b>row</b> of a radial inflow turbine in a torque converter was analysed {{by means of}} a potential flow model and a viscous flow model. The purpose was to compare the accuracy with which the two flow models predict the flow field through the static turbine <b>blade</b> <b>row.</b> The freestream turbulence level necessary to optimise the accuracy of the viscous flow model was also investigated. A first order source-vortex panel method with flat panels was used to apply the potential flow model. A radial inflow freestream was used. It was found that the stator <b>blade</b> <b>row</b> directly upstream of the turbine had {{to be included in the}} analysis to direct the flow at the turbine inlet. Even then the panel method did not satisfactorily predict the pressure distribution on a typical blade of the static 2 nd turbine <b>blade</b> <b>row.</b> A two-dimensional viscous flow model gave excellent results.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} of the Harmonic Balance method for threedimensional, unsteady, multi-stage turbomachinery problems modeled by the Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations. This time-domain algorithm simulates the true geometry of the turbomachine (with the exact blade counts) using only one blade passage per <b>blade</b> <b>row,</b> thus leading to drastic savings in both CPU and memory requirements. Modified periodic boundary conditions are applied on the upper and lower boundaries of the single passage in order to account for the lack of a common periodic interval for each <b>blade</b> <b>row.</b> The solution algorithm allows each <b>blade</b> <b>row</b> to resolve a specified set of frequencies in order to obtain the desired computation accuracy; typically, a <b>blade</b> <b>row</b> resolves only the blade passing frequencies of its neighbors. Since every <b>blade</b> <b>row</b> is setup to resolve different frequencies the actual Harmonic Balance solution in each of these blade rows is obtained at different instances in time or time levels. The interaction between blade rows occurs through sliding mesh interfaces in physical time. Space and time interpolation are carried out at these interfaces and can, if not properly treated, introduce aliasing errors that can lead to instabilities. With appropriate resolution of the time interpolation, all instabilities are eliminated. This new procedure is demonstrated using both two-and three dimensional test cases and can be shown to significantly reduce the cost of multi-stage simulations while capturing the dominant unsteadiness in the problem.

40|$|Downprevious {{published}} {{experience has}} been discussed in Part I and so will not be repeated here. The objective {{of the project was}} firmly focused on the re-design of the engine compressors and this had an influence on the ap-proach taken throughout the work. The compressors to be re-designed were existing engine machines that were well under-stood. In particular, the high pressure ~HP! compressor was in use in the Trent 700 and 800 engines. It was decided that the basic axial and radial matching and vortex design of the compressor would not be altered as part of the redesign because these were deemed acceptable in the existing machine. The objective was to improve the efficiency without reducing the stability margin or operating range of the compressor. It was also decided to re-design the engine compressor blading in two steps. In the first, the stator <b>blade</b> <b>rows</b> were redesigned and this was followed by a re-design of the rotor <b>blade</b> <b>rows.</b> The designs were also con-strained to be back-compatible with the existing blading so {{that it would not be}} essential to have all the 3 -D-designed <b>blade</b> <b>rows</b> in the compressor. A mixed set of blading, with some rows being unchanged from the original 2 -D design, would be an option if so desired.
