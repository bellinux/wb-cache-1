40|$|The South Africa {{criminal}} law allows the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> {{to raise a}} <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence {{in the context of}} non-pathological criminal incapacity. However, there is a need of expert evidence to support such defence for it to succeed in the court of law. Hence, this paper scrutinizes the task of expert evidence in support of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome in order to reach the extent of its effectiveness. Nevertheless, such evidence is not indispensable but without it, the court hardly gets persuaded resulting into the failure of the defence. The meaning of <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome is articulated in the paper as well as the fact that <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence falls under the defence of non-pathological criminal incapacity. The origin and development of the non-pathological criminal incapacity has also been discussed by comparing it with pathological criminal incapacity which emanates from mental illness while the former does not originate from a mental illness. Psychiatrist are {{in a better position to}} understand the latter while psychologists are in a better position to understand the former, hence it is advisable if the court pays more attention or attach more weight to the evidence given by the psychologists if this defence is to succeed and have a brilliant future. Moreover, the possible defences available to the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> have been mentioned as well as the cases that used non-pathological criminal incapacity as a defence particularly with regard to the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence. Both cases that were successful and unsuccessful have been elaborated. However, the cases that failed with the defence are in large numbers than the successful ones. Although expert evidence is essential to support the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence, it is unjustly and unfairly applied on the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> who is an accused person in the court leading to the failure of the defence. In short the use of expert evidence has failed in its application as the two professions, law and medicine has failed to make this defence work as they have not reached an agreement concerning the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence. In addition, the paper looks at the obstacles linked with the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence as well as offering suggestions to be put in place in order to make the use of expert evidence achievable. This can only be done if both the lawyers and mental health professionals come to terms with each other where they are able to understand the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome and the actions which led to the situation where <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> finds herself as an accused person. Finally, the paper concludes that expert evidence has failed tremendously in its application leading to the failure of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> syndrome defence in the context of non-pathological criminal incapacity. Consequently a lot still needs to be done to protect the women who face numerous obstacles; both personal and legal as they do not face justice in court and everyone must take part to put an end to <b>battering</b> of <b>women</b> which is inhuman and morally wrong.

50|$|The <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> {{defense is}} a defense used {{in court that}} the person accused of an assault/murder was {{suffering}} from battered person syndrome at the material time.

25|$|A 1984 {{study on}} the impact of peer support and support groups for victims of {{domestic}} violence showed that 146 <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> found women's peer support groups the most helpful source of a range of available treatments. The women in these groups appeared to give direct advice and to act as role models. A 1986 study on 70 adolescent mothers considered to be at risk for domestic violence showed that peer support improved cognitive problem-solving skills, self-reinforcement, and parenting competence.|$|E
25|$|Intentional acts {{of cruelty}} {{can lead to}} {{multiple}} years behind bars. These acts (of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury) may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or actually hurt or killed {{one or more of}} their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets. <b>Battered</b> <b>women</b> report that they are prevented from leaving their abusers because they fear {{what will happen to the}} animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.|$|E

Coming into the bout Mayweather and Corrales were undefeated, and neither fighter had touched the canvas. Mayweather was The Ring's #2-ranked super featherweight in the world (and #7 pound-for-pound), while Corrales was the #1-ranked super featherweight in the world and #5 pound-for-pound. Before the fight was announced Mayweather had stated he wanted to fight Corrales, who was facing jail time for allegedly beating his pregnant wife.

40|$|The medicalization of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> in Ontario began {{a decade}} ago. As a result, victims of {{domestic}} violence have been constructed as psychologically 2 Ì† 7 ill 2 Ì† 7. Socialist feminist issues and concerns about the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> have been disqualified by the therapeutic community of experts who claim expertise on the issue of wife battery. The way in which a therapeutic framework shapes and defines mass media constructions of the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> are an underlying theme. Specific reference is made to popular magazine and newspaper articles between 1974 and 1996. The concepts of public consciousness, power, and discourse are analyzed {{in order to understand the}} change in meaning surrounding the <b>battered</b> <b>woman</b> within the last two decades.

2500|$|In Australia, {{self-defence}} {{might be}} considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder {{for a woman who}} kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life. [...] But the lack of success in raising self-defence in Australia for <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> has meant that provocation has been the main focus of the courts [...] In 2005, based on the Victorian Law Reform Commission's Defences to Homicide: Final Report, the Victorian government announced changes to the homicide laws in that jurisdiction, which are intended to address this perceived imbalance. Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence {{even in the absence of}} an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.|$|E
6000|$|Later on in {{that year}} the women began a new attack. Day and night, and all through the long nights of the Budget sittings, at all the piers of the gates of New Palace Yard and at St. Stephen's Porch, stood women pickets, and watched us silently and reproachfully as we went to and fro. They were women of all sorts, though, of course, the {{independent}} worker-class predominated. There were grey-headed old ladies standing there, sturdily charming in the rain; battered-looking, ambiguous women, with something of the desperate bitterness of <b>battered</b> <b>women</b> showing in their eyes; north-country factory girls; cheaply-dressed suburban women; trim, comfortable mothers of families; valiant-eyed girl graduates and undergraduates; lank, hungry-looking creatures, who stirred one's imagination; one very dainty little woman in deep mourning, I recall, grave and steadfast, with eyes fixed on distant things. Some of those women looked defiant, some timidly aggressive, some full of the stir of adventure, some drooping with cold and fatigue. The supply never ceased. I had a mortal fear that somehow the supply might halt or cease. I found that continual siege of the legislature extraordinarily impressive--infinitely more impressive than the feeble-forcible [...] "ragging" [...] of the more militant section. I thought of the appeal that must be going through the country, summoning the women from countless scattered homes, rooms, colleges, to Westminster.|$|E
