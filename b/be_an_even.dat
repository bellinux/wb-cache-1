5|$|The {{behavior}} of certain other systems, such as one-dimensional cyclic cellular automata, {{can also be}} {{described in terms of}} ballistic annihilation. There is a technical restriction on the particle positions for the ballistic annihilation view of Rule 184 that does not arise in these other systems, stemming from the alternating pattern of the background: in the particle system corresponding to a Rule 184 state, if two consecutive particles are both of the same type they must be an odd number of cells apart, while if they are of opposite types they must <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number of cells apart. However this parity restriction does not {{play a role in the}} statistical {{behavior of}} this system.|$|E

25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases {{the total number of}} possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).|$|E

25|$|The {{cable car}} begins moving when a {{clamping}} device {{attached to the}} car, called a grip, applies pressure to ("grips") the moving cable. Conversely, the car is stopped by releasing pressure on the cable (with or without completely detaching) and applying the brakes. This gripping and releasing action may be manual, {{as was the case}} in all early cable car systems, or automatic, as is the case in some recent cable operated people mover type systems. Gripping must <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> and gradual process in order to avoid bringing the car to cable speed too quickly and unacceptably jarring the passengers.|$|E
25|$|One of the analogs of {{interest}} {{was made by}} isoindolinone replacement of the phthaloyl ring. It was given the name EM-12 (Figure 3). This replacement was thought to increase the bioavailability of the substance because of increased stability. The molecule had been reported to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more potent teratogenic agent than thalidomide in rats, rabbits and monkeys. Additionally, these analogs are more potent inhibitors of angiogenesis than thalidomide. As well, the amino-thalidomide and amino-EM-12 were potent inhibitors of TNF-α. These two analogs later got the name lenalidomide, which is the EM-12 amino analog, and pomalidomide, the thalidomide amino analog.|$|E
25|$|International {{recruitment}} {{is often}} used to fill the nursing gap but gives rise to concern now that the U.S. Homeland Security has stopped the issuance of the H-1C visa, which was deemed specifically for nurses. Because of the Affordable Care Act, which will result in an increased number of insured Americans, it is estimated that there will <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> greater need for nurses in the near future. U.S. trained nurses are concerned, however, that this recruitment initiative impedes on their ability to obtain positions in the field after completing their training. A nursing shortage does not translate to new nursing jobs.|$|E

The ongoing hostility and threats to the lives of the Europeans resulted in a near mutiny by Fraser's crew, who wanted to escape overland. Quelling the revolt, Fraser and his men continued north upstream from present-day Yale, arriving in Fort George on August 6, 1808. The journey upstream took thirty-seven days. In total it took Fraser and his crew two-and-a-half months to travel from Fort George to Musqueam and back.|$|E
25|$|The Astros' {{opponent}} {{in their first}} ever World Series was the Chicago White Sox. Games 1 and 2 were held at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, while Games 3 and 4 were played at Minute Maid Park. Game 3 also marked the first Fall Classic game to be played {{in the state of}} Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 14 innings. Early conventional wisdom held that the White Sox were a slight favorite, but that Houston would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> match. However, the Astros' situational hitting continued to plague them throughout the World Series. The White Sox swept the Astros in the best-of-seven series with a run differential of only six.|$|E
25|$|He {{has also}} been known {{to reach out to}} younger golfers. One notable example came in 1984, when a teenage Canadian golfer who had {{previously}} met Nicklaus at an exhibition wrote him for career advice. The young golfer was right-handed but played left-handed; although he was showing considerable promise as a left-hander, he had been told that he might <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> better player if he switched to right-handed play. He wrote Nicklaus asking for advice; Nicklaus immediately wrote back telling him not to change if he was comfortable playing left-handed. The young Canadian, Mike Weir, decided to stay with left-handed play, and eventually became a Masters champion. He still keeps Nicklaus' letter framed in his home.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube {{has eight}} corners and twelve edges. There are 8! (40,320) ways {{to arrange the}} corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; {{the orientation of the}} eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 37 (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an even permutation exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 211 (2,048) possibilities.|$|E

25|$|Many {{effective}} altruists {{believe that}} reducing animal suffering {{should be a}} major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this. Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2,7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption. He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare. Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction. Philosophically, wild animal suffering may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.|$|E
25|$|While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV {{switched}} to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive {{taxes on the}} proceeds from the deal. To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in late 1994. NBC traded KCNC-TV in Denver and KUTV in Salt Lake City (which NBC had acquired earlier that year) to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>even</b> trade—displacing their respective longtime network affiliates, KMGH-TV and KSL-TV. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W {{in return for a}} minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded broadcasting facilities in Miami. The deal officially took effect at 12:30a.m. on September 10, 1995. The final NBC program aired on KYW-TV was a rerun of Saturday Night Live, which began at 11:30p.m. on September 9, 1995.|$|E
