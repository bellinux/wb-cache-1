25|$|The pioneer {{work to the}} {{implementation}} of the phase-contrast method to X-ray physics was presented in 1965 by Ulrich Bonse and Michael Hart, Department of Materials Science and Engineering of Cornell University, New York. They presented a crystal interferometer, made from a large and highly perfect single crystal. Not less than 30 years later the Japanese scientists Atsushi Momose, Tohoru Takeda and co-workers adopted this idea and refined it for application in <b>biological</b> <b>imaging,</b> for instance by increasing the field of view with the assistance of new setup configurations and phase retrieval techniques. The Bonse–Hart interferometer provides several orders of magnitude higher sensitivity in biological samples than other phase-contrast techniques, but it cannot use conventional X-ray tubes because the crystals only accept a very narrow energy band of X-rays (ΔE/E ~ 10−4). In 2012, Han Wen and co-workers took a step forward by replacing the crystals with nanometric phase gratings. The gratings split and direct X-rays over a broad spectrum, thus lifting the restriction on the bandwidth of the X-ray source. They detected sub nanoradian refractive bending of X-rays in biological samples with a grating Bonse–Hart interferometer.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the latter mask is simply to create {{insensitive}} regions between adjacent pixels, and its use can be avoided if specialized detector technology is employed. In this way, the EI configuration is simultaneously realized for all pixel rows of an area detector. This plurality of individual beamlets means that no scanning is required – the sample is placed downstream of the sample mask and imaged in a single shot (two if phase retrieval is performed). Although the set-up perhaps superficially resembles that of a grating interferometer, the underpinning physical mechanism is different. GI is an intrinsically coherent method, in which an incoherent source can be used only provided it is made sufficiently coherent through collimation via the source grating. In contrast, EI is an incoherent technique, and was in fact proven to work with both spatially and temporally incoherent sources, without any additional source aperturing or collimation. Quantitative phase retrieval was also demonstrated with (uncollimated) incoherent sources, showing {{that in some cases}} results analogous to the synchrotron gold standard can be obtained. The highly simplified set-up, which however does not lead to reduced phase sensitivity, results in a number of advantages, which include reduced exposure time for the same source power, reduced radiation dose, robustness against environmental vibrations, and easier access to high X-ray energy. Moreover, since their aspect ratio is not particularly demanding, masks are cheap, easy to fabricate (e.g.do not require X-ray lithography) and can already be scaled to large areas. The method is easily extended to phase sensitivity in two directions, for example, through the realization of L-shaped apertures for the simultaneous illumination of two orthogonal edges in each detector pixel. More generally, while in its simplest implementation beamlets match individual pixel rows (or pixels), the method is highly flexible, and, for example, sparse detectors and asymmetric masks can be used. So far, the method has been successfully demonstrated in areas such as security scanning, <b>biological</b> <b>imaging,</b> material science, paleontology and others; adaptation to 3D (computed tomography) was also demonstrated. Alongside simple translation for use with conventional x-ray sources, there are substantial benefits in the implementation of EI with coherent synchrotron radiation, among which high performance at very high X-ray energies and angular resolutions higher than in other approaches.|$|E
