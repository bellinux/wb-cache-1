5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1520 to around 1560, {{encompassing}} Garamond's career, {{was an extremely}} <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> for typeface creation. Many fonts were cut, some such as Robert Estienne’s for a single printer’s exclusive use, others sold or traded between them. Confusion about which engravers created which typefaces is natural since many were active over this time, creating typefaces {{not just in the}} Latin alphabet in roman and italic, but also in Greek and Hebrew for scholarly use. These included Garamond himself, Granjon, Guillaume Le Bé, particularly respected for his Hebrew fonts, Pierre Hautin, Antoine Augereau (who may have been Garamond's mentor), Estienne's stepfather Simon de Colines and others. This period saw the creation of a pool of high-quality punches and matrices that would supply the French and European printing industry, to a large extent, for the next two centuries.|$|E

Schneider's breakthrough came with her portrayal of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, in the romantic biopic Sissi (1955) and its two sequels, Sissi – The Young Empress (1956) and Sissi – Fateful Years of an Empress (1957), all with Karlheinz Böhm, who became a close friend.

500|$|In 1948 Mitford {{completed}} a new novel, {{a sequel to}} The Pursuit of Love she called Love in a Cold Climate, with the same country house ambience as the earlier book {{and many of the}} same characters. The novel's reception was even warmer than that of its predecessor; Waugh {{was one of the few}} critics to qualify his praise—he thought the descriptions were good but the conversations poor. In 1950 she translated and adapted André Roussin's play La petite hutte ("The Little Hut"), in preparation for its successful West End début in August, The Timess critic noted the [...] "habit of speech at once colloquial and unexpected which instantly declares itself the creation of Miss Mitford." [...] The play ran for 1,261 performances, and provided Mitford with a steady £300 per month in royalties. The same year The Sunday Times asked her to contribute a regular column, which she did for four years. This <b>busy</b> <b>period</b> in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel, The Blessing, another semi-autobiographical romance this time set in Paris, in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis. Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel, [...] "permeated with her joyous love of France". This time Waugh (to whom the book was dedicated) had no criticism; he found the book [...] "admirable, deliciously funny, consistent and complete, by far the best of your writings".|$|E

40|$|Fixed-priority {{scheduling}} is {{the most}} common scheduling algorithm used in industry practice. Imposing fixed task release offsets is an effective technique for improving schedulability by avoiding the critical instant when all tasks are released simultaneously. In this paper, we address the problem of schedulability analysis and priority assignment for a periodic taskset with fixed-priority preemptive scheduling, where tasks have fixed offset relationships relative to each other. For schedulability analysis, we present an efficient algorithm for computing busy/idle periods, and obtaining response times of all instances of a task τi in the feasibility interval once the priority-level-pi <b>busy</b> <b>periods</b> are determined. For priority assignment, we adopt Audsley’s Optimal Priority Assignment (OPA) algorithm, and present an efficient algorithm for incremental construction of priority-level-(k− 1) <b>busy</b> <b>periods</b> by removing all instances of the task with priority k from the priority-level-k <b>busy</b> <b>periods.</b> Performance evaluation shows that our algorithms can result in significant performance improvements compared to existing techniques. 1...|$|R
