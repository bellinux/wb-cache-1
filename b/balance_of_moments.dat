40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation into the}} effect of reinforcement exposure during the patch repair process on the ultimate strength of continuous beams. The parameters investigated were the position of breakout within the member and the areas of flexural reinforcement at the intermediate support and within the span. Reinforcement layouts were designed to vary both the moment redistribution demand for the full plastic collapse load to be attained and the redistribution capacity at the location where the first hinge would form. Exposure of reinforcement and the consequent loss of bond has two major effects. Firstly, it reduces beam stiffness at the exposed location, and shifts the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> away from the location at which bars are exposed {{to other parts of}} the beam, Secondly, loss of composite interaction alters the pattern of flexural strains at the exposed section, increasing the strain at the extreme compression fibre and reducing section ductility.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{design of}} a tilting weir is presented, which allows for periodic exchange of potadromous fish between freshwater ecosystems. The application domain includes inland waters {{that need to be}} isolated hydraulically, preserving the existing ecological connection with the surrounding areas as much as possible. In the absence of a hydraulic gradient, the weir is opened in its neutral position and fish can bypass through passages sideways of the weir. When a hydraulic gradient develops in either of two directions, the weir rotates until a new <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> of force is reached, while fish can still bypass. Above a threshold value of the hydraulic gradient, the weir falls shut. When the hydraulic gradient returns to zero, the weir reopens, restoring the ecological connection. Four variants of the weir were investigated in the Hydraulics Laboratory at Wageningen University. The versatility of the design is demonstrated by showing that the hydraulic gradients required for closure and reopening can be manipulated largely independently. Patterns of flow velocity and turbulence kinetic energy were analyzed, which suggest that relevant fish species can bypass the weir unimpeded. The effectiveness of the weir will mainly depend on hydrostatic aspects, which determine when the weir is opened and closed, and on the absence of large hydraulic gradients in the migration season...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} the re-entrainment phenomenon encountered with an electrostatic agglomerator having a fibrous collecting electrode and treating submicron particles. The idea is to propose a process to control the particle number emitted by automotive diesel engines. Rather than trying to directly measure agglomerates of diesel particles exiting the agglomerator, we propose working with a synthetic submicron aerosol dispersed in ambient filtered air as a representative exhaust gas. The study will contribute to build a numerical modeling of the behavior of particles in such a process. The particular point that will be treated here is the collected particle re-entrainment as micron-sized agglomerates. We propose a joint experimentation/modeling approach to approximate the re-entrained aerosol size distribution in controlled conditions. From the modeling point of view, a local approach which uses the method of the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> on agglomerates provides the re-entrained particle size in the agglomerator, according to the filtration conditions. The experimental approach confirms the clearly micron-sized character of the re-entrained agglomerates. This is unambiguously shown by measuring a greater micron particle numerical concentration downstream from the agglomerator than upstream. We show that the fluorescein submicron particles use can greatly simplify the characterization of an electrostatic agglomerator by allowing the use of a commercial laser granulometer to measure the size and the number of the generated agglomerates.

40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{welding process}} {{developed}} at The Welding Institute (TWI) in England. The method uses very large strain plastic deformation {{of the material}} to join two pieces of metal together. The material is deformed using a tool which is forced between the two pieces which rotates causing a bond. Beyond this, very little is actually known although many people {{working in the field}} are willing to speculate on the detailed mechanisms involved. Some measurements made using sacrificial thermocouples at the weld joint indicate that the maximum temperature during the weld process is on the order of 370 C - well below the melting temperature of the material. However, at this temperature, the material properties are highly temperature dependent, and the yield stress is approximately an order of magnitude less at this temperature than it is at room temperature. As expected, there are many interpretations of the physical mechanisms occurring during the weld process. Although there is very little published concerned with FSW, some of the anecdotal theories will be described. One describes the primary mechanism as frictional heating {{at the front of the}} tool caused by slip between the tool and the material. At elevated temperatures, the weld material becomes soft and deforms around the tool but not essentially altered by the tool rotation, similar to an extrusion. As the material meets again at the rear of the tool, the temperatures and pressures are sufficient to cause the material to bond. All other structures seen are secondary and unimportant. Another theory examined last summer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was that there was no slip between the tool and the material resulting in a rotating mass of plastic weld material traveling at a variety of angular velocities - the greatest at the tool surface diminishing to zero at the outer edge of the plastic mass surrounding the tool. This conceptual model was followed by simplified calculations which showed that the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>moments</b> through the weld plug was not possible under steady state conditions and realistic temperature profiles. This led to some consideration of a quasi-steady oscillating process. Later when force measurements became available some models were modified and new ones were proposed...|$|E

All involve single handed lifting tasks where {{the height of the}} lifted object, the {{distance}} of the lifted object from the body, and the angle of the lift relative to the body were varied.

Second, attempt to empirically model the activations of the shared muscles. Third, to understand the relationship between the active and antagonistic contraction. Finally, to establish a biomechanical model to estimate the compressive forces on the cervical spine. ^ Ten subjects participated in the study and performed lifting of five different weights from twenty different locations. Those locations were a combination two heights, two reach distances, and five different angles. EMGs activities of three selected muscles of the shared musculature between the neck and shoulder were the dependent measures. The independent variables were height, distributing angles, weights, gender, and reach distance. The muscles chosen were the Upper Trapezius, Stemocleidomas and Levator Scapula. ^ Results showed that muscles on both the left and right side of the neck were very active during these right hand lifts. The antagonistic contractions in all the muscles studied were found {{to be related to the}} contractions happening in the active counterpart of the muscle. Results also showed that the activation pattern in all active muscles is predictable based on hand loads, arm posture, and anthropometric measurements. In addition, it was found that work height, reach distance, gender, and distributing angles are all significant factors in stimulating activation in the shared muscles. Finally, it was found that the co-contraction is accurately predicted by the active contraction for the same muscles in the left and the right side respectively. ^ Examination the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>moment</b> produced during lifting tasks at the C 4 /C 5 disc was conducted and it was found that the active shared muscles and their co-contracting counterparts are the main contracting muscles.
