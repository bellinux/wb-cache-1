Alonso stayed in Merseyside to be at her side while she gave birth, later saying, [...] "It was a little frustrating to miss the match against Inter but I have to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> family at times like these." [...] His decision to place his family ahead of a Champions League tie caused much friction with former manager Rafael Benítez. On 30 March 2010, they had their second child, a girl named Ane Alonso Aranburu. Their third child and second daughter, Emma Alonso Aranburu, was born on 2 December 2013.|$|E
500|$|Steiger remarked of the film: [...] "I {{think my}} best {{work is in}} The Pawnbroker. The last scene, where I find the boy dead on the street. I think that's the highest moment, {{whatever}} it may <b>be,</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> talent." [...] He drew upon inspiration for this climactic scene, in which he appears to show his frustration through a silent scream, from Picasso's [...] "Guernica", which depicts war-ravaged villagers. Cecil Wilson of the Daily Mail wrote that Steiger's character [...] "seems to encompass all the agony ever inflicted on man". Although the film attracted controversy and was accused of anti-Semitism, Steiger was widely acclaimed for his performance, which garnered him the prize for Best Actor at the Berlin International Film Festival and his second Best Actor nomination at the Oscars. Steiger was so certain that he had produced an Oscar-winning performance that he was shocked when he lost to Lee Marvin.|$|E

500|$|Paul Brown, {{the coach}} of the Cleveland Browns in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), met Humble while vacationing in Florida in 1946. Brown came to watch the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day, and was staying in the same hotel as the Rice team. He saw Humble and his wife Lorraine, whom Humble had met while in {{training}} at Southwestern, on a dance floor at the hotel. [...] "He appeared to be the sort of fellow we like to have on our team," [...] Brown said later in 1947. [...] "Then I watched him in that Tennessee game and after that made up my mind he'd <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> club if I ever had the chance to make a deal for him." [...] The AAFC's Baltimore Colts selected Humble in the league's draft, but Brown got his chance in August. He engineered a trade that sent four players including quarterback Steve Nemeth and guard George Cheroke to the Colts, plus two players to be named later.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> friends. Out of everything in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{these early}} events caused Emin {{to be well}} known in art circles, she was largely unknown by the public until she {{appeared}} on a Channel 4 television programme in 1997. The show comprised a group discussion about that year's Turner Prize and was broadcast live. Emin said she was drunk, slurred and swore before walking out. From the interview: [...] "Are they really real people in England watching this programme now, they really watching, really watching it?... They're 25 minutes behind us, think about that... I'm leaving now, I wanna <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> friends, I wanna <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mum. I'm gonna phone her, and she's going to be embarrassed about this conversation, this is live and I don't care. I don't give a fuck about it." ...|$|E

She moved back, full-time, {{at the end of}} October 2012, after almost two decades living in France and London, with her partner, Vincent Mancini and their son. Arena says, [...] "It was time. I've been away 20-odd years, worked internationally and done some great things, [...] I just felt it was time to come home". What Arena wants more than anything right now, is time with her family, including her parents, Giuseppe and Franca, and sisters Nancy and Silvana.

2500|$|Thérèse adhered {{strictly}} {{to the rule}} which forbade all superfluous talk during work. She saw her sisters together only in the hours of common recreation after meals. At such times she would sit down beside whomever she happened to be near, or beside a nun whom she had observed to be downcast, disregarding the tacit and sometimes expressed sensitivity and even jealousy of her biological sisters. [...] "We must apologize to the others for our being four under one roof", {{she was in the}} habit of remarking. [...] "When I am dead, you must be very careful not to lead a family life with one another...I did not come to Carmel to <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> sisters; on the contrary, I saw clearly that their presence would cost me dear, for I was determined not to give way to nature." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{organized}} letter-writing campaign, dubbed COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of Peaks), {{attempted to}} save the show from cancellation. The campaign was successful, as ABC agreed to air the remaining six episodes to finish the season. But due to the Gulf War, Twin Peaks was moved from its usual time slot [...] "for six weeks out of eight" [...] in early 1991, according to Frost, preventing the show from maintaining audience interest. In the final episodes, Agent Cooper was given a love interest, Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), to replace the writers' intended romance between him and Audrey Horne. According to Frost, Lara Flynn Boyle, who was romantically involved with Kyle MacLachlan at the time, had effectively vetoed the Audrey-Cooper relationship, forcing the writers {{to come up with}} an alternative. Sherilyn Fenn corroborated this claim in a 2014 interview, stating, [...] " [...] was mad that my character was getting more attention, so then Kyle started saying that his character shouldn’t <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> character because it doesn’t look good, ’cause I’m too young... I was not happy about it. It was stupid." [...] The series finale did not sufficiently boost interest, despite ending on a deliberate audience-baiting cliffhanger, and the show was not renewed for a third season, leaving the cliffhanger unresolved.|$|E
