5|$|However, {{the pelvis}} {{is not always}} present, so {{forensic}} anthropologists must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> other areas on the skeleton that have distinct characteristics between sexes. The skull also contains multiple markers {{that can be used}} to determine sex. Specific markers on the skull include the temporal line, the eye sockets, the supraorbital ridge, as well as the nuchal lines, and the mastoid process. In general, male skulls tend to be larger and thicker than female skulls, and to have more pronounced ridges.|$|E

5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their sin and have a desire to have faith.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the main}} tools {{forensic}} anthropologists use {{in the identification of}} remains is their knowledge of osteology and the various differences that occur within the human skeleton. During the course of an investigation, anthropologists are often tasked with helping to determinate an individual's sex, stature, age, and ancestry. To do this, anthropologists must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how the human skeleton can differ between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Partner {{communication}} {{is essential in}} a good defense. When one partner is under attack, the other partner should <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> which pieces hurt most. Sitting strategies might be necessary, and it is therefore important to play the defense fast. Accepting a sacrifice can be lethal. On the other hand, it results in the attacker having a piece less to play with, with the defender's partner having a piece more. Sacrifices therefore give the partner of the defender {{an opportunity to take}} initiative.|$|E

5|$|The boiling frog is {{a parable}} {{describing}} a frog being slowly boiled alive. The {{premise is that}} if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used {{as a metaphor for the}} inability or unwillingness of people to react to or <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> threats that arise gradually.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

5|$|Electric vehicle {{warning sounds}} are {{a series of}} sounds {{designed}} to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and all-electric vehicles (EVs) travelling at low speeds. Warning sound devices were deemed necessary by some government regulators because vehicles operating in all-electric mode produce less noise than traditional combustion engine vehicles and can {{make it more difficult for}} pedestrians, the blind, cyclists, and others, to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their presence. Warning sounds may be driver triggered (as in a horn but less urgent) or automatic at low speeds; in type, they vary from clearly artificial (beeps, chimes) to those that mimic engine sounds and those of tires moving over gravel.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that {{can be drawn from}} the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after midnight}} on 3 January, 200 police {{officers}} from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night {{the residents of the}} houses on the block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the evacuation.|$|E

5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, should <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially {{in the early stages}} of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the PPCLI {{replaced}} the 3rd Battalion in April as CANBAT 1. The {{commander of the}} 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Calvin, instructed his troops to approach their tasks differently than the 3rd Battalion had. Calvin (unlike his predecessor) {{did not want the}} RSK forces or the HV to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> CANBAT 1 operations, ordering the battalion to observe radio silence. According to Canadian journalist Carol Off, Calvin was eager to fight and instructed his troops to return fire if necessary. The situation in Sector West deteriorated when Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. A major contribution to the deterioration was Shabshough's minimal involvement with local authorities, in contrast to Zabala's cooperative approach.|$|E

5|$|The horses' senses {{are based}} on their status as prey animals, where they must <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> their {{surroundings}} at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned {{on the sides of}} their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.|$|E
5|$|The setting then changes; Doggett {{arrives at}} Reyes' new {{apartment}} with a housewarming gift. Neither seems to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the previous events.

Reyes tells Skinner that Doggett is in her apartment, but then finds that he has vanished. The FBI matches the bullet surgically removed from Doggett with Reyes' gun and she is questioned by Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes), but she insists that Doggett was with her {{at the time of the}} shooting. Meanwhile, Lukesh watches the interrogation and identifies Reyes as the shooter.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> possible radioactive substances.|$|E
