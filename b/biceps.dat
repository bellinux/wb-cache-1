5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left <b>biceps</b> brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand to stimulate the <b>biceps</b> brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' <b>biceps</b> muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2014 season, Hamels {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} ready to pitch on Opening Day because of tendonitis in his <b>biceps.</b> On April 6 Hamels pitched in a Minor League Class A-Advanced game, striking out four while allowing two earned runs on three hits in four innings. He made his first start of the season on April 23.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2008, Rutgers {{attempted}} to convert Westerman to defensive tackle, {{so he could}} replace the departed Eric Foster. However, Westerman ended up playing defensive end during the season. Against Morgan State, Westerman blocked a punt and recovered the loose ball. Westerman suffered a torn <b>biceps</b> against Louisville {{and was forced to}} sit {{out the rest of the}} season which included a bowl game. Despite his injury, he led Rutgers with six sacks on the season.|$|E
5|$|Favre {{failed to}} finish a game due to injury on only eight {{occasions}} since {{taking control of the}} Packers as quarterback. Significant injuries suffered by Favre during the streak includes a first-degree shoulder separation, deep thigh bruise, severely bruised left hip, severely sprained left ankle, wind knocked out coupled with coughing up blood, sprained right thumb, right elbow tendinitis, left mid-foot sprain, sprained lateral collateral ligament of the left knee, broken left thumb, softball-sized bruise of the left hamstring, mild concussion, sprained right hand, injured ulnar nerve of the right elbow, bone spurs on the left ankle, torn right <b>biceps,</b> pulled groin, stress fracture of the left ankle coupled with an avulsion fracture of calcaneus, and a sprained sternoclavicular joint of the right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|Fernández {{began the}} 2015 {{season on the}} 15-day {{disabled}} list but was later moved to the 60-day disabled list to continue recovery from Tommy John surgery. It was announced by the Marlins on June 15 {{that he would make}} his season debut on July 2. In his debut, Fernández recorded six strikeouts in six innings. He also hit a home run. Fernández returned to the disabled list in August with a <b>biceps</b> strain in his pitching arm. He returned to the mound in September and set a major league record for consecutive wins at home by a single pitcher with his seventeenth such win on the 25th of that month.|$|E
5|$|Injury {{troubles}} {{continued the}} following season, in 2000–01, as Cloutier was sidelined for nine games {{early in the}} season after straining his <b>biceps</b> on October 22, 2000. After recovering, he recorded his first NHL shutout, making 26 saves, in a 3–0 win against the Detroit Red Wings on December 2, 2000. He achieved the feat in his 95th career game in the NHL. During that month, head coach Steve Ludzik began playing backup Kevin Weekes in favour of Cloutier. By the trade deadline, Cloutier was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks on February 7, 2001, in exchange for defenceman Adrian Aucoin and a second-round selection in the 2001 draft.|$|E
5|$|A {{surge in}} {{offensive}} production from Giordano and fellow defencemen T. J. Brodie and Dennis Wideman {{resulted in the}} Flames {{being one of the}} NHL's biggest surprises early in the 2014–15 season. Predicted to finish {{near the bottom of the}} standings before the season, the Flames instead began December with one of the best records in the league, in large part due to the play of Giordano, who led all NHL defencemen with 25 points, four better than Brodie. His plus-minus of +14 ranked him second in the league. The NHL recognized Giordano's early season play by naming him its First Star of the month of November. He was subsequently named as the Flames' representative at the 60th National Hockey League All-Star Game. Giordano played his 500th career game on February 2, 2015, in a victory over the Winnipeg Jets. He set a personal best by scoring his 48th point of the season in a 3–1 win over the New Jersey Devils on February 25, but also suffered an injury in the game. The Flames announced one week later that he required surgery for a completely torn <b>biceps</b> tendon; the estimated recovery time of four to five months meant that his season was over.|$|E
5|$|For the 2008–09 season, the Devils signed Brian Rolston and Bobby Holik, both {{making their}} second stints with the team. The Devils {{were forced to}} play without Brodeur for over three months after he tore a <b>biceps</b> tendon in November, but strong play by backup goalie Scott Clemmensen kept the Devils atop the Atlantic Division. After his return, Brodeur broke Patrick Roy's record for regular season wins on March 17, 2009, with his 552nd victory, while Patrik Elias became the franchise's all-time leading scorer with his 702nd point. The season {{also served as a}} {{break-out}} year for 24-year-old Zach Parise, who led the team with an impressive 45 goals and 94 points. In the opening round of the 2009 playoffs, the Devils were eliminated in a Game 7 loss in which the Hurricanes scored two goals in the last minute and twenty seconds to erase a 3–2 Devils lead.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde Spears sitting and {{laughing}} in a bar with two female friends, but stops {{to look at a}} brunette Spears calling out to her on a small stage in front of them, wearing a leather vest, a studded belt, panties and fishnet stockings while sporting a tattoo on her <b>biceps.</b> She dances erotically around a pole and up against a mirror. Throughout the video, she continues to dance and flip her hair while special effects lights flash around her as the camera moves slightly in and out of focus to the beat of the song. The video's light systems change from black and white with aura-like blue and pink hues to full blown color. Around the middle of the video, she is joined by two alter egos of her female friends, who also dance around the pole. The blonde Spears and her friends, while watching the dancing, later draw their attention to an attractive man sitting with his friends at a table across the bar.|$|E
25|$|The <b>biceps</b> can be {{strengthened}} using weight and resistance training. Examples of well known <b>biceps</b> exercises are the chin-up and <b>biceps</b> curl.|$|E
25|$|Elbow (Humeroulnar joint) – The <b>biceps</b> brachii also {{functions}} {{as an important}} flexor of the forearm, particularly when the forearm is supinated. Functionally, this action is performed when lifting an object, such as a bag of groceries or when performing a <b>biceps</b> curl. When the forearm is in pronation (the palm faces the ground), the brachialis, brachioradialis, and supinator function to flex the forearm, with minimal contribution from the <b>biceps</b> brachii. It {{is also important to}} note that regardless of forearm position, (supinated, pronated, or neutral,) the force exerted by the <b>biceps</b> brachii remains the same; however, the brachioradialis has a much greater change in exertion depending on position than the <b>biceps</b> during concentric contractions. That is, the <b>biceps</b> can only exert so much force, and as forearm position changes, other muscles must compensate.|$|E
25|$|Two muscles lie {{underneath}} the <b>biceps</b> brachii. These are the coracobrachialis muscle, which like the <b>biceps</b> {{attaches to the}} coracoid process of the scapula, and the brachialis muscle which connects to the ulna and along the mid-shaft of the humerus. Besides those, the brachioradialis muscle is adjacent to the <b>biceps</b> and also inserts on the radius bone, though more distally.|$|E
25|$|In {{training}} the <b>biceps</b> brachii, {{it is important}} to distinguish between the long head and the short head of the <b>biceps.</b> The long head is the outer portion of the muscle. The short head is the inner portion of the muscle.|$|E
25|$|Both {{heads of}} the <b>biceps</b> femoris perform knee flexion.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder (Glenohumeral joint) (shoulder) – Several weaker {{functions}} {{occur at}} the glenohumeral, or shoulder, joint. The <b>biceps</b> brachii weakly assists in forward flexion of the shoulder joint (bringing the arm forward and upwards). It may also contribute to abduction (bringing the arm out to the side) when the arm is externally (or laterally) rotated. The short head of the <b>biceps</b> brachii also assists with horizontal adduction (bringing the arm across the body) when the arm is internally (or medially) rotated. Finally, the short head of the <b>biceps</b> brachii, due to its attachment to the scapula (or shoulder blade), assists with stabilization of the shoulder joint when a heavy weight is carried in the arm. The tendon of the long head of the <b>biceps</b> also assists in holding {{the head of the}} humerus in the glenoid cavity.|$|E

25|$|The term, from Latin, for {{the main}} upper arm flexor in the {{singular}} is the <b>biceps</b> muscle (from <b>biceps</b> brachii); however, many English speakers take {{it to be a}} plural and refer to the muscle of only one arm, by back-formation, as a bicep. The correct —although very seldom used— Latin plural is bicipites.|$|E

25|$|It {{was noted}} that Jones {{incurred}} {{a tear in}} his right <b>biceps</b> in round five and fought {{the rest of the}} bout one handed and admitted after the bout the healing time required for his torn right <b>biceps</b> probably meant the end of his long career. In October, Jones stated his intentions to continue fighting on and not retiring from the sport.|$|E
25|$|Modern front-line combat stress {{treatment}} {{techniques are}} designed to mimic the historically used PIE techniques with some modification. <b>BICEPS</b> is the current treatment route employed by the U.S. military and stresses differential treatment by the severity of CSR symptoms present in the service member. <b>BICEPS</b> is employed {{as a means to}} treat CSR symptoms and return soldiers quickly to combat.|$|E
25|$|The <b>biceps</b> {{are usually}} {{attributed}} {{as representative of}} strength within a variety of worldwide cultures.|$|E
25|$|The <b>biceps</b> is {{a muscle}} {{in the upper}} arm with two heads, called the short head and the long head, which {{converge}} into a single mass. It {{is one of the}} three muscles in the anterior compartment of the arm, the others being the brachialis muscle and the coracobrachialis muscle, with which the <b>biceps</b> shares a nerve supply. Both heads of the <b>biceps</b> arise from the scapula in the shoulder, and the muscle attaches to the radius (bone), in the forearm. Specifically, the short head of the <b>biceps</b> originates from the coracoid process {{at the top of the}} scapula. The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle just above the shoulder joint. From here, the long head has a tendon that passes up along the intertubercular groove of the humerus into the joint capsule of the shoulder joint. The tendon of the short head runs adjacent to the tendon of the coracobrachialis and likewise attaches to the coracoid process.|$|E
25|$|There is {{much debate}} over the best <b>biceps</b> {{workouts}} for targeting each of these heads.|$|E
25|$|When {{the knee}} is semi-flexed, the <b>biceps</b> femoris in {{consequence}} of its oblique direction rotates the leg slightly outward.|$|E
25|$|Avulsion of the <b>biceps</b> femoris tendon {{is common}} in sports that require {{explosive}} bending of the knee as seen in sprinting.|$|E

25|$|The muscle {{performing}} {{an action}} is the agonist, while the muscle which contraction brings about an opposite action is the antagonist. For example, {{an extension of}} the lower arm is performed by the triceps as the agonist and the <b>biceps</b> as the antagonist (which contraction will perform flexion over the same joint). Muscles that work together to perform the same action are called synergists. In the above example synergists to the <b>biceps</b> can be the brachioradialis and the brachialis muscle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The <b>biceps</b> femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the <b>biceps</b> which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The <b>biceps</b> flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the <b>biceps,</b> and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation at the knee.|$|E
25|$|A {{contraindication}} {{specifically for}} posterior deltoid to triceps transfer is a flexion contracture of the elbow, <b>biceps</b> to triceps transfer might then be a possible transfer for elbow extension reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|The {{transverse}} humeral ligament, which {{passes from}} the lesser tubercle {{to the greater}} tubercle of humerus, covers the intertubercular groove, in which the long head of <b>biceps</b> brachii travels.|$|E
25|$|The English form , attested from 1939, is a back {{formation}} {{derived from}} interpreting the s of <b>biceps</b> as the English plural marker -s. While common even in professional contexts, {{it is often}} considered incorrect.|$|E
