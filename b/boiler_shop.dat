25|$|The main {{locomotive}} {{works are}} located at Bridgnorth. It is not normally {{open to the}} public but conducted tours and open days are arranged from time to time. Major features of the locomotive works include the <b>boiler</b> <b>shop</b> equipped with overhead crane, Noble and Lund wheel lathe, ex-LT lifting jacks and a Wheeldrop recovered from Leicestershire, installed in 2010. Works to enclose the southern end of Bridgnorth locomotive shed with roller shutter doors, improve natural illumination and waterproof the building more effectively were completed in early 2009. This forms the first of a number of phases to improve the Bridgnorth site both for staff and for visitors.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1850s {{the company began}} to rely less on wood ship or railcar {{building}} for its income. Machine shops, office buildings, wharves, carpenter sheds, <b>boiler</b> <b>shops,</b> blacksmith shops and cranes were added {{in the first five}} years of the decade. As the firm's reputation grew, more orders for steamboats came in from across the country. Charles Morgan, a New York shipping magnate, purchased his first ship from Harlan in 1856. Morgan would eventually become one of the largest customers for Harlan & Hollingsworth, ordering over 31 vessels by 1878.|$|R

The present state of the art of vibration control of pneumatic hammers as it is practiced abroad, and the solutions adopted for this purpose, are discussed. A new type of pneumatic hammer with a low noise and vibration level is presented...|$|R
50|$|Boilers were covered, or lagged, {{to reduce}} heat loss, and {{increase}} efficiency. Wood slats were used originally. After 1900, asbestos was a favored lagging material. It was common for the slabs of the mineral {{to be machined}} to fit. This produced large clouds of asbestos dust that is now {{known to be a}} major carcinogen, a significant cause of lung cancer. The use of dust masks, hearing protection, and safety glasses was unknown at the time. The <b>boiler</b> <b>shops</b> were a haze of asbestos dust.|$|R

2500|$|The Dry Dock Engine Works began {{manufacturing}} engines on Atwater Street in 1867; {{however, the}} earliest buildings {{used by the}} company were replaced by later buildings, built between 1892 and 1919. [...] These early structures were located throughout the city block owned by the company, and included a sheet metal works, <b>boiler</b> <b>shop,</b> forge, machine shop, and the Dry Dock Hotel. The Detroit Dry Dock Company began shipbuilding {{in the same area}} as early as 1852. [...] Their earlier dry docks, including Dry Dock No. 1, no longer exist. A complex of six buildings, as well as Dry Dock No. 2, do remain.|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1892, Detroit Dry Dock built {{a machine}} {{shop at the}} corner of Atwater and Orleans, running {{parallel}} to Orleans. [...] The shop replaced a portion of the earlier machine shop which fronted on Atwater. [...] The building was designed and built by Berlin Iron Bridge Company, a firm from Connecticut now part of the American Bridge Company. [...] The building featured a load-bearing steel frame and non-load-bearing brick curtain walls, at the time a novel construction technique. [...] Also in 1892, Berlin Iron Bridge also built a <b>boiler</b> <b>shop</b> of the same construction across Dequindre from the main complex; this building has since been demolished.|$|E

5000|$|Surviving {{industrial}} buildings include {{parts of}} the old factory wall along Woolwich Church Street and remnants of the Steam Factory with its prominent chimney nearby. The original factory building of 1838 still stands {{on the south side}} of Ruston Road, although only at around two-thirds of its original length of 444 ft. When built, it housed a complex of <b>boiler</b> <b>shops,</b> a foundry, fitting shops and erecting shops for the manufacture and assembly of marine steam engines. Additions were made over the next ten years, culminating in the smithery which stands parallel with the original block, to the south; dating from 1847, this originally contained 48 hearths and 5 Nasmyth steam hammers. Coppersmiths and brass founders were accommodated in a smaller block just to the west (which is still to be seen, immediately north of the old police house at the West Gate). The building which faces the police house across the gateway was built in 1848-9 to serve as the Woolwich Dockyard School for Apprentices: one of a number of such schools set up at the Royal Dockyards under an Admiralty Scheme of 1843, Woolwich specialised in steam engineering, and for a time factory apprentices from all the royal dockyards were educated at the school.|$|R

50|$|The large main {{entrance}} doorways are generally round arch openings symmetrically placed in gable ends and often flanking a smaller central window. Long side window and door openings are generally of the segmental arch headed type with multi-pane windows in carefully detailed cast iron frames, astragals, and pivoting sections. Door and window dressings are {{a combination of}} Helidon freestone, brickwork, or cement render usually with restrained use of coloured brick or stone voussoirs and keystones, raking arches and label moulds.In {{the early years of}} the twentieth century, well designed and finely detailed industrial brick structures such as the Power House, Erecting and <b>Boiler</b> <b>Shops</b> were constructed, completing the intended lateral expansion along the northern and southern sides of the Traverser. These buildings continued the style of the 1880s buildings, some with affinities to Romanesque detail. The final result, when viewed along the strong central axis of the Traverser, is a streetscape of robust brick industrial buildings. Each facade exhibits subtle variations on a simple architectural theme, and although the roof lines vary from simple pitched roofs to extensive saw tooth profiles, there is a great subtlety of scale and material texture which is aesthetically pleasing and impressive.The influence of quality engineering practice, upon the designs for the North Ipswich Railway Workshops is clearly evident in the drawings and specifications produced at this time.|$|R

The buildings were generally of steel frame construction and sheeted in corrugated iron, with gabled roofs. Some had earth floors while others were floored in timber or concrete. With the construction of these buildings, the workshops were all but complete. In 1918, work {{was transferred to the}} new workshops.
