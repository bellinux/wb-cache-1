40|$|SUMMARY A {{study has}} been made of the {{coalescence}} of secondary dispersions in a fibrous bed. The literature pertaining to the formation, hydrodynamic behaviour and methods of separation of droplets less than one hundred micrometres in diameter has been reviewed with particular reference to fibrous bed coalescers. The main operating parameters were identified as inlet drop size distribution, phase ratio, superficial velocity and the thickness and voidage of the bed. A recirculatory rig with interchangeable fibrous <b>bed</b> <b>pads</b> was designed and operated with toluene-water dispersions generated by a combination of centrifugal pumps. Inlet drop sizes were analysed using a Coulter Counter and outlet drops were sized photographically. A novel technique, involving conductivity measur ements at different planes in the bed, was developed to measure hold up distribution. Single phase flow and two phase flow pressure drops were correlated by a Blake-Kozeny type equation. Exit drop size was independent of inlet drop size distribution and phase ratio but a function of superficialvelocity and packing thickness. Average bed hold up was independent of inlet drop size distribution and phase ratio, but decreased with increase in superficial velocity. Hold up was not evenly distributed in the bed, the highest value occurred at the inlet followed by a sharp - 2 drop at approximately 1. 2 x 10 m. Hold up remained constant {{throughout the rest of the}} bed until the exit plane, where it increased. From the results, a mechanism is postulated involving: (a) Capture of the inlet drops followed by interdrop coalescence until an equilibrium value is reached. (b) Equilibrium size droplets flowing as rivulets through the intermediate portion of the bed, and (c) Each rivulet forms droplets at the exit face, which detach by a 'drip point' mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) {{are designed}} {{in order to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails {{to the ground and}} are installed as the crosstie beam support in railway track systems. They are subjected to impact loading conditions that are resulted from train operations over wheel or rail abnormalities, such as flat wheels, dipped rails, crossing transfers, rail squats, corrugation, etc. The magnitude of the shock load relies on various factors such as axle load, types of wheel/rail imperfections, speeds of vehicle, track stiffness, etc. This paper demonstrates the development of finite element modelling to evaluate the dynamic responses of prestressed tendons or wires embedded in concrete sleepers, particularly under a variety of impact loads. The force prediction under high speed rail environment was conducted using D-TRACK. The 3 D finite element model of prestressed concrete sleeper has been developed using a finite element package, LS-Dyna. It has been verified by the experiments carried out using the high capacity drop-weight impact machine at the University of Wollon-gong, Australia. The experimental results provide very good correlation with numerical simulations. In this paper, the numerical studies are extended to evaluate the dynamic behaviors of high strength steel wires and their responses under different parameters in high speed rail environments. The outcome of this study can potentially lead to the dynamic design guideline for prestressed concrete sleepers under low-cycle fatigues.

50|$|The Simmons Manufacturing Company {{was known}} from its {{inception}} for woven wire mattress springs, cradles, metal beds and wooden folding chairs. In 1916 Zalmon II looked to expand the company nationally. The Simmons Company purchased the Rudger-Merle Company in San Francisco followed by a plant in Los Angeles. In 1918 the company purchased of the largest bedding company in the east, New Jersey’s Newark Spring Mattress Company. This acquisition extended the company's product lines from cradles, metal beds and woven wire bed springs into the <b>padded</b> <b>bedding</b> and mattress industry. Z.G. II’s desire to revolutionize the company would eventually lead to a mass-produced pocketed coil innerspring mattress known as the Beautyrest. The success of this new business venture led to the purchase of Atlanta, Georgia mattress maker Hirsch and Spitz and a Seattle plant in 1919. With the company’s new acquisitions, Simmons Manufacturing Company was officially in the mattress business. Z.G.

30|$|The context agent {{flexibility}} {{relates to}} the ability to determine what has occurred in the environment and adapt the context message to the detected contextual changes. Without the flexibility to choose the correct contextual message, the MAS {{would not be able to}} determine the correct assistance to offer. The interaction methods chosen by the GUI Agent are flexible in that they can be further refined based on the currently selected profile. The profile represents the current older person’s interaction requirements and these can be changed at any time to take into account a change of interaction preference or underlying interaction requirements relating to old age. The assistance offered by the Feedback and Intervention agents are reliant on the underlying flexibility to adapt the assistance centred on what has occurred in the environment based on: the detected changes of context relating to a device, sensor or physical objects change of state such as for example a door being opened or closed; an activity the older person carries out such as being restless in <b>bed</b> (a pressure <b>pad</b> registers movement in the bed), using the WC (the older person enters the WC) or entering a room (the room state is detected to have changed from empty to occupied). During the night only a subset of the available interventions are offered such as for example a reminder to return to bed when the older person enters the kitchen, as previously discussed it is the flexible characteristics that enable a different intervention to be offered at different times during the day. The majority of actions the older person carries out during the night result in feedback assistance being generated and this assistance is only offered during the day. Without this flexibility both feedback and intervention assistance would be provided during the night and this may result in information overload and be detrimental to a good night’s sleep.|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the major cause of death and {{disability}} in the Western world. The main disease underlying cardiovascular disorders is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease affecting numerous vascular beds, including the coronary and peripheral circulation i. e. cerebrovascular, aortic and lower limb arterial circulation. The global ageing phenomenon will further increase the burden of cardiovascular disease and also enforce a change in health care towards the elderly population. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common condition. Importantly, only 1 out of 9 patients with PAD are symptomatic while vascular morbidity and mortality {{is estimated to be}} similar in patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic PAD. This poses PAD to be a major health burden. Risk factors for atherosclerotic disease are common and polyvascular disease is highly prevalent in the PAD population. The prognosis of patients with PAD is predominantly determined by the presence and extent of the underlying ischemic heart disease (IHD). The estimated cardiovascular risk in PAD is, moreover, as high as in IHD. 3, 4 Mc Dermott and colleagues reported already in 1997 that PAD patients received less intensive drug treatment compared to IHD patients, irrespective of comparable risk. Additionally, in a large risk factor matched population, patients with IHD received more cardiac medications, compared with PAD patients (beta-blockers 74 % vs. 34 %, aspirin 88 % vs. 40 %, nitrates 37 % vs. 19 %, statins 67 % vs. 29 % and ACE-inhibitors 57 % vs. 31 %, respectively). The observed poor medical control of PAD patients may be an explanation for the worse outcome of PAD patients compared with IHD patients as observed by the study of Welten et al. The REACH registry showed that cardiovascular events increased in a stepwise fashion with the number of symptomatic vascular beds. 4 The combined 1 -year outcome of atherothrombotic events ranged from 17 % in patients with PAD as a single affected vascular bed to 26 % in patients with 3 diseased vascular <b>beds.</b> Patients with <b>PAD</b> undergoing vascular surgery are known to be at higher risk for both early and late cardiovascular events compared to patients with IHD. 3, 7 Hertzer’s landmark study in 1000 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for PAD who underwent preoperative cardiac catheterizations reported that only 8 % had normal coronary arteries, and approximately one third had severe-correctable or severe-inoperable IHD...|$|R
40|$|Children with {{cerebral}} palsy and powerful whole body extensor spasms find sitting in a rigid seat uncomfortable and sometimes painful due to the large forces they apply to their constraints. They are usually unable to speak and communication is difficult. The spasms affect every aspect of their lives. This thesis describes the genesis of a new functional dynamic seat for children with severe whole body extensor spasms, and the novel method used to design it. This novel seat technology is known as ‘Whole Body Dynamic Seating’. The thesis describes the clinical need this seat addresses, and the design and technology context in which this research takes place. The user evaluation, observation, measurement, analysis and reasoning {{that led to a}} successful seat design are described in detail. Children with {{cerebral palsy}} sometimes have whole body spasms that mean they cannot be seated in conventional static seating that positions a child in a fixed posture. For this research the children were classified as functioning at Chailey Sitting Ability Level 1 and Gross Motor Functional Classification System Level V. Such children spend much of their time being held by a person, or lying on a mat, <b>bed</b> or <b>pad.</b> This results in difficulty with social engagement and physical functioning, particularly in school. This research created a seat that such children could sit in, providing a comfortable and functional seat for use in a home or school classroom environment. This seat was designed with the direct and essential involvement of disabled children, their parents, therapists, teachers and carers. The work {{is part of a larger}} programme of research into seating and support technology that will enhance a child’s ability to gain functional movement and communication skills that can be employed to enable the child’s free self expression and social participation. The research investigated means of supporting children with whole body extensor spasms through a progressive iterative method utilizing direct user evaluation of a series of prototypes incrementing in complexity and fidelity towards a fully functional physical seat. An iterative method was used to design, build and evaluate three dynamic seats. This method incorporated two new approaches to prototyping developed for the research programme in response to difficulties encountered in designing dynamic systems for children with highly complex neuromotor disability. Soft and Semi-soft prototyping and evaluation methods provided essential feedback on dynamic seating concepts that guided proposed solutions, without requiring costly and time-consuming manufacture. Video was used to create a record of the children’s movements and responses for subsequent analysis. Instrumentation was built into the seats to enable direct objective measurement of the reaction forces and seat movement caused by extensor spasms. This thesis presents several unique features created through this research programme: 1. Independent and virtually hinged anatomical dynamic thigh supports; 2. Independent anatomical dynamic foot supports; 3. A virtually hinged dynamic back support; 4. An anatomical dynamic head support concept. The final Whole Body Dynamic Seat was child-centred in its functionality and aesthetic design, and was favourably commented upon by parents, children and school staff. Use of the new dynamic seating by three children (including one from a previous work programme) showed that children with severe whole body extensor spasms can be seated comfortably. The children also demonstrated gains in physical and social function as a result of using the dynamic seats. The two fully independent dynamic seats made advances in comfort over static seating for children with whole body extensor spasms. One of the children especially liked the seat and resisted being put back into his usual seating. An adult with severe cerebral palsy and extensor spasms evaluated a dynamic foot support concept and reported very significant reductions in spasticity and pain, and gains in physical function. The Whole Body Dynamic Seats showed gains in postural symmetry and in hand and head function over the usual static seats when used by the children with spasms. These gains were reported by staff during long term evaluations and measured specifically during the final evaluation. Two children learned to control the movement of seats in which they were sat, and were able to control their posture and use that control to carry out functions such as switch pressing. Such learning through the use of dynamic seating by children with severe dystonic cerebral palsy and whole body extensor spasms has not previously been documented. The seats did not just affect the children - school staff were affected too. School staff working around the children in the dynamic seats were observed to be more inclusive towards the children, and to expect more interaction from them. The ability of the children to move altered staff expectations of their ability to participate and communicate. This new seating has improved the quality of life of the children that use it. Future implementation of this technology in commercially produced seating offers the possibility of similar gains to many more severely disabled children who are currently less comfortable and less functional than they need to be...|$|R
40|$|In Cambodia, {{sun drying}} of rice {{has always been}} of great {{importance}} for preserving rice. The main goal {{of this study was}} to find the conditions for sun drying that maximise the throughput while minimising quality loss. A whole-bed approach was taken to investigate the conditions of the grain and the air at different layers during the drying process. Seven sets of sun-drying experiments were conducted in Cambodia using a range of methods practiced by rice farmers. These methods included drying with different bed depths (2 to 6 cm), with the <b>bed</b> on different <b>pads</b> (water-proof tarpaulin, mat, net, polystyrene or rice husk), and with different bed tempering methods (stirring regularly or shading and/or covering the bed around midday) for four Cambodian rice varieties (Pka Knhey, CAR 11, Masary and IR 66). The grain temperature was found to be more affected by the solar intensity than the temperature of the ambient air. Fastest drying was achieved when the bed was thin, less compacted, stirred regularly but not shaded or covered around midday, dried on a pad which allows some air and moisture movement and with high or strong solar intensity. Only the mechanical impact (MI) and milling tests of the rice quality provided useful results. Higher quality was found for grain that was dried in thin beds, stirred regularly, shaded with or without covering around midday and dried on pads with less air circulation. Among the methods used to determine the glass transition temperature of the grain, only the Differential Scanning Calorimetry method gave meaningful results. The glass transition temperature data were highly variable but generally decreased with increasing moisture content and compared quite well with the published glass transition temperatures for other varieties of rice. To provide additional detail on the local conditions within the bed, to better understand the drying process and the interactions between variables and to predict alternative parameters that might be used to correlate with the head rice yields (HRYs), a mathematical model for heat and moisture transport within the bed was developed. The model covered all the drying methods/conditions studied experimentally. A lumped parameter approach to energy and mass transfer in individual kernels was used in the bed model. The model was validated against experimental data. The predicted drying time, temperatures, moisture contents and water activities (relative humidity of the air within the bed) were found to compare very well with the experimental data except when a polystyrene pad was used. The model proved to be a very good mechanistic tool with advantages of simplicity and practical accuracy in the design and management of the sun drying system. A number of parameters related to postulated grain damage mechanisms were derived from the predicted conditions within the bed during drying. The best predictors of the grain quality were found to be rewetting the kernels when the grain is bulked (especially when the kernels are partly below and partly above critical moisture content) grain temperature and distance from the glass transition temperature line. It was concluded that in order to get the fastest drying conditions rice should be sun dried with thin bed, stirring, not shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with air circulation. For the highest quality grain, that is grain which would have the least breakage during milling, rice should be sun dried with a thin bed, stirring, shaded or covered around midday and dried on a pad with less air circulation. The optimal drying conditions to get the best quality combined with the fastest practical drying rate, the drying conditions should be drying with 2 cm bed depth, stirring the grain bed every hour, shading or covering the bed around midday and using a tarpaulin or net pad placed directly on the ground...|$|R
