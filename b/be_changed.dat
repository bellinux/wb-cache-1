5|$|At {{the tenth}} RA I {{tropical}} cyclone committee held during 1991, it was {{recommended that the}} intensity classifications <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. Specifically {{it was decided that}} the classifications: Weak Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Depression and Severe Tropical Depression would <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> to Tropical Depression, Moderate Tropical Storm and Severe Tropical Storm. This change was implemented ahead of the 1993–94 tropical cyclone season. The United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center also monitors the basin, and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the United States Government. These warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, however, regardless of intensity in this basin the JTWC labels all systems as tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt {{started to}} push for {{improvements}} to U.S. coins, and arranged for the Mint to engage Saint-Gaudens to redesign coins which could <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> under the 1890 act. Before his death in 1907, the sculptor provided designs for the double eagle and eagle, though the double eagle required adjustment by Barber to lower the relief {{before it could be}} released as a circulating coin. Redesign of the smaller gold pieces, Lincoln cent, and Buffalo nickel followed between 1908 and 1913. By then, the dime, quarter, and half dollar were the only coins being struck which had not received a redesign in the 20th century. As the 1916 date approached when the Barber coins could <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> without an act of Congress, calls for a new design increased.|$|E

The other color channels follow a similar pattern. The changed characteristics of color samples are important clues for detecting altered images.|$|R

5|$|Before {{each game}} and single-player Conquest, players choose between Sports and Action camera views.

Enclosed arenas are inaccessible when using Sports view. The camera view cannot <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> once single-player begins, so Conquest mode players in Sports view will not see the arenas they unlock. The Action view camera swings wildly and can be pulled back slightly in the menus.|$|E

In November 2011, reports began that the film's name might <b>be</b> <b>changed</b> again to Muqtasar. At the time Kohli stated only {{that they had not}} yet decided the title of the film. Such speculation was believed to be a marketing choice to increase curiosity for the film.|$|E
5|$|Electoral {{legislation}} remained unchanged. Labor introduced {{bills for}} reform, {{but these were}} defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament. The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to <b>be</b> <b>changed.</b> The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair.|$|E
