40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} a systematic way to construct symplectic schemes for the numerical integration {{of a large}} class of highly oscillatory Hamiltonian systems. The <b>bottom</b> line <b>of</b> our <b>construction</b> is to consider the Hamilton-Jacobi form of the Newton equations of motion, and to perform a two-scale expansion of the solution, for small times and high frequencies. The approximation obtained for the solution is then used as a generating function, from which the numerical scheme is derived. Several options for the derivation are presented, some of them also giving rise to non symplectic variants. The various integrators obtained are tested and compared to several existing algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate their efficiency...|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the flat}} <b>bottom</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the Roman lusoria it was also possible, during an armed {{reconnaissance}} mission for example, to venture into Barbaricum waters. These inflows were often used by the Germanic tribes as an approach route for their surprise attacks on Roman territory. The findings from this kind of [...] "maritime warning system" [...] were certainly highly valued by the Roman commanders. Another protection were the then widely ramified, sometimes almost impenetrable and marshy floodplain of the Upper Rhine {{and the presence of}} numerous meandering tributaries, which also considerably more difficult to approach the border zone.|$|R
2500|$|To {{avoid the}} {{turbulent}} surf zone {{as well as}} to move closer to the cold-water resource, OTEC plants can be mounted to the continental shelf at depths up to [...] A shelf-mounted plant could be towed to the site and affixed to the sea <b>bottom.</b> This type <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> is already used for offshore oil rigs. The complexities of operating an OTEC plant in deeper water may make them more expensive than land-based approaches. Problems include the stress of open-ocean conditions and more difficult product delivery. Addressing strong ocean currents and large waves adds engineering and construction expense. Platforms require extensive pilings to maintain a stable base. Power delivery can require long underwater cables to reach land. For these reasons, shelf-mounted plants are less attractive.|$|R

30|$|Between 2004 and 2007, the {{contraction}} in the gender wage gap could be largely {{attributed to the}} wage growth in the predominantly state-run industries that employ high-skill white-collar workers, {{most of whom are}} women. The expansion of these industries and <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and transport contributed to the change {{in the shape of the}} gender wage gap distribution from upward to downward sloping. This happened because the growth in state sector wages lifted women’s wages at the top of the distribution and the expansion <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> and transport raised men’s wages at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution. The greater increase in the working hours of women at the top and men at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution also played a role in changing the shape of the gender wage gap.|$|R

40|$|Syntactic irregularities, {{which often}} occur in sourcecode {{undergoing}} maintenance, prevent {{the application of}} analysis and comprehension tools that employ traditional parsing techniques. As an alternative to parsing, we have developed an iterative lexical technique {{that is based on}} the repetitive application of regular expressions using a shortest-match strategy. The approach recognizes syntactic elements using iterative refinement, where unambiguous constructs are identified to provide contextual cues for the identification of more ambiguous constructs. The use of a shortest-match strategy supports the <b>bottom</b> up <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a syntax tree by identifying smaller subtrees first. To examine the technique's effectiveness, we present the results of an experiment comparing iterative lexical analysis against parsing. The measures of precision and recall are used to evaluate and compare the two approaches...|$|R
2500|$|In {{its most}} popular form, the dory {{was created in}} New England fishing towns {{sometime}} after the early 18th century. [...] Howard Chapelle writes, [...] "... some kind of dory boat was in use on the Massachusetts coast as early as 1726." [...] A definite precursor to the dory type was the early French bateau type, a flat bottom boat with straight sides used as early as 1671 on the Saint Lawrence River. The common coastal boat of the time was the wherry and the merging of designs between the wherry type and the simplified flat <b>bottom</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> the bateau initiated {{the birth of the}} dory. Other antecdotal evidence exists of much older precursors throughout Europe. [...] England, France, Belgium, and Italy all have small boats from the medieval periods that could reasonably be construed to be predecessors of the Dory.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a holistic framework of questions mo- tivating sustainability research in computing {{in order to}} en- able new opportunities for critique. Analysis of systemat- ically selected corpora of computing publications demon- strates that several of these question areas are well covered, while others are ripe for further exploration. It also pro- vides insight into which of these questions tend to be ad- dressed by different communities within sustainable com- puting. The framework itself reveals discursive similarities between other existing environmental discourses, enabling reflection and participation with the broader sustainability debate. It is argued that the current computing discourse on sustainability is reformist and premised in a Triple <b>Bottom</b> Line <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> sustainability, and a radical, Quadruple Bottom Line alternative is explored as a new vista for com- puting research...|$|R
30|$|The {{increase}} in {{the lower part of}} the distribution can in part be attributed to the expansion <b>of</b> the <b>construction</b> and transport industries, which lifted the proportion of high-skilled blue-collar male workers between 2004 and 2007.12 Indeed, the contribution <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> alone doubled at the 25 th percentile from 0.03 log points to 0.06 log points. In a related development, not visible in the analysis of the gap at the mean, men at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution became more concentrated in urban areas, raising the gap at the 10 th percentile by 0.48 log points, potentially because construction projects took place mostly in urban areas. We note, however, that women’s urban premium was higher than men’s at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution, indicating that women benefited more from working in urban areas than men. Also explaining the {{increase in}} the gap at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution, the high concentration of women in education, health and social services, and culture, and in white-collar occupations, which lowered the gap at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution in 2004, no longer decreased it in a statistically significant way in 2007. This was likely because the growing wages in these industries moved many women into higher percentiles. In contrast, sociodemographic shifts placed downward pressure on the gender wage gap at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution although not strongly enough to outweigh the upward forces. For example, the contribution of marriage to the gender wage gap decreased at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution. This was in part because, as the working age population became younger, there were more single male and female workers. However, the {{increase in the}} proportion of single male wage workers was stronger at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> the distribution. At the top, similar shares of high-income men and women were married, suggesting that for women with the potential to earn high wages marriage may not present a problem for entering the labor market.|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} of the literature specific to Alternative Dispute Resolution {{in the construction industry}} in Scotland offers a snapshot of a discipline whose research base is in its infancy (Agapiou, 2010). It is widely documented that legal advisers generally perform a gate-keeping role, advising clients on the most appropriate form of dispute resolution for particular cases. Is it reasonable to believe that the attitudes <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> lawyers in Scotland creates a real limit on what could be implemented by a government that seeks to promote modern methods of dispute resolution as part of its civil justice reform agenda? Drawn from a questionnaire survey, this paper seeks to add to the dispute-resolution literature by identifying the attitudes <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> lawyers on the use and effectiveness of mediation to resolve construction disputes in Scotland. Despite the small sample used in this study, there is little evidence within the study that the inherent conservatism of lawyers in Scotland in their approach to the conduct of disputes brought to them by clients has militated against the use of mediation: this is contrary to anecdotal evidence in the construction industry. Neither does it seem, that the lack of knowledge of mediation, far less experience of its operation, along with fear of the unknown as opposed to an adversarial process which for all its imperfections lawyers understand unequivocally has prevented the use of Mediation to resolve construction disputes. Interestingly, there would also appear to be some evidence <b>of</b> a modest <b>bottom</b> up growth <b>of</b> <b>construction</b> mediation according to the research findings...|$|R
