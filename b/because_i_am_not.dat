It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> {{sure that it is}} not the best".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly {{and paid}} £250 in {{compensation}} to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it {{to test the}} strength of a Toyota Hilux. In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit [...] "gay". The [...] was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera [...] "And please do not write to us about drinking and driving, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> driving I am sailing" [...] (as they were on top of international, frozen waters). They stated the scene [...] "was not editorially justified" [...] despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any drink-driving laws.|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 1976, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was {{interview}}ed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> really sure they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African captain of England.|$|E
2500|$|The theory {{underlying}} this [...] "exemption" [...] {{is derived}} from the nature of the hearsay rule itself. The hearsay rule operates to exclude extrajudicial assertions as untrustworthy because they cannot be tested by cross-examination. When an assertion is offered into evidence against the defendant and the defendant objects, [...] "hearsay", the defendant is in essence saying [...] "I object to this statement as untrustworthy <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> afforded an opportunity to cross-examine the person who made it. How can we trust what he said?" [...] But what if the defendant is the person who made the statement that is now being offered against him? To object, [...] "hearsay" [...] in this circumstance would be as absurd as to argue, [...] "This statement is unreliable because I cannot cross-examine myself; therefore, how can I trust what I said?" [...] In this situation the objection of the Hearsay rule falls away, because the very basis of the rule is lacking, viz. the need and prudence of affording an opportunity of cross-examination. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that a defendant who faces his own statement being used against him has an opportunity to cross-examine himself – he can take the witness stand and explain his prior assertion, so the rule is satisfied.|$|E
