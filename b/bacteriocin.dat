25|$|There {{are many}} ways to {{demonstrate}} <b>bacteriocin</b> production, depending on the sensitivity and labor intensiveness desired.|$|E
25|$|Class IIa bacteriocins {{have a large}} {{potential}} for use in food preservation as well medical applications due to their strong anti-Listeria activity and broad range of activity. One example of Class IIa <b>bacteriocin</b> is pediocin PA-1.|$|E
25|$|The most {{recently}} proposed subclass is the Class IIe, which encompasses those bacteriocins composed by {{three or four}} non-pediocin like peptides. The best example is aureocin A70, a four-peptide <b>bacteriocin,</b> highly active against Listeria monocytogenes, with potential biotechnological applications.|$|E
5000|$|Lantibiotics are {{produced}} by {{a large number of}} Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Streptomyces to attack other Gram-positive bacteria, and as such, they are considered a member of the <b>bacteriocins.</b> <b>Bacteriocins</b> are classified according to their extent of posttranslational modification. The lantibiotics are a class of more extensively modified <b>bacteriocins,</b> also called Class I <b>bacteriocins.</b> (<b>Bacteriocins</b> for which disulfide bonds are the only modification to the peptide are Class II <b>bacteriocins.)</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Gram {{negative}} <b>bacteriocins</b> {{are typically}} classified by size. Microcins {{are less than}} 20 kDa in size, colicin-like <b>bacteriocins</b> are 20 to 90 kDa in size and tailocins or so called high molecular weight <b>bacteriocins</b> which are multi subunit <b>bacteriocins</b> that resemble the tails of bacteriophages. This size classification also coincides with genetic, structural and functional similarities.|$|R
2500|$|Class IV <b>bacteriocins</b> {{are defined}} as complex <b>bacteriocins</b> {{containing}} lipid or carbohydrate moieties.|$|R
25|$|Class IId cover single-peptide bacteriocins, {{which are}} not post-translationally {{modified}} and do not show the pediocin-like signature. The best example of this group is the highly stable aureocin A53. This <b>bacteriocin</b> is stable under highly acidic conditions, high temperatures, and is not affected by proteases.|$|E
25|$|Biological control {{methods are}} also {{utilized}} in managing this disease. In the 1970's and 1980's, A commonly used practice for treating germinated seeds, seedlings, and rootstock was to soak the plant parts in a suspension of K84, a related but not pathogenic species of Agrobacterium, A. radiobacter. K84 produces a <b>bacteriocin</b> (agrocin 84) {{which is an}} antiobiotic specific against related bacteria, including A. tumefaciens.This method, which was successful at controlling the disease on a commercial scale, had the risk of K84 transferring its resistance gene to the pathogenic Agrobacteria. Thus, in the 1990's, use of a genetically engineering strain of K84, known as K-1026, was created. This strain is just as successful in controlling crown gall as K84 without the caveat of resistance gene transfer.|$|E
25|$|Since Metchnikoff, {{advances}} in science have uncovered {{that the process}} of pathogenic inhibition is more complex than simply increasing the acidity in the colon, as the probiotic bacteria produce bacteriocins, bacterial synthesized proteins that inhibit pathogenic bacteria. In the case of L. bulgaricus this <b>bacteriocin</b> is called bulgaricin. Also there is a complex interplay between the probiotic bacteria and the body's immune system in the large intestine, where the good bacteria stimulate the body's own immune system to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria. For example, in a controlled study, 61 elderly volunteers, after 6 months of a daily dose of L. bulgaricus, responded to the intake of probiotic with an increase in the percentage of NK cells, an improvement in the parameters defining the immune risk profile (IRP), and an increase in the T cell subsets that are less differentiated. The probiotic group also showed decreased concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 but increased antimicrobial peptide hBD-2.|$|E
30|$|<b>Bacteriocins</b> are a {{heterogeneous}} group of ribosomally-synthesized AMPs or complex proteins secreted by bacteria that exhibit antimicrobial activity against similar or closely-related species through numerous mechanisms (Micenkova et al. 2014; Shabir et al. 2018). <b>Bacteriocins</b> produced by Gram-positive bacteria are typically classified into three classes: The Class I <b>bacteriocins,</b> {{also known as}} lantibiotics, include lanthionine, methyllanthionine, dehydroalanine, and 2 -aminoisobutyric acid; the Class II <b>bacteriocins</b> are small non-lanthionine-containing proteins and are divided into five subclasses (IIa/b/c/d/e); and the Class III <b>bacteriocins</b> are large heat-labile proteins, often with enzymatic activity (Cotter et al. 2013). <b>Bacteriocins</b> have net positive charges, which makes them useful for various applications. <b>Bacteriocins</b> {{have been shown to}} be active against human and animal bacterial pathogens, either of the same species (narrow spectrum), or other species (broad spectrum). <b>Bacteriocins</b> are highly selective, are effective against multidrug-resistant pathogens, and are non-toxic, which makes them important lead compounds for drug development (Bowdish et al. 2005; Mathur et al. 2018).|$|R
50|$|<b>Bacteriocins</b> {{for which}} {{disulfide}} bonds {{are the only}} modification to the peptide are Class II <b>bacteriocins.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} and well studied class of <b>bacteriocins</b> is the class IIa or pediocin-like <b>bacteriocins</b> produced by lactic acid bacteria. All class IIa <b>bacteriocins</b> {{are produced by}} food-associated strains, isolated {{from a variety of}} food products of industrial andnatural origins, including meat products, dairy products and vegetables. Class IIa <b>bacteriocins</b> are all cationic, display anti-Listeria activity, and kill target cells by permeabilizing the cell membrane.|$|R
25|$|In {{spite of}} these {{promising}} advantages, nisin is the only <b>bacteriocin</b> {{generally recognized as safe}} by the Food and Drug Administration and is currently used as a food preservative in several countries.This limitation in bacteriocins availability in the market as preservatives and antimicrobials can be attributed to multiple factors, including: (i) the high cost of their commercial production; (ii) the loss of their activity by proteolytic enzymes; (iii) their unfavorable interactions with other food constituents, which decreases the availability and necessitates a huge amount of the peptide to be added; (iv) the alterations of the chemical and physical properties of these compounds during the various food-processing stages; (v) the low yield of these compounds due to ineffective recovery by traditional purification methods; and (vi) the narrow spectrum of activity observed for most of the tested bacteriocins against pathogenic bacteria. In the last years, several studies on bacteriocins have demonstrated that the optimization of their production conditions, their purification methods, their combinations with other antimicrobial agents, the hurdle technology approach, and nanotechnology formulations, could all represent solutions to some of the previously mentioned problems.|$|E
2500|$|This {{naming system}} is {{problematic}} {{for a number}} of reasons. [...] First, naming bacteriocins by what they putatively kill would be more accurate if their killing spectrum were contiguous with genus or species designations. [...] The bacteriocins frequently possess spectra that exceed the bounds of their named taxa and almost never kill the majority of the taxa for which they are named. [...] Further, the original naming is generally derived not from the sensitive strain the <b>bacteriocin</b> kills, but instead the organism that produces the <b>bacteriocin.</b> [...] This makes the use of this naming system a problematic basis for theory; thus the alternative classification systems.|$|E
2500|$|The class IIb bacteriocins (two-peptide bacteriocins) require two {{different}} peptides for activity. [...] One such {{an example is}} lactococcin G, which permeabilizes cell membranes for monovalent sodium and potassium cations, but not for divalent cations. Almost all of these bacteriocins have a GxxxG motifs. This motif {{is also found in}} transmembrane proteins, where they are involved in helix-helix interactions. Accordingly, the <b>bacteriocin</b> GxxxG motifs can interact with the motifs in the membranes of the bacterial cells, killing the cells.|$|E
40|$|Class IIa <b>bacteriocins</b> {{have been}} {{primarily}} explored as natural food preservatives, {{but there is}} much interest in exploring the application of these peptides as therapeutic antimicrobial agents. <b>Bacteriocins</b> of this class possess antimicrobial activity against several important human pathogens.

40|$|Bacteria {{produces}} {{different kinds}} of antimicrobial sub-stances including ribosomally synthesized <b>bacteriocins</b> and non-ribosomally synthesized antibiotics or lipopep-tides {{as a part of}} their defense strategies in complex en-vironments such as fermented foods and the human gut.

LAB strains are recognized as GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) mi-croorganisms and have been studied in detail for bio-technological applications together with the <b>bacteriocins</b> produced by these strains [2, 3]. Members of the genus Pediococcus are classified within the LAB family and are reported to produce <b>bacteriocins</b> without post-translational modifications that are classified under class II <b>bacteriocins</b> [4, 5]. The <b>bacteriocins</b> classified under class IIa are called as pediocin-like <b>bacteriocins</b> because the first antimicrobial peptide of this class (pediocin PA- 1) was isolated from Pediococcus sp.

2500|$|Bacteriocins are {{categorized}} {{in several}} ways, including producing strain, common resistance mechanisms, and mechanism of killing. [...] There are several large categories of <b>bacteriocin</b> which are only phenomenologically related. [...] These include the bacteriocins from gram-positive bacteria, the colicins, the microcins, and the bacteriocins from Archaea. [...] The bacteriocins from E. coli are called colicins (formerly called 'colicines,' meaning 'coli killers'). [...] They are the longest studied bacteriocins. [...] They are {{a diverse group}} of bacteriocins and do not include all the bacteriocins produced by E. coli. [...] In fact, one of the oldest known so-called colicins was called colicin V and is now known as microcin V. [...] It is much smaller and produced and secreted in a different manner than the classic colicins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bacteriocin</b> {{genes are}} located either on chromosoms or on plasmids. Strain 5 {{produces}} a plasmid-encoded <b>bacteriocin</b> that {{is identical to}} sakacin P, {{as well as two}} chromosomally encoded bacteriocins, which were designated sakacin T and sakacin X.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{bacteria}} that release bacteriocins. The bacteria that releases the <b>bacteriocin</b> {{may have to}} die {{in order to do}} so; however most of the harm will be done to unrelated individuals who will be killed by the <b>bacteriocin.</b> This is because the ability to produce and release the <b>bacteriocin</b> is linked with immunity to it. Therefore, close relatives to the releasing cell will be less likely to die than non-relatives.|$|E
2500|$|Class III <b>bacteriocins</b> are large, heat-labile (>10 kDa) protein <b>bacteriocins.</b> This {{class is}} {{subdivided}} in two subclasses: subclass IIIa or bacteriolysins and subclass IIIb.|$|R
25|$|The class II <b>bacteriocins</b> {{are small}} (<10 kDa) {{heat-stable}} proteins. This class is subdivided into five subclasses. The class IIa <b>bacteriocins</b> (pediocin-like <b>bacteriocins)</b> {{are the largest}} subgroup and contain an N-terminal consensus sequence -Tyr-Gly-Asn-Gly-Val-Xaa-Cys across this group. The C-terminal is responsible for species-specific activity, causing cell-leakage by permeabilizing the target cell wall.|$|R
40|$|Plantaricin EF and JK {{are both}} two-peptide <b>bacteriocins</b> {{produced}} by Lactobacillus plantarum C 11. The mechanism of plantaricin EF and JK action was studied on L. plantarum 965 cells. Both plantaricins form pores in the membranes of target cells and dissipate the {{transmembrane electrical potential}} (Dc) and pH gradient (DpH). The plantaricin EF pores efficiently conduct small monovalent cations, but conductivity for anions is low or absent. Plantaricin JK pores show high conductivity for specific anions but low conductivity for cations. These data indicate that L. plantarum C 11 produces <b>bacteriocins</b> with complementary ion selec-tivity, thereby ensuring efficient killing of target bacteria. Many lactic acid bacteria produce <b>bacteriocins.</b> <b>Bacteriocins</b> are peptides or proteins that kill bacteria {{that are related to}} the producer strain. <b>Bacteriocins</b> are useful to their producer by killing bacteria that compete for the same niche.

50|$|<b>Bacteriocin</b> AS-48 is a cyclic peptide {{antibiotic}} {{produced by}} the eubacteria Enterococcus faecalis (Streptococcus faecalis) that shows a broad antimicrobial spectrum against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. <b>Bacteriocin</b> AS-48 is encoded by the pheromone-responsive plasmid pMB2, and acts on the plasma membrane in which it opens pores leading to ion leakage and cell death. The globular structure of <b>bacteriocin</b> AS-48 is composed of five alpha helices enclosing a hydrophobic core. The mammalian NK-lysin effector protein of T and natural killer cells has a similar structure, though it lacks sequence homology with bacteriocins AS-48.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} the incidence of <b>bacteriocins</b> produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic pathogenic oral bacteria. This set of LAB contained several strains (≥ 17 %) producing <b>bacteriocins</b> active against food-related bacteria.

30|$|PlnEF and plnJK are {{categorized}} as class IIb <b>bacteriocins,</b> whose activity {{depends on the}} overall activity of two peptides. Two peptide <b>bacteriocins</b> need both peptides for their activity and both peptides act synergistically.

These <b>bacteriocins</b> have little gene coding sequence similarity to other neighboring plantaricins; any peptide combination other than both synergistic peptides in these <b>bacteriocins</b> resulted in full loss of synergies (Zacharof and Lovitt 2012).|$|R
