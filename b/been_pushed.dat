5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let {{themselves}} into the house using Floyd's keys, without knocking or announcing themselves, while Cynthia and her family were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said she had not <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall {{may have been a}} precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had <b>been</b> <b>pushed,</b> but perhaps accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Operation Florence {{had come}} to an end. While the German line had <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> back and they had {{sustained}} casualties they could ill afford, they still firmly held Orsogna.

In the centre, a wedge of Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{start date}} was mid-1999, {{with the release}} date set for Christmas 2000, but Fox moved X-Men to June.

This meant that Singer had to finish X-Men six months ahead of schedule, although filming had <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> back. The release date was then moved to July 14.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear or wind {{gradients}} are {{a threat}} to parachutists, particularly to BASE jumping and wingsuit flying.

Skydivers routinely make adjustments {{to the position of}} their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.|$|E
5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} into long, grueling marches through rough terrain {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897.

5|$|At {{the time}} of Innocent VIII's death, the names of Cardinals Gherardo and Sanseverino (both created in pectore), had not been published, thus making them ineligible to {{participate}} in the conclave; however, both were published as an act of the College in sede vacante, Gherardo having <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> by Giovanni Battista Orsini and Sanseverino by Ascanio Sforza. Gherardo was assigned the title of Santi Nereo e Achilleo, which it was believed Innocent VIII had intended for him; Sanseverino was given the poor and undesirable diaconate of San Teodoro to ensure that the future pontiff would confirm his assignment.|$|E
5|$|By mid-November, the Germans {{had nearly}} taken Stalingrad in bitter street {{fighting}} when the Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad and {{an assault on}} the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously.

5|$|Eleven {{years into}} Sunday's evangelistic career, {{both he and}} his wife had <b>been</b> <b>pushed</b> to their {{emotional}} limits.

For her part, Nell found it increasingly difficult to handle household responsibilities, the needs of four children (including a newborn), and the long-distance emotional welfare of her husband. His ministry was also expanding, and he needed an administrator, a job for which his wife was ideally suited. In 1908, the Sundays decided to entrust their children to a nanny so that Nell could manage the revival campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Gunfright was {{initially}} released for the ZX Spectrum in 1985 {{and was the}} last game to be developed under the direct involvement of the Stamper brothers. Realising that the graphical limits of platforms such as the ZX Spectrum had <b>been</b> <b>pushed,</b> future projects such as Blackwyche and Dragon Skulle were handed over to designer brothers Dave and Bob Thomas, who were often uncredited for their work.
