5|$|At {{first the}} {{painting}} met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict {{war in the}} high style of history painting, and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> correct, the writer Richard Schickel argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.|$|E

5|$|Being one of {{the tallest}} {{buildings}} in Singapore in the early 20th century, the Great Southern Hotel was an important landmark of Chinatown. Designed by Swan and Maclaren, the architectural style of the Nam Tin Building {{was that of the}} Modern Movement. The building was designed to <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> functional. The grey-coloured façade of the Great Southern Hotel seemed to consist only of the bare essentials, with ordinary designs like strong horizontal lines with angular arches and simple cornices. The building was fitted with steel frame windows, with metal railings and grills, which were considered fashionable in the 1930s. The loggia on the uppermost floor was a little lighter in colour with the use of cast iron balustrades and brackets, and there was extensive use of green glass. The building was {{one of the}} first in Singapore to be built as an integral structure of reinforced concrete slab and beam with infill brick wall.|$|E
5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned the taking of manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, the taking of mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E

5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of arrest and detention into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E
5|$|Current {{commonly}} accepted physical theories imply or {{assume the}} photon to <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> massless. If the photon {{is not a}} strictly massless particle, it would not move at the exact speed of light, c in vacuum. Its speed would be lower and depend on its frequency. Relativity would be unaffected by this; the so-called speed of light, c, would then not be the actual speed at which light moves, but a constant of nature which is the upper bound on speed that any object could theoretically attain in space-time. Thus, {{it would still be}} the speed of space-time ripples (gravitational waves and gravitons), but it would not be the speed of photons.|$|E
5|$|Even though Champollion {{was appalled}} by the rampant looting of ancient {{artefacts}} and destruction of monuments, the expedition {{also contributed to the}} destruction. Most notably, while studying the Valley of the Kings, he damaged KV17, the tomb of Seti I, by removing a wall panel of 2.26 x 1.05m in a corridor. English explorers attempted to dissuade the destruction of the tomb, but Champollion persisted, stating that he had the permission of the Muhammad Ali Pasha. Champollion also carved his name into a pillar at Karnak. In a letter to the Pasha recommended that tourism, excavation and trafficking of artefacts <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> controlled. Champollion's suggestions may have led to Muhammad Ali's 1835 ordinance prohibiting all exports of antiquities and ordering the construction of a museum in which to house the ancient artifacts.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives. The women who were observed that had part-time jobs had a mortality rate lower than the women with full-time jobs and children. The same study also suggests that women who have young children {{are less likely to}} die than women who have no children or have older children. Although this evidence can not <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> attributed to the double burden of having children and a career field, it can give a good indication of a trend in society.

5|$|In an {{interview}} held in June 2009, Rob Pardo indicated that LAN support {{would not be}} included in StarCraft II. Removing LAN requires players to connect through Blizzard's servers before being able to play multiplayer games, causing gamers to voice their dissatisfaction online. Further controversy was sparked when Blizzard confirmed that the game would not support cross-server play out of the box, restricting gamers to only play against local opponents—for instance, US gamers against those in the US and Europeans against Europeans. The company originally explained that Australia and New Zealand servers would be located in Southeast Asia, pitting them against combatants from Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. However, starting from patch 1.1.0, {{it was announced that}} the Southeast Asia/Australia/New Zealand version of the game would not <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> region-locked, with gamers able to play on both the SEA/ANZ servers and the North American ones.|$|E

5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The Great Notch train station, {{formerly}} known as Caldwell Junction, was a small New Jersey Transit facility in the Great Notch section of Little Falls, New Jersey.

5|$|Later {{texts of}} Hinduism declare Ahimsa {{one of the}} primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against dharma (moral life).

Holden's and Holford's City of London Plan (1946–1947) recommended a relaxation of the strict height limits imposed in the capital and the first use in London of plot ratio calculations in the planning process so that buildings could be designed with floor space of up to five times the ground area. For the bomb-devastated area around St Paul's Cathedral, Holden proposed a new precinct around which buildings would be positioned to provide clear views of the cathedral and from which new ceremonial routes would radiate. The heights of buildings would <b>be</b> <b>strictly</b> defined to protect these views.
