"In the {{earliest}} centuries of Islam, {{the position of}} women was not <b>bad</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Only {{over the course of}} centuries was she increasingly confined to the house and was forced to veil herself." [...] The Quran and Muhammad's example were more favorable to the security and status of women than history and later Muslim practice might suggest. For example, the Qur'an does not require women to wear veils; rather, it was a social habit picked up with the expansion of Islam. In fact, since it was impractical for working women to wear veils, [...] "A veiled woman silently announced that her husband was rich enough to keep her idle." ...|$|E

[...] Everhadus is our only hard driving back, while Minnesota has three, [...] [...] [...] Our other ball carriers depend on sidestepping to go places and they couldn't do much of that with the footing so slippery." [...] Kipke also praised his defense for their play after Minnesota drove to the 15-yard line: [...] "Fourth down and 12 yards to go didn't look <b>bad</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> [...] Renner certainly meant business when he threw Alfonse for that six-yard loss." [...] The Wolverines played a defensive oriented game and relied heavily on Regeczi's punting. [...] One sports columnist wrote: [...] "No game I have seen this season more clearly brought out the inestimable value of consistent punting as did this bruise and batter struggle [...] [...] [...] [...] No matter where Michigan was located when Johnny Regeczi went back to kick, the boot almost always was good enough to place Minnesota on the defensive." ...|$|E

Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong has also identified himself as bisexual, saying in a 1995 interview with The Advocate, [...] "I think I've always been bisexual. I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.' They say it's taboo. It's ingrained in our heads that it's bad, when it's not <b>bad</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> It's a very beautiful thing." [...] In 2014 Armstrong discussed songs such as [...] "Coming Clean" [...] stating, [...] "It was a song about questioning myself. There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized... I think it's a process of discovery. I was willing to try anything." ...|$|E

[...] Armstrong continued, saying, [...] "The fact that it's an issue is kind of phobic within itself. At some point, you gotta think, this should be something that's just accepted." [...] Armstrong added: [...] "I don't really classify myself as anything. And when it comes to sex, there are parts of me that are very shy and conservative." [...] In February 2014, Armstrong again discussed his bisexuality in a Rolling Stone article about Dookie, a record which Armstrong described as [...] "touch on bisexuality a lot."

25|$|Further {{evidence}} supporting {{the importance of}} these texts discussing hells lies in Buddhists' further investigation of the nature of hell and its denizens. Buddhavarman's fifth century Chinese translation of the Abhidharma-vibhāṣā-śāstra (Ch. āpídámó pípóshā lùn 阿毘曇毘婆沙論) questions whether hell wardens who torture hell beings are themselves sentient beings, what form they take, and what language they speak. Xuanzang's 玄奘 seventh century Chinese translation of the Abhidharmakośa śāstra (Ch. āpídámó jùshè lùn 阿毘達磨倶舍論) too is concerned with whether hell wardens are sentient beings, as well as how they go on to receive karmic retribution, whether they create <b>bad</b> karma <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> and why are they not physically affected and burned by the fires of hell.|$|R
