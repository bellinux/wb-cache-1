5|$|Only 5–10% of {{levodopa}} {{crosses the}} <b>blood–brain</b> <b>barrier.</b> Much {{of the remainder}} is metabolized to dopamine elsewhere in the body, causing a variety of side effects including nausea, vomiting and orthostatic hypotension. Carbidopa and benserazide are dopa decarboxylase inhibitors which do not cross the <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barrier</b> and inhibit the conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, reducing side effects and improving the availability of levodopa for passage into the brain. One of these drugs is usually taken along with levodopa, often combined with levodopa in the same pill.|$|E
5|$|The larger arteries {{throughout}} the brain supply blood to smaller capillaries. These smallest {{of blood vessels}} in the brain, are lined with cells joined by tight junctions and so fluids do not seep in or leak out to the same degree as they do in other capillaries, thereby creating the <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barrier.</b> Pericytes {{play a major role in}} the formation of the tight junctions. The barrier is less permeable to larger molecules, but is still permeable to water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and most fat-soluble substances (including anaesthetics and alcohol). The <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barrier</b> is not present in areas of the brain that may need to respond to changes in body fluids, such as the pineal gland, area postrema, and some areas of the hypothalamus. There is a similar blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, which serves the same purpose as the <b>blood–brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> but facilitates the transport of different substances into the brain due to the distinct structural characteristics between the two barrier systems.|$|E
40|$|Fetal cells migrate {{into the}} mother during pregnancy. Fetomaternal {{transfer}} probably occurs in all pregnancies and in humans the fetal cells can persist for decades. Microchimeric fetal cells {{are found in}} various maternal tissues and organs including blood, bone marrow, skin and liver. In mice, fetal cells have also {{been found in the}} brain. The fetal cells also appear to target sites of injury. Fetomaternal microchimerism may have important implications for the immune status of women, influencing autoimmunity and tolerance to transplants. Further understanding of the ability of fetal cells to cross both the placental and <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barriers,</b> to migrate into diverse tissues, and to differentiate into multiple cell types may also advance strategies for intravenous transplantation of stem cells for cytotherapeutic repair.

40|$|This chapter {{describes}} the toxicokinetics (i. e., absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of mercury and mercury compounds in the body. Biomarkers of exposure {{and methods of}} analysis for measuring mercury levels in biological samples are discussed. The biotransformation of mercury in the environment is discussed in Volume III. The absorption of elemental mercury vapor occurs rapidly through the lungs, but it is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral absorption of inorganic mercury involves absorption through the gastrointestinal tract; absorption information for the inhalation route is limited. Methylmercury is rapidly and extensively absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract. Once absorbed, elemental mercury is readily distributed throughout the body; it crosses both placental and <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barriers.</b> Elemental mercury is oxidized to inorganic divalent mercury by the hydrogen peroxidase-catalase pathway, which is present in most tissues. The oxidation of elemental mercury to the inorganic mercuric cation in the brain can result in retention in the brain. Inorganic mercury has poor lipophilicity and a reduced capacity for penetrating the <b>blood-brain</b> or placental <b>barriers.</b> Once elemental mercury crosses the placental or <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barriers</b> and is oxidized to the mercuric ion, return to the general circulation is impeded, and mercury can retained in brain tissue...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Systemic {{chemotherapy}} {{has been}} relatively ineffective {{in the treatment of}} malignant brain tumors even though systemic chemotherapy drugs are small molecules that can readily extravasate across the porous <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> of malignant brain tumor microvasculature. Small molecule systemic chemotherapy drugs maintain peak blood concentrations for only minutes, and therefore, do not accumulate to therapeutic concentrations within individual brain tumor cells. The physiologic upper limit of pore size in the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> of malignant brain tumor microvasculature is approximately 12 nanometers. Spherical nanoparticles ranging between 7 nm and 10 nm in diameter maintain peak blood concentrations for several hours and are sufficiently smaller than the 12 nm physiologic upper limit of pore size in the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> to accumulate to therapeutic concentrations within individual brain tumor cells. Therefore, nanoparticles bearing chemotherapy that are within the 7 to 10 nm size range can be used to deliver therapeutic concentrations of small molecule chemotherapy drugs across the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> into individual brain tumor cells. The initial therapeutic efficacy of the Gd-G 5 -doxorubicin dendrimer, an imageable nanoparticle bearing chemotherapy within the 7 to 10 nm size range, has been demonstrated in the orthotopic RG- 2 rodent malignant glioma model.

40|$|Abstract Background Effective transvascular {{delivery}} of nanoparticle-based chemotherapeutics across the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> of malignant gliomas remains a challenge. This {{is due to}} our limited understanding of nanoparticle properties {{in relation to the}} physiologic size of pores within the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier.</b> Polyamidoamine dendrimers are particularly small multigenerational nanoparticles with uniform sizes within each generation. Dendrimer sizes increase by only 1 to 2 nm with each successive generation. Using functionalized polyamidoamine dendrimer generations 1 through 8, we investigated how nanoparticle size influences particle accumulation within malignant glioma cells. Methods Magnetic resonance and fluorescence imaging probes were conjugated to the dendrimer terminal amines. Functionalized dendrimers were administered intravenously to rodents with orthotopically grown malignant gliomas. Transvascular transport and accumulation of the nanoparticles in brain tumor tissue was measured in vivo with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Localization of the nanoparticles within glioma cells was confirmed ex vivo with fluorescence imaging. Results We found that the intravenously administered functionalized dendrimers less than approximately 11. 7 to 11. 9 nm in diameter were able to traverse pores of the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> of RG- 2 malignant gliomas, while larger ones could not. Of the permeable functionalized dendrimer generations, those that possessed long blood half-lives could accumulate within glioma cells. Conclusion The therapeutically relevant upper limit of <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> pore size is approximately 11. 7 to 11. 9 nm. Therefore, effective transvascular drug delivery into malignant glioma cells can be accomplished by using nanoparticles that are smaller than 11. 7 to 11. 9 nm in diameter and possess long blood half-lives. </p...|$|R

5|$|The brain consumes up {{to twenty}} percent of the energy used by the human body, more than any other organ. Brain {{metabolism}} normally relies upon blood glucose as an energy source, but during times of low glucose (such as fasting, endurance exercise, or limited carbohydrate intake), the brain uses ketone bodies for fuel with a smaller need for glucose. The brain can also utilize lactate during exercise. Long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the <b>blood–brain</b> <b>barrier,</b> but the liver can break these down to produce ketone bodies. However, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., butyric acid, propionic acid, and acetic acid) and the medium-chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and heptanoic acid, can cross the <b>blood–brain</b> <b>barrier</b> and be metabolized by brain cells. The brain stores glucose in the form of glycogen, albeit in significantly smaller amounts than that found in the liver or skeletal muscle.|$|E

These include cognitive loss, abnormal amyloid metabolism and aberrant Tau phosphorylation, as well as disturbances, such as inflammation, oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction, among others. A better understanding of the role of IGF- 1 in all these perturbations is required, particularly in relation to cognition. Furthermore, insight into the environmental factors contributing to abnormally reduced IGF- 1 function in AD brains may become crucial in development of much needed disease-modifying strategies. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.

40|$|Postoperative {{cognitive}} dysfunction (POCD) is a multifactorial process {{with a huge}} number of predisposing, causal, and precipitating factors. In this scenario, the neuroinflammation and the microglial activation play a pivotal role by triggering and amplifying a complex cascade involving the immuno-hormonal activation, the micro circle alterations, the hippocampal oxidative stress activation and, finally, an increased <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barrier's</b> permeability.

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), which includes white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), silent brain infarction (SBI), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), develops in a conjunction of cumulated injuries to cerebral microvascular beds, increased permeability of <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barriers,</b> and chronic oligemia.

40|$|Targeted drug {{delivery}} {{to the brain}} is difficult to achieve using conventional techniques, {{largely due to the}} <b>blood-brain</b> <b>barrier’s</b> (BBB) impediment to drug diffusion into the brain parenchyma. In response, development of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) offers the ability to circumvent the BBB and target specific areas of the brain. Predictability of infusate movement in pathological brain states during CED will maximize the effectiveness of this treatment, and therefore modeling of infusate movement must be characterized. Previous work from our lab effectively modeled CED in rats using the middle carotid artery occlusion model of cytotoxic edema. However, previous models examined for vasogenic edema study did not show pure vasogenic edema. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a model of pure vasogenic edema in the rat brain.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{intravenous}} co-infusion of labradimil, a metabolically stable bradykinin B 2 receptor agonist, {{has been}} shown to temporarily enhance the transvascular delivery of small chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, across the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier.</b> It has been thought that the primary mechanism by which labradimil does so is by acting selectively on tumor microvasculature to increase the local transvascular flow rate across the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier.</b> This mechanism of action does not explain why, in the clinical setting, carboplatin dosing based on patient renal function over-estimates the carboplatin dose required for target carboplatin exposure. In this study we investigated the systemic actions of labradimil, as well as other bradykinin B 2 receptor agonists with a range of metabolic stabilities, in context of the local actions of the respective B 2 receptor agonists on the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier</b> of rodent malignant gliomas. Methods Using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, the pharmacokinetics of gadolinium-diethyltriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), a small MRI contrast agent, were imaged in rodents bearing orthotopic RG- 2 malignant gliomas. Baseline blood and brain tumor tissue pharmacokinetics were imaged with the 1 st bolus of Gd-DTPA over the first hour, and then re-imaged with a 2 nd bolus of Gd-DTPA over the second hour, during which normal saline or a bradykinin B 2 receptor agonist was infused intravenously for 15 minutes. Changes in mean arterial blood pressure were recorded. Imaging data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Results The decrease in systemic blood pressure correlated with the known metabolic stability of the bradykinin B 2 receptor agonist infused. Metabolically stable bradykinin B 2 agonists, methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil, had differential effects on the transvascular flow rate of Gd-DTPA across the <b>blood-brain</b> tumor <b>barrier.</b> Both methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil increased the blood half-life of Gd-DTPA sufficiently enough to increase significantly the tumor tissue Gd-DTPA area under the time-concentration curve. Conclusion Metabolically stable bradykinin B 2 receptor agonists, methionine-lysine-bradykinin and labradimil, enhance the transvascular delivery of small chemotherapy drugs across the BBTB of malignant gliomas by increasing the blood half-life of the co-infused drug. The selectivity of the increase in drug delivery into the malignant glioma tissue, but not into normal brain tissue or skeletal muscle tissue, is due to the inherent porous nature of the BBTB of malignant glioma microvasculature. </p...|$|R
