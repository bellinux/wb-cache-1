5|$|Trollope refused. Hugo's {{novel was}} {{published}} in The Gentleman's Magazine, beginning in May 1869. However, {{by the end of}} June, the sale of Once A Week to a new publisher was in progress. Rather than serialising The Vicar in the magazine, Bradbury and Evans issued it in eleven monthly shilling numbers, running from July 1869 to May 1870. Trollope could not object to this mode of independent publication; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> that had fallen out of favour with the public, and Trollope suffered a loss of reputation and readership as a result. He also suffered a pecuniary loss of £300, agreeing for reasons unspecified to accept only £2500 for the novel.|$|E

25|$|The Tigers {{went into}} the finals without a single player who had played finals before, which seemed the only chink in the team's armour. However, in the semi final against Carlton, Hart led the way with a best afield {{performance}} and booted six goals. Two weeks later, Richmond played a Grand Final against Geelong considered {{as one of the}} classic matches of Australian football. Hart gathered 13 kicks and six handpasses <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of his seven marks that remains eternally etched in the memory. In the dying minutes, Hart rose above his opponent to grab the ball from a kick in by Geelong's Roy West and helped keep the momentum going the Tigers' way. In the end, Richmond hung on to win by nine points to end a 24-year premiership drought. Richmond's emphasis on attacking and kicking high scores became the new trend, and within a few years the game would be much more offense-orientated. To cap an extraordinary first year, Hart won the club goalkicking award, was voted recruit of the year and represented Australia in Ireland in the first contact between Australian and Gaelic football.|$|E

[...] In another comparison, Vermeule suggested, [...] "far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically, and far less attractive to the eye than the , the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal.

In the beginning of 1893, over a year after construction began, the MTK again redesigned Sisoi Velikys artillery. The two pairs of 12-inch 40-calibre guns were changed from barbette mountings to French-style center-pivot twin turrets. These guns had a maximum elevation of +15° and the ship carried 80 rounds per gun for them. Their rate of fire {{was intended to be}} one round per 1.5 minutes, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> shot per 2.5–3 minutes in reality.

The sessions took place at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, in August–September that year, with Phil McDonald as recording engineer. Harrison played piano and electric guitar on the recording; the other musicians were Billy Preston (electric piano), Tom Scott (saxophones), Willie Weeks (bass) and Andy Newmark (drums). These four musicians then joined Harrison for tour rehearsals in Los Angeles, where he rushed to complete Dark Horse before undertaking a much-anticipated North American tour with Ravi Shankar. With Peter Sellers among his entourage, Harrison alternatively adopted comedy and his Hindu-aligned spiritual goals as a defence against expectations related to his Beatle past during the tour.|$|E

Pike recalled that [...] "there was so much to memorize for that album, {{and we had to}} do it in like three different sections because a reel-to-reel only holds 22 minutes.

500|$|Small Heath Football Club's 1891–92 season {{had been}} {{relatively}} successful {{after several years}} of declining interest. On the field, they finished third in the Football Alliance.

Alfred Jones had been acting as club secretary on a voluntary basis since 1885, when payment of players was first permitted. Prior to entering the Football League, the board of directors appointed him as the club's first paid official, as secretary-manager. Caesar Jenkyns captained the team.|$|E

[...] Like Gibson, Frederick also praised the scene depicting Chuck's surrender to Vivian, calling it [...] "sniffle-inducing". Frederick continued that Dalton [...] "plays Hartley Winterbottom with a great sincerity and vulnerability." [...] Frederick also called it [...] "a great reward to the fans that the episode didn't cheat us out of the Chuck/Sarah wedding at all." [...] Frederick wrote, [...] "While I'm not blown away by this finale, I still am satisfied with it, because it represents the values we've come to expect from Chuck: the ideas of hope, family, and sticking together {{in the face of the}} most adverse of circumstances." [...] Ryan McGee of The Onion A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ on an A+ to F scale, although criticizing its [...] "mechanics".

500|$|Towards {{the second}} half of the century, Brasenose began to lose its {{reputation}} for ignorance; it also became wealthier. Its social ranking improved, and it attracted more members. The accounts were much improved: from a deficit of £444 in 1761 to a surplus of £476 in 1781. This must have been helped by the introduction of Arabic numerals (rather than Roman numerals) as late as 1773. The Radcliffe Camera was opened in 1749, assisting the college's attempts at self-improvement. Social barriers were broken down – both by the reduction in the duties of the lowest groups and the privileges of the richest, and the increasing wealth of entrants to the college generally. The college remained far from the most elite or exclusive of colleges; nor, by the standards of wealthier colleges, did its members misbehave. Among the 1774 intake, 20 were gentlemen, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> of the remaining seven – Henry Addington – who would achieve most fame as Brasenose's first prime minister. [...] It was into this setting that William Cleaver was made Principal in 1785, the principals of the previous eighty years – Francis Yarborough, William Gwyn, Ralph Cawley, and Thomas Barker– being without real note. Yarborough oversaw improvements to library and hall, the former guided by the addition of his own considerable collection of books. It was also set upon that improvements to accommodation were needed; two properties on the High Street were bought, to be turned into the Principal's residence, the lodgings above the Lodge becoming accommodation for bursar and fellows. This was overseen by Gwyn, but he too did not live to see its completion. It would continue to be the Principal's residence until 1886. Barker was a man of modest means; thus, it was Cleaver who would take Brasenose into a new age of prosperity.|$|E
500|$|Schlattmann {{thought to}} write the comic book store {{homicide}} storyline when {{he picked up the}} Aquaman snow globe in his office and thought, [...] "'Wow, this thing could easily be a murder weapon," [...] because of its weight and its edge. The writers wanted to use the actual Aquaman globe but DC Comics would not allow the character and the snow globe {{to be used in the}} episode, so the Dexter art department custom-made a snow globe. The superhero's name ultimately became [...] "Mariner" [...] as other names including [...] "Sea King" [...] and [...] "King of the Seas" [...] could not be used for legal reasons. Trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for the superhero based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. [...] "The Eradicator" [...] and [...] "Judge Justice" [...] were considered, but the final choice was [...] "The Dark Defender". Cerone said that the name was [...] "a little on the generic side, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> we could clear." [...] He said that The Dark Defender was in part an homage to [...] and [...] to Dexter's Dark Passenger, featured in Jeff Lindsay's series of Dexter novels on which the television series is based. On the poster, The Dark Defender, though hooded, was drawn with a smile to resemble Michael C. Hall. The poster was rendered by comic artist Tone Rodriguez, with whom Schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th Century Fox. When Schlattmann visited Rodriguez's studio in Los Angeles to discuss the art, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also there. Schlattmann thought that [...] "by including the two of them, we could make things a bit more special and add some credibility to the show". Wickline played the dead comic book shopkeeper, while Rodriguez played the prime suspect for the murder. The Dark Defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized Dexter webisodes, recapping Dexter's victims of the second season.|$|E
