40|$|The sea-bob <b>shrimp,</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri,</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} economic marine resources along the entire Brazilian coast. Nevertheless, despite its economic importance, no studies have examined the population genetics of this species. In this paper, we used ten allozyme loci to study the pattern of genetic structuring in X. kroyeri along the southeastern Brazilian coast. Seven of the ten analyzed loci were polymorphic, yielding observed heterozygosity values higher than those reported for other penaeid shrimps. The population from São Paulo was significantly different from the other two populations (Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo), which, in turn, seem to form a single panmitic unit. Therefore, our results clearly indicate that conservation policies for this species should consider the São Paulo population as an independent stock from those of Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo.

5|$|The yellow-orange {{pigments}} of the smalleye hammerhead seem to {{have been}} acquired from the penaeid <b>shrimp</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri,</b> the main food of juvenile sharks, and from sea catfish and their eggs, the main food of adults.

This species is viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Females bear litters of five to 19 pups every year following a gestation period of 10 months. Reproductive seasonality, litter size, and size at maturity vary between geographical regions. Because of its abundance, the smalleye hammerhead is an economically important bycatch of artisanal gillnet fisheries throughout its range and is used as food. In recent years, overfishing has caused marked declines in its numbers off Trinidad, northern Brazil, and probably elsewhere. Coupled with its low reproductive rate, this has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature to list it under vulnerable.|$|R
40|$|Marine {{communities}} in tropical regions contain a great diversity {{of species that}} play key roles in ecological processes. The observed bycatch fauna in artisanal fishing for the seabob <b>shrimp</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> (Heller, 1862) in the southwest Atlantic exceeds the quantity of commercial shrimp captured. This bycatch has not been previously inventoried extensively in Brazil, particularly in the State of Santa Catarina, where small-scale shrimp fisheries is a traditional activity and dominates the local fishing economy. Six municipalities were sampled three times a month, from 1996 to 2011, yielding 216 species belonging to the bycatch (7 cnidarians, 22 mollusks, 42 crustaceans, 11 echinoderms, and 134 fishes). Bycatch management is a pressing aspect of shrimp fisheries. By inventorying the accidental bycatch, we provide a preliminary step towards defining intervention measures to reduce or make better use of this bycatch in seabob artisanal fisheries. Conservation of marine biodiversity is still inadequate in Brazil. We have attempted to identify additional threats to vulnerable and endangered species resulting from shrimp trawling...|$|R

Monthly samples were obtained, from May 2008 through April 2010, from four locations in the estuary and four in the bay. No individual was collected in the estuary and this was attributed to the low salinity means recorded in this environment. We collected 109, 153 individuals in the bay {{and there was no}} difference in abundance between the two years comprised by the study period. The similarity in spatial distribution can be related to sediment grain size that in all sampling locations showed great amount of very fine sand. The largest amount of reproductive females was obtained in early 2010, when temperature was high, and this could have increased the juvenile recruitment in April 2010. According to our results, the distribution of X. kroyeri in the study area is influenced by temperature, which is related to reproduction, and salinity, limiting the entrance of individuals in the estuarine region...|$|R
40|$|The fishery on Penaeidae shrimp is {{done all}} over the Brazilian coast, {{especially}} the seabob <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri).</b> It is captured in large quantities in the Southeast and Southern Brazil.

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} the abundance and spatial-temporal {{distribution of the}} <b>shrimp</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> in the coastal region of Macaé, state of Rio de Janeiro, southeastern Brazil. Monthly samples were obtained from March 2008 to February 2010 in six stations located in Inner (5, 10 and 15 m depth) and Outer (25, 35 and 45 m depth) areas. It was used a commercial fishery boat equipped with an otter-trawl net (3. 5 m mouth width, mesh size 20 mm and 15 mm in the cod end). Water samples were taken for determination of temperature and salinity, and sediment samples for determination of texture and organic matter content. A total of 7146 shrimps were sampled. About 95 % of all shrimps {{were caught in the}} shallow area, i. e., depths < 20 m. Greatest abundances were recorded in winter and spring. No significant correlation was observed between sediment (phi) and abundance. The distribution of X. kroyeri in the studied area was closely related to seasonal cold waterfront of the South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and temperature was the main factor affecting the species abundance...|$|R

This study screened the antimicrobial effect of essential oils and methanol, hexane, ethyl acetate extracts from guava leaves. The extracts were tested against diarrhea-causing bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli. Strains that were screened included isolates from seabob <b>shrimp,</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> (Heller) and laboratory-type strains. Of the bacteria tested, Staphylococcus aureus strains were most inhibited by the extracts. The methanol extract showed greatest bacterial inhibition. No statistically significant differences were observed between the tested extract concentrations and their effect. The essential oil extract showed inhibitory activity against S. aureus and Salmonella spp. The strains isolated from the shrimp showed some resistance to commercially available antibiotics. These data support the use of guava leaf-made medicines in diarrhea cases where access to commercial antibiotics is restricted. In conclusion, guava leaf extracts and essential oil are very active against S. aureus, thus making up important potential sources of new antimicrobial compounds...|$|R

The present study evaluated the Total Operating Cost (TOC) for three groups of vessels engaged in this fishery (G 1, G 2 and G 3) depending on their physical characteristics (vessel length, gross tonnage and engine power), with G 1 including the largest vessels with the most powerful engines, and, in contrast, G 3 with the smallest gross tonnage vessels and G 2, an intermediate group between these two. The results indicate that fuel (diesel) represents the highest source of costs for all groups. Under the schemes of cooperative or market value a small difference was found in the profits among the three groups of boats not showing direct economic benefits that would encourage permanent cooperative engagement. However, the adhesion of fisher to cooperatives occurs due to strong ties between them and can provide security as regarding marketing and preservation of the catches...|$|R

Vibrio vulnificus is an emergent pathogen, an invasive and lethal marine bacterium related to wound infection and held accountable for gastroenteritis and primary septicemia. It occurs quite frequently in marine organisms, mainly in mollusks. This study aimed at isolating and identifying strains of V. vulnificus based upon the analysis of twenty samples of seabob <b>shrimp,</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> (Heller), purchased at the Mucuripe fish market (Fortaleza, Brazil).

The isolates were biologically and antigenically characterized by agglutination tests with enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) -, enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) - and entero-hemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) O 157 -specific antisera. The ETEC enterotoxins were characterized by GMI-ELISA for enterotoxin LT- 1 (thermolabile) and by inoculation of supernatants prepared from newly born mice for en-terotoxin Sta. A total of 14 strains produced exotoxins, of which seven were thermolabile (LT) and seven were thermostable (ST). Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were determined by disc diffusion in agar using ampi-cillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, imipenem, nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, gentami-cin, nitrofurantoin, sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim, and tetracycline. Four isolates showed lower suscepti-bility to some antibiotics, two strains were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and sulfamethoxazole-trime-thoprim, and two were resistant to tetracycline and nitrofurantoin. Plasmids were extracted in the four resistant isolates; two of them contained plasmids whose molecular weight varied from low to high.

In each season of the year, collections were made in the day and at night on 9 transects at depths ranging from 2 to 40 m. The estimated shrimp amount was of 28, 878 individuals. Although the catch rate was higher during the day (15, 853 shrimp), this did not differ significantly from the catch at night (13, 025). The catch rate was higher in daytime on most transects, but was higher at night at locations where fine and very fine sand predominated. The majority of juveniles were caught during the day.

40|$|A {{combination}} of stomach content analyses and dual stable isotope analyses {{was used to}} reveal the trophic ecology of Atlantic seabob <b>shrimp</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> {{off the coast of}} Suriname. This coastal penaeid shrimp species has a rather omnivorous diet, feeding opportunistically on both animal prey and primary food sources. The species is a predator of hyperbenthic crustaceans, including copepods, amphipods and the luciferid shrimp Lucifer faxoni, which are mainly preyed upon during daytime, when these prey typically reside near the seabed. Benthic microalgae (BM) from intertidal mudflats and offshore sedimentary organic matter (SOM) were important primary food sources. Due to their depleted 13 C values, coastal sedimentary and suspended organic matter, and carbon from riverine and mangrove-derived detritus were not incorporated by X. kroyeri. An ontogenetic diet shift was observed from postlavae to juveniles and adults. Adult X. kroyeri were located higher in the food chain, mainly preying on larger benthic organisms. Intertidal BM were an important food source for all life stages of X. kroyeri, contributing up to 64 % to the overall diet based on a Bayesian mixing model. Because X. kroyeri is the main epibenthic organism found at high densities in nearshore waters up to 30  m depth, the species plays a crucial role in transferring energy from low trophic level prey and primary food sources up to higher levels in the food chain. Our results indicate that primary production on intertidal mudflats, through BM, forms an important energy source for the subtidal turbid-water food web in muddy tropical coasts. Conservation of intertidal areas and their associated mangrove systems will therefore likely benefit coastal shrimp production and fisheries in tropical ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The seabob <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri)</b> {{represents}} an important fishing resource for artisanal fishermen in coastal areas of southern Brazil. Stock assessments {{of this species}} ha ve generally relied on biomass dynamics models as applied to CPUE time-series, which (a) are only available for a small offshore fraction of the exploited population and (b) does not comprise patterns of the shallowest artisanal fishing grounds. This work explores the use of extensive catch and effort data derived from a small-scale trawl fishery to obtain swept-area estimates of abundance and removal rates in a limited coastal area of southern Brazil (Tijucas Bay, Santa Catarina State, 27 ° 15 'S- 48 ° 33 'W). Data were obtained from 7, 198 fishing trips monitored at the fishing communities between June 2004 and August 2005. Because three parameters of the swept-area equation (i. e. trawl velocity, catch efficiency and wing spread) were unknown, they were defined through a stochastic procedure and calibrated by estimates produced by a Leslie depletion model applied to concurrent catches obtained in one fishing ground. A 21. 7 % removal rate was estimated for the period June 2004 -January 2005; this increased to nearly 34 % between February and July 2005. This removal scenario predicted that a five-month fishery would suffice to remo ve 90 % of the biomass available in the Tijucas Bay, nearing the 87 % CPUE reduction observed in the same period. Whereas abundance and harvest rate estimates were likely affected by inadequate knowledge of the swept-area equation parameters, the similarity of these estimates with relative abundance indexes supports the convenience of the proposed method and justifies future efforts to improve its accuracy...|$|R

Near the 30 m isobath, sediments were much coarser (median grain size on average 345 ± 103 µm vs. 128 ± 53 µm in the coastal assemblage) and water transparency was much higher (on average 7. 6 ± 3. 5 m vs. 2. 4 ± 2. 1 m in the coastal assemblage). In this zone, a diverse offshore assemblage was found, characterized by brittle stars (mainly Ophioderma brevispina and Ophiolepis elegans) {{and a variety of}} crabs, sea stars and hermit crabs. In between both zones, a transition assemblage was noted, with epibenthic species typically found in either the coastal or offshore assemblages, but mainly characterized by the absence of X. kroyeri. Although the epibenthic community was primarily structured in an on-offshore gradient related to depth, sediment grain size and sediment total organic carbon content, a longitudinal (west-east) gradient was apparent as well. The zones {{in the eastern part of}} the Suriname coastal shelf seemed to be more widely stretched along the on-offshore gradient. Although clear seasonal differences were noted in the environmental characteristics (e. g. dry vs. rainy season), this was not reflected in the epibenthic community structure. X. kroyeri reached very high densities (up to 1383 ind 1000 m - ²) in the shallow coastal waters of Suriname.

40|$|Tropical shrimp {{trawling}} fisheries {{are generally}} known {{to capture a}} large amount of unwanted organisms along with the targeted shrimp. To reduce this by-catch, the fishery for Atlantic seabob <b>shrimp</b> <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> in Suriname uses nets fitted Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and By-catch Reduction Devices (BRDs). It is unclear, however, to what extend these selectivity measures, designed to reduce capture of marine turtles and small roundfish respectively, are reducing by-catch of rays. Due to their life-history characteristics, rays (Batoidea; Chondrichthyes: Elasmobranchii) are generally vulnerable to overexploitation and several endangered species are known to occur in Surinamese waters. The objective of this study therefore is to assess the effect of the selectivity devices currently in place (TEDs and BRDs) on ray by-catch in the X. kroyeri trawling fishery. Hereto, sixty-five simultaneous catch-comparison hauls were conducted, comparing ray by-catch in trawls fitted with (test-net) and without (control-net) TEDs and BRDs. Five different ray species occurred in the by-catch, Gymnura micrura and Dasyatis guttata being the dominant species. Overall, catch rate of rays was reduced by 36 % in the test-net. Moreover, rays that did end up in the test-net codend were on average 21 % smaller than those in the control-net. This confirms the presumption that rays escape through TEDs rather than BRDs, smaller individuals being able to pass through the TED, but larger ones being guided to the escape opening {{at the bottom of the}} net. TEDs were most efficient in excluding Dasyatis geijskesi, the largest ray species. By-catch of D. guttata was reduced as well, but exclusion was highly dependent on size. A similar, but less pronounced relationship between size and exclusion rate was observed for G. micrura. Nevertheless, large individuals of both species were relatively rare, the bulk of the ray by-catch being made up by small sized (G. micrura and D. guttata, complemented with Urotrygon microphthalmum, a small-sized species. Although TEDs and BRDs seem efficient in reducing by-catch of large rays, they seem inappropriate to protect small-sized individuals, which are more abundant in the population. We therefore suggest that further by-catch related efforts in this fishery are concentrated on reducing the incidental capture of small-sized rays...|$|R

Um total de 28. 878 camarões foi obtido e apesar da maior taxa de captura observada durante o dia (15. 853 camarões), não houve diferença significativa em relação ao período noturno (13. 025). Na maioria dos tran-sectos houve também uma maior taxa de captura de camarões durante o dia, no entanto, verificou-se que em locais com sedimentos com predominância de areia fina e muito fina, houve uma captura no período noturno. Já em relação aos juvenis, a maioria dos indivíduos foi amostrada durante o dia. Em consideração ao tamanho (CC) médio, obteve-se o valor de 14, 43 ± 4, 02 mm durante o dia e 14, 82 ± 4, 28 mm durante a noite, com significativa diferença (Student's t-test, df = 2. 429, t = 2, 27, p = 0, 02). Verificou-se também que os maiores indivíduos foram capturados no período noturno. Um único modelo dos três propostos na literatura para as espécies de peneídeos quanto ao padrão de captura diuturna não pode ser aplicado ao X. kroyeri. Nossos resultados evidenciaram que tipo de sedimento não somente influenciou na taxa de captura entre os períodos analisados como determinou os modelos em que esta pode ser incluída...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work {{was to investigate the}} relations of reproductive parameters (sex and maturity) and seasonality with the accumulation of total mercury in a tropical marine <b>shrimp</b> species (<b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri)</b> from the north of Rio de Janeiro State, SE, Brazil. These coastal region suffers the influence of the Paraíba do Sul river water discharge. Shrimp samples were monthly collected between and separated by sex and maturity phases. The organisms suffer a specific strong acid digestion (method). Total mercury was analyzed in the extracts {{with the help of an}} ICP-EAS with a vapor generating accessory (VGA 77). The studied shrimp species presented an average total Hg concentration of 0. 036 μg. g- 1. A significant difference was observed between the rainy (spring/summer 0. 029 μg. g- 1) and the dry period (autumn/winter 0. 039 μg. g- 1) (p< 0. 05). The above mentioned results are in accordance with previous studies that described the total Mercury dynamics and transport in the lower RPS drainage basin as well as its estuarine area. Between sex there was no statistical significant difference observed, although a statistical significant difference was observed between the females in distinct maturation states (p< 0. 05), where the mature females presented higher Hg concentrations (0. 043 μg. g- 1). The total mercury values observed in the present study was always under the maximum values permitted for human consumption determined by Brazilian Authorities, therefore there is no health risk associated with the consumption of this species by human populations...|$|R

Pela análise das 607 culturas isoladas, constatou-se a predominância de bactérias em bastonetes Gram negativos, possivelmente Pseudomonas, Achromobacter e Flavobacterium, nas amostras de sardinha nas três temperaturas de incubação, e nas amostras de camarão houve predominância de bactérias em cocos Gram negativos nas temperaturas de incubação de 30 ºC e 20 ºC e de bastonetes Gram negativos a 7 ºC, Constatou-se, também, que 55, 8 % das cepas isoladas apresentavam propriedades lipolítica e/ou proteolítica, Observou-se que somente 29, 3 % de microrganismos isolados a 30 ºC (contagem de mesófilos) possuíam atividades proteolítica e/ou lipolítíca a 7 ºC. Dentre os microrganismos isolados a 20 ºC (contagem de psicrófilos), 39, 4 % apresentaram essas propriedades a 7 ºC e daqueles isolados a 7 ºC (contagem de psicrotróficos), 49 %. Isso vem mostrar que o método para a contagem de psicrotróficos é cerca de duas vezes mais preciso para enumeração das bactérias de importância à deterioração de pescados refrigerados, do que o método de contagem de mesofilos. A diferença de precisão entre os métodos para contagens de psicrófilos e de psicrotróficos é de cerca de 20 % em favor do últimoAbstract: The {{techniques for}} {{the determination of}} mesophilic (48 hours at 30 ºC) psychrophilic (48 hours at 20 ºC) and psychrotrophic (10 days at 7 ºC) counts {{on the surface and}} in the total were compared with the samples of sardine (Sardinella aurita) and <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri).</b> The results obtained with those three different incubation temperatures showed equivalent counts varying slightly among the samples and with the incubation temperatures of plates. The morphological and physiological characteristics were studied on 607 strains isolated from these samples. The predominance of Gram negative bacilli, possibly Pseudomonas, Achromobacter and Flavobacterium, occurred in the sardine samples at all three temperatures of incubation. In the shrimp samples there was a predominance of Gram negative cocci among the colony formed at the incubation temperatures of 30 ºC and 20 ºC, and of Gram negative bacilli among those formed at 7 ºC. Also, 55. 8 % of the strains were proteolytic and/or lipolytic types. It was found that only' 29. 3 % of the microbes isolated at 30 ºC (mesophilic count) showed proteolytic and/or lipolytic properties at 7 ºC. Amongst those isolated at 20 ºC (psychrophilic count), 39. 4 %	showed these properties at 7 ºC and those isolated at 7 ºC (psychrotrophic count) 49 % of positive strains. These results show hat the method for psychrotrophic count is nearly twice as accurate as the method for mesophilic count for the detection and enumeration of the bacteria implicated in spoilage of fish and marine products stored under refrigeration. The difference in accuracy between the method of psychrophilic count and psychrotrophic count was about 20 % in favor of the last techniqu...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} efficiency of two square-mesh codend designs {{with the same}} circumference (~ 2 m) but different mesh sizes and materials (32 mm polyethylene-PE and 30 mm polyamide-PA) was tested in an artisanal shrimp trawl fishery in Paraná, southern Brazil.

Although not significant, the mean numbers of total bycatch were reduced by 16. 6 and 10. 0 % with the 32 and 30 mm square-mesh codends, respectively.

40|$|Partial {{sequences}} for the 16 S rRNA {{mitochondrial gene}} {{were obtained from}} 10 penaeid shrimp species: Farfantepenaeus paulensis, F. brasiliensis, F, subtilis, F. duorarum, F. aztecus, Litopenaeus schmitti, L. setiferus, and <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> from the western Atlantic and L. vannamei and L. stylirostris from the eastern Pacific. Sequences were also obtained from an undescribed morphotype of pink shrimp (morphotype II) usually identified as F. subtilis. The phylogeny resulting from the 16 S partial sequences showed that these species form two well-supported monophyletic clades consistent with the two genera proposed in a recent systematic review of the suborder Dendrobranchiata. This contrasted with conclusions drawn from recent molecular phylogenetic work on penaeid shrimps based on partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI region that failed to support recent revisions of the Dendrobranchiata based on morphological analysis, Consistent differences observed in the sequences for morphotype Il, coupled with previous allozyme data, support the conclusion {{that this is a}} previously undescribed species of Farfantepenaeus.

From October 2013 to August 2014, the fishing grounds were identified used in this activity, as well as the fishing method, the number of boats and fishermen acting, type of boat and gears used. Analyses were performed with the major communities operating in this fishery (Recife, Jaboatão dos Guararapes, Barra de Sirinhaém and São Jose da Coroa Grande). The analyzes of the catch were tested using one-way ANOVA (α 5 %). They observed two traditional types: the beach seining and trawing. It was cataloged about 50 vessels in the activity, with approximately 100 fishermen.

40|$|Samples {{of shrimp}} trawl catches were {{collected}} from a commercial artisanal vessel fishing inside the 6 -fm isobath in the Gulf of Paria, Trinidad. From August 1986 to May 1987, 34 late evening-early morning trawl trips were made and 97 hauls were sampled. Annual ratio estimates were 9 (SD 1. 3) finfish:shrimp and 14. 7 (SD 2. 0) by-catch: shrimp, with the highest ratios observed August through December and the lowest from late January through May, the dry season. Extrapolation of ratios, using shrimp catch statistics, indicates that for 1986, 974, 000 kg of finfish and 620, 000 kg of crabs, Callinectes spp., were caught incidentally by artisanal shrimp trawlers fishing in the Gulf of Paria. Of this total incidental catch (1, 594, 000 kg), about 1, 500, 000 kg were discarded (94 percent).

40|$|We {{investigated}} the sexual maturity, reproductive period and juvenile recruitment (both associated with salinity and temperature of bottom water) and sex-ratio of <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> in Santos Bay, São Paulo. Monthly samples {{were obtained from}} June 2008 through May 2009 along four transects. Individuals were measured, sexed and the developmental stage of the reproductive system was macroscopically determined. The mean carapace length of females was larger than that of males. Females attained physiological maturity with 25. 5 mm and males with 16. 8 mm. The reproductive period was continuous with higher proportions of reproductive females in autumn. Although not significant, in February occurs a peak of reproductive females similar to March. An intermediate peak of these females occurs between August and October and it contributed to the recruitment in summer. The smallest amount of juveniles after the main peak of spawning (February, March and April) {{can be explained by}} migration or consequences of open access for fishery that occurs on June. The overall sex-ratio was approximately 1 : 1. However, when considering the spatial distribution, we observed a greater amount of reproductive females in shallow waters in the bay. The differential distribution between the sexes could be associated with appropriated areas to spawn.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the growth and}} population structure of <b>Xiphopenaeus</b> <b>kroyeri</b> in Babitonga Bay, southern Brazil. Monthly trawls were conducted from July 2010 through June 2011, using a shrimp boat outfitted with double-rig nets, at depths from 5 to 17 m. Differences from the expected 0. 5 sex ratio were determined by applying a Binomial test. A von Bertalanffy growth model was used to estimate the individual growth, and longevity was calculated using its inverted formula. A total of 4, 007 individuals were measured, including 1, 106 juveniles (sexually immature) and 2, 901 adults. Females predominated in the larger size classes. Males and females showed asymptotic lengths of 27. 7 mm and 31. 4 mm, growth constants of 0. 0086 and 0. 0070 per day, and longevities of 538 and 661 days, respectively. The predominance of females in larger size classes is the general rule in species of Penaeidae. The paradigm of latitudinal-effect {{does not appear to}} apply to seabob shrimp on the southern Brazilian coast, perhaps because of the small proportion of larger individuals, the occurrence of cryptic species, or the intense fishing pressure in this region. The longevity values are within the general range for species of Penaeidae. The higher estimates for longevity in populations at lower latitudes may have occurred because of the growth constants observed at these locations, resulting in overestimation of this parameter...|$|R
