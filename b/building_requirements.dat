In 1833, Martinus Rørbye became the first artist to paint the fishermen and landscapes of Skagen, {{almost half a century}} before the arrival of the Skagen Painters. Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying <b>building</b> <b>requirements</b> including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

The problem here is that, while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has had to do this, so new <b>building</b> <b>requirements</b> would need to be imposed.|$|E
25|$|Shipped by {{railroad}} boxcar, {{and then}} usually trucked {{to a home}} site, the average Sears Modern Home kit had approximately 25 tons of materials, with over 30,000 parts. Plumbing, electrical fixtures and heating systems {{were not included in}} the base price of the house but could be included, at an additional cost, with the house order. The Modern Homes features of central heating, indoor plumbing, and electrical wiring were the first steps for many families to modern HVAC systems, kitchens, and bathrooms. During the Modern Homes program, large quantities of asphalt shingles became available. Asphalt shingles were cheap to manufacture and ship, and easy and inexpensive to install. A later feature was the use of drywall instead of the plaster and lath wall-building techniques which required skilled carpenters and plasterers. Drywall offered the advantages of low price, ease of installation, and added fire protection. Local <b>building</b> <b>requirements</b> sometimes dictated that certain elements of the house construction be done professionally and varied to meet requirements of each area of the country. For example, requirements for the depth of the foundation varied by climate and terrain and whether the house was being financed by Sears.|$|E

500|$|In 1995, La Luz del Mundo {{acquired}} a vacant nursery {{building in a}} commercial zone in Ontario, California. The Church planned {{to use it for}} religious activities and was assured that it could as long as <b>building</b> <b>requirements</b> were met. The city then passed a law requiring all new religious organizations to obtain a conditional use permit to operate a church in the commercial zone. In 1998, the Church petitioned for such a permit but concerned residents objected to its plans. María de Lourdes Argüelles, professor at Claremont Graduate University and board member of the Instituto Cristiano de México, led the opposition against the Church, which she called a [...] "destructive sect". She said she had seen children and teenagers working overnight on the site under precarious conditions.|$|E

2500|$|GSA moved {{ahead with}} its plans. [...] In 1955, Congress {{authorized}} a GSA proposal to construct nine new federal buildings, {{including one in}} Southwest D.C. Congress also enacted a lease-purchase statute which applied only to the District of Columbia. [...] The act required congressional approval of the <b>building</b> <b>requirements</b> and architectural design, and an open bidding process. In July 1956, the House of Representatives appropriated $40.9 million for a federal building on Independence Avenue SW between 6th and 9th Streets, and $25.2 million for three small office buildings to border the 10th Street SW esplanade. All the buildings would be financed under new lease-purchase legislation.|$|E
