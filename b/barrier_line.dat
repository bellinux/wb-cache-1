50|$|The {{station has}} three platforms. Platform 1 is for {{services}} towards Stansted Airport and Cambridge. Platform 2 {{is used for}} services to London Liverpool Street and Stratford. Platform 3 is used for some trains that terminate at Bishops Stortford. It is also used by a few services to/from Cambridge via Stansted Airport which only start/terminate here. In the days before 1985 when Bishop's Stortford was the northern limit of electrification it was used for slow trains to London Liverpool Street and to Cambridge; therefore platform 2 was used for fast trains (Stansted Express). The station has two entrances. One from Station Road where there is ticket hall, waiting room and real time information. The other entrance is for direct access to Platforms 2 and 3.

40|$|The optical data {{transfer}} is considered {{as the future}} of signal transfer due to its various advantages compared to conventional copper-based technologies. The Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) technology offers the opportunity to print materials with high viscosities, such as liquid transparent polymer adhesives (epoxy resins), on almost any possible substrate material and even in third dimension. This paper introduces a new flexible and comparatively cost-effective way of generating polymer optical waveguides through AJP. Furthermore, the conditioning of the substrate material and the printing process of planar waveguides are presented. In the first step, two lines with hydrophobic behavior are applied on foil material (PMMA, PVC, PI) by using a flexographic printing machine. These silicone based patterns containing functional polymer form barriers for the core material due to their low surface energy after curing. In the second step, the core material (liquid polymer, varnish) is printed between the <b>barrier</b> <b>lines.</b> Because of the hydrophobic behavior of the lines, the contact angle between the substrate surface and the liquid core material is increased which yields to higher aspect ratio. The distance between the <b>barrier</b> <b>lines</b> is at least 100 μm, which defines {{the width of the}} waveguide. The minimum height of the core shall be 50 μm. After UV-curing of the core polymer, the cladding material is printed on the top. This is also applied by using the AJP technology. Various tests were performed to achieve the optimal surface properties for adequate adhesion and machine process parameters. © 2016 SPIE...|$|R

40|$|This {{field study}} was {{conducted}} along a curve where the <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> was worn out due to encroachments by cars.

Vehicle type and traffic situation were also classified (n = 6 599). It was assumed that if encroachments of <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> and the standard deviation of lateral positions were reduced, safety would improve. The standard deviation of the lateral position of passenger cars travelling in free-flow traffic decreased from 35 cm with the worn <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> to 28 cm after repainting the <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> and to 24 cm after milling the rumble strip <b>barrier</b> <b>line.</b> Oncoming traffic moved the driving paths of vehicles 15 – 20 cm closer to the edge line.

Encroachments of passenger cars in free-flow traffic with no oncoming traffic fell from 9. 2 % to 2. 5 % after repainting, with no further change after implementing the rumble strip.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The development of a scientific based law enforcement quality control model to monitor <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> violations in the Limpopo Province is belng proposed to reduce road traffic casualties (fatalities and injuries) cause by illegal overtaking on barrier lines and to promote quality road usage by all road users in the Province. This <b>Barrier</b> <b>Line</b> Management Model (BLMM) can be applied provincially, nationally and internationally. Quality Control Models (QCM) are statistical tools {{that can be used}} to monitor violation rates in a scientific manner and are used to address the problem of barrler lines violation in the Limpopo Province. Quality control models for speeding and drunken driving were developed as part of the Traffic Management System (TMS) which is part of the Transport System, Pretorlus (1999). The TMS's disciplines and functional areas will reduce illegal overtaking on barrier lines and casualties through the implementation of the BLMM in the Limpopo Province. The development of the model for <b>barrier</b> <b>line</b> violations is base on the same principles, however, with a different mathematical approach. This is for the flrst tlme being implemented in the Limpopo Province. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.
