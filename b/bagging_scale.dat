40|$|The {{experimental}} determination of purge bag materials properties, development of purge bag manufacturing techniques, experimental {{evaluation of a}} subscale purge bag under simulated operating conditions and the experimental evaluation of the purge pin concept for MLI purging are discussed. The basic purge bag material, epoxy fiberglass bounded by skins of FEP Teflon, showed no significant permeability to helium flow under normal operating conditions. Purge <b>bag</b> small <b>scale</b> manufacturing tests were conducted to develop tooling and fabrication techniques for use in full <b>scale</b> <b>bag</b> manufacture. A purge bag material layup technique was developed whereby the two plys of epoxy fiberglass enclosed between skins of FEP Teflon are vacuum bag cured in an oven in a single operation. The material is cured on a tool with {{the shape of a}} purge bag half. Plastic tooling was selected for use in bag fabrication. A model purge bag 0. 6 m in diameter was fabricated and subjected to a series of structural and environmental tests simulating various flight type environments. Pressure cycling tests at high (450 K) and low (200 K) temperature as well as acoustic loading tests were performed. The purge bag concept proved to be structurally sound and was used for the full <b>scale</b> <b>bag</b> detailed design model...|$|R
40|$|ASD is {{characterized}} primarily by deficits {{in social and}} communicative skills, however recent studies show differences in motor skills as well when compared to typically developing children. Because of these differences, {{parents of children with}} ASD may portray different behaviors than parents of typically developing children.  This research aims to find how parents engage with their child (either with or without ASD) in distinctly different play settings; one that promotes social play and one that promotes gross motor function and physical activity). Parents were coded on five behaviors using an adapted parent-child interaction rating scale from EHS: 24 -month 3 <b>bag</b> <b>scales.</b> The behaviors coded were: parent encourages a stimulating environment, negativity, sensitivity, detachment, and intrusiveness, which were used while coding interactions in both settings. Results from this project indicated a difference in parental behaviors in a motor setting.   Parents of children with ASD were overall less encouraging of a stimulating environment (p=. 04) and less sensitive (p=. 01) in the motor setting. These results highlight the importance of educating parents regarding how to interact with children with ASD in a physical activity setting to increase engagement in physical activity for children with developmental disabilities considering the known differences in child behaviors in such a setting...|$|R

40|$|Shifts {{in plant}} species {{distributions}} {{due to global}} change are increasing the availability of novel resources {{in a variety of}} ecosystems worldwide. In semiarid riparian areas, hydric pioneer tree species are being replaced by drought-tolerant plant species as water availability decreases. Additionally, introduced omnivorous crayfish, which feed upon primary producers, allochthonous detritus, and benthic invertebrates, can impact communities at multiple levels through both direct and indirect effects mediated by drought-tolerant plants. We tested the impact of both virile crayfish (Orconectes virilis) and litter type on benthic invertebrates and the effect of crayfish on detrital resources across a gradient of riparian vegetation drought-tolerance using field cages with leaf litter bags in the San Pedro River in Southeastern Arizona. Virile crayfish increased breakdown rate of novel drought-tolerant saltcedar (Tamarix ramosissima), but did not impact breakdown of drought-tolerant seepwillow (Baccharis salicifolia) or hydric Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) and Gooding’s willow (Salix goodingii). Effects on invertebrate diversity were observed at the litter <b>bag</b> <b>scale,</b> but no effects were found at the cage scale. Crayfish decreased alpha diversity of colonizing macroinvertebrates, but did not affect beta diversity. In contrast, the drought-tolerant litter treatment decreased beta diversity relative to hydric litter. As drought-tolerant species become more abundant in riparian zones, their litter will become a larger component of the organic matter budget of desert streams which may serve to homogenize the litter-dwelling community and support elevated populations of virile crayfish.

40|$|Bagging and {{boosting}} are two popular ensemble {{methods that}} achieve better accuracy {{than a single}} classifier. These techniques have limitations on massive datasets, as {{the size of the}} dataset can be a bottleneck. Voting many classifiers built on small subsets of data ("pasting small votes") is a promising approach for learning from massive datasets. Pasting small votes can utilize the power of boosting and <b>bagging,</b> and potentially <b>scale</b> up to massive datasets. We propose a framework for building hundreds or thousands of such classifiers on small subsets of data in a distributed environment. Experiments show this approach is fast, accurate, and scalable to massive datasets...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} learning-based method for {{detecting}} carried objects that generates candidate image regions from protrusion, color contrast and occlusion boundary cues, {{and uses a}} classifier to filter out the regions unlikely to be carried objects. The method achieves higher accuracy than state of the art, which can only detect protrusions from the human shape, and the discriminative model it builds for the silhouette context-based region features generalizes well. To reduce annotation effort, we investigate training the model in a Multiple Instance Learning framework where the only available supervision is "walk" and "carry" labels associated with intervals of human tracks, i. e., the spatial extent of carried objects is not annotated. We present an extension to the miSVM algorithm that uses knowledge of the fraction of positive instances in positive <b>bags</b> and that <b>scales</b> to training sets {{of hundreds of thousands}} of instances...|$|R
40|$|Graffiti are {{abundant}} in most urban neighborhoods and {{are considered a}} nuisance and an eyesore. Yet, law enforcement agencies have {{found them to be}} useful for understanding gang activities, and uncovering the extent of a gang’s territory in large metropolitan areas. The current method for matching and retrieving graffiti is based on a manual database search that is not only inaccurate but also time consuming. We present a contentbased image retrieval (CBIR) system for automatic matching and retrieval of graffiti images. Our system represents each graffiti image by a <b>bag</b> of SIFT (<b>Scale</b> Invariant Feature Transform) features. The similarity between a query image and a graffiti image in the database is computed {{based on the number of}} matched SIFT features between the two images under certain geometric constraints. Experimental results on two graffiti databases with thousands of graffiti images show encouraging results. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} paper we study the {{equation}} of state of strange matter build of the u,d,s quarks {{in the framework of}} the MIT <b>bag</b> model. The <b>scaling</b> relations with <b>bag</b> constant are discussed and applied to the determination of maximum frequency of a particle in stable circular orbit around strange star. The highest QPO frequency of 1. 33 kHz observed so far is consistent with the strange stars models for which the maximum QPO frequency is 1. 7 – 2. 4 kHz depending on the strange quark mass and the QCD coupling constant. The linear approximation of the equation of state is found and the parameters of this EOS are determined as a functions of strange quark mass, QCD coupling constant and bag constant. This approximation reproduces exact results within an error of the order of 1 % and can be used for the complete study of the properties of strange stars including microscopic stability of strange matter and determination of the total baryon number of the star. Key words: dense matter – equation of state – stars: neutron 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the illegal trade in live pangolins, their meat, and their scales in the Special Development Zone of Mong La, Shan State, Myanmar, {{on the border with}} China, and present an {{analysis}} of the role of Myanmar in the trade of pangolins into China. Mong La caters exclusively for the Chinese market and is best described as a Chinese enclave in Myanmar. We surveyed the morning market, wildlife trophy shops and wild meat restaurants during four visits in 2006, 2009, 2013 – 2014, and 2015. We observed 42 <b>bags</b> of <b>scales,</b> 32 whole skins, 16 foetuses or pangolin parts in wine, and 27 whole pangolins for sale. Our observations suggest Mong La has emerged as a significant hub of the pangolin trade. The origin of the pangolins is unclear but it seems to comprise a mixture of pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries, and potentially African countries. Myanmar, {{on the basis of its}} geographic position, size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country for the smuggling of pangolins to China. Data from 29 seizures from Myanmar and 23 from neighbouring countries (Thailand, India, China) implicating Myanmar as a source of pangolins or as a transit point for pangolins sourced in other countries, in the period 2010 – 2014, illustrate the magnitude of this trade. Combined these seizures amount to 4339 kg of scales and 518 whole pangolins, with a retail value in Myanmar of US$ 3. 09 million. Trade in pangolins, their parts of their derivatives is illegal in Myanmar and CITES II listing with a zero-quota preclude international trade in them. We urge the Myanmar government to liaise with regional authorities to curb the trade in pangolins and recommend that the Myanmar and Chinese CITES authorities in particular come together urgently as to resolve the illicit trade of pangolins and their parts across their borders...|$|R
40|$|The {{acquisition}} {{and use of}} biomass fuels for heating and cooking presents a ubiquitous problem {{for the majority of}} people on three continents. Inefficient cooking and heating practices (wood burns at 5 – 8 % efficiency and cow dung at 3 – 5 %) not only pollute the home but deplete biomass resources and require increasing amounts of time and energy for fuel acquisition. These factors challenge the sustainability of local and global environments as well as the health and economic prosperity of vast numbers of people in the developing world. In response to these issues, Fort Lewis College students and faculty received a phase I, EPA P 3 grant which was used to design and build two biogas digester prototypes. Working with faculty, students also designed a low cost cook stove capable of burning the biogas produced, and evaluated biogas slurry application as an appropriate and effective soil fertility amendment. Phase I prototype digesters demonstrated the feasibility of biogas generation, using simple materials such as trash cans, oil drums, and polyethylene <b>bags.</b> A full <b>scale</b> digester, based on prototype biogas production volumes, would range from 5000 to 9000 liters, depending on the design implemented (fixed drum or polybag). This digester volume is projected to meet the cooking needs of a typical Ecuadorian family of six, 2 m 3 gas /day. In addition to producing methane gas for cooking and heating, the system produces significant quantities of bio-digested manure. The bio-digested manure was applied as a fertilizer to potatoes and a newly established grass pasture mixture. Potato shoot dry weight at harvest was 132 % and 131 % of control dry weight for low and high applications of bio-digested manure, respectively. There was a 51 % difference and 80 % difference in dry weight yield from control between low and high applications of bio-digested manure for pasture grasses. Biogas utilization for cooking, and for the production of anaerobically digested manure is a unique and realizable opportunity for a vast number of people and communities in both the developing and developed world. Positive impacts are possible in terms of quality of life (reduced time for fuel collection, reduced fuel costs, and improved sanitation, increased crop yields), improved health (reduced indoor smoke from clean burning biogas), economic savings and/or earnings (eliminates need for purchasing traditional fertilizers and creates an opportunity to sell excess manure generated by digesters), and environmental responsibility (utilizes renewable resource and enhances soil fertility) ...|$|R
