5|$|With {{the onset}} of the recession, the UK {{government}} lead calls to stimulate aggregate demand. Throughout 2008, a number of fiscal measuresincluding a £145 tax cut for <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> (below £34,800 pa earnings) tax payers, a temporary 2.5% cut in Value Added Tax (VAT), £3billion worth of spending brought forward from 2010 and a £20billion Small Enterprise Loan Guarantee Schemewere introduced. The cost of these measures, most of which were announced in the November 2008 Pre-Budget Report, was about £20billion excluding counting loan guarantees. Further measures worth £5billionincluding training for the young unemployed and a car scrappage scheme which offered a £2,000 subsidy for the purchase of a new car in exchange for the scrapping of a car more than 10 years oldwere announced in the 2009 budget.|$|E

25|$|Despite departing under a cloud, Lamont {{defends his}} budget record to this day. The 1991 budget, {{in which he}} seized the {{opportunity}} presented by Thatcher's resignation to restrict mortgage interest tax relief to the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> of income tax and also cut the rate of corporation tax by two percentage points, was greeted by positive coverage in The Economist which dubbed him a Nimble Novice. In the 1992 budget his proposal to advance to a 20% <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> of income tax {{through a combination of}} a narrow initial band, a cut in tax on deposit interest and curtailment of tax allowances was hailed as an elegant way of combining populism with progressivism, though events were later to lend support to Nigel Lawson's view that this approach was strategically inept. His final budget in 1993 was more sympathetically received by financial specialists than John Major's 1990 budget or Kenneth Clarke's budget of November 1993. Lamont attributes the large public sector borrowing requirement (i.e. fiscal deficit) of these years to the depth of the recession triggered by his inability to cut interest rates sooner within the ERM.|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of the energy-corrected sudden (ECS) formalism for line shape calculations is investigated, using coupled states calculation for CO 2 –Ar collisions on the recently developed “single repulsion” potential of Hutson et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 107, 1824 (1997); 105, 9130 (1996) ]. Inelastic cross sections σ 0 (L→ 0,E) ≡Q′L(E) are calculated using the MOLSCAT program, and then averaged over Maxwell–Boltzmann kinetic energy distributions to give the thermally averaged “basic rates” Q′L(T) needed in the ECS formalism. The ECS linewidths for low initial J, Ji⩽ 16, are sensitive only to the low-L <b>basic</b> <b>rates,</b> for which the CS calculations are converged; comparing them with directly calculated CS linewidths thus gives a stringent test of the ECS model, and it works well (within 10 %). However, for higher Ji lines and for band shape calculations, <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> for higher L are needed for convergence. These are obtained by an extrapolation procedure based on experimental data, using an exponential power law and the adiabaticity factor recently suggested by Bonamy et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 95, 3361 (1991) ] ECS calculations using the resulting <b>basic</b> <b>rates</b> are designated “extrapolated CS-ECS calculations,” and are found to give accurate results for high-Jlinewidths, for near-wing absorption and for band profiles over a very wide range of perturber pressures (up to 1000 atm) ...|$|R

When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%. An additional income tax of 4.3% is levied on all employees under the country's social security programme. This rate is higher for the self-employed, up {{to a maximum of}} 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total.

25|$|Despite the {{negative}} press over Kennedy's departure, the leaderless party won the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election over Labour in February 2006. This result {{was viewed as}} a particular blow for Gordon Brown, who lives in the constituency, represented the adjacent seat and featured in Labour's campaign. The party also came second place by 633 votes in the Bromley and Chislehurst by-election, threatening the safe Conservative seat and pushing Labour into fourth place behind the UK Independence Party. In July 2007, Sir Menzies announced that the party wished to cut the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> of income tax from 20 to 16p per pound—the lowest rate since 1916—and wanted to finance the cut using green taxes and other revenues, including making gains from UK properties owned by non-UK residents eligible for capital gains tax.|$|E

A further poll published 27 April 2007, shows Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats at 34% and 3% respectively compared to Fine Gael and Labour at 31% and 10%. A promise by the Labour Party, at their February 2007 party conference of {{a cut in}} the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> of income tax, paid by 80% of workers, from 20% to 18% created some excitement in political and media circles. Income tax cuts by the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats government had concentrated on the top rate of tax and Labour were able to portray their proposal as progressive to the discomfiture of Fianna Fáil.|$|E
500|$|In the 1997 {{election}} and subsequently, Brown pledged not {{to increase the}} basic or higher rates of income tax. Over his Chancellorship, he reduced the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> from 23% to 20%. However, in all but his final budget, Brown increased the tax thresholds in line with inflation, rather than earnings, resulting in fiscal drag. Corporation tax fell under Brown, from a main rate of 33% to 28%, and from 24% to 19% for small businesses. In 1999, he introduced a lower tax band of 10%. He abolished this 10% tax band in his last budget in 2007 to reduce the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> from 22% to 20%, increasing tax for 5 million people and, according to the calculations of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, leaving those earning between £5,000 and £18,000 as the biggest losers. To backbench cheers, Brown had described the measure in his last Budget thus: [...] "Having put in place more focused ways of incentivising work and directly supporting children and pensioners {{at a cost of}} £3bn a year, I can now return income tax to just two rates by removing the 10p band on non savings income".|$|E

500|$|With the {{discontinuance}} of the two-cent {{piece and}} three-cent silver in 1873, the cent and the three-cent nickel were the sole {{survivors of the}} coins valued at less than five cents. [...] The three-cent nickel, by this time, was unpopular because of its odd denomination and (with the return of silver coinage) its similarity in size to the dime. [...] A three-cent postage rate {{had been one of}} the reasons why that denomination had begun, in the 1850s; in the early 1880s the Post Office decreased the <b>basic</b> <b>rate</b> for letters to two cents. [...] This change both increased demand for cents, and decreased the demand for the three-cent nickel, which was abolished in 1890. In most years of the 1880s, there were large issues of Indian Head cents. The exception was in the mid-1880s, when poor economic times led to less demand for minor coins. No cents or five-cent nickels were minted after February 1885 until near the end of 1886. Production of undated dies into which the year of issue could be punched did continue, and during the hiatus in coin production, Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber modified the design, removing light outlines between the lettering on the obverse and the rest of the design, and making other changes. [...] This led to two types for the 1886 Indian Head cent, which may be distinguished: on the Type I, the lowest feather on the obverse points between the I and the C in [...] "AMERICA", while on the Type II it points between the C and the final A. Snow estimates that 14 million of the mintage of 17,654,290 were Type I, as were a majority of the 4,290 proof strikings.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn a man-machine system, {{equipment}} reliability and human reliability {{are affected by}} many {{factors such as the}} environment in which equipment is operated and psychological stress imposed on a human operator. In the probabilistic method of reliability analysis the <b>basic</b> failure <b>rate</b> and the <b>basic</b> error <b>rate</b> are modified by experts to consider the influence of these factors on reliability. However, these influences are not easily expressed quantitatively, because the relation between {{equipment reliability}} or human reliability and each of these factors is not clear. In this paper the relation is expressed qualitatively. Furthermore, equipment reliability and human reliability are represented by failure possibility and error possibility, respectively, which are fuzzy sets on the interval [0, 1]. A method is presented to derive failure possibility and error possibility from subjective estimates of not only the <b>basic</b> failure <b>rate</b> or the <b>basic</b> error <b>rate</b> but also each factor that affects reliability. Fuzzy reasoning is used in this method. An example is given of reliability analysis of a man-machine system using failure possibility and error possibility obtained by this method...|$|R

To this wage, a legionary on active campaign would hope to add the booty of war, from the bodies of their enemies and as plunder from enemy settlements.
