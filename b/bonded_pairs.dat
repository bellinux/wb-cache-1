5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs.</b> Smaller groups can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between lone <b>pairs</b> and <b>bonding</b> <b>pairs</b> {{may also be}} used to rationalize deviations from idealized geometries. For example, the H2O molecule has four electron pairs in its valence shell: two lone <b>pairs</b> and two <b>bond</b> <b>pairs.</b> The four electron pairs are spread so as to point roughly towards the apices of a tetrahedron. However, the bond angle between the two O-H bonds is only 104.5°, rather than the 109.5° of a regular tetrahedron, because the two lone pairs (whose density or probability envelopes lie closer to the oxygen nucleus) exert a greater mutual repulsion than the two <b>bond</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} glass-forming ability (GFA), the Zr 48 Cu 36 Al 8 Ag 8 bulk {{metallic glass}} (BMG) {{is of great}} importance in glass transition investigations and new materials development. However, {{due to the lack}} of detailed structural information, the local structure and atomic packing of this alloy is still unknown. In this work, synchrotron measurement and reverse Monte Carlo simulation are performed on the atomic configuration of a Zr-based bulk metallic glass. The local structure is characterized in terms of <b>bond</b> <b>pairs</b> and Voronoi tessellation. It is found that there are mainly two types of <b>bond</b> <b>pairs</b> in the configuration, as the body-centered cubic (bcc) -type and icosahedral (ico) -type <b>bond</b> <b>pairs.</b> On the other hand, the main polyhedra in the configuration are icosahedra and the bcc structure. That is, the bcc-type <b>bond</b> <b>pairs,</b> together with the ico-type <b>bond</b> <b>pairs,</b> form the bcc polyhedra, introducing the distortion in bcc clusters in short range. However, in the medium range, the atoms formed linear or planar structures, other than the tridimensional clusters. That is, the medium-range order in glass is of 1 D or 2 D structure, suggesting the imperfect ordered packing feature...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} {{serially}} monogamous, forming <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> {{for one or}} more breeding seasons. The male is territorial and may use the same nesting territory for up to seven years. The female lays about four to seven eggs, generally in April. They are incubated for four weeks, starting when the third egg is laid. They hatch nearly simultaneously and the female remains with them for nine to ten days, being fed by the male.|$|E
50|$|The pygmy tarsier {{is found}} in stable <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs,</b> {{remaining}} together for up to 15 months. This stable pair bond is usually monogamous. The species has two breeding seasons, one {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season and the other at the end, separated by about 6 months. Gestation lasts 178 days on average, and births occur in May and from November to December. Infants are quite precocial, and develop quickly, similar to other juveniles in the genus. The offspring begin capturing their own prey around 42 days of age, and travel in groups after only 23 days. Young females remain with parents until adulthood, while young males leave the natal group as juveniles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> {{are used}} to obtain maximum {{bandwidth}} from the CO to the pedestal (DP). The Convergence Node, which is environmentally hardened and powered via the copper wire from the CO, terminates the bonded signals and acts as the gateway node for the subscriber ‘collector’ ring. DSL Rings technology {{is based on the}} Resilient Packet Rings (RPR) protocol. The technology enables a fail-safe in that, if a single pair is cut, the traffic goes in the opposite direction around the ring to get to the network gateway node. RPR also provides built in Quality of Service (QoS) for traffic differentiation and managed services as well as an Efficient Multicast (EM) capability that significantly reduces overall ring bandwidth requirements for multicast/broadcast video.|$|E
50|$|Humans can {{experience}} {{some or all}} of the above-mentioned varieties of <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> in their lifetime. These bonds can be: temporary or last a lifetime, same-sex or cross-gender, and same age or with different age groups. In a biological sense there are two main types of <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> exhibited in humans: social <b>pair</b> <b>bonding</b> and sexual <b>pair</b> <b>bonding.</b> The social <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> is a strong behavioral and psychological relationship between two individuals that is measurably different in physiological and emotional terms from general friendships or other acquaintance relationships. On the other hand, the sexual <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> is a behavioral and physiological bond between two individuals with a strong sexual attraction component. In this bond the participants in the sexual <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> prefer to have sex with each other over other options. Social <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> are usually more wide-ranging than their sexual counterparts due to the sexual nature involved in the latter. In humans and other mammals, these <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> are created by a combination of social interaction and biological factors including neurotransmitters like oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine.|$|R

50|$|Many {{transition}} metal compounds have unusual geometries, {{which can be}} ascribed to ligand bonding interaction with the d subshell and to absence of valence shell lone pairs. Gillespie suggested that this interaction can be weak or strong. Weak interaction is dealt with by the Kepert model, while strong interaction produces <b>bonding</b> <b>pairs</b> that also occupy the respective antipodal points of the sphere. This is similar to predictions based on sd hybrid orbitals using the VALBOND theory. The repulsion of these bidirectional <b>bonding</b> <b>pairs</b> leads to a different prediction of shapes.|$|R

50|$|Juveniles reach sexual {{maturity}} in 3-4 years. As {{part of the}} courtship behavior, the male ruffles his feathers, spreads his tail feathers, extends his wings, and erects his crest. He then bounces about. Initially, the female ignores or avoids him, but - provided he meets her approval - will eventually allow him to approach her. If his efforts are successful and he is accepted, the pair will be seen preening each other's head and scratching each other around the tail. These actions serve to strengthen their pair bond. Eventually, the male mounts the female and performs the actual act of mating by joining of the cloacae. For <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs,</b> this mating ritual is much shorter and the female may even approach the male. Once they are ready for nesting, breeding pairs separate from their groups and search for a suitable nest cavity (usually in trees).|$|E

50|$|The pairs often {{exhibit a}} {{negative}} polar character with their high charge density and are located {{closer to the}} atomic nucleus on average compared to the <b>bonding</b> <b>pair</b> of electrons. The presence of a lone <b>pair</b> decreases the <b>bond</b> angle between the <b>bonding</b> <b>pair</b> of electrons, due to their high electric charge which causes great repulsion between the electrons. They are also used {{in the formation of}} a dative bond. For example, the creation of the hydronium (H3O+) ion occurs when acids are dissolved in water and is due to the oxygen atom donating a lone pair to the hydrogen ion.|$|R
40|$|T he {{dramatic}} {{differences between}} the properties of molecules formed from the latep-block elements of the first row of the periodic table (NF) {{and those of the}} corresponding elements in subsequent rows is well recognized as the first row anomaly. Certain properties of the atoms, such as the relative energies and spatial extents of the ns and np orbitals, can explain some of these differences, but not others. In this Account, we summarize the results of our recent computational studies of the halides of the late p-block elements. Our studies point to a single underlying cause for many of these differences: the ability of the late p-block elements in the second and subsequent rows of the periodic table to form recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> and recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> dyads with very electronegative ligands. Recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> form when an electron in a singly occupied ligand orbital recouples the pair of electrons in a doubly occupied lone pair orbital on the central atom, leading to a central atom-ligand <b>bond.</b> Recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> dyads occur when a second ligand forms a bond with the orbital left over from the initial recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bond.</b> Recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bonds</b> and recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bond</b> dyads enable the late p-block elements to form remarkably stable hypervalent compounds such as PF 5 and SF 6 and lead to unexpected excited states in smaller halides of the late p-block elements such as SF and SF 2. Recoupled <b>pair</b> <b>bonding</b> also causes the Fn 1 XF bond energies to oscillate dramaticall...|$|R

5000|$|Currently only 3 {{species are}} recognised, all endemic to Australia. The beetles form <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> and occupy {{permanent}} nests under the rainforest floor during their lifespan {{of only one}} year. The scarcity of dung in their habitat appears to have driven members of this genus to improvise a dung substitute from available materials. The male collects leaves and other plant material which is shredded by the female, turned into dung-like material and then shaped into small brood-balls housing the larvae. During the larval growth period the parents regularly add food to the brood-balls, behaviour previously unrecorded for dung beetles. The larvae also produce audible stridulation by rubbing {{the tip of the}} abdomen against the underside of the head - this is taken to be communication between larva and adult. The nests of Cephalodesmius are also inhabited by some 8 other insect species and mites - Macrocheles tenuirostris, Hunteracarus womersleyi, Histiostoma sp., Caloglyphus sp., Sinella sp., Anotylus sp. nov., Oxytellus sp. and Leptocera myrmecophila - these are in a variety of relationships with the beetles.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Twelve kiwis were radio-tagged and tracked for 12 - 78 {{weeks in}} two sites in Hawke's Bay. Four <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> had ranges of 19. 1 to 42. 3 ha (estimated by the convex polygon method), which were {{apparently}} defended against other kiwis. Two unmated females had ranges of 48. 0 and 43. 1 ha. Another unmated female occupied a narrow, circular strip, 5. 4 km long, covering about 26 ha. The ranges of four kiwis in scrubland and eight in climax beech/podocarp forest {{were similar in}} size. Kiwis roosted on 36 % of days in burrows which they excavated themselves. On other days they roosted in natural subterranean tunnels, or in hollows under fallen trees, thick vegetation, or inside logs. Generally they roosted {{in a different place}} each day but often returned to sites they had used previously. Members of <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> roosted apart on 92 % of days, in different parts of their range. In terms of current understanding of population genetics, reserves for kiwis in Hawke's Bay probably need to be at least 7500 ha in order to support a genetically enduring population of 250 breeding pairs.

40|$|In humans, the {{distribution}} of yawn contagion is shaped by social closeness with strongly <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs</b> showing higher levels of contagion than weakly <b>bonded</b> <b>pairs.</b> This ethological finding led the authors to hypothesize that the phenomenon of yawn contagion {{may be the result}} of certain empathic abilities, although in their most basal form. Here, for the first time, we show the capacity of bonobos (Pan paniscus) to respond to yawns of conspecifics. Bonobos spontaneously yawned more frequently during resting/relaxing compared to social tension periods. The results show that yawn contagion was context independent suggesting that the probability of yawning after observing others ’ yawns is not affected by the propensity to engage in spontaneous yawns. As it occurs in humans, in bonobos the yawing response mostly occurred within the first minute after the perception of the stimulus. Finally, via a Linear Mixed Model we tested the effect of different variables (e. g., sex, rank, relationship quality) on yawn contagion, which increased when subjects were strongly bonded and when the triggering subject was a female. The importance of social bonding in shaping yawn contagion in bonobos, as it occurs in humans, is consistent with the hypothesis that empathy may play a role in the modulation of this phenomenon in both species. The higher frequency of yawn contagion in presence of a female as a triggering subject supports the hypothesis that adult females not only represent the relational and decisional nucleus of the bonobo society, but also that they play a key role in affecting the emotional states of others...|$|E

40|$|The {{emotional}} investment {{required to}} construct a caring doctor-patient relationship can be justified on humane grounds. Can it also be justified as a direct physiologic intervention?

Furthermore, the experience of feeling cared about in a relationship reduces the secretion of stress hormones and shifts the neuroendocrine system toward homeostasis.
