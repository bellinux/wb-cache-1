5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> and may be used by women with previous <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> in their veins. In those with a history of arterial <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E
5|$|Prostaglandins, local hormones {{produced}} in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the hypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes {{are responsible for the}} aggregation of platelets that form <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> Heart attacks are caused primarily by <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{are associated}} with a slightly increased risk of venous and arterial <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> Venous clots, on average, increase from 2.8 to 9.8 per 10,000 women years which is still less than that associated with pregnancy. Due to this risk, they are not recommended in women over 35years of age who continue to smoke. Due to the increased risk they are included in decision tools such as the DASH score and PERC rule used to predict the risk of <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b>|$|E
50|$|Vince Gordon died August 4, 2016 of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot.</b> He had {{his first}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> {{at the age of}} 42 due to at special {{inherited}} disease. The <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> was followed by heart attracts. Due to his health problems he had to stop getting on tours.|$|R
50|$|A venous {{thrombus}} is a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> (thrombus) {{that forms}} within a vein. Thrombosis {{is a term}} for a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> occurring inside a blood vessel. A common type of venous thrombosis is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in the deep veins of the leg. If the thrombus breaks off (embolizes) and flows towards the lungs, it can become a pulmonary embolism (PE), a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in the lungs.|$|R
40|$|Respiratory tract {{obstruction}} {{due to a}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> {{may result}} in life threatening ventilatory impairment. Ball valve <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> obstructions of the airways are rare. A ball valve <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> acts as a one-way valve, allowing (near) normal air entry into the airways, but (completely) blocking expiration. In a near fatal case of obstruction of the airways by a ball valve <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> we performed 'whole tube suction' to resolve the airway proble...|$|R
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} {{can lead}} to death {{as a result of}} a number of complications: severe infections, <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> and cardiac arrest likely due to autonomic neuropathy. Despite optimum care this occurs in about 5% of cases.|$|E

5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of infection is crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form <b>blood</b> <b>clots).</b>|$|E
50|$|Darexaban and darexaban glucuronide {{selectively}} and competitively inhibit FXa, suppressing prothrombin {{activity at}} the sites of <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> (thrombus) formation. This leads to a decrease in <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation in a dose dependent manner. Reducing <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation will decrease blood flow blockages, thus possibly lowering the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, venous thrombosis, and ischemic stroke.|$|R
50|$|NSAIDs cause {{decreased}} {{ability to}} form a <b>blood</b> <b>clot,</b> which can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding when combined with other drugs that also decrease <b>blood</b> <b>clotting,</b> such as warfarin.|$|R
40|$|C-refctive protein prolongs blood {{coagulation}} time in phospholipids-dependent coagulation tests. O. P. Bliznukov, L. D. Kostin, A. J. Martinov, T. A. Lisitsina, T. M. Reshetnyak, V. J. Lauga Objective. To study {{influence of}} different CRP forms on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time in standard phospholipid clotting tests. Material and methods. Purified native CRP. monomeric CRP (0 - 1. 6 M), immune complexes of native CRP and rabbit polyclonal anti-CRP antibodies (1. 6 M) {{were added to}} blood plasma of healthy donors. <b>Blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time was registered using optical coagulometer. Phospholipid dependent prothrombin time (PT), activated partial tromboplastin time (APTT), kaolin clotting time (KCT) with kaolin and ellagic acid, dilute Russel viper venom time (dRVVT) were determined. Results. Native CRP was able to increase <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time in all mentioned clotting tests, excluding prothrombin time. CRP influence on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time showed a concentration dependence. Polyclonal rabbit anti-CRP antibodies had no inhibitory effect on CRP prolonged <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time. Monomeric CRP (0 - 1. 6 M) had no influence on <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> time in all phospholipid-dependent clotting tests...|$|R
5|$|Trousseau's syndrome, {{in which}} <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> form spontaneously in the portal blood vessels, the deep veins of the extremities, or the {{superficial}} veins {{anywhere on the}} body, {{may be associated with}} pancreatic cancer, and is found in about 10% of cases.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} {{decrease}} the tendency for thrombosis or as secondary prophylaxis (prevention of further episodes) in those individuals who have already formed a blood clot (thrombus). Warfarin treatment can help prevent formation of future <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> and help {{reduce the risk of}} embolism (migration of a thrombus to a spot where it blocks blood supply to a vital organ).|$|E
50|$|The haemostatic (<b>blood</b> <b>clotting)</b> system {{involves}} {{the interaction of}} proteins in the blood, the blood vessel wall and {{the flow of blood}} to control bleeding and <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> Developmental Haemostasis is a term that represents the maturation of the haemostatic system from birth to adulthood. There are differences in the concentration, structure and activity of many proteins involved in <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> These changes {{play an important role in}} physiological development and are important in providing appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bleeding and clotting disorders (e.g. thrombosis). The age-specific differences in the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> system may contribute to the fact that children are less prone to developing thrombosis compared to adults.|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Russell Doolittle, {{on whose}} work Behe based {{much of the}} blood-clotting {{discussion}} in Darwin's Black Box, wrote a rebuttal to the statements about irreducible complexity of certain systems. In particular, Doolittle mentioned {{the issue of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> in his article, [...] "A Delicate Balance." [...] Later on, in 2003, Doolittle's lab published a paper in the peer-reviewed journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences which demonstrates that the pufferfish lacks at least three out of 26 <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> factors, yet still has a workable <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> system. According to Doolittle, this defeats a key claim in Behe's book, that <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is irreducibly complex.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{surgical}} risks or complications for this procedure are: perforation involving small bowel, duodenum, or stomach causing a leak, infection, abscess, {{deep vein thrombosis}} (<b>blood</b> <b>clot),</b> and pulmonary emboli (<b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> traveling to the lungs).|$|R
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|Birth {{control is}} another consideration: women with SCI {{are usually not}} {{prescribed}} oral contraceptives since the hormones in them {{increase the risk of}} <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> for which people with SCI are already at elevated risk. Intrauterine devices could have dangerous complications that could go undetected if sensation is reduced. Diaphrams that require something to be inserted into the vagina are not usable by people with poor hand function. An option of choice for women is for partners to use condoms.|$|E
5|$|Once {{dissection}} has occurred, two mechanisms {{contribute to}} the development of stroke symptoms. Firstly, the flow through the blood vessel may be disrupted due to the accumulation of blood under the vessel wall, leading to ischemia (insufficient blood supply). Secondly, irregularities in the vessel wall and turbulence increase the risk of thrombosis (the formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots)</b> and embolism (migration) of these clots of the brain. From various lines of evidence, it appears that thrombosis and embolism is the predominant problem.|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} in bone healing is forming a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> at injured bones. During bone implantation, {{biomaterials}} unavoidably come into direct contact with blood, leading to a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation on its surface prior to bone regeneration. Despite both situations being similar in forming a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> at the defect site, most research in bone tissue engineering virtually ignores {{the important role of}} a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> in supporting healing. Dental implantology has long demonstrated that the fibrin structure and cellular content of a peri-implant clot can greatly affect osteoconduction and de novo bone formation on implant surfaces. This paper reviews the formation of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> during bone healing in related to the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gels. It is implicated that PRP gels are dramatically altered from a normal clot in healing, resulting conflicting effect on bone regeneration. These results indicate that the effect of clots on bone regeneration depends on how the clots are formed. Factors that influence <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> structure and properties in related to bone healing are also highlighted. Such knowledge is essential for developing strategies to optimally control <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation, which ultimately alter the healing microenvironment of bone. Of particular interest are modification of surface chemistry of biomaterials, which displays functional groups at varied composition for the purpose of tailoring blood coagulation activation, resultant clot fibrin architecture, rigidity, susceptibility to lysis, and growth factor release. This opens new scope of in situ <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> modification as a promising approach in accelerating and controlling bone regeneration...|$|R
25|$|The {{underlying}} {{scientific basis}} for <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and hemostasis {{is discussed in}} detail in the articles, Coagulation, hemostasis and related articles. The discussion here {{is limited to the}} common practical aspects of <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation which manifest as bleeding.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is {{a precise}} cascade {{engineered}} {{to form a}} clot with temporal and spatial control. Current control of <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> is achieved predominantly by anticoagulants and thus inherently one-sided. Here we use a pair of nanorods (NRs) to provide a two-way switch for the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> cascade by utilizing their ability to selectively release species on their surface under two different laser excitations. We selectively trigger release of a thrombin binding aptamer from one nanorod, inhibiting <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> and resulting in increased clotting time. We then release the complementary DNA as an antidote from the other NR, reversing {{the effect of the}} aptamer and restoring <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> Thus, the nanorod pair acts as an on/off switch. One challenge for nanobiotechnology is the bio-nano interface, where coronas of weakly adsorbed proteins can obscure biomolecular function. We exploit these adsorbed proteins to increase aptamer and antidote loading on the nanorods. National Science Foundation (U. S.) (Grant DMR # 0906838...|$|R
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (<b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep vein thrombosis in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and antiplatelet drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves <b>blood</b> <b>clots)</b> may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to valve {{replacement}} with mechanical prostheses inhibition of the <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> system (anticoagulation) {{is not necessary}} after aortic valve repair. Blood thinning may only be necessary if atrial fibrillation occurs or persists {{in order to prevent}} <b>blood</b> <b>clot</b> formation in the left atrium.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} the process of <b>blood</b> <b>clotting.</b> The loop is {{initiated}} when injured tissue releases signal chemicals that activate platelets in the blood. An activated platelet releases chemicals to activate more platelets, causing a rapid cascade and the formation of a <b>blood</b> <b>clot.</b>|$|R
5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term to help prevent heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and <b>blood</b> <b>clots,</b> in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E
5|$|Heparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{the development}} of thrombocytopenia (a low platelet count), due to the administration of various forms of heparin, an anticoagulant. HIT predisposes to thrombosis (the abnormal formation of <b>blood</b> <b>clots</b> inside a blood vessel) because platelets release microparticles that activate thrombin, thereby leading to thrombosis. When thrombosis is identified the condition is called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (HITT). HIT is caused by the formation of abnormal antibodies that activate platelets. If someone receiving heparin develops new or worsening thrombosis, or if the platelet count falls, HIT can be confirmed with specific blood tests.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is enzymatic {{destruction}} of <b>blood</b> <b>clots.</b> This {{is achieved by}} the administration of a drug (such as urokinase or alteplase) that activates plasmin, an enzyme that occurs naturally {{in the body and}} digests clots when activated. Thrombolysis is an accepted treatment for heart attacks and stroke unrelated to dissection. In cervical artery dissection, only small case series are available. The thrombolytic drug is administered either intravenously or during cerebral angiography through a catheter directly into the affected artery. The data indicates that thrombolysis is safe, but its place in the treatment of VAD is uncertain.|$|E
