25|$|Scooter's uncle J.P. Grosse {{owns the}} theatre, and rents {{it to the}} Muppets, as Scooter is {{only too happy to}} remind Kermit. In a deleted scene from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, Kermit reveals that J.P. has died and left the theatre to the Muppets in his will. This would have taken place some time after 1996, as J.P. can be seen (and {{referred}} to as such by the head of the KMUP network) in episode 107 of Muppets Tonight, the 1990s reworking of The Muppet Show. The Muppet Theater is shown to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City as Rachel Bitterman plots to tear down the Muppet Theater and build a club. She is thwarted when Pepe the King Prawn manages to get the Muppet Theater to be made into a national landmark.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was {{released}} as a single, being an outtake from the band's previous release, Leave Home. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, {{as it was the}} initial wave of New York City's underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max's Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to hear these bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> that summer was to have some sense of what it might have been like to live in San Francisco in 1966 or '67, or in London when the Beatles and the [...] Stones first hit." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what pain I must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know my own mind, and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could never think otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E
500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> You guys need to do something different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I {{was trying to get}} that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, [...] "Originally {{we were supposed to be}} in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque." [...] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man3 and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads [...] "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" [...] though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{had played}} over 100 dates with Journey during 1983, {{serving as the}} opening act on their Frontiers Tour. During that time, he and Jim Vallance co-wrote [...] "Heaven", which was {{inspired}} by Journey's hit [...] "Faithfully". It was recorded at the Power Station in New York City on June 6 and 7, 1983. Halfway through the recording session, drummer Mickey Curry – who had warned Adams about his limited availability that day – {{announced that he had}} to leave since he had committed in advance to a Hall & Oates session. Since the recording session for [...] "Heaven" [...] was running behind schedule, Adams called Journey drummer Steve Smith, who happened to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City at the time and he filled Curry's drumming position. The song first appeared on the soundtrack to the 1983 film, A Night in Heaven, although it was not released as a single at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Nilsson's next album, Harry (1969), was {{his first}} to hit the charts, and also {{provided}} a Top 40 single with [...] "I Guess the Lord Must <b>Be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City" [...] (written as a contender for the theme to Midnight Cowboy), used in the Sophia Loren movie La Mortadella (1971) (US title: Lady Liberty). While the album still presented Nilsson as primarily a songwriter, his astute choice of cover material included, this time, a song by then-little-known composer Randy Newman, [...] "Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear". Nilsson {{was so impressed with}} Newman's talent that he devoted his entire next album to Newman compositions, with Newman himself playing piano behind Nilsson's multi-tracked vocals. The result, Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), was commercially disappointing but was named Record of the Year by Stereo Review magazine and provided momentum to Newman's career. The self-produced Nilsson Sings Newman also marked the end of his collaboration with RCA staff producer Rick Jarrard, who recounted in the Nilsson documentary that the partnership was terminated by a telegram from Nilsson, who abruptly informed Jarrard that he wanted to work with other producers, and the two never met or spoke again.|$|E
2500|$|Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love {{begins with}} Shinjiro Taiga departing from Tokyo to New York City. Shortly after {{arriving}} there, Shinjiro witnesses a bank robbery being foiled by Gemini Sunrise, a samurai cowgirl. Shinjiro is apprehended, but is vouched for by Kayama {{and led to}} the Little Lip Theater to meet Shinjiro's captain, Ratchet Altair, and the Star Division's commander, Michael Sunnyside. Taiga and Gemini meet each other in Midtown, and then head to a district known as [...] "The Village", where Shinjiro's apartment is based. Ratchet then introduces Shinjiro to Subaru Kujo, a Japanese musician. Shinjiro also encounters Cheiron Archer, a lawyer. Cheiron reveals that his uncle, Imperial Assault Force Commander Ichiro Ogami, was to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in place of Shinjiro. Just after Taiga finishes watching the musical Cleopatra, an emergency occurs. Shinjiro is assigned by Sunnyside to be an usher. While at Central Park, Shinjiro meets Diana Caprice, a local birdwatcher and doctor who helps Shinjiro acclimate himself with the city. Eventually, Shinjiro becomes a member of the Star Division. The New York Combat Revue engages demon forces near the Statue of Liberty led by Ranmaru, a recurring antagonist in the game. During the battle, Ratchet is wounded, forcing Shinjiro to assume command. After thwarting Ranmaru's invasion, Shinjiro becomes the New York Combat Revue's Captain-in-Training and Ratchet fills the role of Vice Commander.|$|E
2500|$|Birdman was {{edited by}} Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both {{worked with the}} {{director}} before on 21 Grams and Babel. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrone already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they {{had the ability to}} introduce cuts. Mirrone said that in Birdman Iñárritu had [...] "let go of that safety net". Because of this the editors needed {{to be involved in the}} project early on, and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrone was busy so unable to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.)</b> Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu [...] "dragged it out" [...] of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as [...] "pretty traditional". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.|$|E
