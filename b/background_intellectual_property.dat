The JSRA was based on NASA's Space Act Agreement Authority, which permitted flexible teaming, cost-sharing and intellectual property sharing to maximize collaboration for rapid technology development progress. The Federal contribution to ERAST was reported at $42.2 million while the private sector contribution was reported at $30,000 along with in-kind contributions of personnel, equipment and <b>background</b> <b>intellectual</b> <b>property.</b> The ERAST JSRA {{was one of}} three aeronautics partnership agreements designed by American Technology Alliances (AmTech).

This article reports a series of experiments revealing that these debates are actually orthogonal to how most users and many creators understand <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> law. The most common perception of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> among the American public is that <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> law is designed to prevent plagiarism.
