5|$|In July, {{the team}} {{reclassified}} Max Bielfeldt from a redshirt junior to a senior, which freed up Bielfeldt's scholarship for the Class of 2015, implying Bielfeldt would play his {{final year of}} eligibility elsewhere. In November, Beilein announced that the team would redshirt Andrew Dakich {{so that he could}} play a fifth year somewhere else. However, a pair of January <b>backcourt</b> injuries caused Dakich's services to be needed and he played instead of redshirting. D. J. Wilson missed most of the season due to a knee injury and was redshirted.|$|E

50|$|Bolstered by {{his strong}} showing his sophomore year, Williams opened the 2012-13 {{season with a}} handful of preseason accolades.

5|$|However, {{the trade}} proved highly {{beneficial}} for Robertson. After being stuck with an under-performing team the last six years, he now was paired with the young Lew Alcindor, who would years later become the all-time NBA scoring leader as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. With Alcindor in the low post and Robertson running the <b>backcourt,</b> the Bucks charged to a league-best 66–16 record, including a then-record 20-game win streak, a dominating 12–2 record in the playoffs, and crowned their season with the NBA title by sweeping the Baltimore Bullets 4–0 in the 1971 NBA Finals. For {{the first time in}} his career, Robertson had won an NBA championship.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Brunson was an All-Lake County {{honorable mention}} {{selection}} in 2012, as Stevenson finished {{the season with}} a 1711 record. During his sophomore season, Stevenson started the season 104 before going on a 19-game winning streak. That year, Brunson led Stevenson to the March 16, 2013 IHSA Class 4A championship game against Jabari Parker and Kendrick Nunn's three-time defending state champion Simeon Career Academy, where he got the Simeon <b>backcourt</b> in foul trouble in the first half before being held to one point {{in the second half of}} a 5840 loss. Stevenson finished the season 295. Following the season, the Associated Press named him to the Class 4A All-state second team as the only sophomore on the first or second team. Brunson averaged 21.5 points that season.|$|E
5|$|Robertson {{averaged}} a triple-double {{for his first}} five seasons in the NBA with the Royals, recording averages of 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, and 10.6 assists per game. From the 1964–65 season on, things began to turn sour for the franchise. Despite Robertson's stellar play, never failing to record averages of at least 24.7 points, 6.0 rebounds and 8.1 assists in the six following seasons, the Royals were eliminated {{in the first round}} from 1965 to 1967, then missed the playoffs from 1968 to 1970. In the 1969–70 season, the sixth disappointing season in a row, fan support was waning. To help attract the public, 41-year-old head coach Bob Cousy made a short comeback as a player. For seven games, the former Celtics point guard partnered with Robertson in the Royals' <b>backcourt,</b> but they missed the playoffs.|$|E
50|$|The Cleveland Cavaliers, {{being named}} {{as a serious}} {{championship}} contender, {{was said to be}} challenged by the Bulls. The reason was due to the Bulls' depth, defense, the addition of Gasol, and a healthy Rose. On October 1, Bleacher Report released an article stating that Rose and Butler were ranked number five {{as one of the best}} <b>backcourts</b> for the 2014-15 season.|$|R
50|$|On February 24, 2005, Davis {{was traded}} from the Hornets to the Golden State Warriors for guard Speedy Claxton and veteran forward Dale Davis after tension with the Hornets' {{coaching}} staff and several nagging injuries. The move created {{one of the}} more potent <b>backcourts</b> in the NBA with Davis and star guard Jason Richardson. It also saw Davis' return to California, where he had craved to return since his college days at UCLA.|$|R
2500|$|Despite the {{championship}} win in 1970, the Knicks {{wanted to make}} some major changes to their team after the glorious season they had the year before. They traded for star shooting guard Earl Monroe, someone who always gave Walt Frazier issues when defending him. Although not many people thought that he could fit in with Walt, he and Frazier soon become {{known as one of}} the best <b>backcourts</b> in the league, even earning the nickname “the Rolls Royce Backcourt.” ...|$|R
5|$|After Masai Ujiri {{was brought}} in as the new General Manager in 2013, he traded Bargnani to the New York Knicks. With a <b>backcourt</b> led by Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors {{returned}} to the playoffs, won their second Atlantic Division title, and won a then-franchise record 48 games in the 2013–14 season. However, they failed for a fourth consecutive time to advance beyond {{the first round of}} the playoffs. In the 2014–15 season, they won a then-franchise record 49 games, but failed for a second consecutive year to advance past {{the first round of the}} playoffs, getting swept by the Washington Wizards, 4–0. In the 2015–16 season, they won a franchise record 56 games, finishing in second place in the conference for the first time in franchise history. In the playoffs, they won their first playoff series since 2001 by defeating both the Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time against the Cleveland Cavaliers, only for the Raptors to lose to the eventual NBA champions in six games. In the 2016–17 season, the Raptors make the playoffs again, this time defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, but losing to the defending champions in the second round.|$|E
5|$|During the 1999 NBA draft, {{believing that}} the Raptors still lacked a strong frontcourt presence, Grunwald traded first-round draft pick Jonathan Bender for power forward Antonio Davis of the Indiana Pacers. Davis quickly entered the Raptors {{starting}} lineup and he would develop into an All-Star in the coming years. Conversely, Bender would only play nine seasons and {{would be out of}} the league by age 29. In the <b>backcourt,</b> Carter, Christie and Dell Curry played at the shooting guard position and Alvin Williams and Muggsy Bogues at point guard. The rotation of Davis, Oakley and Willis in the frontcourt and Carter's and McGrady's improvement helped the team make its first ever playoff appearance, fulfilling a promise Carter had made to fans in the previous season. Lacking significant post-season experience, Toronto was defeated 3–0 by the New York Knicks in the first round. Nonetheless, team improvements and the rise of Carter—who emphatically won the 2000 NBA Slam Dunk Contest—attracted many fans around Toronto, many of whom were previously not basketball fans. The season was also the first full year played at the Air Canada Centre, after having played four years at the cavernous SkyDome, which was better suited to baseball and Canadian football. Overall, the Raptors concluded the season with a 45–37 record.|$|E
5|$|He again {{participated in}} the NBA Summer League for the Nuggets in 2013. Prior to his second season, head coach Brian Shaw {{described}} Miller {{as if he has}} the potential to be comparable to Paul George. Once the season began, Miller's second year salary became fully guaranteed. On December 27, 2013, Miller scored a career-high 9 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. With Wilson Chandler suffering from a groin injury, Miller made his first NBA career start on January 9, 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder with Kevin Durant as his defensive assignment. The game was nationally televised. Miller matched his career high with 9 points, while Durant scored 30, but Denver won 10188. In his second start in the following game against Orlando on January 11, Miller achieved his first NBA double double with career highs of 16 points and 11 rebounds. Miller again served in the starting lineup on February 10 but this time in the <b>backcourt</b> when point guard Ty Lawson was injured and starting shooting guard Randy Foye shifted over to replace him. In late March, when Wilson Chandler missed several games, Miller moved into the starting lineup. On April 6, Miller, who was still starting in place of Chandler, scored a career-high 19 points in an overtime contest against Houston.|$|E
5000|$|Following the season, {{though he}} {{considered}} {{an offer to}} return to Houston, Cassell elected to re-sign with the Nets on a six-year contract. Forming one the league's most potent <b>backcourts</b> with Kerry Kittles, Cassell averaged 19.6 points, 8 assists and 1.6 steals in 34 minutes per game for the Nets that year, and helped lead them to the playoffs for their {{first time in four}} years. However they were swept by Michael Jordan and the Bulls in the first round.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, Monroe {{was traded}} to the New York Knicks and formed what was known as the [...] "Rolls Royce Backcourt" [...] with the equally {{flamboyant}} Walt Frazier. While there were initial questions as to whether Monroe and Frazier could coexist as teammates, the duo eventually meshed {{to become one of the}} most effective guard combinations of all time, leading the Knicks to the 1973 NBA championship. That pairing is one of few <b>backcourts</b> ever to feature two Hall of Famers and NBA 50th Anniversary Team members.|$|R
50|$|Pringle left about 100 works. Many {{are small}} scale oil on canvas, with {{subjects}} often including his family, friends, <b>backcourts</b> or local surroundings.

Wilson). In both cases he produced a range of sea or landscapes, often experimenting with painterly effects. Later he produced portraits (often miniatures) on commission, some of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.|$|R
5|$|In February of the 2009–10 season, James {{was forced}} into a {{temporary}} point guard role following a series of injuries to the Cavaliers' <b>backcourt.</b> Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with {{the best record in}} the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in the losing effort.|$|E
5|$|In the 1963–64 season, the Royals {{achieved}} a 55–25 record, which put them {{second place in}} the Eastern Division. Under new coach Jack McMahon, Robertson flourished, {{and for the first time}} in his career, he had a decent supporting cast: second scoring option Jack Twyman was now supplemented by Jerry Lucas and Wayne Embry, and fellow guard Adrian Smith helped Robertson in the <b>backcourt.</b> Robertson led the NBA in free-throw percentage, scored a career-high 31.4 points per game, and averaged 9.9 rebounds and 11.0 assists per game. The averages for his first five NBA seasons are a triple-double: 30.3 points, 10.4 rebounds and 10.6 assists per game. He won the NBA MVP award and became the only player other than Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain to win it from 1960 to 1968. Robertson also won his second All-Star Game MVP award that year after scoring 26 points, grabbing 14 rebounds, and dishing off 8 assists in an East victory. In the postseason, the Royals defeated the Philadelphia 76ers, but then were dominated by the Celtics 4 games to 1.|$|E
5|$|Michigan lost to Purdue on January 3, {{by making}} only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead.

On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA Tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of an ailing Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured College GameDay game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to a toe injury. Due to the <b>backcourt</b> injuries, Dakich burned his redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.|$|E

25|$|The Suns {{acquired}} Penny Hardaway {{from the}} Orlando Magic {{before the start}} of the 1999–00 season in hope of creating the best <b>backcourt</b> duo in the league. Combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the <b>BackCourt</b> 2000. Despite a decent 53–29 record, the Suns' season was spoiled by injuries to both of their superstars.

After high school, he attended the University of Rhode Island from 1993 to 1998 and redshirted his first year. At Rhode Island, he helped lead the Rams team to an Elite Eight appearance in the 1998 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament and graduated with a degree in communication studies. He was selected in the second round (41st overall) of the 1998 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. Mobley started at the shooting guard position, where he and Steve Francis formed one of the NBA's elite scoring <b>backcourts.</b> Mobley played with them for six seasons before being shipped to the Orlando Magic along with Steve Francis and Kelvin Cato for Tracy McGrady, Juwan Howard, Reece Gaines, and Tyronn Lue in the 2004 offseason. After playing 23 games with the Magic, though, he was traded to the Sacramento Kings, along with Michael Bradley for Doug Christie. Mobley ranked third in the league in three-point percentage during the 2004-2005 season. He signed a five-year US$42 million deal with the Clippers on July 14, 2005. [...] Besides being known for his three-point shooting, he also relies heavily on his post-up game. In addition, he also ran the Clutch City shootout contest in Houston during his Rockets years.

25|$|After a late-season {{implosion}} in 2009, {{head coach}} Mike Thibault {{had to make}} some crucial decisions for a team whose culture completely broke down last year. Connecticut started its rebuilding process quickly, acquiring DeMya Walker in the Monarchs' dispersal draft. The Sun then snagged the first overall pick in the 2010 collegiate draft in a trade with the Minnesota Lynx; a trade that would have the Sun's most recognizable face in starting point guard Lindsay Whalen, along with the second overall pick, shipped to Minneapolis. This package netted the Sun Montgomery, who {{would prove to be}} luxury in the deal. Thibault continued to reshape his roster after introducing Kara Lawson at a press conference as a new member of the Sun. Lawson was formerly a member of the Monarchs' team that decimated the Sun's chances of a WNBA title. Lawson, along with Montgomery, formed a <b>backcourt</b> that would be able to dictate pace and bolster the Sun's perimeter arsenal attack. The Sun also signed reserves Anete Jēkabsone-Žogota and Tan White to multiyear contracts to solidify the Sun's revamped <b>backcourt.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{a disappointing}} 1994 season, the Wildcats looked to recruit a pure sharp shooter to stretch {{opposing}} defenses and free up more {{room in the}} low post {{for the likes of}} Scott Fisher, James Crawford and Andrew Vlahov to operate in.

Joining Stewart in the <b>backcourt</b> was Ricky Grace and Aaron Trahair, while Martin Cattalini rounded out the eight-man rotation used by coach Adrian Hurley.|$|E
25|$|On {{the heels}} of their first playoff series win in nearly a decade, the Bulls entered the 2007–08 season with high expectations. Prior to the season, Gordon and Deng both turned down offers for {{contract}} extensions, believing they could earn more in free agency. Following a 9-16 start, Scott Skiles was fired and the Bulls did not recover. The Bulls drafted Derrick Rose with their first overall pick in 2008, raising questions about how Gordon and Rose could coexist in Chicago's <b>backcourt</b> (both were score-first guards).|$|E
25|$|Heading {{into the}} 2015–16 NBL season, the Breakers were without star guard Corey Webster, {{who was in}} the United States chasing an NBA contract. As a result, Ili, a {{designated}} development player, stepped into the <b>backcourt</b> rotation where hopes were high the 22-year-old could transform his aggression and athleticism into something effective at NBL level. Ili was given minutes on a regular basis for the Breakers {{towards the end of the}} season, including during the playoffs.

Having missed his first five 3-point shots of the game, Fisher spotted up and hit a pivotal three-pointer {{to tie the game}} at 87 with 4.6 seconds left. On the final possession of regulation, Mickaël Piétrus missed a 20-footer.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2005–06 NCAA season, Rondo {{announced}} he would forgo his final two seasons at Kentucky and enter the NBA draft. Rondo was drafted 21st overall by the Phoenix Suns in the 2006 NBA draft.
