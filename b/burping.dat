40|$|Abstract: <b>BURP</b> domain-containing {{proteins}} {{belong to}} a newly identified protein class that is unique to plants and {{plays an important role}} in plant development and metabolism. Although systematic characterization of <b>BURP</b> domain-containing proteins have been carried out in many species, such as rice, poplar and maize, little is known about <b>BURP</b> domain-containing proteins in Medicago. In this study, multiple bioinformatics approaches were employed to identify all the members of <b>BURP</b> family genes in Medicago. A complete set of 39 <b>BURP</b> family genes were identified. These genes have diverse structures and were distributed on chromosome 1 to 8 except 7. According to phylogenetic analysis, these <b>BURP</b> family genes could be classified into eight classes. Motif and exon-intron organization, stress-related cis-elements in promoter regions and microarray analysis of MtBURPs were also performed. Furthermore, transcript level analysis of MtBURP genes in response to drought stress revealed that all of the 39 <b>BURP</b> genes were regulated by drought stress. The results of this study reveal a comprehensive overview of the Medicago <b>BURP</b> gene family and provide the first step towards the selection of MtBURP genes for cloning and functional analysis of the <b>BURP</b> gene family in Medicago truncatula...|$|R
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the <b>BURP</b> domain is a ~230-amino acid protein domain, {{which has}} been named for the {{four members of the}} group initially identified, BNM2, USP, RD22, and PG1beta. It is found in the C-terminal part of a number of plant cell wall proteins, which are defined not only by the <b>BURP</b> domain, but also by the overall similarity in their modular construction. The <b>BURP</b> domain proteins consists of either three or four modules: (i) an N-terminal hydrophobic domain - a presumptive transit peptide, joined to (ii) a short conserved segment or other short segment, (iii) an optional segment consisting of repeated units which is unique to each member, and (iv) the C-terminal <b>BURP</b> domain. Although the <b>BURP</b> domain proteins share primary structural features, their expression patterns and the conditions under which they are expressed differ. The presence of the conserved <b>BURP</b> domain in diverse plant proteins suggests an important and fundamental functional role for this domain. It is possible that the <b>BURP</b> domain represents a general motif for localization of proteins within the cell wall matrix. The other structural domains associated with the <b>BURP</b> domain may specify other target sites for intermolecular interactions.|$|R
25|$|Despite having herbivorous diets {{similar to}} {{ruminants}} such as cattle, which release {{large quantities of}} methane through exhaling and eructation (<b>burping),</b> kangaroos release virtually none. The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy. Scientists {{are interested in the}} possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide, per molecule.|$|E
25|$|While not {{affecting}} {{the production of}} the gases themselves, surfactants (agents that lower surface tension) can reduce the disagreeable sensations associated with flatulence, by aiding the dissolution of the gases into liquid and solid faecal matter. Preparations containing simethicone reportedly operate by promoting the coalescence of smaller bubbles into larger ones more easily passed from the body, either by <b>burping</b> or flatulence. Such preparations do not decrease the total amount of gas generated in or passed from the colon, but make the bubbles larger and thereby allowing them to be passed more easily.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the normal}} range of volumes of flatus in normal individuals varies hugely (476–1,491ml/24h). All intestinal gas is either swallowed environmental air, present intrinsically in foods and beverages or the result of gut fermentation. Swallowing small amounts of air occurs while eating and drinking. This is emitted from the mouth by eructation (<b>burping)</b> and is normal. Excessive swallowing of environmental air is called aerophagia, and {{has been shown in}} a few case reports to be responsible for increased flatus volume. This is however considered a rare cause of increased flatus volume. Gases contained in food and beverages is likewise emitted largely through eructation, e.g., carbonated beverages. Endogenously produced intestinal gases make up 74 percent of flatus in normal subjects. The volume of gas produced is partially dependent upon the composition of the intestinal microbiota, which is normally very resistant to change, but is also very different in different individuals. Some patients are predisposed to increased endogenous gas production by virtue of their gut microbiota composition. The greatest concentration of gut bacteria is in the colon, while the small intestine is normally near sterile. Fermentation occurs when unabsorbed food residues may arrive in the colon. Therefore, even more than the composition of the microbiota, diet is the primary factor that dictates the volume of flatus produced. Diets that aim {{to reduce the amount of}} undigested fermentable food residues arriving in the colon have been shown to significantly reduce the volume of flatus produced. Again, it is emphasised that increased volume of intestinal gas will not cause bloating and pain in normal subjects. Abnormal intestinal gas dynamics will create pain, distension, and bloating, regardless of whether there is high or low total flatus volume.|$|E

It colonizes the gastrointestinal system, predominantly the stomach. The bacterium has specific survival conditions that our gastric microenvironment: it is both capnophilic and microaerophilic. Helicobacter also exhibits a tropism for gastric epithelial lining and the gastric mucosal layer about it. Gastric colonization of this bacterium triggers a robust immune response leading to moderate to severe inflammation. This inflammatory response triggers a cascade of mucosal changes that can persist [...] from chronic gastritis, duodenal cancer, metaplasia, dysplasia, carcinoma, to mucosal associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT lymphoma). Many individuals go through life without realizing they are infected because they were exposed young and their body sees it as normal flora. However, signs and symptoms are gastritis, burning abdominal pain, weight loss, loss of appetite, bloating, <b>burping,</b> nausea, bloody vomit, and black tarry stools. Infection is easy enough to detect: GI X-rays, endoscopy, blood tests for anti-Helicobacter antibodies, a stool test, and a urease breath test (which is a by-product of the bacteria). If caught soon enough, it can be treated with three doses of different proton pump inhibitors as well as two antibiotics, taking about a week to cure.

40|$|Abstract Background For typing of Staphylococcus aureus, DNA {{sequencing}} of the repeat {{region of the}} protein A (spa) gene is a well established discriminatory method for outbreak investigations. Recently, {{it was hypothesized that}} this region also reflects long-term epidemiology. However, no automated and objective algorithm existed to cluster different repeat regions. In this study, the Based Upon Repeat Pattern (<b>BURP)</b> implementation that is a heuristic variant of the newly described EDSI algorithm was investigated to infer the clonal relatedness of different spa types. For calibration of <b>BURP</b> parameters, 400 representative S. aureus strains with different spa types were characterized by MLST and clustered using eBURST as "gold standard" for their phylogeny. Typing concordance analysis between eBURST and <b>BURP</b> clustering (spa-CC) were performed using all possible <b>BURP</b> parameters to determine their optimal combination. <b>BURP</b> was subsequently evaluated with a strain collection reflecting the breadth of diversity of S. aureus (JCM 2002; 40 : 4544). Results In total, the 400 strains exhibited 122 different MLST types. eBURST grouped them into 23 clonal complexes (CC; 354 isolates) and 33 singletons (46 isolates). <b>BURP</b> clustering of spa types using all possible parameter combinations and subsequent comparison with eBURST CCs resulted in concordances ranging from 8. 2 to 96. 2 %. However, 96. 2 % concordance was reached only if spa types shorter than 8 repeats were excluded, which resulted in 37 % excluded spa types. Therefore, the optimal combination of the <b>BURP</b> parameters was "exclude spa types shorter than 5 repeats" and "cluster spa types into spa-CC if cost distances are less than 4 " exhibiting 95. 3 % concordance to eBURST. This algorithm identified 24 spa-CCs, 40 singletons, and excluded only 7. 8 % spa types. Analyzing the natural population with these parameters, the comparison of whole-genome micro-array groupings (at the level of 0. 31 Pearson correlation index) and spa-CCs gave a concordance of 87. 1 %; <b>BURP</b> spa-CCs vs. manually grouped spa types resulted in 95. 7 % concordance. Conclusion <b>BURP</b> is the first automated and objective tool to infer clonal relatedness from spa repeat regions. It is able to extract an evolutionary signal rather congruent to MLST and micro-array data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{proteins}} containing <b>BURP</b> domain {{have been}} identified in many different plant species, but not in any other organisms. To date, the molecular function of the <b>BURP</b> domain is still unknown, and no systematic analysis and expression profiling of the gene family in soybean (Glycine max) has been reported. Results In this study, multiple bioinformatics approaches were employed to identify all the members of <b>BURP</b> family genes in soybean. A total of 23 <b>BURP</b> gene types were identified. These genes had diverse structures and were distributed on chromosome 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these <b>BURP</b> family genes could be classified into 5 subfamilies, and one of which defines a new subfamily, BURPV. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of transcript levels showed that 15 of the 23 genes had no expression specificity; 7 of them were specifically expressed in some of the tissues; {{and one of them was}} not expressed in any of the tissues or organs studied. The results of stress treatments showed that 17 of the 23 identified <b>BURP</b> family genes responded to at least one of the three stress treatments; 6 of them were not influenced by stress treatments even though a stress related cis -element was identified in the promoter region. No stress related cis -elements were found in promoter region of any BURPV member. However, qRT-PCR results indicated that all members from BURPV responded to at least one of the three stress treatments. More significantly, the members from the RD 22 -like subfamily showed no tissue-specific expression and they all responded to each of the three stress treatments. Conclusions We have identified and classified all the <b>BURP</b> domain-containing genes in soybean. Their expression patterns in different tissues and under different stress treatments were detected using qRT-PCR. 15 out of 23 <b>BURP</b> genes in soybean had no tissue-specific expression, while 17 out of them were stress-responsive. The data provided an insight into the evolution of the gene family and suggested that many <b>BURP</b> family genes may be important for plants responding to stress conditions. </p...|$|R
