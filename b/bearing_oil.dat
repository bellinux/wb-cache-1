50|$|X-ray {{spectroscopy}} is {{a powerful}} experimental technique that provides qualitative information about the elemental composition and internal stresses and strain within a specimen. High energy X-rays {{have the ability to}} penetrate deeply into materials allowing the examination of dense objects such as welds in steel, geological core sections <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> or gas or for the internal observation of chemical reactions inside heavy plant or machinery. Different experimental techniques such as X-ray fluorescence imaging and X-Ray diffraction imaging require X-ray detectors that are sensitive over a broad range of energies. Established semiconductor detector technology based on silicon and germanium have excellent energy resolution at X-ray energies under 30 keV but above this, due to a reduction in the material mass attenuation coefficient, the detection efficiency is dramatically reduced. To detect high energy X-rays, detectors produced from higher density materials are required.|$|E

With the planet gears rotating about their own axis and orbiting around the sun gear, centrifugal forces generated by both motions interact with each and generate complex kinematic conditions. This paper presents a literature and state-of-the-art knowledge review to identify existing work performed on cases similar to external journal <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> flow. In order to numerically investigate external journal <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> flow, an approach to decompose an actual journal bearing into simplified models is proposed.

The findings and conclusions are {{used to create a}} three dimensional (3 D), two-component computational fluid dynamic (CFD) sector model with rotationally periodic boundaries of the most simplistic approximation of an actual journal bearing: a non-orbiting representation, rotating about its own axis, with a circumferentially constant, i. e. concentric, lubricating gap. In order to track the phase interface between the oil and the air, the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method is used. External journal <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> flow is simulated with a number of different mesh densities. Two different operating temperatures, representing low and high viscosity oil, are used to assess the effect on the external flow field behaviour.

40|$|Purpose: A {{variety of}} biomass {{plantations}} {{are being raised}} for energy production. This case study is on energy production potential of seasonal <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops in India. These crops {{have the advantage of}} producing oil (liquid fuel) as well as biomass as agro residue (solid fuel). The purpose of the study is to estimate total energy yields of <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops and compare with other types of energy plantations. Also <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops bioaccumulate metals and thus phytoremediate soil. This provides scope for waste water irrigation. Design/methodology/approach: Relevant published papers on energy production by raising <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops have been analyzed. The effect of waste water irrigation and agronomic practices on increasing productivity is given special attention. Findings: It is shown that the seasonal <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops such as castor have a high potential to generate energy and this is comparable to energy produced by many perennial grasses. The energy yields of castor under irrigated condition was 196 Ã 103 MJ/ha and this is comparable to the reed canary grass which yields 195 Ã 103 MJ/ha. Some of the <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops are also super accumulators of certain toxic metals. Research limitations/implications: In this study, only all the accessible papers on the topic could be analyzed. Practical implications: This case study indicates that raising <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> crops such as castor using waste water has many advantages which include high energy yields, utilization of waste water for productive purpose and phytoremediation of soil. Originality/value: The comparison made between various types of energy crops for their energy generation is an original contribution.
