40|$|<b>The</b> {{buckling}} <b>of</b> thin-walled {{steel plates}} which are juxtaposed with a rigid {{medium must be}} treated as a contact problem, since the local buckles may only form away from the rigid medium in a unilateral mode. One particular example is <b>the</b> <b>bolting</b> <b>of</b> plates to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> reinforced concrete beams in order to stiffen and strengthen the original concrete beam. Plates which experience first yield before local buckling are referred to as semi-compact, and this paper uses an energy method developed elsewhere by the authors to study the unilateral local buckling of restrained plates, so that limiting depth to thickness ratios may be obtained that delineate the semi-compact section classification when the plate is subjected to a combination of bending, compressive and shearing actions. The application to retrofitting concrete beams is discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> proof <b>of</b> {{concept for}} using surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) strain sensors in <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> aircraft fastener failures is demonstrated. SAW sensors were investigated {{because they have the}} potential for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> passive wireless systems. The SAW devices employed four orthogonal frequency coding (OFC) spread spectrum reflectors in two banks on a high temperature piezoelectric substrate. Three SAW devices were attached to a cantilever panel with removable side stiffeners. Damage in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> fastener failure was simulated by removal <b>of</b> <b>bolts</b> from <b>the</b> <b>side</b> stiffeners. During testing, three different force conditions were used to simulate static aircraft structural response under loads. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensor, the panel arrangement and the panel testing results are reported. The results show that the sensors successfully detected single fastener failure at distances up to 54. 6 cm from the failure site under loaded conditions...|$|R
