50|$|Averrhoa <b>bilimbi</b> (commonly {{known as}} <b>bilimbi,</b> {{cucumber}} tree, or tree sorrel) is a fruit-bearing tree {{of the genus}} Averrhoa, family Oxalidaceae. It is a close relative of carambola tree.|$|E
50|$|In {{another part}} of Indonesia, Aceh, it is {{preserved}} by sun-drying. The sun-dried <b>bilimbi</b> is called asam sunti. <b>Bilimbi</b> and asam sunti are popular in Acehnese cuisine. It can replace mango in making chutney. In Malaysia, it also is made into a rather sweet jam.|$|E
5000|$|The genus {{comprises}} {{about a dozen}} species, {{of which}} two, the carambola and the <b>bilimbi,</b> are cultivated for their fruits : Averrhoa <b>bilimbi</b> L. -- BilimbiAverrhoa carambola L. -- Starfruit or carambolaAverrhoa dolichocarpa Rugayah & SunartiAverrhoa leucopetala Rugayah & SunartiAverrhoa microphylla TardieuAverrhoa minima Perr.Averrhoa sinica Hance ...|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on avocado, Coffea, Camellia sinensis, custard-apple and <b>bilimbi.</b> The {{species is}} {{considered}} a pest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{species in}} the genus Averrhoa along with the species in genus Sarcotheca are the only woody, tree-like plants {{belonging}} to the Oxalis family Oxalidaceae. The Oxalis family has nearly 900 species, most are herbaceous perennials or annuals native from tropical and semitropical locations though a number also grow {{in other parts of}} the world. Averrhoa has sometimes been placed in the family Averrhoaceae. Averrhoa carambola is one of two {{species in the}} genus Averrhoa, both have edible fruit; the other species Averrhoa <b>bilimbi,</b> which is sometimes called the <b>Bilimbi</b> or the Cucumber Tree, is limited to tropical regions. The fruits of A. <b>bilimbi</b> are too sour to be eaten raw, while the sweet forms A. carambola are eaten raw. The fruits of A. <b>bilimbi</b> and the sour forms, which have high oxalic acid content, of A. carambola are pickled and made into jelly, jam, and juice. The genus was named after Abū 'l-Walīd Muḥammad bin Aḥmad bin Rushd (better known just as Ibn Rushd), who was called Averroes in European literature - a famous Arabian physician, astronomer and philosopher of the 12th century.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bilimbi</b> tree reaches 5-10 m in height. Its trunk {{is short}} and quickly divides up into ramifications. <b>Bilimbi</b> leaves, 3-6 cm long, are {{alternate}}, imparipinnate and cluster at branch extremities. There are around 11 to 37 alternate or subopposite oblong leaflets. The leaves are quite {{similar to those of}} the Otaheite gooseberry. The trunk and branches of tree has to be exposed to sunlight for fruits to form (traditional knowledge), which is achieved by removing leaves except from branch end.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Averrhoa {{carambola}} and Averrhoa <b>bilimbi.</b> They bore in {{the flower}} buds and {{feed on the}} flowers. They are considered a serious pest.|$|E
50|$|In some {{villages in}} the Thiruvananthapuram {{district}} of India, {{the fruit of the}} <b>bilimbi</b> was used in folk medicine to control obesity. This led to further studies on its antihyperlipidemic properties.|$|E
50|$|In the Philippines, {{where it}} is {{commonly}} found in backyards, the fruits are eaten either raw or dipped in rock salt. It can be either curried or added as a souring agent for common Filipino dishes such as sinigang and paksiw. The uncooked <b>bilimbi</b> is prepared as relish and served with rice and beans in Costa Rica. In the Far East, where the tree originated, it is sometimes added to curry. <b>Bilimbi</b> juice (with a pH of about 4.47) is made into a cooling beverage. In Indonesia, it is added to some dishes, substituting for tamarind or tomato.|$|E
50|$|Pinangat is a Filipino dish. There are two popular {{versions}} of Pinangat: the sour version using <b>bilimbi</b> (kamias), tamarind, or vinegar; and the Bicol version with gata. The sour version uses fish {{as the main}} ingredient.|$|E

50|$|Like the <b>bilimbi,</b> {{the juice}} {{of the more}} acidic sour types {{can be used to}} clean rusty or {{tarnished}} metal (especially brass) as well as bleach rust stains from cloth. They may also be used as a mordant in dyeing.|$|E
50|$|Red {{and white}} textile {{colouring}} {{was available in}} ancient Indonesia. White is the natural colour of woven cotton fabrics, while red {{is one of the}} earliest natural dyes, acquired either from teak leaves, the flowers of Averrhoa <b>bilimbi,</b> or the skin of mangosteen fruits.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on flower buds {{and flowers}} of Dolichos lablab, Lagenaria, Pelargonium and Fabaceae species. Other {{recorded}} food plants include Brillantaisia lamium, Caperonia castaneifolia, Phaseolus vulgaris, Hibiscus mutabilis, Thalia geniculata, Mimosa pudica, Orchidaceae, Averrhoa <b>bilimbi,</b> Passiflora foetida, Antirrhinum majus, Theobroma cacao and Lantana camara.|$|E

50|$|The parrots’ diet is principally fruit, both {{wild and}} cultivated, {{as well as}} flowers and buds. Wild foods include {{the fruits of the}} endemic palm Vershaffeltia splendida, growing along the river valleys, as well as the flowers of the coco de mer. Cultivated fruits {{utilised}} by the parrots include guava, papaya, mango and <b>bilimbi.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{tree and}} fruits have many {{different}} names, Carambola is the Spanish vernacular {{name of the}} tree. In English it is called Star fruit, Carambola and Chinese gooseberry, in Malaysia and the Philippines it has numerous names. In Indonesia it is called belimbing, in Tagalog it is called balimbing. The related <b>bilimbi</b> is called kamias in Tagalog.|$|E
50|$|Outside of Asia, {{the tree}} is {{cultivated}} in Zanzibar. In 1793, the <b>bilimbi</b> was introduced to Jamaica from Timor and after several years, was cultivated throughout Central and South America where it is known as mimbro. In Suriname this fruit is known as lange birambi. Introduced to Queensland {{at the end of}} the 19th century, it has been grown commercially in the region since that time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{municipality}} {{was named}} after the sour fruit [...] "Iba", commonly known as kamias (Averrhoa <b>bilimbi),</b> which is abundant in the place. [...] Local folklore talks about the Spaniards {{who came to the}} town asking the name of the place, the natives shouted [...] "Iba, Iba" [...] thinking that the man was asking what they were eating. From then on, the place was called Iba.|$|E
5000|$|The {{carambola}} {{is known}} under different names in different countries. It {{should not be}} confused with the closely related <b>bilimbi,</b> with which it shares some common names. It is also called [...] "starfruit" [...] in English (including Jamaican English and Philippine English) and literally translates into Stjernefrugt in Danish, Sternfrucht in German, and Stjärnfrukt in Swedish. In Spanish, it is known as carambola, carambolo, tamarindo chino, tamarindo culí, balimbín (Philippine Spanish, from Tagalog balimbing, plural is balimbines), and fruta china (Ecuador).|$|E
50|$|In the Philippines, {{the leaves}} {{serve as a}} paste on itches, swelling, rheumatism, mumps or skin eruptions. Elsewhere, they are used for bites of venomous creatures. A leaf {{infusion}} is used as an after-birth tonic, while the flower infusion is used for thrush, cold, and cough. Malaysians use fermented or fresh <b>bilimbi</b> leaves to treat venereal diseases. In French Guiana, syrup made from the fruit is used to treat inflammatory conditions. To date {{there is no scientific}} evidence to confirm effectiveness for such uses.|$|E
50|$|The Phyllanthus acidus is an {{intermediary}} between a shrub and tree, reaching 2 to 9 m (6½ to 30 ft) high. The tree's dense and bushy crown {{is composed of}} thickish, tough main branches, {{at the end of}} which are clusters of deciduous, greenish, 15-to-30-cm long branchlets. The branchlets bear alternate leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in form, with short petioles and pointed ends. The leaves are 2-7.5 cm long and thin, they are green and smooth on the upperside and blue-green on the underside. In general, the Otaheite gooseberry tree very much looks like the <b>bilimbi</b> tree.|$|E
5000|$|Like the {{closely related}} <b>bilimbi,</b> {{there are two}} main types of carambola: the small sour (or tart) type and the larger sweet type. The sour {{varieties}} have a higher oxalic acid content than the sweet type. A number of cultivars have been developed in recent years. The most common cultivars grown commercially include the sweet types [...] "Arkin" [...] (Florida), [...] "Dah Pon" [...] (Taiwan), [...] "Ma fueng" [...] (Thailand), [...] "Maha" [...] (Malaysia), and [...] "Demak" [...] (Indonesia) and the sour types [...] "Golden Star", [...] "Newcomb", [...] "Star King", and [...] "Thayer" [...] (all from Florida).

5000|$|Papaitan, or sinanglaw in the Ilocos Region, is an offal stew whose {{signature}} ingredient is its broth {{made from}} animal bile and {{the fruit of}} the Averrhoa <b>bilimbi.</b> The original stew was made from goat offal or goat tripe, however offal from cattle or carabao are also used. Papaitan means [...] "bitterness", from the taste of the bile. In the province of Cagayan, a version of the dish without the bile is called menudencia. The dish kare-kare is made with beef tripe and tail stewed in peanut sauce. Beef tripe is also a main ingredient in a rice porridge dish called goto. Although, goto in the province of Batangas refers to a soup dish with the same tripe ingredient, instead of a rice porridge. Beef tongue, on the other hand, is stewed in a creamy dish called lengua (Spanish for [...] "tongue"). Beef liver, as well as pig liver, are also main ingredients in meat stews such as menudo, and the Ilocano igado (from [...] "hígado" [...] or Spanish for [...] "liver").|$|E

40|$|Averrhoa <b>bilimbi</b> Linn. are type {{of family}} Oxalidaceae {{that had a}} common name such as <b>bilimbi,</b> belimbing buloh and balimbing. They have an {{excellent}} source of bioactive compounds such as flavonoid, phenolic and antioxidant included oxalic acid, vitamin C, tannins also minerals. A. <b>bilimbi,</b> has been widely used in traditional medicine since gives high good impact to humankind for cured disease such as cough, cold, itches, boils, rheumatism, syphilis, diabetes, whooping cough and hypertension. However, this active compound will reduce its value during undergo heating and drying process especially when exposed to high temperature. Since bioactive compounds are unstable when it exposed to heat, the product will become low in the nutritional value. Therefore, it very important to understand the thermal degradation of A. <b>bilimbi</b> to maintain the product quality and produce nutritional product that can used for human health, and hence this is the objective of this work. Extraction of A. <b>bilimbi</b> fruit were performed using 50 % concentration methanol as a solvent. Then, the heat treatment was performed using a metal tube containing A. <b>bilimbi</b> extracts at various temperature and time exposure. Total flavonoids (TFC) and phenolic (TPC) content were analyses using colorimetric assay. Meanwhile, the free-radical scavenging (antioxidant) activity was measured using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. All analysis was performed using a calibrated ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (Hitachi U- 1800, Japan).
