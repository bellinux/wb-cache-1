The aims {{of this study were}} to detect the changes of serum soluble interleukin- 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R) levels following heavy-ion beam irradiation in the hamster model with cheek pouch carcinoma, as well as to examine the impact of immune status of the hamster cheek pouch carcinoma model using heavy-ion beam irradiation. sIL- 2 R serum levels were detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in 40 hamsters <b>bearing</b> <b>cheek</b> pouch carcinoma prior to and following exposure to heavy-ion beam irradiation, and 8 normal animals served as the control. The sIL- 2 R serum level in hamster cheek pouch carcinoma model was significantly increased as compared to the normal control group (P< 0. 05). Results showed that an increase in the irradia-tion dose led to a gradual decrease in the sIL- 2 R serum level. Additionally, a statistical significance was observed compared to the tumor group (P< 0. 05). In conclusion, alterations in serum sIL- 2 R expression {{have an effect on the}} hamsters cheek pouch carcinoma model subsequent to heavy-ion beam irradia-tion. An increase in the irradiation dose indicated a decreased tendency in serum sIL- 2 R content. Detection of serum level changes may lead to an improved understanding of heavy-ion irradiation in vivo immune status, which is crucial for clinical diagnosis and prognosis. It can also provide a sensitive indi-cator to help estimate the effects of heavy-ion cancer targets...|$|E
