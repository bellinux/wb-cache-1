Web 2. 0 has recently cooled down, but it may have started a new era. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the blogonomics - the business, as well as social, changes blogs have brought to us. It applies system thinking to analyze blogs, from blog elements (forms) to <b>blog</b> <b>systems,</b> and then to major components in the blog ecosystem. This paper focuses on the returns on blogs (ROB), mainly the business impact. Blog marketing, including word-of-mouth marketing (WOMM) and blog ads, has been discussed extensively along with the business models that can monetize blogs. It also proposes to use blogs as innovative tools for collaboration and content management. This paper primarily targets companies interested in the benefit from blogs.

40|$|Abstract—With the {{proliferation}} of Weblogs (blogs) use in educational contexts, gaining {{a better understanding of}} why students are willing to utilize <b>blog</b> <b>systems</b> has become an important topic for practitioners and academics. While perceived enjoyment has been found to have a significant influence on behavioral intentions to use blogs or hedonic systems, few studies have investigated the antecedents of perceived enjoyment in the acceptance of blogging. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to explore the individual difference antecedents of perceived enjoyment and examine how they influence behavioral intention to blog through the mediation of perceived enjoyment. Based on the previous literature, the Big Five personality traits (i. e., extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to experience), as well as computer self-efficacy and personal innovation in information technology (PIIT), are hypothesized as potential antecedents of perceived enjoyment in the acceptance of blogging. Data collected from 358 respondents in Taiwan are tested against the research model using the structural equation modeling approach. The results indicate that extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and PIIT have a significant influence on perceived enjoyment, which in turn significantly influences the behavioral intention to blog. These findings lead to several important implications for future research. Keywords—Individual difference, Big Five personality traits, perceived enjoyment, blogging W I...|$|E

This thesis was made to introduce the systems and tools which allow the non professional users to build a web site and later learn how to add files and maintain the contents without previous computer knowledge and programming skills. In this thesis I am expanding on CMS, Blog and Wiki systems. CMS were initially used for a web site construction. Blog were used for writing the web diaries. Wiki system were intended for creation of web encyclopaedias and knowledge bases. The last two mentioned systems were not being used primarily as the tool for the web site construction, but were still satisfactory for the creations of the simple web site. Further in the thesis I compare the pros and cons of the three systems and I also expand on the appropriate use for different profiles of users. In my thesis I introduce the tools needed for the function of the system. For each system group the three typical representatives were chosen. Joomla, Drupal and Website Baker were used for the introduction of CMS. Wordpress, B 2 evolution and Serendepity were used for <b>Blog.</b> <b>Systems</b> used for Wiki were MediaWiki, WikaWiki and PmWiki. The chosen systems are being presented from set up until the final presentation of the web site. Each group has a brief description of each presenter. The final article provides some recommendation for each chosen system group and different profile users. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Researchers need {{to share}} {{information}} about their publications. They also desire to share opinions and comments about each other’s publications. The paper describes a system which demonstrates how semantic blogging {{can be used for}} the purpose. The SWRC ontology has been incorporated in the <b>blogging</b> <b>system</b> for entering the metadata of publications. The semantic <b>blogging</b> <b>system</b> provides means to annotate publications. The system is a decentralized publication aggregation system. It utilizes the RSS technology to aggregate posts. The publication metadata is embedded in the RSS to produce BuRST feed. The RSS aggregator has been extended to handle the BuRST feeds. The system uses the FOAF links of the authors and friends to explore the social network of the research community for aggregation of relevant information. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Web 2. 0 applications, {{including}} blogs, wikis {{and social}} networking sites, pose challenging privacy issues. Many users are unaware that search engines index personal information from these sites and offer {{public access to}} collected data. As a consequence, privacy invasions are rampant. In this paper, we demonstrate that tag-based privacy policies are a usable and flexible privacy control method for Web 2. 0 applications. Content owners express their privacy policy in terms of tags on content objects; the system then applies the policy to objects based on the tags assigned to them. We implemented tag-based privacy controls as a plugin to the WordPress <b>blogging</b> <b>system,</b> and conducted a user study to measure whether users could efficiently implement real-world privacy concerns with tagbased policies. Despite limited time, training and familiarity with the <b>blogging</b> <b>system,</b> {{a third of the}} participants chose the tag-based policy tools. These users were able to perform privacy-related tasks with the same accuracy and increased speed using our tag-based privacy controls versus perobject privacy controls...|$|R
