5000|$|The oriental dollarbird was {{originally}} {{described in the}} genus Coracias. Formerly, some authorities have also considered the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> and the azure dollarbird to have been subspecies of the oriental dollarbird.

5000|$|Rollers can be {{identified}} as medium-sized birds with strong, slightly hooked beaks and stocky bodies, often with brightly-colored plumage. Rollers resemble crows in size and build, ranging from 25 to 27 centimetres (10 - 11 in) in length. They share the colourful appearance of kingfishers and bee-eaters, blues and pinkish or cinnamon browns predominating. The rollers are similar in general morphology to their relatives in the order Coraciiformes, having large heads on short necks, bright plumage, weak feet and short legs. The two inner front toes are connected, but not the outer one. The weakness of the feet and legs is reflected in their behaviour, rollers do not hop or move along perches and seldom use their feet other than for occasional lurching leaps along the ground pursuing escaping prey. The bill is robust, and is shorter yet broader in the genus Eurystomus, sometimes known as the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>rollers.</b> The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>rollers</b> have brightly coloured bills, whereas those of the Coracias (or true) rollers are black. Other {{differences between the two}} genera are in wing length; the more aerial Eurystomus rollers have longer wings (and shorter feet still) than the Coracias rollers, this reflects differences in their foraging ecology. Their calls are [...] "repeated short, gruff caws".|$|R
50|$|The blue-throated roller perches high up, either singly or in pairs, on bare branches, {{frequently}} at {{the very}} top of the canopy. They often sit for long periods, and sometimes make their shrill chattering calls. When active they hawk insects in the air and aggressively defend their territory from other bird species. In the late afternoon the birds gather in small flocks, often mixed with <b>broad-billed</b> <b>rollers,</b> to feed on ants and termites which emerge after a rainfall. The rollers feed on these insects in flight, acrobatically chasing them and eating them on the wing. This activity continues until dusk and one roller may eat over 700 insects weighing 40g.|$|R

50|$|The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> is 29-30 cm in length. It has a warm {{back and}} head, lilac foreneck and breast, {{with the rest}} of the plumage mainly brown. The broad bill is bright yellow. Sexes are similar, but the {{juvenile}} is a drabber version of the adult, with a pale breast. The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> is striking in its strong direct flight, with the brilliant blues of the wings and tail contrasting with the brown back.|$|E

50|$|Eurystomus {{contains}} four broad-billed species, which {{breed in}} Africa, Asia and Australasia. Two species {{are restricted to}} Africa, one of which, the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller,</b> is migratory. The oriental dollarbird has a large distribution ranging from India to Japan and Australia and it too, is migratory over {{the northern and southern}} extremes of its range. The final species, the azure dollarbird, is endemic to the Moluccas in Indonesia. In general they are open country foragers, occurring in woodland, savanna and farmland. The azure dollarbird and the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> are both associated with rainforests but nevertheless require open areas in which to forage.|$|E
50|$|The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> (Eurystomus glaucurus) is {{a member}} of the roller family of birds which breeds across {{tropical}} Africa and Madagascar in all but the driest regions. It is a wet season breeder, which migrates from the northern and southern areas of its range towards the moister equatorial belt in the dry season.|$|E
50|$|Interesting birds {{include the}} Ceylon frogmouth, great {{hornbill}}, Malabar pied hornbill, Malabar grey hornbill, Indian grey hornbill and Asian fairy bluebird.Around 200 {{species of birds}} are recorded in the park. These include the distinctive adjutant stork, ashy woodswallow, black-crested bulbul, blue-headed pitta, brahminy kite, <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller,</b> crested serpent eagle, great hornbill, golden-backed woodpecker, Malabar pied hornbill, Sri Lanka frogmouth and yellow-footed green pigeon.|$|E
5000|$|Birds 268 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the sanctuary. 134 species are listed as rare and 18 species are endemic to western Ghats.

50|$|Like most owls, the Madagascar owl is nocturnal, {{roosting}} by day {{in dense}} foliage. It feeds mainly on small mammals, hunting {{either in the}} forest or in open areas nearby. Pellets collected from a roost site in south eastern Madagascar were examined and contained the remains of insects; frogs (Boophis); geckoes (Uroplatus), birds (<b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> and Malagasy bulbul); rodents, including tufted-tailed rats (Eliurus spp);and black rat Rattus rattus); Commerson's leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros commersoni); and dwarf lemurs (Microcebus spp).|$|E
50|$|The park's diverse aquatic {{avifauna}} includes {{painted stork}} Mycteria leucocephala, white-bellied sea eagle Haliaeetus leucogaster, grey pelican Pelecanus philippensis, great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo , and little cormorant P. niger. Notable forest species are endemic Sri Lanka junglefowl Gallus lafayetii, the rare <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> Eurystomus glaucurus (possibly the only dry zone haunt), common tailorbird Orthotomus sutorius, shama Copsychus malabaricus, black-hooded oriole Oriolus xanthornus, and woodpecker Dendrocopos nanus. Endemic red-faced malkoha (Phaenicophaeus pyrrhocephalus) also occurs. The reservoirs harbor {{several species of}} bird including Oriental darter Anhinga melanogaster, spot-billed pelican Pelecanus philippensis, Asian openbill Anastomus oscitans, black-headed ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, and Eurasian spoonbill Platalea leucorodia.|$|E
50|$|Other {{significant}} sightings {{during the}} survey included {{those of the}} large hawk cuckoo (Cuculus sparverioides), <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> (Eurystomus orientalis) and ashy minivet (Pericrocotus divaricatus). About half of the large mammals found in Kerala are reported from Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary, especially some of the globally threatened species such as tiger (Panthera tigris), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and wild dog (Cuon alpinus). Other red-listed species found here include the Indian giant squirrel (Ratufa indica) and the endemic primates-lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), Nilgiri langur (Trachypithecus johnii) and slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus). There are 39 species of mammals, 160 species of birds, 25 species of reptiles, 14 species of amphibians, and 31 species of fishes are reported from the sanctuary.|$|E
40|$|The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> Eurystomus orientalis {{is one of}} the {{endangered}} species in Kyushu. There are only few studies reported and not enough information on it. In this study, the nests were searched at the 5 river systems during the breeding season in 2005 and 2006. Nested the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> were find at 5 brides among 45 bridges. These bridges are located at Midorikawa, Gokasegawa, Kitagawa, Ohitagawa and Ooitagawa rivers. The bridges are silent against human activity. Positions of the nest hollows had no relations with bridge colors and structures. Total of 18 bird houses were installed at 4 bridges and 3 pair of the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> were nested in 2006. The bird house size and install location were followed after Dr. Iida 2 ̆ 7 s method. This study indicated that the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> in Kyusyu lay eggs from late May to early June and left a nest at the middle of July. Constructing bird houses will contribute the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> to prevent from extinction in Kyushu...|$|E
40|$|The eastern <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller,</b> Eurystomus orientalis, inhabiting in Japan is an {{endangered}} species and needed exact information for the conservation. The <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> breeding in Kyushu has morphological similarities with that in Chugoku; however there is no research on genetic inspection until now. To examine polymorphism of the mitochondrial control region, we at the first sequenced 3599 bp from cytochrome b region to 12 S rRNA region, and then determined 380 bp sequences of the domain I at the control region using 17 samples Using 10 haplotypes defined, phylogeny, ΦST and Mantel test showed that the <b>broad-billed</b> <b>roller</b> both in Kyushu and Chugoku should be included into a single genetic population, which increased its population {{at least since the}} Last Glaciations when these islands were connected each other during the sea regression. Polymorphic analysis suggested that this species has high genetic diversity which might be enable to distinguish the mother bird. These continuous genetic studies for this species will contribute to ecology and conservation...|$|E
