An {{example of}} semantic pattern analysis {{is used to}} demonstrate the methodological aspects of knowledge discovery in bibliographic databases. The semantic pattern analysis {{is based on the}} keywords selected from the documents grouped by <b>bibliographical</b> <b>coupling.</b> The frequency distribution patterns suggest the existence of a common intellectual base {{with a wide range of}} specialties and marginal areas in the antibiotic resistance literature. The resulting values for keyword density per rank show a difference of ten times between the specialty and marginal keyword densities.

Includes <b>bibliographical</b> references. <b>Coupled</b> line structures in inhomogeneous media are analyzed and applied in three circuits, a novel three-coupled line bandpass filter having sharp cutoff and two planar baluns composed of two sections of broadside-coupled lines. These are very suitable for microwave integrated circuits (MIC) and microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). Two quasistatic analyses, the spectral domain analysis and a variational technique, are applied to the three-coupled line structure {{for the first time and}} numerical data are presented. The spectral domain analysis is utilized to obtain results for two lines. A quasi-TEM analysis is applied to the three- coupled line structure and specific port terminations are applied to the resulting six-port impedance matrix to obtain the ABCD matrix parameters for a bandpass filter. By a similar quasi-TEM analysis, the generalized four-port scattering matrix of a two-coupled line structure is derived for the first time. The scattering matrix for two planar baluns are derived using the generalized scattering matrix. A design procedure for the planar Marchand balun based on the derived scattering parameters is presented. Experimental results from circuits designed with this theory are presented and are seen to agree well with prediction...|$|R

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2012. Includes <b>bibliographical</b> references. Mutual <b>coupling</b> between {{microstrip}} antenna elements (through space and surface waves) {{has a significant}} role in the performance merits of the {{microstrip antenna}} arrays. In many applications, low mutual coupling levels are desired such as bistatic radar systems where isolation is essential in order not to have any interference between the transmitter and receiver antennas. Furthermore, presence of mutual coupling among the antenna elements can affect the sidelobe levels, beam position and frequency bandwidth of arrays. Mutual coupling among the array elements usually occurs as a result of surface waves and space waves. Mutual coupling through the space waves are very strong if the array elements are very close to each other. However, they die out quickly as the separation between the array elements become larger. On the other hand, although the mutual coupling due to the surface waves are weaker than that of space waves when the array elements are close to each other, they remain as the only coupling mechanism when they are far away from each other, in particular for arrays of microstrip antennas. In this thesis, the main goal is to reduce the mutual coupling between the microstrip antennas resulting from the surface waves by using a defected ground structure (DGS). The DGS is formed by etching either a dumbbell shape or a slotted complementary split ring resonator (SCSRR) to the part of the ground plane that remains between the microstrip antennas along their E-plane direction. It has been observed that although a considerable reduction in the mutual coupling can be achieved, the radiation patterns of the antennas are deteriorated due to a significant increase in the backlobe radiation. Hence, a reflector and a cavity combination is used to decrease the backlobe radiation to a certain level. Finally, to test the DGS in an array environment, the performance merits of a 2 × 2 microstrip antenna array is investigated in the presence of a dumbbell DGS, where each microstrip is backed with a cavity and a reflector. Based on both the simulations and the measurements, it has been concluded that despite the achieved mutual coupling reduction between the microstrip antennas in the array environment, the far-zone radiation patterns related merits have not been improved.
