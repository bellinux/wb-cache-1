Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|R
50|$|At work, Billy is {{tasked with}} mailing {{out a large}} {{shipment}} of advertising calendars to potential customers, but instead hides the calendars and keeps the postage money. He is eventually found out by Shadrack, who refuses to let him resign from his position until he pays <b>back</b> the <b>postage</b> money. Billy aspires to get a more interesting job as a scriptwriter for comic Danny Boon (Leslie Randall), but when Boon comes to town, he {{is not interested in}} Billy's overtures.|$|R
50|$|The first {{post office}} was in Tabor's store at Oro, Augusta Tabor was the postmistress. Carriers {{went down to}} Denver one week and tried to come <b>back</b> the next. <b>Postage</b> was fifty cents a letter. In early 1878, Meyer, Harrison, Tabor {{established}} a post office in Leadville, with Henderson as postmaster. The post office and the telegraph office both prospered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{more books}} Grey sold, {{the more the}} {{established}} critics, such as Heywood Broun and Burton Rascoe, attacked him. They claimed his depictions of the West were too fanciful, too violent, and not faithful to the moral realities of the frontier. They thought his characters unrealistic and much larger-than-life. Broun stated that [...] "the substance of any two Zane Grey books could be written upon the <b>back</b> of a <b>postage</b> stamp." ...|$|R
5000|$|Currency, postage stamps, {{magazines}} {{covers and}} any other items with the king’s image are never tossed to the ground or treated harshly. Even licking the <b>back</b> of a <b>postage</b> stamp is considered disrespectful. Most especially, these items are never trod upon {{as it is a}} sign of utmost disrespect to place one’s foot above the head of the king. Money or other items dropped accidentally should immediately be picked up and reverently brushed, not trodden on to stop from rolling away.|$|R
2500|$|Postal {{cards and}} postcards are small message cards which are sent by mail unenveloped; the {{distinction}} often, though not invariably and reliably, drawn {{between them is}} that [...] "postal cards" [...] are issued by the postal authority or entity with the [...] "postal indicia" [...] (or [...] "stamp") preprinted on them, while postcards are privately issued and require affixing an adhesive stamp (though {{there have been some}} cases of a postal authority's issuing non-stamped postcards). Postcards are often printed to promote tourism, with pictures of resorts, tourist attractions or humorous messages on the front and allowing for a short message from the sender to be written on the <b>back.</b> The <b>postage</b> required for postcards is generally less than postage required for standard letters; however, certain technicalities such as their being oversized or having cut-outs, may result in payment of the first-class rate being required.|$|R
6000|$|He saw John Eames {{before he}} started. [...] "You'll be ready this day week, will you?" [...] John Eames promised that he would. [...] "It {{will cost you}} some forty pounds, I should say. By George,--if {{you have to go}} on to Jerusalem, it will cost you more." [...] In answer to this, Johnny pleaded that it would be as good as any other tour to him. He would see the world. [...] "I'll tell you what," [...] said Toogood; [...] "I'll pay half. Only you mustn't tell Crump. And it will be quite as well not to tell Maria." [...] But Johnny would hear nothing of this scheme. He would pay the entire cost of his own journey. He had lots of money, he said, and would like nothing better. [...] "Then I'll run down," [...] said Toogood, [...] "and rummage up what tidings I can. As for writing to the dean, what's the good of writing to a man when you don't know where he is? Business letters always lie at hotels for two months, and then come <b>back</b> with double <b>postage.</b> From all I can hear, you'll stumble on her before you find him. If we do nothing else but bring him back, it will be a great thing to have the support of such a friend in the court. A Barchester jury won't like to find a man guilty who is hand-and-glove with the dean." ...|$|R
60|$|Smoke Printing.--When other {{apparatus}} {{is not at}} hand, a method of obtaining very clear impressions is to smoke a plate over a lighted candle, to press the finger on the blackened surface, and then on an adhesive one. The following details must, however, be borne in mind: the plate must not be smoked too much, {{for the same reason}} that a slab must not be inked too much; and the adhesive surface must be only slightly damped, not wetted, or the impression will be blurred. A crockery plate is better than glass or metal, as the soot does not adhere to it so tightly, and it is less liable to crack. Professor Bowditch finds mica (which is sold at photographic stores in small sheets) to be the best material. Certainly the smoke comes wholly off the mica on to the parts of the finger that touch it, and a beautiful negative is left behind, which can be utilised in the camera better than glass that has been similarly treated; but it does not serve so well for a plate that is intended to be kept ready for use in a pocket-book, its softness rendering it too liable to be scratched. I prefer to keep a slip of very thin copper sheeting in my pocket-book, with which, and with the gummed <b>back</b> of a <b>postage</b> stamp, or even the gummed fringe to a sheet of stamps, impressions can easily be taken. The thin copper quickly cools, and a wax match supplies enough smoke. The folders spoken of (p. 42) may be smoked instead of being inked, and are in some cases preferable to carry in the pocket or to send by post, being so easy to smoke afresh. Luggage labels that are thickly gummed at the back furnish a good adhesive surface. The fault of gummed paper lies in the difficulty of damping it without its curling up. The gummed paper sold by stationers is usually thinner than luggage labels, and still more difficult to keep flat. Paste rubbed in a very thin layer over a card makes a surface that holds soot firmly, and one that will not stick to other surfaces if accidentally moistened. Glue, isinglass, size, and mucilage, are all suitable. It was my fortune as a boy to receive rudimentary lessons in drawing from a humble and rather grotesque master. He confided to me the discovery, which he claimed as his own, that pencil drawings could be fixed by licking them; and as I write these words, the image of his broad swab-like tongue performing the operation, and of his proud eyes gleaming over the drawing he was operating on, come vividly to remembrance. This reminiscence led me to try whether licking a piece of paper would give it a sufficiently adhesive surface. It did so. Nay, it led me a step further, for I took two pieces of paper and licked both. The dry side of the one was held over the candle as an equivalent to a plate for collecting soot, being saved by the moisture at the back from igniting (it had to be licked two or three times during the process), and the impression was made on the other bit of paper. An ingenious person determined to succeed in obtaining the record of a finger impression, can hardly fail altogether under any ordinary circumstances.|$|R
