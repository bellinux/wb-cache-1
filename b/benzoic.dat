5|$|By 1803, Accum had {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in Nicholson's Journal, which discussed a number of subjects: investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines, determining the existence of <b>benzoic</b> acids in vanilla extract, observing the explosivity of sulphur-phosphorus mixtures.|$|E
5|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is a first-line {{treatment for}} mild and moderate acne {{due to its}} effectiveness and mild side-effects (mainly skin irritation). In the skin follicle, benzoyl peroxide kills P. acnes by oxidizing its proteins through the formation of oxygen free radicals and <b>benzoic</b> acid. These free radicals are thought {{to interfere with the}} bacterium's metabolism and ability to make proteins. Additionally, benzoyl peroxide is mildly effective at breaking down comedones and inhibiting inflammation. Benzoyl peroxide may be paired with a topical antibiotic or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide/clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide/adapalene, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like <b>benzoic</b> acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
5|$|Ka is the {{dissociation}} constant of a substituted compound, K is the {{dissociation constant}} when the substituent is hydrogen, ρ is a {{property of the}} unsubstituted compound and σ has a particular value for each substituent. A plot of log(Ka) against σ is a straight line with intercept log(K) and slope ρ. This {{is an example of}} a linear free energy relationship as log(Ka) is proportional to the standard fee energy change. Hammett originally formulated the relationship with data from <b>benzoic</b> acid with different substiuents in the ortho- and para- positions: some numerical values are in Hammett equation. This and other studies allowed substituents to be ordered according to their electron-withdrawing or electron-releasing power, and to distinguish between inductive and mesomeric effects.|$|E
25|$|Gum benzoin {{contains}} up to 20% of <b>benzoic</b> {{acid and}} 40% <b>benzoic</b> acid esters.|$|E
25|$|The first {{industrial}} process involved {{the reaction of}} benzotrichloride (trichloromethyl benzene) with calcium hydroxide in water, using iron or iron salts as catalyst. The resulting calcium benzoate is converted to <b>benzoic</b> acid with hydrochloric acid. The product contains significant amounts of chlorinated <b>benzoic</b> acid derivatives. For this reason, <b>benzoic</b> acid for human consumption was obtained by dry distillation of gum benzoin. Food-grade <b>benzoic</b> acid is now produced synthetically.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid {{is cheap}} and readily available, so the {{laboratory}} synthesis of <b>benzoic</b> acid is mainly practiced for its pedagogical value. It {{is a common}} undergraduate preparation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> {{acid and}} its salts {{are used as}} a food preservatives, {{represented}} by the E-numbers E210, E211, E212, and E213. <b>Benzoic</b> acid inhibits the growth of mold, yeast and some bacteria. It is either added directly or created from reactions with its sodium, potassium, or calcium salt. The mechanism starts with the absorption of <b>benzoic</b> acid into the cell. If the intracellular pH changes to 5 or lower, the anaerobic fermentation of glucose through phosphofructokinase is decreased by 95%. The efficacy of <b>benzoic</b> acid and benzoate is thus dependent on the pH of the food. Acidic food and beverage like fruit juice (citric acid), sparkling drinks (carbon dioxide), soft drinks (phosphoric acid), pickles (vinegar) or other acidified food are preserved with <b>benzoic</b> acid and benzoates.|$|E
25|$|The {{major cause}} of benzene in soft drinks is the {{decarboxylation}} of <b>benzoic</b> acid {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid (vitamin C, E300) or erythorbic acid (a diastereomer of ascorbic acid, E315). <b>Benzoic</b> acid is often added to drinks as a preservative in the form of its salts sodium benzoate (E211), potassium benzoate (E 212), or calcium benzoate (E 213). Citric acid is not thought to induce significant benzene production in combination with <b>benzoic</b> acid, but some evidence suggests that in the presence of ascorbic or erythorbic acid and <b>benzoic</b> acid, citric acid may accelerate the production of benzene.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid occurs {{naturally}} as do its esters in many {{plant and}} animal species. Appreciable amounts {{have been found in}} most berries (around 0.05%). Ripe fruits of several Vaccinium species (e.g., cranberry, V. vitis macrocarpon; bilberry, V. myrtillus) contain as much as 0.03–0.13% free <b>benzoic</b> acid. <b>Benzoic</b> acid is also formed in apples after infection with the fungus Nectria galligena. Among animals, <b>benzoic</b> acid has been identified primarily in omnivorous or phytophageous species, e.g., in viscera and muscles of the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) as well as in gland secretions of male muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) or Asian bull elephants (Elephas maximus).|$|E
25|$|Typical {{levels of}} use for <b>benzoic</b> acid as a {{preservative}} in food are between 0.05–0.1%. Foods in which <b>benzoic</b> acid {{may be used}} and maximum levels for its application are controlled by international food law.|$|E
25|$|This {{last step}} was {{achieved}} some {{few months later}} (1832) by Justus von Liebig and Friedrich Wöhler, who determined the composition of <b>benzoic</b> acid. These latter also investigated how hippuric acid is related to <b>benzoic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid is a {{precursor}} to benzoyl chloride, C6H5C(O)Cl by treatment with thionyl chloride, phosgene {{or one of the}} chlorides of phosphorus. Benzoyl chloride is an important starting material for several <b>benzoic</b> acid derivates like benzyl benzoate, which is used in artificial flavours and insect repellents.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid {{is present}} {{as part of}} hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine) in urine of mammals, {{especially}} herbivores (Gr. hippos = horse; ouron = urine). Humans produce about 0.44 g/L hippuric acid in their urine, and {{if the person is}} exposed to toluene or <b>benzoic</b> acid, it can rise above that level.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} laboratories, <b>benzoic</b> acid is {{a common}} standard for calibrating a bomb calorimeter.|$|E
25|$|In the Lummus Process, the {{oxidation}} of toluene to <b>benzoic</b> acid {{is conducted}} separately.|$|E
25|$|All the {{reactions}} mentioned for carboxylic acids are also possible for <b>benzoic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> {{acid esters}} {{are the product}} of the acid catalysed {{reaction}} with alcohols.|$|E
25|$|The {{more active}} <b>benzoic</b> {{anhydride}} is formed by dehydration using acetic anhydride or phosphorus pentoxide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid {{was used}} as an expectorant, analgesic, and {{antiseptic}} in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, {{research}} {{showed how}} benzene can form from <b>benzoic</b> acid {{in the presence}} of vitamin C.|$|E
25|$|In Taipei, Taiwan, a city {{health survey}} in 2010 found that 30% of dried and pickled food {{products}} had <b>benzoic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|Electrophilic {{aromatic}} substitution reaction {{will take}} place mainly in 3-position due to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic group; i.e. <b>benzoic</b> acid is meta directing.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 Salkowski {{discovered}} the antifungal abilities of <b>benzoic</b> acid, {{which was used}} {{for a long time}} in the preservation of benzoate-containing cloudberry fruits.|$|E
25|$|Like other {{nitriles}} and amides, benzonitrile and benzamide can be hydrolyzed to <b>benzoic</b> acid or its {{conjugate base}} in acid or basic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} that <b>benzoic</b> acid and its salts may react with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in some soft drinks, forming small quantities of benzene.|$|E
25|$|The {{reduction}} of anisole {{is one of}} the simplest examples and is shown in equation 1. The {{reduction of}} <b>benzoic</b> acid is illustrated in equation 2.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{synthesis}} of <b>benzoic</b> acid from phenylmagnesium bromide and dry ice. <b>Benzoic</b> acid is more soluble in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane or diethyl ether, and when shaken with this organic solvent in a separatory funnel, will preferentially dissolve in the organic layer. The other reaction products, including the magnesium bromide, will remain in the aqueous layer, clearly showing that separation based on solubility is achieved. This process, known as liquid–liquid extraction, is an important technique in synthetic chemistry. Recycling is used to ensure maximum extraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid amides {{are more}} easily {{available}} by using activated acid derivatives (such as benzoyl chloride) or by coupling reagents used in peptide synthesis like DCC and DMAP.|$|E
25|$|Rearrangement of diketones in the {{benzilic acid}} {{rearrangement}} involving {{the generation of}} <b>benzoic</b> acids are the von Richter reaction from nitrobenzenes and the Kolbe–Schmitt reaction from phenols.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid is {{produced}} commercially by partial oxidation of toluene with oxygen. The process is catalyzed by cobalt or manganese naphthenates. The process uses abundant materials, and proceeds in high yield.|$|E
25|$|<b>Benzoic</b> acid was {{discovered}} in the sixteenth century. The dry distillation of gum benzoin was first described by Nostradamus (1556), and then by Alexius Pedemontanus (1560) and Blaise de Vigenère (1596).|$|E
25|$|Benzyl {{alcohol is}} refluxed with {{potassium}} permanganate or other oxidizing reagents in water. The mixture is hot filtered to remove manganese dioxide and then allowed to cool to afford <b>benzoic</b> acid.|$|E
25|$|The copper catalysed {{decarboxylation}} of benzoate to benzene may be {{effected by}} heating in quinoline. Also, Hunsdiecker decarboxylation {{can be achieved}} by forming the silver salt and heating. <b>Benzoic</b> acid can also be decarboxylated by heating with an alkali hydroxide or calcium hydroxide.|$|E
25|$|Centipede defences include {{their speed}} and venomous forcipules, {{as well as}} the {{secretion}} of defensive chemicals. Geophilomorph centipedes can secrete sticky substances that generate toxic hydrogen cyanide and <b>benzoic</b> acid from microscopic glands on their undersides. Similarly, lithobiomorph centipedes secrete a sticky substance from glands in the rear-most two pairs of legs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physodic acid mentioned above, P.furfuracea also contains 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,6-dimethyl <b>benzoic</b> acid, atranorin, oxyphysodic acid, and virensic acid. Of these compounds, atranorin showed the highest inhibition of proteolytic enzymes trypsin and porcine pancreatic elastase. Research suggests that the biosynthesis of both atranorin and physodic acid {{is influenced by the}} cooperation of epiphytic bacteria.|$|E
