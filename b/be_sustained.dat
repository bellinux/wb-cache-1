5|$|There {{used to be}} {{two large}} geysers fields in Nevada—Beowawe and Steamboat Springs—but they were {{destroyed}} by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants.

5|$|Bats possess highly adapted lung {{systems to}} cope with the {{pressures}} of powered-flight. Flight is an energetically taxing aerobic activity and requires large amounts of oxygen to <b>be</b> <b>sustained.</b> In bats, the relative alveolar surface area and pulmonary capillary blood volume are significantly larger than most other small quadrupedal mammals. Due to the restraints of the mammalian lungs, bats cannot maintain high-altitude flight.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would <b>be</b> <b>sustained</b> would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E
5|$|Colin McRae Rally is a rally racing {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} Codemasters. It was originally released for iOS mobile devices in June 2013, and then ported to Android devices and OS X and Windows personal computers (PCs) in 2014. Gameplay is similar to early iterations of the Colin McRae Rally series of racing games with content predominantly taken from the 2000 title Colin McRae Rally 2.0. Players can drive cars and participate in point-to-point rally events, competing against times recorded by computer drivers. Stages take place in several different locations with varied terrain like tarmac and gravel. The game features damage modelling and chassis deformation effects that can <b>be</b> <b>sustained</b> from collisions.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not <b>be</b> <b>sustained.</b> One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to that of the {{original}} game in which players control Sir Daniel Fortesque as he travels through Gallowmere to stop the evil Zarok. Dan can utilize a variety of weapons, including close range weapons such as swords and axes to long ranged weapons such as throwing knives and crossbows. If Dan defeats enough enemies to collect the Chalice of Souls hidden throughout each level, he will be able to travel to the Hall of Heroes, where a legendary hero rewards him by giving him a new weapon or other helpful items. Dan possesses a single life bar throughout the game, which can <b>be</b> <b>sustained</b> by collecting Life Bottles throughout the game which can be replenished by energy vials and Life Fountains. The remastered version also includes some exclusive arcade-style minigames which can also be played over online multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Herds {{of red and}} {{fallow deer}} also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can <b>be</b> <b>sustained.</b> Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer, which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E

5|$|His reign {{was marked}} by {{multiple}} wars with the Lombards, a Germanic people who {{had arrived in the}} former Roman province of Pannonia under the leadership of their king, Audoin. Thurisind also had to face the hostility of the Byzantine Empire, which was resentful of the Gepid takeover of Sirmium and anxious to diminish Gepid power in the Pannonian Basin, a plain covering most of modern Hungary and partly including the bordering states. The Byzantines' plans to reduce the Gepids' power took effect when Audoin decisively defeated Thurisind in 551 or 552. The Byzantine Emperor Justinian forced a peace accord on both leaders so that equilibrium in the Pannonian Basin could <b>be</b> <b>sustained.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway branch lines had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not <b>be</b> <b>sustained</b> when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E

Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified.

5|$|On 12December 1979, {{in light}} of a {{build-up}} of Warsaw Pact nuclear capabilities in Europe, ministers approved the deployment of US GLCM cruise missiles and PershingII theatre nuclear weapons in Europe.

Similarly, in 1983–84, responding to the stationing of Warsaw Pact SS-20 medium-range missiles in Europe, NATO deployed modern Pershing II missiles tasked to hit military targets such as tank formations {{in the event of}} war.
