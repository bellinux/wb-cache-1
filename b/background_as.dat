5|$|Liman's directorial {{method was}} often hands-on. Many times he {{operated}} the camera himself {{in order to}} create what he believed was a more intimate relationship between himself, the material, and the actors. He felt that this connection was lost if he simply observed the recording on a monitor. This was a mindset he developed from his <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a small-scale indie film maker.|$|E

For the video, the singer wears an archival corset by Christian Lacroix, lace gloves by Chanel, and a crystal mask by Atelier Swarovski.|$|E

5|$|After a naval career lasting {{more than}} forty years, in 1912 he was {{appointed}} First Sea Lord, the professional head of the British naval service. With World War I looming, he took steps to ready the British fleet for combat, but his <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a German prince forced his retirement once the war began, when anti-German sentiment was running high. He changed his name and relinquished his German titles, {{at the behest of}} King George V, in 1917.|$|E

She feels sick and leaves the computer, and later on calls her mom, Margaret (Sheila Larken). When she realizes her phone is tapped, she looks outside {{the window to see}} if anyone is out there.

5|$|In 1955, the {{inhabitants}} of the French-administered Saar Protectorate voted to join West Germany. Since its establishment as a separate French protectorate in 1947, the Saar had a white Nordic cross on a blue and red <b>background</b> <b>as</b> its flag. To demonstrate the commitment of the Saar {{to be a part of}} West Germany, a new flag was selected on 9 July 1956: the black-red-gold tricolour defaced with the new coat of arms, also proposed on this day. This flag came into force on 1 January 1957, upon the establishment of the Saarland as a state of West Germany.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E
5|$|Massino testified {{again in}} the 2012 {{extortion}} trial of Genovese capo Anthony Romanello, primarily to provide <b>background</b> <b>as</b> {{an expert on the}} American Mafia. While Massino had not worked closely with Romanello, prosecutors decided to use him after another mobster-turned-witness was dropped; the case ended in an acquittal. Massino had also been considered as a witness in the 2013 murder trial of Colombo acting boss Joel Cacace, but was dropped after he was unable to fully remember the meeting where he claimed Cacace indicated his involvement in the murder of NYPD officer Ralph Dols.|$|E

Totti was named the Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year for both 2000 and 2001, and won the Serie A Footballer of the Year Award {{for the first time}} in his career in 2000. He received his first Ballon d'Or nomination in 2000, finishing 14th in voting, and fifth the following year.

5|$|Since {{before the}} Civil War, {{the two major}} parties were the Republicans and the Democrats, and {{after the end of the}} Reconstruction Era in 1877, the {{national}} electorate was closely divided between them. Party membership was only partly based on ideology; party identification often reflected ethnic and religious <b>background,</b> <b>as</b> well as Civil War loyalties that were still keenly felt by many voters. Most Northern Protestants voted Republican, as did black Southerners. On the other hand, white Southerners and Northern Catholics generally voted Democratic.|$|E
5|$|The Flavians, {{although}} a relatively short-lived dynasty, helped restore stability to an empire on its knees. Although all three have been criticised, especially {{based on their}} more centralised style of rule, they issued reforms that created a stable enough empire to last well into the 3rd century. However, their <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a military dynasty led to further marginalisation of the senate, and a conclusive move away from princeps, or first citizen, and toward imperator, or emperor.|$|E

5|$|The {{distance}} to the IK Pegasi system can be measured directly by observing the tiny parallax shifts of this system (against the more distant stellar <b>background)</b> <b>as</b> the Earth orbits around the Sun. This shift was measured to high precision by the Hipparcos spacecraft, yielding a distance estimate of 150 light years (with an accuracy of ±5 light years). The same spacecraft also measured the proper motion of this system. This is the small angular motion of IK Pegasi across the sky because of its motion through space.|$|E
5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to minors. Yee's <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed {{that the government had}} strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his <b>background</b> <b>as</b> a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable to afford a full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|Written by Phil Ford. This story {{idea was}} planned as fourth {{episode of the}} second series.

5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School {{and one by one}} the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access to all of the club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the <b>background</b> <b>as</b> their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|As {{the train}} departs King's Cross, Hedwig the owl flies {{alongside}} while {{passing through the}} outskirts of London. Hedwig flies away and Dementors arrive from over the nearby buildings. At the same time Harry, Ron, and Hermione pass along the corridor side of the carriage looking for food. The journey enters a tunnel; upon its exit, it passes by Malfoy Manor during a stormy night. Next, the train passes through a second tunnel and {{the lights in the}} compartments go out as a Dementor enters the train and passes along the corridor; Harry Potter uses his magic to defeat the Dementor. After exiting the tunnel, riders are greeted by Hagrid flying on a motorbike with Hogwarts in the <b>background.</b> <b>As</b> the train enters a forest, the flying Ford Anglia appears and starts driving through the terrain. The car crashes soon after and the train leaves the forest, passing by Hogwarts once again before arriving at Hogsmeade Station with Hagrid greeting passengers.|$|E
