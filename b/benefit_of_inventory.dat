B) Settlement of an inheritors calling mechanism, {{especially in the}} event of a Power of Appointment (the representative has some disposition capabilities on the inheritance), with remission to the moment of its exercise (#17). C) Regulation of the Heir and Legatee Status, including presumptions of the Heir Status of certain Legatees (# 19 & 20). D) A definition of the Inheritance debts, which includes the maintenance payable to the deceased’s descendants; and the establishment of a responsibility for the inheritance debts limited to the value, in the moment of the call to the successor, of de assets acquired (#21). A system for separating the inherintace´s and the heirs´s own goods and debts. E) The forced succession regulation is extended to all the Basque Autonomic Community and the forced portion reduced to 1/3 of the patrimony net value (#49). Ancestors are excluded from forced succession (#47). F) The traditional widow allowance is extended with a Right of habitation in the spouses’ home during widowhood. G) The intestate succession provisions splits between Trunk Lineage Statutory assets and the rest of the deceased’s patrimony (#111 & 112). This intestate succession passes by right of representation to the issue of a deceased’s beneficiary (#113 & 116.2). In non Trunk real state the subsequent intestate successors are: The descendants, the widow/er (#114), ascendants (#115), collateral ancestors (#116), and if there is no surviving person within the Basque Community Administration escheats the assets as a trustee to pass to herself, to the County Council of the deceased’s last residence and to the municipality of the latter last residence, by third parts and by means of <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory.</b> Therefore, an overall intestate succession system is generated to any Basque Community civil residents.

40|$|The {{doctoral}} thesis concerns the debt and liability of the legatee. The theme {{of interest is}} the succesional law. In Italian civil law succession may be legal or testamentary. The testator may establish an heir, which became sole heir or legatee. The general rule is that only the heir is liable for debts of the deceased; the legatee does not. The legate is responsible, if the testator has him imposed the payment of a debt. But the legatee responds {{within the limits of}} what was received (intra vires liability). Equally, if the good received is encumbered by mortgages and the legatee suffers enforcement. In any case, as a general rule, the creditor must apply to the heir, not to legatee (which has not any passive legitimation for the debts of the deceased). However, there are cases where the legatee should return the good received, when the heritage is insufficient to satisfy hereditary creditors (for example, separation of assets, acceptance with the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory).</b> Thus hereditary creditors may proceed by way of recourse against the legatee, although he didn’t have a debt. You must then remeditate the general principle that a legatee is not responsible for any hereditary debt, because there are cases of liability without debt. In this regard can be very useful dating german theory of “liability without debt”. Today this theory is, at least in Italy, entirely in the minority. However the distinction of the two elements of the obligation (debt and liability) is useful to describe and justify the fortunes of the obligations and the final allocation of "duty". With regard to the legatee, his position in relation to the debts or weights of the heritage can be varied, because the landscape of possible obligations that the legatee may, exceptionally, suffer is heterogeneous. The hypothesis of "liability" of the legatee is divided into four areas: 1) 	obligations of the legatee (modus, sub-legacy, testamentary autonomy of imposition debts, charges on things uncumbered) : distinguishing between obligations of the legatee and succession of the legatee in debts, these weights are settled by the succession rules. In case of modus and sub-legacy the legatee does not pay any debt of the testator, or a debt (in technical sense) of the heritage. Finally in the case of art. 668 cod. civ. They are not debts or charges of the heritage, but weights of loads imposed on the object of good lefted. 2) 	distinction between be liable and suffer weights (reduction action, lifetime allowance in favour of unrecognizable natural son, separation of assets of the deceased, lying inheritance, acceptance with the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory).</b> In the case of separation of assets and b. i., then, the legatee has not any debt, but his position is comparable to that of a purchaser of an asset encumbered by a real mortgage. 3) 	Patrimonial warranty of legatee (mortgage action and discovery of testament). We keep the conceptual autonomy of these cases from mortgage, because the mortgage action is comparable to real constraint that is realized with separation of assets, but it is different, because the mortgage is a specific constraint causally linked to a particular credit. With the mortgage liability in near to an abstraction, but causally tied to that particular credit. The ancillary characteristic of mortgage draws attention to the configurability of a case of responsibility without debt. Even if {{you do not want to}} agree to that theory (today a minority, though not entirely abandoned), the legatee suffer a warranty, different and more specific than that seen in the second macro-area. With the action of recourse in the case of b. i., the legatee does not suffer any debt of the testator, but a weight equal to its legacy. 4) 	debt and liability determinate by other rules (legacy of firma, company, usufruct, succession in the condominium, in the lease and in cooperative societies). In these cases the source of debt and responsibility doesn’t lie in any succession rules, but in the rules of the statement in which the legatee takes over. Therefore, the position of the legatee can be varied and complex. However, with regard to the specific aspect of succession in hereditary debts general principles are effective and good. All thing considered, the summa divisio lies on the distinction between succession and other rules. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} strategic management accounting perspective <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> routing. The thesis studies the drivers of cost efficiency gains {{by identifying the}} role of the underlying cost structure, demand, information sharing, forecasting accuracy, service levels, vehicle fleet, planning horizon and other strategic factors as well as the interaction effects among these factors with respect to performance outcomes. The task is to enhance the knowledge of the strategic situations that favor the implementation <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> routing systems, understanding cause-and-effect relationships, linkages and gaining a holistic view of the value proposition <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> routing. The thesis applies an exploratory case study design, which is based on normative quantitative empirical research using optimization, simulation and factor analysis. Data and results are drawn from a real world application to cash supply chains. The first research paper shows that performance gains require a common cost component and cannot be explained by simple linear or affine cost structures. Inventory management and distribution decisions become separable {{in the absence of a}} set-dependent cost structure, and neither economies of scope nor coordination problems are present in this case. The second research paper analyzes whether information sharing improves the overall forecasting accuracy. Analysis suggests that the potential for information sharing is limited to coordination of replenishments and that central information do not yield more accurate forecasts based on joint forecasting. The third research paper develops a novel formulation <b>of</b> the stochastic <b>inventory</b> routing model that accounts for minimal service levels and forecasting accuracy. The developed model allows studying the interaction of minimal service levels and forecasting accuracy with the underlying cost structure in inventory routing. Interestingly, results show that the factors minimal service level and forecasting accuracy are not statistically significant, and subsequently not relevant for the strategic decision problem to introduce inventory routing, or in other words, to effectively internalize inventory management and distribution decisions at the supplier. Consequently the main contribution of this thesis is the result that cost <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> routing are derived from the joint decision model that accounts for the underlying set-dependent cost structure rather than the level of information sharing. This result suggests that the value of information sharing <b>of</b> demand and <b>inventory</b> data is likely to be overstated in prior literature. In other words, cost <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> routing are primarily determined by the cost structure (i. e. level of fixed costs and transportation costs) rather than the level of information sharing, joint forecasting, forecasting accuracy or service levels...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{demand and}} {{inventory}} planners at NIKE Always Available (NIKE's replenishment business) experience difficulty in managing long-lifecycle highly-seasonal products like soccer equipment and fleece apparel. Very often items are either stocked out at retailers or piling up at Distribution Centers (DCs). NIKE manages inventory to a 95 % item fill rate for all replenishment products. Highly seasonal products generally have unpredictable demand patterns {{which lead to}} either stock outs or excess inventory. These imbalances in inventory occur without fully understanding the cost and <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> holding the <b>inventory.</b> To understand the cost and <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> holding <b>inventory</b> for long lifecycle highly seasonal products, the author analyzed the current profitability, revenue, service level, and <b>inventory</b> position <b>of</b> soccer equipment, sandals, and fleece apparel. From these results, the author modeled the benefits to the above metrics <b>of</b> managing <b>inventory</b> via a dynamic service level approach that varies the service level over the season. Next, the author modeled the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> managing <b>inventory</b> via dual-sourcing. Lastly, the author modeled the profitability impact of reducing lead times for these items. These models have shown that long lead times and high seasonality are key drivers of large safety stock quantities. Also, with highly seasonal long lead time products, dynamically managing the service level by increasing the service level {{at the beginning of}} a product's life and lowering it in its last season of life offers greater profitability than managing to a static service level. Lastly, there is an opportunity to increase the profitability of these products by changing the supply chain to enable dual-sourcing or by reducing lead times. by John H. Kang. Thesis: M. B.

40|$|Dams affect {{rivers and}} other {{freshwater}} ecosystems around the world. The structural performance and service delivery of many dams has seldom been assessed; many are unsafe {{and no longer}} deliver designed benefits.

This creates an opportunity during relicensing for modification or removal of dams to render them safe, maximise their services and minimise social and environmental impacts. We examined case studies of reassessment of dams from Australia (New South Wales), China, France and the United States that illustrated the following: the management challenge of aging and unsafe dams; unrealised opportunities to improve environmental, social and economic benefits; and the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> and relicensing systems.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{focuses on}} three axes: economic, {{social and environmental}} development. Since previous efforts were concentrated on cost reduction strategies, managers are now confronted with greater threats. They still have to supply the right quantities {{at the right moment}} at minimum cost while making environmental and societal improvements. In light of these new challenges, inventory control might offer an effective solution to integrate the sustainability issues. This work highlights the role <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> control in achieving sustainable objectives. Our aim is to advance understanding of the potential <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> control in the quest of building sustainable supply chains. In Chapter 1, we found that while the understanding of the effect of sustainable considerations at the strategic level is more mature, at the tactical level it is in its infancy. There is little or no knowledge about the role <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> control in regard to sustainable development. Our aim is to contribute in filling the gaps. In Chapter 2, we explored how to incorporate environmental policies into inventory control. To this end, we studied an infinite horizon inventory problem with remanufacturing subject to carbon abatement regulations. We provided insights into the structure <b>of</b> new <b>inventory</b> and carbon management policies. Ultimately, we showed the economic and environmental advantages from restructured inventory policies. In Chapter 3, we extended our results to a finite horizon context. We addressed the effect of environmental parameters on production planning, and on inventory control decisions. The proposed model brought out the computational issues of the added complexities. A metaheuristic approach is then proposed. In Chapter 4, we investigated combining strategic and tactical planning. We stressed the financial and environmental <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> such an integrated approach. Finally, we conclude this thesis with our general conclusion which brings together lessons learned and points out further perspectives. This thesis provides a comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> control to improve the sustainable performance of firms. Our findings enable us to place inventory control as a complementary approach to emission mitigation and cost control. Inventory policies must be redesigned to cope with environmental policies and to transform regulations into opportunities. Ultimately, this restructuring would 1) give more flexibility to the firm to respond to additional uncertainties from environmental issues, 2) balance production capacities, demand, and environmental requirements, and 3) release the potential of the carbon market to maximize the long-term profit while minimizing the environmental effects of production processes. Besides, our findings present multiple practical implications. Firstly, decision-makers can foresee threatening situations. Secondly, policy-makers can take advantage of our findings to define more appropriate enforcement levels. Finally, communities with carbon intensive businesses would benefit from a reduction in the environmental impact of manufacturing activities...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a discrete-time supply chain for perishable goods having separate demand streams for items of different ages. For a good that has two periods of lifetime, we build {{a model that}} generalizes and/or subsumes many of the models in the literature and study the effectiveness of two intuitive heuristic (base-stock) replenishment policies combined with different substitution rules. For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> aged items, ordering a constant amount each period. Thus the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> pooling <b>inventory</b> for substitutable, perishable products depends critically on the replenishment policy used. inventory management, perishable goods, substitution, heuristics...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{magnitude}} {{of the increase in}} stockouts The empirical analysis in the paper finds that, on average, taking on high leverage increases stockouts by about 8 to 9 percent. To put this magnitude in perspective, I construct an estimate of the profit impact of an 8 percent increase in stockouts for the average supermarket firm. The calculation, which is presented in Panel A of Table A 1, trades off the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> reduced <b>inventory</b> investment for the lost profits from forgone current and future sales. The value <b>of</b> reduced <b>inventory</b> investment equals the decrease in inventories times the cost <b>of</b> carrying <b>inventory,</b> which includes storage, utilities, handling, insurance, taxes, obsolescence, and the cost of capital. On the other hand, more frequent stockouts reduce current sales when customers substitute to lowervalue products or cancel their intended purchase of the out-of-stock item. The profit impactof this substitution equals the value of forgone sales (which others have estimated based on surveys of customer substitution patterns) times the gross margin on these products. More frequent stockouts also have a longer-run impact on sales in that the firm is likely to lose customers when its reputation for service deteriorates. Assuming the firm forgoes sales to a lost customer in perpetuity, the profit impact of customer switching equals the value of forgone annual sales time...|$|R

This book has been written to enhance understanding of the uncertainty encountered in estimating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and in dealing with the challenges resulting from those estimates. Such challenges include, {{but are not limited to}} i) monitoring emissions; ii) adhering to emission commitmets; iii) securing the proper functioning of emission trading markets; and iv) meeting low-carbon or low-GHG futures in the long term. The approaches to addressing uncertainty discussed by all authors attempt to improve national inventories, not only for their own sake but also from a wider, systems analytical perspective that seeks to strengthen their usefulness under a compliance and/or global monitoring and reporting framework. These approaches show the challenges and <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> including <b>inventory</b> uncertainty in policy analysis and where advances are being made...|$|R
40|$|Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) {{systems and}} the health sector of a country taken {{together}} can become a force which could save millions of public money and which could take the health sector to the next level. This statement may seem unrealistic and impractical. ERP systems are typically the largest, most complex, and most demanding information systems implemented by firms, representing a major departure from the individual and departmental information systems prevalent in the past. However, ERP systems have evolved to be the force behind many organizations around the globe by integrating all the key functions and by assisting better and timely decision making. This research is the quest {{to find out the}} feasibility of implementing an ERP system for the health sector in Sri Lanka, focusing on the cost <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> medical stock optimization. Literature was reviewed in order to study ERP systems, usage of Information Technology in Health Sector, Health Information Systems and global case studies of HIS, ERP system implementations on health sector and ROI from stock optimization. After analyzing the Sri Lankan health sector as an overview with all the cost drivers, the cost of medical drugs and cost <b>of</b> <b>inventory</b> were focused. The market leaders in ERP systems such as SAP, Oracle and Microsoft Dynamics have come with healthcare ERP solutions with several success stories. After building a solid theoretical background on stock optimization through ERP systems, the ROI was calculated. The annual cost saving for the health sector by stock optimization by implementing an ERP system was calculated to be around 817. 6 Million Sri Lankan Rupees while the cost of implementing an ERP system would cost around 624. 7 Million Sri Lankan Rupees. The financial <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> better <b>inventory</b> management through an ERP system alone would recover the cost of an ERP system. Other savings include improvements in Human Resources Management, Asset Management, Financial Management and overall organizational monitoring. These benefits will result in better customer service, which can be in the extent of saving human lives...|$|R
40|$|AdvanRobot {{proposes a}} new robot for inventorying and {{locating}} all the products inside a retail store {{without the need}} of installing any fixed infrastructure. The patent pending robot combines a laser-guided autonomous robotic base with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) payload composed of several RFID readers and antennas, {{as well as a}} 3 D camera. AdvanRobot is able not only to replace human operators, but to dramatically increase the efficiency and accuracy in providing inventory, while also adding the capacity to produce store maps and product location. Some important <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inventory</b> capabilities <b>of</b> AdvanRobot are the reduction in stock-outs, which can cause a drop in sales and are the most important source of frustration for customers; the reduction of the number of items per reference maximizing the number of references per square meter; and reducing the cost of capital due to over-stocking [1, 7]. Another important economic benefit expected from the inventorying and location capabilities of the robot is the ability to efficiently prepare on-line orders from the closest store to the customer, allowing retailers to compete with the likes of Amazon (a. k. a. omnichannel retail). Additionally, the robot enables to: produce a 3 D model of the store; detect misplaced items; and assist customers and staff in finding products (wayfinding) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of greenhouse gases}} emitted to and removed from the atmosphere is high on the international political and scientific agendas. Growing international concern and cooperation regarding the climate change problem have increased the need for policy-oriented solutions {{to the issue of}} uncertainty in, and related to, <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The approaches to addressing uncertainty discussed in this Special Issue reflect attempts to improve national inventories, not only for their own sake but also from a wider, systems analytical perspective - a perspective that seeks to strengthen the usefulness <b>of</b> national <b>inventories</b> under a compliance and/or global monitoring and reporting framework. These approaches demonstrate the <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> including <b>inventory</b> uncertainty in policy analyses. The authors of the contributed papers show that considering uncertainty helps avoid situations that can, for example, create a false sense of certainty or lead to invalid views of subsystems. This may eventually prevent related errors from showing up in analyses. However, considering uncertainty does not come for free. Proper treatment of uncertainty is costly and demanding because it forces us to make the step from "simple to complex" and only then to discuss potential simplifications. Finally, comprehensive treatment of uncertainty does not offer policymakers quick and easy solutions. The authors of the papers in this Special Issue do, however, agree that uncertainty analysis must be a key component <b>of</b> national GHG <b>inventory</b> analysis. Uncertainty analysis helps to provide a greater understanding and better science helps us to reduce and deal with uncertainty. By recognizing the importance of identifying and quantifying uncertainties, great strides can be made in ongoing discussions regarding GHG inventories and accounting for climate change. The 17 papers in this Special Issue deal with many aspects of analyzing and dealing with uncertainty in emissions estimates...|$|R
40|$|In today's {{competitive}} business world, companies require shorter lead times, low {{costs and}} high customer service levels and faster cash flows, to survive. Because of this, companies {{have become more}} customer focused. The result is that companies have been putting in significant effort to reduce their inventory levels. The purpose of this master thesis is to analyse the adaptation <b>of</b> lean <b>inventory</b> in customised product manufacturing environment where high variable and low volume products are produced. The methodology {{is based on an}} action based case study at Avery Dennison Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, which is a label manufacturer. All processes from receiving an order to delivery of the order were mapped in a Value Stream Map and ideal state is also mapped applying standard lean applications. The variability of products and dynamics of orders were analysed and they were compared with the capacity mix. The after state was implemented with reduced inventory levels and the company experienced several problems due to reduced inventory levels. Some problems were manageable through standard lean applications. Due to high variable nature of the products, some of the elements in the future stare could not be managed as planned. This thesis critically reviews the difficulties and their relevance with high variable nature of the product. This thesis develops some recommendations to help reduce non-value adding time and improve lead time with the help of lean. production principles mainly by reducing the inventories. It also recommends some 'extended application {{in order to get the}} maximum <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> lean <b>inventory</b> in a customised product manufacturing environment...|$|R
