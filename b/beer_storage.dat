Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the <b>beer</b> requires long <b>storage</b> before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|R

The cool seasons were chosen {{to minimize the risk}} of fire when boiling mashed grain into wort. Numerous conflagrations had occurred, resulting in the prohibition of brewing during the summer months.

40|$|Flavor {{quality is}} of major {{importance}} to the consumer, but the flavor characteristics of beer appear to deteriorate greatly with time, at a rate depending on {{the composition of the}} <b>beer</b> and its <b>storage</b> conditions (notably pH). Prior to identifying the influence of pH {{on the development of the}} most intense staling flavors found in aged lager beers, the corresponding key flavor compounds were determined by aroma extract dilution analysis. In addition to trans- 2 -nonenal, beta-damascenone seems at least as important in the flavor of aged beer. Ethyl butyrate, dimethyl trisulfide, 2 -acetylpyrazine, 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, 2 -methoxypyrazine, maltol, gamma-nonalactone, and ethyl cinnamate are also relevant to the sensory profile of aged beer. Upon aging, a beer having a higher pH produces less beta-damascenone, because acid-catalyzed glycoside hydrolysis is decreased. On the other hand, it produces more 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde, owing to Strecker degradation of methionine. Raising the beer pH additionally causes the release of 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde from sulfitic adducts. These adducts, more stable at a lower pH, protect the aldehyde against premature oxidation to 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid, thus making it available for dimethyl trisulfide formation during aging...|$|R

Lactic acid was a major compound during storage, and acetic acid was found at a detectable level of 1. 26 mg/mL after the third day at ambient temperature. The ethanol contents increased significantly at ambient temperature after two days and then decreased but showed a fair decrease at 4 °C.

5000|$|The area now {{comprising}} Benton Park proper {{was first}} used as the City Cemetery, from 1842-1865. Those buried in the cemetery were relocated in 1865, and the neighborhood was created on June 25, 1866, by city ordinance. [...] The site of the park was originally 17 acres, but was reduced to 14 1/3 acres to accommodate perimeter streets. Noted horticulturist Edward F. Krausnick landscaped the park, incorporating a greenhouse, a footbridge, and two ponds. The park was used for botanical instruction and community activities and today is a popular recreational area. Originally named City Park, the park was later renamed after Thomas Hart Benton, the first U.S. Senator representing the people of Missouri. As the neighborhood grew, it attracted several breweries due to its location above a system of caves that were ideal for <b>beer</b> <b>storage,</b> or [...] "lagering" [...] in German, {{as many of the}} popular German styles require.

40|$|Iso-α-acids are quantitatively {{the most}} {{important}} hop-derived fraction in beer. In addition to CO 2 and ethanol, iso-α-acids are considered the primary beer flavour components. They impart the typical bitter taste and depending on the desired beer bitterness, their concentration varies from 10 up to 100 mg/L, according to the beer type. This article is to give a review on the knowledge about the formation of iso-α-acids and the mechanisms of their degradation in the <b>beer</b> matrix during <b>storage.</b> Iso-α-acids arise from the isomerisation of hop α-acids during wort boiling. In addition to the isomerisation reaction, the beer’s bitter acids degradation has extensively been studied. Iso-α-acids are subjected to both oxidative and nonoxidative transformations. As a result, both the intensity {{and the quality of}} the beer bitterness are adversely affected. Both trans- and cis-iso-α-acids are susceptible to degradation in the presence of reactive oxygen species and light. Stored in the dark, trans-iso-α-acids in beer were found to be markedly more unstable than their cis-counterparts, and a harshy, lingering bitter taste simultaneously develops. This flavour defect occurring during beer ageing is attributed to the proton-catalysed cyclisation of trans-iso-α-acids into tri- and tetracyclic degradation products. These non-volatile degradation products of trans-iso-α-acids have only recently been identified. In contrast, only few reports deal with the formation of volatiles from iso-α-acids upon beer ageing. The relation between bitter acids degradation and aldehyde formation is cited in this review. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Beer is an {{extremely}} complex mixture of more than 3, 000 different compounds in an aqueous environment. Thus, it is perhaps {{not surprising that the}} maintenance of beer quality throughout its lifetime has been a considerable challenge for brewers. Whilst it is inevitable that chemical changes will occur in beer with the passage of time, it is the formation of flavor-active components which is of immediate concern to an overview of beer shelf life stability. Sulfur dioxide has long been recognized by brewers as {{the most important factor in}} delaying flavor staling, and prolonging the shelf life of beer. However, nowadays, sulfur dioxide and sulfites are considered allergens and concerns about the safety of their use as food additives have been on the increase. The present review is structured into three main parts. Firstly, the chemical properties of sulfur dioxide are presented, along with the toxic effects and maximum legal levels permitted according to U. S. and EU legislation. As the accurate determination of the free, bound and total sulfur dioxide in beer is essential to ensuring regulatory compliance, several methods have been developed for analyzing sulfur dioxide in beer. Thus, secondly, various types of methods are reported and compared with the officially recommended ones. Finally, the crucial role of sulfite in the control of flavor instability of beer is discussed in light of the current data. Two courses of action have been proposed, which are elucidated in detail relating firstly to the fact that sulfite inhibits <b>beer</b> oxidation during <b>storage</b> by acting as an antioxidant and, secondly, sulfite reacts with the carbonyl staling compounds in beer, and thereby masks stale flavors...|$|R
40|$|Problem of {{aluminium}} in beer has been elaborated in several papers {{over the last}} decade. However, the effect {{of aluminium}} on organoleptic properties of beer has been observed in few papers {{where it has been}} stated that aluminium gives beer a »metallic« and bitter flavour without any observations on particular aroma compound changes. Also, the number of reports on precise changes of aroma components throughout different storage conditions is surprisingly scarce. In order to investigate the changes of aluminium concentration along with aroma compound changes, graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectrophotometry (GF-AAS) with Zeeman background correction and gas chromatography with static headspace sampler (GC-HSS) were used in this work. Analyses were conducted periodically throughout seven months of storage on three different brands of beer from name breweries. Samples were taken before and after filling in aluminium cans. One part of samples was stored in a refrigerator (4 °C) and the other in a thermostatic chamber (22 °C). The effects of <b>beer</b> brand and <b>storage</b> conditions on aluminium concentration and level of aroma compounds were measured. To prove the effect of aluminium concentration on the changes of aroma compounds, the adequate level of aluminium sulphate was added to bottled beer samples stored at 28 °C. Although different beer types showed significantly different aluminium concentration, it could be the result of other factors (different batches of identical beer type showed significantly different aluminium concentration as well). Samples that were stored in the refrigerator were protected from aluminium migration from the can to the beer and showed increased aroma stability. Level of aroma constituents of analyzed beer brands was significantly different. Elevated aluminium concentration did not have any noticeable effect on the level of aroma compounds in beer samples stored at 28 °C...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it was {{reported}} that furfuryl ethyl ether is an important flavor compound indicative of <b>beer</b> <b>storage</b> and aging conditions. A study of the reaction mechanism indicates that furfuryl ethyl ether is most likely formed by protonation of furfuryl alcohol or furfuryl acetate followed by S(N) 2 -substitution of the leaving group by the nucleophilic ethanol. For the reaction in beer, a pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics was derived. A close correlation was found between the values predicted by the kinetic model and the actual furfuryl ethyl ether concentration evolution during storage of beer. Furthermore, 10 commercial beers of different types, aged during 4 years in natural conditions, were analyzed, and {{it was found that the}} furfuryl ethyl ether flavor threshold was largely exceeded in each type of beer. In these natural aging conditions, lower pH, darker color, and higher alcohol content were factors that enhanced furfuryl ethyl ether formation. On the other hand, sulfite clearly reduced furfuryl ethyl ether formation. All results show that the furfuryl ethyl ether concentration is an excellent time-temperature integrator for <b>beer</b> <b>storage.</b> status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Eight {{commercial}} beers (3 lager beers, 2 dark ales and 3 high-alcoholic ales) were aged for {{one year}} under normal storage conditions, and the changes with time of flavour profile and the concentration of 15 volatile compounds were monitored. The compounds were chosen as markers to evaluate the importance of different reactions in the aging process of each beer type. The development of typical aging flavours during <b>beer</b> <b>storage</b> could {{be linked to the}} Maillard reaction, the formation of linear aldehydes, ester formation, ester degradation, acetal formation, etherification and the degradation of hop bitter compounds. A difference in the nature of aging flavours between lager and specialty beers was found and seemed to be mainly the result of an increased Maillard reaction in specialty beers. Based on the results, some practical strategies are proposed to improve the flavour stability, depending on the beer type. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Besides Maillard reactions, {{structural}} rearrangements of flavan- 3 -ol monomers cause color {{changes in}} beer during storage. Acetone/water-soluble fractions (70 / 30, v/v) of three lager beers {{of the same}} batch, differently stabilized before bottling in glass or poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottles, were monitored by normal-phase HPLC-ESI(-) -MS/MS over a 1 -year period of storage at 20 degrees C. In parallel, beer color was monitored by the European Brewery Convention assay. The evolution of color was similar in the silica gel-filtered beer to that in identically bottled and stored poly(vinylpolypyrrolidone) -treated samples, despite the high flavanoid dimers content of the former. On the other hand, color evolved more rapidly in the PET bottle, suggesting a key role of oxygen. The kinetics was still increased in model media containing (+) -catechin, while no color was detected when normal-phase HPLC-fractionated dimers or trimers were investigated. (+) -Catechin emerged as the precursor of less polar products, characterized by a yellow-brown color. MS/MS enabled us to identify these products as issued from the oxidation and intramolecular additions of dehydrodicatechin B 4.

40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{the main}} experimental variables, such as extraction temperature, volume of sample and the extraction time of an HS-SPME/GC-MS procedure, for profiling beer volatile analysis was evaluated using response surface methodology. A central composite circumscribed design was employed to study {{the effect of the}} experimental variables on the extraction of 28 representative volatile compounds of beer flavour profile. The parameters of the models were estimated by multiple linear regressions. The strongest influence in the volatile extraction yield was the volume of the sample (V) and the extraction temperature (T), with a positive and a negative effect, respectively. The performance characteristics of the optimised method were also determined, showing adequate linear ranges, repeatability, detection and quantification limits. The optimised methodology was applied to the same beer sample stored during 5 months at three different temperature conditions (4, 20 and 40 °C). Sampling was performed monthly, and the results showed that the concentration of most volatile compounds decreased during <b>beer</b> <b>storage,</b> although the rate of decrease was clearly higher at room temperature (20 °C) compared with refrigeration conditions (4 °C). Accelerated ageing conditions (40 °C) showed the most different volatile profile.

40|$|The {{changes of}} sensory {{properties}} during a <b>beer</b> <b>storage,</b> the so-called staling of beer, represent nowadays {{one of the}} main problems in beer research. Present knowledge does not allow full elucidation of this phenomenon and up to date there is no simple technological measure ensuring prolongation of a sensory stability of beer. A heterogeneity of investigated beers and their substantially different features are {{one of the reasons why}} technological measure devises for one kind of beer can be proved as utterly ineffective for another beer. Moreover, there are only few research papers dealing with sensory stability of Czech beers. Aldehydes are recognised as the key compounds of beer staling. Therefore, a new method was developed and successfully applied that enables determination of selected aldehydes (namely 3 -methyl-butanal, 2 -furfural and 2 E-nonenal) in beer. Contrary to other procedures, the method does not require an expensive analytical equipment, is not time consuming and provides satisfactory results. An influence of staling on wide range of chemical constituents of beer and its sensory properties during six-month storage of a typical Czech lager at 9 C was determined. From analysed compounds, a decrease of total amino acids has been proved with different susceptibility of individual amino acids to the changes. Evaluation of sensory properties showed different tendency of the samples to the changes during storage. A dominant significance of amino acid level in bottled beer and extent of its decrease during storage was established. Beers with original concentration of amino acids less than 800 mg. l- 1 showed moderate changes of sensory stability even when the amount of amino acids decreased by 6 % in comparison with beers above the limit, with the comparable decrease. In parallel samples stored at room temperature the content of furfuryl alcohol increased for which a mechanism of formation and possible connection with 2 -furfural has been proposed and a decrease of ethyl acetate was observed in comparison with fresh samples and samples stored at 9 CAvailable from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
40|$|In 2012, 4, 460 European brewers {{produced}} more than 390 million hl of beer (Berkhout et al. 2013), accounting for an annual sales value of 111 billion euro. From this economic point of view, the flavour quality of beer, i. e. a suitable combination of odour, aroma, taste, and mouthfeel, is of primary importance as it determines consumer’s acceptance or rejection. Nevertheless, all beers produced show one common problem: they all suffer from flavour instability which is currently a major quality problem for many brewers since the beer industry became globalized in the past 20 years. The {{increase in the level}} of an array of aldehydes appears to be pivotal to flavour deterioration in all ageing beers. Recently, evidence was provided for a new type of bound-state aldehydes in beer, i. e. 2 -substituted 1, 3 -thiazolidine- 4 -carboxylic acids (Baert et al. 2015). Due to the reversibility of the formation of these aldehyde-cysteine mono-adducts, these compounds may gradually release the parent aldehyde in the beer matrix and thus contribute to the increase in aldehydes during <b>beer</b> <b>storage.</b> By measuring the levels of free aldehydes with estimation of the intrinsic aldehyde content by aldehyde generation following 4 -vinylpyridine (4 -VP) addition, a new approach for the estimation of beer flavour instability is established. Beer sample aliquots were analysed for the remaining free aldehyde fraction (HS SPME GC-MS). The amount of bound aldehydes was indirectly determined by addition of the effective binding competitor 4 -VP, and subsequent quantification of released volatile aldehydes. Besides formation of bisulfite adducts, we clearly observed the high reactivity of cysteine towards ageing aldehydes. We succeeded in releasing aldehydes from these precursors in beer by adding the competitive binding agent 4 -VP, known for its reactivity towards thiols (Andrews & Dixon, 1987). A large amount of aldehydes was released from several fresh beers upon 4 -VP addition, showing that beer contains relatively high amounts of cysteine and/or bisulfite adducts. The important role of bound-state aldehydes in beer flavour instability is further supported by the results from multivariate data analysis. 4 -VP proved to release aldehydes from both cysteine and bisulfite adducts in beer, making them quantifiable as free aldehydes. When applied to fresh beer, this methodology is a fast and automated predictive tool for the estimation of the levels of free aldehydes upon ageing. A new approach for assessing the intrinsic beer flavour stability is presented. Insufficient flavour stability constitutes a serious economic threat as competition in the export countries with the locally produced and fresh beers is becoming very hard. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Several {{chemical}} and molecular changes result in beer off-flavors which become recognizable {{after a certain}} storage time thereby reducing the consumer’s acceptance. Elucidating factors and reactions which adversely affect or promote beer staling is therefore of major interest for the brewing industry. The objective of this work was to elucidate the role of reactive oxygen species {{for the formation of}} aroma-active aldehydes as well as to characterize and optimize the anti-staling effects of the hop dosage ultimately aiming to improve the resistance of beer against staling. A pathway for the hydroxyl and hydroxyethyl radical-mediated formation of aroma-active aldehydes by oxidative degradation of their parent amino acids was first investigated in model systems, and its relevance was subsequently examined during <b>beer</b> <b>storage</b> using response surface methodology. The Maillard reaction and consecutive Strecker degradation as initialized from non-oxidative xylose and glucose decomposition as well as the factor Fe 2 + concentration were found irrelevant for Strecker aldehyde formation during beer storage; yet, a linear relationship between Strecker aldehydes formed and total packaged oxygen as well as amino acid concentration could be identified. Oxygen-involvement in the de novo formation of phenylacetaldehyde and benzaldehyde from phenylalanine during <b>beer</b> <b>storage</b> was demonstrated using labeling experiments. Additional lab-scale experiments suggested a relevance of amino acid oxidative degradation during wort production. Albeit varying the concentration of Fe 2 +, a catalyst in radical generation, was found irrelevant for Strecker aldehyde formation within the scope of the <b>beer</b> <b>storage</b> experiments, its withdrawal from reactions by treatment of beers with excess EDTA was perceived to significantly diminish Strecker aldehyde levels. As related to the findings, diminishing oxygen uptake, lowering amino acid concentrations, and rendering iron harmless during beer production and storage can be anticipated to be key strategies to diminish staling. In an attempt to find approaches to counteract staling, antioxidative properties of hop acids and the hop dosage were scrutinized. Hop α-acids were found to complex prooxidative metal ions thereby counteracting free radical formation and promoting autoxidation of Fe 2 + to Fe 3 + thus stabilizing iron in its higher, less harmful, valence state. Accordingly, next to suppressing free radical formation and withdrawing iron from potential reaction partners, one of the main functionality of hop α-acids was found to lie in their capability to counteract recycling of Fe 3 + to Fe 2 + consequently improving oxidative beer stability. UV-VIS measurements suggested a covalent binding between Fe 3 + and hop α-acids and the formation of a complex at a ratio of 3 : 1 (α-acid:Fe 3 +). While α-, β-, and iso-α-acids were shown to complex Cu 2 +, Fe 2 + und Fe 3 + ions, no complexation of Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 +, and Zn 2 + ions was noticed. The hop acid’s selective complexation behavior can be regarded as very advantageous for beer quality as prooxidative transition metal ions are rendered harmless without adversely affecting the wort’s or beer’s ionic composition. Testing different hop constituents in wort-like model syst 0 ems during incubation at 100 °C demonstrated a high efficacy of hop α- and β-acids in suppressing the formation of 2 -furfural and 3 -methylbutanal, while iso-α-acids were shown to be less effective. Hop α-acids were investigated in greater detail, and α-acid-induced suppression of 3 -methylbutanal formation could be partly traced back to the hop α-acids’ capability to functionally complex Fe 2 +-ions and scavenge organic, carbon-centered radicals thereby suppressing free radical-mediated oxidative degradation of leucine. Constantly allocating fresh α- and β-acids can therefore be seen as a key strategy to counteract staling aldehyde formation during wort production. The knowledge could be successfully adapted to semi-technical beer production and an increased oxidative stability and resistance to staling of beers was achieved by optimization of the hopping technology as verified analytically and sensorial. The malt bill and wort matrix were noticed being crucial for the state of iron and efficacy of the hop dosage. The hopping technology should therefore be adapted to the wort matrix and initial malt bill when aiming to achieve the best optimal utilization. Modestly lower bitter substance yields were found when dosing α-acids later which may be balanced by higher hop dosages. In sum, knowledge about yet unexplored beer staling mechanisms and the anti-staling efficacy of hops, particularly hop acids, could be expanded. Outcomes from this work take the brewing and beverage industry a step further towards producing beers with a higher resistance against staling, from which eventually not only the brewing industry but also customers will benefit. Eine Vielzahl an chemischen und molekularen Vorgängen führt zum Auftreten von Fehlaromen während der Lagerung von Bier und zu einer verringerten Akzeptanz bei Konsumenten. Wissen um Faktoren, die die Geschmacksstabilität von Bier beeinflussen, ist damit von großem Interesse für viele Brauereien. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit war es, die Rolle von reaktiven Sauerstoffspezies in Bildungsreaktionen von Aroma-aktiven Aldehyden aufzuklären, sowie die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfen, insbesondere Hopfensäuren zu erörtern und optimierte Hopfengaben zu erarbeiten. Ein vorgeschlagener Mechanismus zur Bildung Aroma-aktiver Streckeraldehyde durch Hydroxyl- und Hydroxyethylradikal-induzierten, oxidativen Abbau von Aminosäuren wurde zunächst in Modellsystem bestätigt, und dessen Relevanz für die Bieralterung anschließend mittels Oberflächenwirkungsversuchsplänen untersucht. Während der nicht-oxidative Abbau von Glucose und Xylose im Rahmen der Maillardreaktion sowie eine Veränderung der Fe 2 +-Konzentration nachweislich keinen Einfluss auf die Bildung von Streckeraldehyden hatte, konnte ein linearer Einfluss der Faktoren Sauerstoffgehalt und Aminosäurekonzentration auf die Bildung von Streckeraldehyden während der Bierlagerung belegt werden. Die sauerstoffabhängige Nachbildung von Phenylacetaldehyd und Benzaldehyde aus Phenylalanin während der Lagerung konnte mittels Isotopenmarkierungsexperimenten nachgewiesen werden. Zusätzliche Experimente im Labormaßstab deuteten darauf hin, dass der Sauerstoff-induzierte Abbau von Aminosäuren ebenso bei der Würzeproduktion eine bedeutende Rolle spielt. Dessen ungeachtet, dass der Faktor Fe 2 +-Konzentration bei den durchgeführten Experimenten nicht signifikant war, führte die Zugabe von EDTA zu einer deutlichen Abnahme an Streckeraldehyden nach der Lagerung. Die Vermeidung von Sauerstoffeintrag, Maßnahmen die den Aminosäuregehalt in Würze und Bier erniedrigen, sowie Substanzen, die der prooxidativen Wirkung von Übergangsmetallionen entgegenarbeiten, sind daher in Bezug auf die Minimierung von Alterungserscheinungen als besonders zielführend anzusehen. Zur Erarbeitung von Strategien, die der Bieralterung entgegenstehen, wurde die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfensäuren in weiteren Versuchen eingehend untersucht. Das antiradikalische Verhalten von α-Säuren konnte auf deren funktionelle Komplexierung von prooxidativen Übergangsmetallionen zurückgeführt werden. Hierbei wurde insbesondere für α-Säuren die Autoxidation von Fe 2 + zu Fe 3 + und Stabilisierung von Eisen im höheren Valenzniveau nachgewiesen. Neben der Radikalunterdrückung und dem Entzug von Eisen von anderen Reaktionspartnern, kann die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von α-Säuren dementsprechend darauf zurückgeführt werden, dass sie der Reduktion von Fe 3 + zu Fe 2 + entgegenwirken. Mittels UV-VIS-Messungen konnte anschließend die Struktur eines α-Säure-Fe 3 +-Komplexes im Verhältnis 3 : 1 (α-Säure:Fe 3 +) vorgeschlagen werden. Während Cu 2 +-, Fe 2 + und Fe 3 +-Ionen von α-, β-, und iso-α-Säuren komplexiert wurden, konnte keine Komplexierung der Metallionen Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + und Zn 2 + nachgewiesen werden. Das selektive Komplexierungsverhalten von Hopfensäuren kann daher in Bezug auf die Bierqualität als sehr förderlich angesehen werden, da prooxidative Metallionen komplexiert werden ohne dass dabei die ionische Komposition der Würze oder des Bieres nachteilig beeinflusst wird. Weiterführende Versuche in Bierwürze-ähnlichen Modelllösungen zeigten auf, dass α- and β-Säuren signifikant der Bildung von 3 -Methylbutanal und 2 -Furfural entgegenwirken, während iso-α-Säuren keinen Effekt zeigten. Die Wirkung der α-Säure wurde dabei eingehender untersucht und es konnte belegt werden, dass insbesondere der Radikal-induzierte, oxidative Abbau von Leucin zu 3 -Methylbutanal durch Fe 2 +-Komplexierung und das Abfangen organischer Radikale unterdrückt wurde. Die stetige Gewährleistung adäquater α- und β-Säurekonzentrationen während der Würzebereitung kann daher als zielführend betrachtet werden, um der Bildung von Alterungsaldehyden entgegenzuwirken. Die Resultate wurden schließlich erfolgreich auf die semi-technische Bierproduktion angewandt. Optimierte Hopfengaben konnten erarbeitet und deren positive Wirkung auf die Geschmacksstabilität und Verzögerung von Alterungserscheinungen analytisch und sensorisch bestätigt werden. Die Modifikationen der Hopfengabe führten jedoch zu geringeren Bitterstoffgehalten im Bier, die durch leicht höhere Hopfengaben ausgeglichen werden müssten. Die Hopfengaben sollten dabei methodisch der jeweiligen Würzematrix angepasst werden, um eine größtmögliche Effektivität in Bezug eine Stabilitätssteigerung zu erzielen. Zusammenfassend wurden in dieser Doktorarbeit das Wissen um oxidative Bieralterungsmechanismen und die antioxidative Wirkungsweise von Hopfensäuren erweitert. Darauf aufbauend konnten praktikable Vorschläge erarbeitet werden, um Biere mit einer gesteigerten Resistenz gegen Alterungserscheinungen zu produzieren, von denen nicht nur die Brau- und Getränkeindustrie, sondern letztendlich auch die Endverbraucher profitieren...|$|E
40|$|Beer {{is often}} {{distributed}} and stored at room temperature, at which stability {{in terms of}} brightness and foam is largely under control {{in contrast to the}} flavour (combination of odour, aroma, taste and mouthfeel). Already {{in the early stages of}} storage of virtually all bottled beers, especially lagers, the disappearance of pleasant fresh beer flavour characteristics is associated with the accelerated development of unwanted ageing flavours. Given the increasing importance of export and the ever intensifying competition in the international market, a prolonged stability of the beer flavour is however a prerequisite. The distribution and particularly the export of beers can then be broadened while consumers are minimally confronted with changes in flavour and drinkability, even upon prolonged storage time prior to consumption. An optimised flavour stability is equally important for beers intended for the domestic market, as it is the best guarantee for maintaining the drinkability, which is with a direct impact on consumption very important in the light of a declining pale lager beer consumption. Some brewers do in fact operate a cold-chain, expensive though it may be. Consequently, prolonging the flavour stability of beer remains a major concern for each modern brewery. With their off-flavour character and very low thresholds, aldehydes play a key role in the sensory perception of aged beer flavours, since their concentration increase, even at &# 956;g/L levels, coincides with the appearance and intensity of organoleptic defects. Several reaction pathways give rise to these ageing compounds during beer production and storage, but knowledge on their proportional role is far from complete. Next to the significant decline in beer bitterness, the decomposition of in particular trans-iso-alfa-acids into a series of non-volatile cyclic compounds contributes to a harsh lingering bitterness upon ageing. The flavour shelf life of beers brewed with a strongly reduced level of trans-isomers can thus be extended with regard to bitterness intensity and quality. However, the impact that the iso-alfa-acids degradation has on the formation of ageing aldehydes is currently only exploited to a very limited extent. It remains unclear whether ageing aldehydes would develop less in beers with enhanced levels of cis-iso-alfa-acids, since the cis-isomers are distinctly less susceptible to degradation compared to their trans-counterparts. Against this background, this doctoral study aimed to generate new insights into the relationship between iso-alfa-acids degradation and the formation of ageing aldehydes, with focus on the marked instability of trans-iso-alfa-acids, in order to determine critical factors related to wort production and hopping for an improved beer flavour stability. A number of aldehydes were selected as beer flavour instability markers, i. e. 2 -methylpropanal, 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methional, benzaldehyde, phenylacetaldehyde, furfural, hexanaland trans- 2 -nonenal. Accurate analytical measurement of these aldehydes in a complex matrix such as beer requires highly specific extraction and detection techniques to obtain the necessary sensitivity and selectivity. Based on the properties of the compounds of interest, headspace solid phase microextraction with on-fibre O-(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentafluorobenzyl) -hydroxylamine (PFBHA) derivatisation in combination with capillary gas chromatography-negative chemical ionisation mass spectrometry (CGC-NCI-MS) was the technique of choice in this PhD study. The unique characteristics of the NCI spectra of aldehyde PFBHA-oxime derivatives provided excellent selectivity and sensitivity for measurement of the selected marker aldehydes, even when present at trace levels. The developed methodology was successfully applied to study the formation of aldehydes in fresh and forced aged beers. Given the pronounced instability of trans-iso-alfa-acids compared to their cis-counterparts, the evaluation of their potential specific impact on the formation of ageing aldehydes is necessary. Therefore both trans- and cis-iso-alfa-acids were required in their pure form and separated from a commercial isomerised hop extract by formation of trans-iso-alfa-acids/ß-cyclodextrin (ß-CD) complexes. The implemented preparative-scale separation procedure yielded the required amounts of isolated trans- and cis-iso-alfa-acids in a purity of 94 % and 98 %, respectively, for addition to model solutions and repeated trials of beer. The possible formation of ageing aldehydes arising from iso-alfa-acids degradation upon dark storage, was initially investigated in model solutions containing bitter acids or/and amino acids or/and xylose. In this way, the huge complexity of the beer matrix was originally evaded, allowing us to reveal the proportional contribution of each of the constituents to the formation of hop-derived aldehydes, Strecker aldehydes, and furfural, respectively. The involvement of different bitter acids (trans- vs. cis-iso-alfa-acids and iso-alfa-acids vs. dihydro- and tetrahydroiso-alfa-acids) in these reactions was evaluated, based upon their reported relative stability. The relationship between the bittering and the aldehyde formation was subsequently further explored in beer. In a comparative study, the impact of the bitter acids degradation on the aldehyde increase upon forced ageing in the dark was repeatedly studied in identically prepared pilot pale lager beers conventionally bittered (pellets, CO 2 -extract), bittered with iso-alfa-acids end boiling, and post-fermentation bittered with exclusively iso-alfa-acids, enriched trans-iso-alfa-acids, enriched cis-iso-alfa-acids, dihydroiso-alfa-acids and tetrahydroiso-alfa-acids, respectively, and compared with the aldehyde levels in the corresponding unhopped beers. For the first time, the differential behaviour upon ageing of trans- and cis-iso-alfa-acids was studied separately in model solution as well as in the beermatrix. Even though an increase in the aldehyde levels was monitored both in model solutions and aged beer samples, the suggested chemical pathways for aldehydes as degradation products of iso-alfa-acids were derived from the model experiments. The observed increase in the levels of marker aldehydes was only related to the conversion of iso-alfa-acids during storage in the model solutions. 2 -Methylpropanal was identified as a volatile, direct degradation product of both cis- and trans-iso-alfa-acids without the involvement of amino acids and/or xylose in these model experiments. The conversion of both cis- and trans-iso-alfa-acids was unmistakably influenced by the oxygen levels of the model solutions. In the presence of amino acids, this led to the formation of 2 -methylbutanal, 3 -methylbutanal, methional, and phenylacetaldehyde. This has been reported for the first time, and is explained as a Strecker-like degradation of the amino acids by a non-volatile oxidation product of both cis- and trans-iso-alfa-acids, the hydroxy-allo-iso-alfa-acids. These alfa-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are postulated as reactants for the Strecker-like degradation of amino acids in model solution, delivering the corresponding Strecker aldehydes. However, the contribution of this reaction to the increase in Strecker aldehydes in the aged iso-bittered beers was found negligible. cis-Iso-alfa-acids showed increased stability in beer compared to the model solutions, indicating less oxidative degradation. Despite the fact that clear differences in the stability of the bitter compounds between the nine specific bittered beers were observed, it was shown that the increase in aldehydes is irrespective of the bittering. In unhopped beer in fact an at least equally high increase in aldehydes was observed upon storage, so that the presence and conversion of, in particular, trans-iso-alfa-acids in the beer matrix can not be considered as a critical factor for the formation of aldehydes during beer ageing. On the basis of beers made with another pale malt it was further demonstrated that the malt and wort production should be considered as critical factors for the flavour stability of beer, as deduced from the higher aldehyde levels in the fresh and aged beers. In conclusion, through a comparative study of the impact of different types of bitter acids on aldehyde formation upon <b>beer</b> <b>storage,</b> the opportunities of using highly enriched cis-iso-alfa-acids preparations in brewing practice to prolong beer flavour stability were explored. The results obtained in this study created attractive new insights into the degradation of iso-alfa-acids and proved that under oxidative conditions, both cis- and trans-iso-alfa-acids are a source of Strecker aldehydes through a postulated Strecker-like reaction between oxidative iso-alfa-acids degradation products, the hydroxy-allo-iso-alfa-acids, and amino acids. However, this reaction was of no or at least less importance in the beer matrixat low oxygen concentrations, since the aldehyde increase upon ageing was irrespective of the applied bittering. Still, enriched cis-iso-alfa-acids can be utilised in beer in view of an enhanced bitterness stability, in the absence of light and with low-oxygen bottling. Therefore, the upscaling of the enrichment of cis-iso-alfa-acids from a mixture of cis- and trans-iso-alfa-acids opens up new perspectives. Moreover, cis-iso-alfa-acids are more bitter than the corresponding trans-isomers, so for the same bitterness intensity, less cis-iso-alfa-acids will be needed, which also yields an additional economic advantage. This doctoral study argues for an improved quality control of the used malt with the aim of reducing the aldehyde content in fresh and aged beer, and suggests to the brewer some points to reduce aldehydes production during brewing and <b>beer</b> <b>storage,</b> such as mashing-in conditions, limiting heat load (rapid wort filtration) and oxygen-free bottling. nrpages: 288 status: publishe...|$|E
