Following the success of Karan's {{previous}} film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), which starred Khan, Kajol and Mukerji, he wanted her presence in this film too. He thus cast Mukerji in a guest appearance. Initially, Karan wanted her presence in the film to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> but an accidental slip by Sony Music during the promotional activities led to her discovery.|$|E

25|$|Under {{standard}} conditions, from CH4 to C4H10 alkanes are gaseous; from C5H12 to C17H36 {{they are}} liquids; and after C18H38 they are solids. As {{the boiling point}} of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size (molecular weight) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20–30°C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.|$|E
25|$|By {{the fall}} of 2008, a story broke that Rodríguez had {{wrestled}} a dark match for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) {{and that they had}} offered him a contract. Over the following months conflicting reports of whether he had signed or not arose, but he remained CMLL World Heavyweight Champion. When he lost the title to Último Guerrero it was believed that he had indeed signed with WWE, with him being rumored to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> participant in the 2009 Royal Rumble. However, he remained with CMLL and stated that he signed a four-year deal and chose CMLL because they offered him a better deal than WWE.|$|E
25|$|Left {{with little}} {{political}} power and flexibility, the CUP began to plan a coup against Kâmil Pasha's Freedom and Accord government. In addition, an animosity had already been brewing between Kâmil Pasha and the CUP since the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that had started the Second Constitutional Era. During the {{more than four years}} since, Kâmil Pasha had made a series of efforts to keep CUP members far from government and keep the army, which had many CUP members among its ranks, out of politics. By January 1913, the CUP was thoroughly frustrated with Kâmil Pasha and Freedom and Accord. Although the coup was to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> attack, the CUP had made definitive decisions to carry it out far in advance.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} results were largely perceived to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> for the opposition, with the HDP having surpassed the election threshold by a healthy 3% {{of the vote}} despite many pollsters claiming that it was hovering at the 10% boundary. HDP co-leader Selahattin Demirtaş was widely seen as the victor of the election, {{in the sense that}} as well as exceeding many vote share projections, his party won the same amount of MPs (80 seats) as the Nationalist Movement Party. The international press characterised Demirtaş as the 'Kurdish Obama' and supporters of the HDP took to the street to celebrate their success on the evening of polling day. HDP MP Sırrı Süreyya Önder also stated that the HDP was aware that many voters voted tactically to ensure that the HDP passed the 10% threshold, claiming that the party would not alienate these voters.|$|E
25|$|Before the film's release, Paramount {{carried out}} a viral {{marketing}} campaign to promote the film which included viral tie-ins similar to Lost Experience. Filmmakers decided to create a teaser trailer that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{in the light of}} commonplace media saturation, which they put together during the preparation stage of the production process. The teaser was then used as a basis for the film itself. Paramount Pictures encouraged the teaser to be released without a title attached, and the Motion Picture Association of America approved the move. As Transformers showed high tracking numbers before its release in July 2007, the studio attached the teaser trailer for Cloverfield that showed the release date of January 18, 2008, but not the title. A second trailer was released on November 16, 2007 which was attached to Beowulf, confirming the title.|$|E
25|$|In the 2009–10 season, Fiorentina {{started their}} {{domestic}} campaign strongly before steadily losing momentum and slipped to mid-table {{positions at the}} latter half of the season. In Europe, the team proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> dark horse: after losing their first away fixture against Lyon, they staged a comeback with a five-match streak by winning all their remaining matches (including defeating Liverpool home and away). The Viola qualified as group champions, but eventually succumbed to Bayern Munich due to the away goals rule. This was controversial due to a mistaken refereeing decision by Tom Henning Øvrebø, who allowed a clearly offside goal for Bayern in the first leg. Bayern eventually finished the tournament as runners-up, making a deep run all the way to the final. The incident called into attention the possible implementation of video replays in football. Despite a good European run and reaching the semi-finals in the Coppa Italia, Fiorentina failed to qualify for Europe.|$|E

500|$|Although it is {{not known}} exactly where squab pie was first made, it is clear that it was somewhere in South West England. There are {{references}} to it originating in Gloucestershire, Devon and Cornwall. Although it appears that squab pie did originally contain pigeons, mutton and apples have been used as a substitute since at least 1737 using a recipe that has remained in cookbooks for years afterwards. This misnaming has meant that the pie is considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b> Squab is described as tender with a mild berry flavour, and so {{it is possible that the}} combination of mutton and apples created a similar flavour. There is also a theory that the name squab pie is short for [...] "squabble pie", as it stems from a disagreement over whether to have a meat or apple pie.|$|E

500|$|Tessa's death {{occurs in}} the fourth episode of the second season; [...] "The Darkness". The {{creative}} staff decided Tessa would die in a random carjacking incident. Tessa's death played {{no role in the}} episode's main storyline. It was not formulaic; the writers wanted to shock the audience. Abramowitz said that [...] "...it would have been easier to kill her off in the episode," [...] but the writers [...] "...wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> and show how shocking [...] was to [...]" [...] Horvath said that [...] "...losing a loved one to a random act of violence isn't something that only happens to television action heroes or Immortals or people in another type of life, it happens in the real world too- totally unexpectedly, at a moment that makes no sense dramatically."
