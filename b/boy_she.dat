25|$|Jodie Whittaker {{was cast}} as Beth Latimer, {{the mother of}} the murdered <b>boy.</b> <b>She</b> was hired after Buchan and McClure joined the series.

Chris Chibnall, however, told her that none of the actors would know who the murderer was (not even the actor who played the killer) until the last possible moment. She found that highly appealing, for it raised the anxiety level in the actors and reduced each actor's willingness to trust the other characters. She was also impressed by the heart-breaking way the first episode was written, and how many interesting characters there were in the series.|$|E
