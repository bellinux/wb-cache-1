5000|$|In a 1994 analysis, Holger Kirchmann, a soil {{researcher}} {{with the}} Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, concluded that Steiner's instructions were occult and dogmatic, and cannot {{contribute to the}} development of alternative or sustainable agriculture. According to Kirchmann, many of Steiner's statements are not provable because scientifically clear hypotheses cannot be made from his descriptions. Kirchmann asserted that when methods of biodynamic agriculture were tested scientifically, the results were unconvincing. Further, in a 2004 overview of biodynamic agriculture, Linda Chalker-Scott, a researcher at Washington State University, characterized <b>biodynamics</b> as pseudoscience, writing that Steiner did not use scientific methods to formulate his theory of <b>biodynamics,</b> and that the later addition of valid organic farming techniques has [...] "muddled the discussion" [...] of Steiner's original idea. Based on the scant scientific testing of <b>biodynamics,</b> Chalker-Scott concluded [...] "no evidence exists" [...] that homeopathic preparations improve the soil.|$|E

50|$|As a {{practical}} method of farming, <b>biodynamics</b> embodies {{the ideal of}} ever-increasing ecological self-sufficiency just as with modern agro-ecology, but includes ethical-spiritual considerations.

5000|$|Like most body psychotherapeutic schools, <b>Biodynamics</b> is not {{recognized}} by the health insurance companies in the United States as a scientifically based therapeutic intervention; however, in Switzerland, <b>Biodynamics</b> is covered by health care insurance. The German {{compulsory health insurance scheme}} (AOK) states: [...] "The idea of [...] "emotional residue" [...] which is delivered via the bowels is scientifically baseless. Also there are no scientific studies to attest to the efficacy of the therapy. (...) It is surely so that anxiety and stress have effects on the vegetative nervous system of the intestines and would express itself as changes in digestive activity. However, the idea that intestinal noises is an expression of the psychological situation of the patient cannot be established." ...|$|E

50|$|Like biodynamic {{agriculture}} in general, biodynamic viticulture {{stems from the}} ideas and suggestions of Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925), who gave his now famous Agriculture Course in 1924, predating most of the organic movement.
