40|$|Background and Purpose. Comparisons of {{spontaneous}} movements of pre-mature infants with <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> and those without <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> can provide insights into normal and abnormal {{processes in the}} ontogeny of motor development. In this study, the characteristics {{of spontaneous}} upper-extremity movements of premature infants with <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> and those without <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> were examined with time series analysis.

A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure upper-extremity limb acceleration in 3 -dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded from the right wrist when the infant was in an active, alert state and lying in the supine position. The recording time was 200 seconds. The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The acceleration time series data were analyzed by nonlinear analysis as well as linear analysis. Results.

5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, feeling in a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Definitions of mild {{traumatic}} <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> (MTBI) were inconsistent {{until the}} World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) provided a consistent, authoritative definition across specialties in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis can be complex because {{concussion}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions. For example, post-concussion {{symptoms such as}} cognitive problems may be misattributed to <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> when, in fact, due to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).|$|E

40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>injuries</b> {{in sports}} drew {{more and more}} public attentions in recent years. <b>Brain</b> <b>injuries</b> vary by name, type, and {{severity}} in the athletic setting. It should be noted, however, that these injuries are not isolated to only the athletic arena, as non-athletic mechanisms (e. g., motor vehicle accidents) are more common causes of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> (TBI) among teenagers. Notwithstanding, as many as 1. 6 to 3. 8 million TBI result from sports and recreation {{each year in the}} United States alone. These injuries are extremely costly to the global health care system, and make TBI among the most expensive conditions to treat in children. This article serves to define common <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> in sport; describe their prevalence, what happens to the <b>brain</b> following <b>injury,</b> how to recognize and manage these injuries, and what you can expect as the athlete recovers. Some return-to-activity considerations for the brain-injured athlete will also be discussed...|$|R
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury,</b> as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Subarachnoid blood can be {{detected}} on CT scanning {{in as many as}} 60 percent of people with traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury.</b> Traumatic SAH (tSAH) usually occurs near the site of a skull fracture or intracerebral contusion. It usually happens in the setting of other forms of traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injury</b> and has been linked with a poorer prognosis. It is unclear, however, if this {{is a direct result of}} the SAH or whether the presence of subarachnoid blood is simply an indicator of severity of the head injury and the prognosis is determined by other associated mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|Traumatic <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> are {{strongly}} related to alcohol intoxication as by some estimates half or more of all <b>brain</b> <b>injuries</b> involve at least one intoxicated individual.

Here, we will review the epidemiological and experimental evidence for this phenomenon and discuss potential psychosocial mediators including attenuation of negative affect and impaired decision making as well as neurochemical mediators including disruption in the glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic signaling pathways and increases in inflammation...|$|R
