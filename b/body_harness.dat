25|$|Deployment of {{a single}} {{tethered}} scuba diver is a reasonably safe alternative to free-swimming buddy team diving. The tethered scuba diver {{is equipped with a}} full-face mask with voice communications, high capacity scuba air supply, and an independent emergency air supply. A lifeline with communications cable is secured to a <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> on the diver and is handled by a surface tender who is in constant voice communication with the diver. A similarly equipped standby diver is available on the surface.|$|E

50|$|Safety is {{the biggest}} {{consideration}} for tree stands. A <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> {{is the most important}} part of tree stand safety. Many different styles of harness can keep hunters safe. One harness compiled of a belt around the waist of the person and one around tree with a strap between the two can keep the hunter safe. Another harness is a full <b>body</b> <b>harness,</b> which has shoulder straps and straps around the legs. The full <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> attaches to the tree the same way the belt harness does. Attaching the harness as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the harness and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of spaceflight on the oxidative burst of neutrophils is not known. The {{present study was}} designed to evaluate the {{influence of}} antiorthostatic suspension, a ground-based modeling system designed to simulate certain aspects of weightlessness that occur after spaceflight, on the capacity of rat neutrophils to express the oxidative burst, an important host defense mechanism against microbial pathogens. Rats were suspended in whole <b>body</b> <b>harnesses</b> in the antiorthostatic orientation for a 3 - or 7 -day period. Control rats were suspended orthostatically or allowed to remain in vivarium cages without the attachment of any suspension materials. After suspension, peripheral blood was harvested and neutrophils were isolated by density gradient centrifugation. The enriched neutrophil preparations were stimulated with N-formyl-methionyl-leucine-phenylalanine and phorbol myristic acid to induce the oxidative burst. It was found that neutrophils isolated from suspended animals released the same levels of superoxide anion as did vivarium control animals that were not suspended, indicating that whole body suspension did not alter this aspect of rat neutrophil function...|$|R

The participant begins on a trampoline and is fitted into a <b>body</b> <b>harness,</b> which is attached via bungy cords to two high poles {{on either side of}} the trampoline. As they begin to jump, the bungy cords are tightened, allowing a higher jump than could normally be made from a trampoline alone.|$|E

50|$|The parai is slung by a strap {{over one}} {{shoulder}} (weak/off hand side) and is held vertically by pushing it towards the performer's <b>body.</b> This simple <b>harness</b> allows the drummer to play while standing, walking, or dancing.

50|$|The {{combined}} {{weight of the}} counterbalance and camera means that the armature bears a relatively high inertial mass which is not easily moved by small body movements from the operator (much as {{it is difficult to}} quickly shake a bowling ball). The freely pivoting armature adds additional stabilization to the photographed image, and makes the weight of the camera-sled assembly acceptable by allowing the <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> to support it.|$|E
50|$|A harness is {{a system}} used for {{connecting}} the rope to the climber. There are two loops {{at the front of}} the harness where the climber ties into the rope at the working end using a figure-eight knot. Most harnesses used in climbing are preconstructed and are worn around the pelvis and hips, although other types are used occasionally. Usually young children use a full <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> because it gives more support for the body.|$|E

It contained an electronic ring which was placed on the penis. The ring automatically switched on when there was an erection so that the boy's parents could become aware. Shoes worn by ancient Greek prostitutes are displayed in the museum. These shoes had the sentence [...] "follow my steps" [...] engraved on the soles so that they could leave an imprint on the ground. It also has {{a collection of}} erotic clothing.

50|$|Most cameras {{can also}} be handheld, that is held {{in the hands of}} the camera {{operator}} who moves from one position to another while filming the action. Personal stabilizing platforms came into being in the late 1970s through the invention of Garrett Brown, which became known as the Steadicam. The Steadicam is a <b>body</b> <b>harness</b> and stabilization arm that connects to the camera, supporting the camera while isolating it from the operator's body movements. After the Steadicam patent expired in the early 1990s, many other companies began manufacturing their concept of the personal camera stabilizer.|$|E
