30|$|On {{the other}} side of the spectrum, less {{developed}} as well as smaller countries gain more than developed and <b>bigger</b> <b>countries.</b> Small country with a small economy, like Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Brunei Darussalam, would lose more in comparison to <b>bigger</b> <b>country</b> with a <b>bigger</b> economy after removal of respective trade agreements. Though the economy size of Singapore is much higher in comparison to other members, it would lose more, as the size of the country is smaller, i.e., smaller countries need more option to trade. The intuition behind that is <b>bigger</b> <b>countries</b> have their own natural market to trade (Arkolakis et al. 2012).|$|R

25|$|In 1955, Elaine Makatura came to {{work with}} Bass in his Los Angeles office. By 1960, with the opening to Spartacus, she was {{directing}} and producing title sequences, and in 1961 the two married, beginning more than 40 years of close collaboration. After {{the birth of their}} children, Jennifer in 1964 and Jeffrey in 1967, they concentrated on their family, film directing, and title sequences. Saul and Elaine designed title sequences for more than 40 years, continuously experimenting with a variety of innovative techniques and effects, from Bunraku-style maneuvers in Spartacus (1960), live-action sequences in Walk On The Wild Side (1962), to time-lapse photography in The Age of Innocence (1993), and even chopped liver in Mr. Saturday Night (1992). Their live-action opening title sequences often served as prologues to their films and transitioned seamlessly into their opening scenes. These “time before” title sequences either compress or expand time with startling results. The title sequence to Grand Prix (1966) portrays the moments before the opening race in Monte Carlo, the title sequence to The <b>Big</b> <b>Country</b> (1958) depicts the days it takes a stage coach to travel to a remote Western town, and the opening montage title sequence to The Victors (1963) chronicles the twenty-seven years between World War I and the middle of World War II, where the film begins.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the last}} few years, Abilene, Texas, has {{steadily}} become the retail, residential, business, medical, and overall center of the surrounding <b>Big</b> <b>Country.</b> Commercial development was especially boosted in 2007, with several multimillion dollar projects throughout the entire city. Most of the recent development is concentrated in roughly four areas in Abilene: Southwest Drive, Catclaw Drive, and Buffalo Gap Road near the Winters Freeway to the southwest, as this area becomes a strong commercial sector {{as well as a}} good residential district; Buffalo Gap Road, Beltway South, and US Highway 83/84 near and beyond {{the outskirts of the city}} in the south with several housing developments; Loop 322 area and Oldham Ln to the southeast, also near and past the edge of the city with a mix of several residential subdivisions as well as the start of commercial growth; and State Highway 351/Ambler Avenue near Interstate 20 to the northeast, also a combination of staple retail development, similar to the southwest commercial development, and the beginnings of residential growth with a new apartment complex and growing subdivisions. All this growth has contributed to the suburbanization of the city; however, as Abilene is not a large city itself, this is also helped the urbanization of the city as a whole. More people in the city leads to more workers and commuters in a city that has a short commute time throughout the city.|$|E

500|$|After her {{suspension}} with Warner Bros. was lifted, Baker {{appeared in}} William Wyler's Western epic The <b>Big</b> <b>Country</b> (1958). The film was well received by critics, though the shoot {{was described as}} [...] "problematic": Baker was four months pregnant {{at the time and}} had to wear restraining garments, and director Wyler reportedly had her {{on the verge of tears}} after forcing her to repeat the same take over 60 times, only to use the first one. She followed The <b>Big</b> <b>Country</b> with lead roles in two romances, portraying a nun in The Miracle (1959) co-starring Roger Moore, and in But Not for Me (1959), a comedy with Clark Gable. The New York Times praised Baker's performance in But Not for Me, saying: [...] "Miss Baker, being a young lady who not only has looks but also can act, makes you understand why Mr. Gable would like to cheat a little bit on Father Time." [...] She disliked The Miracle so much that she bought out her contract with Warner Bros., putting her in considerable debt. But Not for Me was made at Paramount.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a better {{understanding}} of the literature dealing with strategic fiscal behaviours of small EU countries using estimations of tax reaction functions of competing national governments. Deriving a simple model of tax competition in a Nash and a Stackelberg game, we use panel data and tools from spatial econometrics to examine the role of small countries in tax competition within the enlarged European Union. We find that interactions are stronger among smaller EU countries than between larges ones and rates set in small countries influence those in <b>big</b> <b>countries.</b> Finally, small countries located in the centre of the EU have more influence on tax policies choices of <b>big</b> <b>countries</b> than small countries located in the periphery of EU...|$|R
