5|$|Chaptal did not {{consider}} his experiment a success. When he retired in 1946, he put the condenser out of order, possibly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to leave an improper installation to mislead those who might later continue studies on air wells.|$|E
5|$|Jenson Button was {{required}} {{to apply to the}} stewards to be allowed to race, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> post a lap time during the first part of qualifying. They gave him permission to start based on his satisfactory practice times.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is but one}} answer, and I {{am sorry}} if you don't like it. If Innocent is happy, it is <b>because</b> <b>he</b> IS innocent. If he can defy the conventions, it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> can keep the commandments. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want to kill but to excite to life that a pistol is still as {{exciting}} to him {{as it is to}} a schoolboy. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want to steal, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> covet his neighbour's goods, that he has captured the trick (oh, how we all long for it!), the trick of coveting his own goods. It is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> want to commit adultery that he achieves the romance of sex; it is just <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loves one wife that he has a hundred honeymoons. If he had really murdered a man, if he had really deserted a woman, {{he would not be able}} to feel that a pistol or a love-letter was like a song-- at least, not a comic song." ...|$|R

5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his spotter {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be {{considered}} a failure <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinand's rule {{remained}} fragile in {{the eastern}} territories of the Kingdom of Hungary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> send enough mercenaries to defend them.

5|$|Hull {{attempted}} {{to join the}} South African Air Force in 1935, but was turned down <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak Afrikaans. He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) instead, enlisting in England in September 1935. Completing the pilot's course on 3 August 1936 with the rank of pilot officer, he joined No. 43 Squadron at RAF Tangmere in Sussex five days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney {{attempted}} {{to pass the}} Meech Lake Accord, a series of constitutional amendments to persuade Quebec to endorse the Canada Act 1982. Unanimous support in the legislature was needed to bypass public consultation. Manitoba politician Elijah Harper, a Cree, opposed <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe First Nations had been adequately involved in the Accord's process, and thus the Accord failed.|$|E
5|$|In {{that first}} stage, Garin {{had asked the}} race {{official}} Lefèvre for food, which was illegal. Lefèvre, who knew that Garin was {{the star of the}} race, broke the rules and gave him the food, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to be responsible for Garin leaving the race because of hunger.|$|E

5|$|At several {{stages of}} development, other actors were pursued for the film. In October 2010, Willis said that Steve Austin would reprise {{his role as}} villain Dan Paine. In November 2010, Charlie Sheen was {{reported}} to be in consideration for the role of a CIA agent hunting down Willis' Mr. Church. In August 2011, Variety reported that actor and martial artist Donnie Yen was offered a role in the film; however, Yen declined the role <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> find it intriguing.|$|E
5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> plan to sell it, {{he gave a}} {{price of}} 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes.

5|$|Cho {{was able}} to pass both {{background}} checks and successfully complete both handgun purchases after he presented to the gun dealers his U.S. permanent residency card, his Virginia driver's permit to prove legal age and length of Virginia residence and a checkbook showing his Virginia address, in addition to waiting the required 30-day period between each gun purchase. He was successful at completing both handgun purchases <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> disclose on the background questionnaire that a Virginia court had ordered him to undergo outpatient treatment at a mental health facility.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} as a producer, West's true {{aspiration}} {{was to be a}} rapper. Though he had developed his rapping long before he began producing, it was often a challenge for West to be accepted as a rapper, and he struggled to attain a record deal. Multiple record companies ignored him <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> portray the 'gangsta image' prominent in mainstream hip hop at the time. After a series of meetings with Capitol Records, West was ultimately denied an artist deal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did not agree with him, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, {{his family}} moved to New York City looking for a better way of life.

5|$|In October 1588 the Diet {{proposed}} {{to declare the}} sixteen-year-old Sigismund of age if he banished the Jesuits from Transylvania. He did not accept the offer, mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to expel his confessor, Alfonso Carillo. The Diet was dissolved, but Sigismund's cousins convinced him not to resist the Diet, which was dominated by Protestant delegates. The Diet was again summoned in late 1588; on 8December it ordered the expulsion of the Jesuits and declared Sigismund to be of age.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Stevenson was a {{conservative}} stalwart, steadfastly opposing spending on internal improvements {{and maintaining a}} strict constructionist view of the constitution. He urged his fellow senators to oppose the Civil Rights Act of 1871, claiming that its provision that the president could suspend the right of habeas corpus in cases where he believed violence was imminent amounted to giving the chief executive the powers of a dictator. He also opposed the appropriation of federal money to fund the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> believe Congress was given the authority to make such an allocation under the Constitution.|$|E
