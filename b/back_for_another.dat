5|$|The {{character}} of Ste was originally a background character, who was cast by David Hanson for only seven episodes. Upon completion of his initial short stint, new producer Bryan Kirkwood {{decided to bring}} the character <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> handful of episodes in October 2006 in which Ste fled {{the scene of a}} car accident involving Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies). Following positive viewer feedback after this second stint, Kirkwood asked Richardson to reprise the role on a permanent basis beginning 26 September 2007.|$|E
5|$|After the {{produced}} pilot {{lived up}} to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name Friends on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30p.m. timeslot. The pilot aired between Mad About You and Seinfeld, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run, and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing, and {{that at least two}} of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that Friends would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7million per episode—that it took to bring the series <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> season.|$|E

A pair of 15-yard penalties against the Bucs defense enabled the 49ers to drive <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> Chandler field goal, but a 36-yard pass interference call against San Francisco safety Tony Parrish soon led to another Buccaneer touchdown, this one a 12-yard catch by tight end Rickey Dudley. Later on, Brooks intercepted a pass from Garcia at the 49ers 26-yard line. One play later, Michael Pittman's 22-yard burst moved the ball to the 4-yard line, and Alstott finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, giving Tampa Bay a 28-6 lead with 55 seconds left in the half.|$|E

500|$|... 2010: On February 7, Favre {{appeared}} in a second quarter Super Bowl XLIV ad for Hyundai parodying his retirement indecisiveness. In the ad, set after the 2020 NFL season, a grayed 50 year old Favre accepts the season MVP award and ponders retirement, but can't commit {{one way or the}} other. In April, Favre indicated that {{if it were not for}} his Vikings teammates and fans, it would be easy to retire. In early August, Favre's ankle (which was injured during the 2009 playoffs) had not responded after surgery and rehabilitation.

Willem Dafoe starred as the villain John Geiger, and Glenn Plummer (who played Reeves' carjacking victim) also cameos as the same character, this time driving a boat that Alex takes control of.

5000|$|In 1932, a Jewish {{businessman}} of German extraction, Shmuel Yosef Holtzmann, provided financial <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> {{attempt at}} resettling the area, through a company named El HaHar ("To the Mountain"). The kibbutz established there in 1935 was named Kfar Etzion, {{in his honor}} (the German word Holz means [...] "wood", which is etz עץ in Hebrew). The 1936-1939 Arab revolt made life intolerable for the residents, who returned to Jerusalem in 1937. The Jewish National Fund organized a third attempt at settlement in 1943 with the refounding of Kfar Etzion by members of a religious group called Kvutzat Avraham. Despite the rocky soil, shortage of potable water, harsh winters, and constant threat of attack, this group managed to succeed.|$|R
5000|$|Like David Niven, Buchanan was {{renowned for}} his {{portrayal}} of the quintessential English gentleman on stage and screen, despite being a Scot. Buchanan also provided financial <b>backing</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> Scot, John Logie Baird, in Logie's work to develop mechanical television. Buchanan was legendary among his colleagues for his financial generosity to less prosperous actors and chorus performers.

500|$|Under {{new head}} coach Red Hickey in 1960, the 49ers adopted the shotgun formation.

The 49ers scored a season-high thirty points, and with Brodie in the shotgun won three of their last four games to salvage a winning season at 7–5. Though conflicted, Tittle decided to get into shape and prepare for the next season. He stated in his 2009 autobiography that at times he thought, [...] "The hell with it. Quit this damned game. You have been at it too long anyway." [...] But then another voice within him would say, [...] "Come <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> year and show them you're still a good QB. Don't let them shotgun you out of football!" [...] However, after the first preseason game of 1961, Hickey informed Tittle he had been traded to the New York Giants.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{comic book}} writer Stan Lee as himself.

Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series. The design of the character is also based on Castellaneta.|$|E
500|$|CNN's Henry Hanks {{wrote the}} episode [...] "is {{reason enough to}} bring this series <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> season," [...] and praised Noble's {{performance}} as Emmy-worthy; Hanks also loved the [...] "genius" [...] musical score written by composers Michael Giacchino and Chris Tilton. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded the episode with an A-, explaining that, like the other reviewers, he loved the opening sequence with Peter on the lake, the newest mythology details, {{as well as how}} Walternate discovered the prime universe. Murray also loved the [...] "mood" [...] of the episode, but had minor problems with the plot, as he thought it was now harder to believe Olivia, Peter, and Walter were strangers {{to each other in the}} first season. James Poniewozik of Time magazine concluded that the episode [...] "was not the revelation that 'Peter' was, though a phase-shifting Olivia’s mistaking of Walternate for Walter was one of the series’ most mindblowing moments (and, again, a Lostian bit of disorienting sleight of hand). But it was again an effective detour in which Fringe reminded us that time has parallels just as space does, and that the past is emotionally overlaid on the present just as its Over There is overlaid on our world." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{demise of}} Star Cops after just nine episodes {{has been seen}} as {{indicative}} of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and, after Doctor Who followed Star Cops into cancellation in 1989, there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until Bugs began in 1995. However, Star Cops has undergone something of a reappraisal – in science fiction circles at least – since it went off the air in 1987. Reviewing the VHS releases for TV Zone in 1991, Gary Russell stated that [...] "Star Cops represents excellent science fiction" [...] and recanted his original impression of the series upon broadcast that it was [...] "Bergerac in spacesuits, complete with rather cruddy visual effects and boring performances". A retrospective article penned by Keith Topping for Dreamwatch to mark the series' 10th anniversary in 1997 described Star Cops as [...] "a series that could (and should) {{have been one of the}} BBC's most popular, influential and entertaining products of the era. On at least one of these points the series failed miserably, but, certainly when it came to entertainment, it succeeded magnificently". In 1999, when science fiction magazine SFX asked an expert panel from the SF field, including Terry Pratchett and Stephen Baxter, to compile a list of the top 50 SF shows of all time, Star Cops came thirteenth on the list, with SFX describing it as [...] "the SF TV show SF writers love. It wasn't perfect but it's as close as TV will ever get to producing proper written SF". Later, in 2005, SFX went on to poll its readers for their list of the top 50 British telefantasy shows and Star Cops was voted into twenty-seventh position on the list. The BBC themselves revisited Star Cops in a thirty-minute retrospective documentary about the show, recorded as part of a series titled The Cult of..., first broadcast on BBC Four on 28 November 2006 as part of that channel's Science Fiction Britannia season. Reflecting on the show in the programme, the author and critic Kim Newman said that [...] "the strength of Star Cops is the writing. I don't think any of the episodes are realised as well on screen as they are on the page. [...] If it had come <b>back</b> <b>for</b> <b>another</b> couple of seasons it might well have been the BBC's best science fiction show". The documentary concluded that Star Cops was an [...] "overlooked gem".|$|E
