40|$|The Horizon 2020 COLUMBUS project aims to {{identify}} and transfer unexploited knowledge, generated by EU funded science and technology research, to actors {{with the potential to}} capitalise on it resulting in measurable value creation. Marine knowledge is generated, to a large extent, through analyses and application of the data and information obtained through monitoring and observation of seas and oceans. The COLUMBUS project is structured around nine areas of competency, or nodes. The Monitoring and Observation node has been focusing on identifying some of the bottlenecks and challenges to greater uptake and application of marine data and information by users, in particular by industry. Building on the knowledge of the partners involved, significant work has been carried out to engage with actors from the private sector, establishing their general and specific needs and to what extent observatories and marine data-sharing initiatives can or should adapt to meet them. This document is based on desk-top research resulting in COLUMBUS Deliverable D 4. 1, attendance at trade fairs and workshops, one-on-one meetings with representatives from the private sector, a COLUMBUS <b>brokerage</b> <b>event</b> in the context of SeaTech Week (2016) and contributions from partnersâ€™ own experience...|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{matchmaking}} {{is also used}} {{in the business world}} and known as B2B Matchmaking, Investor Matchmaking, Business Speed Dating or <b>Brokerage</b> <b>Events.</b> In contradiction to social networking solutions, real meetings between business people are in focus. Trade fair organisations e.g. find this concept an added value for their exhibitors because it gives them the opportunity of advanced planned meetings. Following the inspiration of dating sites, some online B2B networking platforms developed advanced business matching solutions enabling relevant business partners' identification.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 BFUNTEX is a European Coordination Action {{with the}} {{objective}} to bring together all innovation actors {{in the field of}} functional textile structures and textile related materials, fostering a multidisciplinary approach between universities, research institutes, industry (especially SMEs) and sector associations. The 2 BFUNTEX international team aims to identify technological gaps and eliminate barriers resulting in a faster industrial uptake of functional materials with new functionalities and improved performance. Technological needs will be mapped, new joint international research disciplines will be identified and multidisciplinary laboratory teams will be created. Training materials for research and industry purposes will be elaborated and implemented, allowing a common language regarding functional textiles, and increasing the number of well-trained people in this field. 2 BFUNTEX partners will organise and participate in conferences, workshops and <b>brokerage</b> <b>events.</b> Through the development of an interactive website with an extensive database, collaboration will be boosted and rapid industrial uptake catalysed and enhanced...|$|R
30|$|For all {{experiments}} {{reported in this}} paper, we use CReST as the cloud simulation platform. To optimise simulation performance, we disabled several of the lower-level physical infrastructure modules, such as the Thermal module that tracks heat-flow in the data centre. The active modules used {{in all of the}} brokerage simulations that we perform include: <b>Brokerage,</b> Pricing, <b>Events,</b> Services and Simulation. This enables us to efficiently run experiments that simulate decades of time, without compromising on the abstraction level needed. All CReST code used to run the experiments performed here, and associated Python scripts used for data analysis and visualisation, are available to download in version 0.4. 0 of CReST [4].|$|R
40|$|Boosting {{collaboration}} between research centres and industry to enhance rapid industrial uptake of innovative functional textile structures and textile-related materials in a mondial market 2 BFUNTEX will exploit the untapped potential in functional textile structures and textile related materials. It will bring together all innovation {{actors in the}} field fostering a multidisciplinary approach between universities, research institutes, SMEs and sector associations. The 2 BFUNTEX team will identify technological gaps and eliminate barriers resulting in a faster industrial uptake of added value functional materials with new functionalities and improved performance and resulting in creation of new business worldwide. Technological needs will be mapped, new joint international research disciplines will be identified and multidisciplinary lab teams will be created. International cooperation will be favoured to exploit the worldwide market expansion potential. Industry will be involved at all stages of the process. The inventory will enlarge the team of important textile universities and renowned materials research centres and will identify new collaborations. Synergy will be reinforced and created which will enable to identify and develop new functional materials. Training materials regarding functional materials for research and industrial purposes will be developed and implemented to allow a common language regarding functional textile structures and text ile related materials, and will {{increase the number of}} well-trained people in this field. Further, the 2 BFUNTEX partners will organise and participate in conferences, workshops and <b>brokerage</b> <b>events.</b> Along with a website with an extensive database comprising all information gained throughout the project, collaboration will be boosted and rapid industrial uptake catalysed and enhanced. The project duration will be 4 years and the consortium includes 26 partners from 16 countries. Start date : 01 / 01 / 2012 More information: Ir.

40|$|P>Despite the {{recognition}} that network brokerage is beneficial for entrepreneurial ventures, {{little is known about}} its antecedents. This study examines how participation in industry events (e. g. conferences) relates to entrepreneurs' brokerage positions in informal industry networks and how these positions, in turn, impact new venture performance. Using a unique dataset of 45 events and subsequent network relations among entrepreneurs from 90 firms in the open source software industry, results indicate that: (1) entrepreneurs who participated in heterogeneous events or who bridged between events with few common participants {{were more likely to be}} brokers; (2) the relationship between <b>event</b> bridging and <b>brokerage</b> was stronger for entrepreneurs with broader prior career experiences; and (3) network <b>brokerage</b> mediated the <b>event</b> participation-performance link. It appears that events may limit structural opportunities for brokerage and that individual differences matter for exploiting these opportunities. Overall, this study increases understanding of how and when particular networking behaviours are beneficial for entrepreneurs...|$|R
