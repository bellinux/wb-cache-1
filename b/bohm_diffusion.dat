40|$|We {{calculate}} the energy spectra of cosmic ray (CR) protons and electrons at a plane shock with quasi-parallel magnetic fields, using time-dependent, diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) simulations, including energy losses via synchrotron emission and Inverse Compton (IC) scattering. A thermal leakage injection model and a <b>Bohm</b> type <b>diffusion</b> coefficient are adopted. The electron spectrum at the shock becomes steady after the DSA energy gains balance the synchrotron/IC losses, and it cuts {{off at the}} equilibrium momentum p_eq. In the postshock region the cutoff momentum of the electron spectrum decreases with {{the distance from the}} shock due to the energy losses and the thickness of the spatial distribution of electrons scales as p^- 1. Thus the slope of the downstream integrated spectrum steepens by one power of p for p_br<p<p_eq, where the break momentum decrease with the shock age as p_br∝ t^- 1. In a CR modified shock, both the proton and electron spectrum exhibit a concave curvature and deviate from the canonical test-particle power-law, and the upstream integrated electron spectrum could dominate over the downstream integrated spectrum near the cutoff momentum. Thus the spectral shape near the cutoff of X-ray synchrotron emission could reveal a signature of nonlinear DSA.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{questions}} to understanding the efficiency of diffusive shock acceleration of the cosmic rays (CRs) is the injection process from thermal particles. A self-consistent injection model based on the interactions of the suprathermal particles with self-generated magneto-hydrodynamic waves has been developed recently by Malkov (1998, Phys. Rev. E 58, 4911). By adopting this analytic solution, a numerical treatment of the plasma-physical injection model at a strong quasi-parallel shock has been devised and incorporated into the combined gas dynamics and the CR diffusion-convection code. In order to investigate self-consistently the injection and acceleration efficiencies, we have applied this code to the CR modified shocks of both high and low Mach numbers (M= 30 and M= 2. 24) with a <b>Bohm</b> type <b>diffusion</b> model. We find the injection process is self-regulated {{in such a way}} that the injection rate reaches and stays at a nearly stable value after quick initial adjustment. For both shocks about 0. 1 % of the incoming thermal particles are injected into the CRs. For the weak shock, the shock has reached a steady state within our integration time and about 10 % of the total available shock energy is transfered into the CR energy density. The strong shock has achieved a higher acceleration efficiency of about 20 % by the end of our simulation, but has not yet reached a steady-state.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{simulate}} {{the propagation of}} Ultra High Energy (UHE) protons in the magnetised intergalactic medium of Galaxy Clusters (GCs). Differently from previous works on the subject, we trace proton trajectories in configurations of the Intra Cluster Magnetic Field (ICMF) which have been extracted from a constrained Magnetic-SPH simulation of the local universe. Such an approach allows us {{to take into account}} the effects of several features of the ICMFs, e. g. irregular geometrical structure and field fluctuations due to merger shocks, which cannot be investigated analitically or with usual numerical simulations. Furthermore, we are able to simulate a set of clusters which have properties quite similar to those of GCs observed in the nearby universe. We estimate the time that UHE protons take to get out of the clusters and found that in the energy range 5 × 10 18 < ∼ E < ∼ 3 × 10 19 eV proton propagation takes place in the <b>Bohm</b> scattering <b>diffusion</b> regime passing smoothly to a small pitch angle diffusion regime at larger energies. We apply our results to estimate the secondary gamma and Hard X Ray (HXR) emissions produced by UHE protons in a rich GC.

This process may give rise to a detectable signal if a relatively powerful AGN, or a dead quasar, accelerating protons at UHEs is harboured by a rich GC in the local universe.

5000|$|In a {{magnetized}} plasma, {{the collision}} frequency is usually {{small compared to}} the gyrofrequency, so that the step size is the gyroradius [...] and the step time is the collision time, , which {{is related to the}} collision frequency through , leading to [...] If the collision frequency is larger than the gyrofrequency, then the particles can be considered to move freely with the thermal velocity vth between collisions, and the diffusion coefficient takes the form [...] Evidently the classical (collisional) diffusion is maximum when the collision frequency is equal to the gyrofrequency, in which case D = ρ²ωc = vth²/ωc. Substituting ρ = vth/ωc, vth = (kBT/m)1/2, and ωc = eB/m, we arrive at D = kBT/eB, which is the Bohm scaling. Considering the approximate nature of this derivation, the missing 1/16 in front is no cause for concern.

5000|$|In {{light of}} the {{calculation}} above, {{it is tempting to}} think of <b>Bohm</b> <b>diffusion</b> as classical diffusion with an anomalous collision rate that maximizes the transport, but the physical picture is different. Anomalous diffusion is the result of turbulence. Regions of higher or lower electric potential result in eddies because the plasma moves around them with the E-cross-B drift velocity equal to E/B. These eddies play a similar role to the gyro-orbits in classical diffusion, except that the physics of the turbulence can be such that the decorrelation time is approximately equal to the turn-over time, resulting in Bohm scaling. Another {{way of looking at it}} is that the turbulent electric field is approximately equal to the potential perturbation divided by the scale length , and the potential perturbation can be expected to be a sizeable fraction of the kBT/e. The turbulent diffusion constant [...] is then independent of the scale length and is approximately equal to the Bohm value.|$|E

The process can be a transport driven by the thermal fluctuations, corresponding to the lowest possible random electric fields. The low-frequency spectrum will cause the ExB drift. Due to the long range nature of Coulomb interaction, the wave coherence time is long enough to allow virtually free streaming of particles across the field lines. Thus, the transport would be the only mechanism to limit the run of its own course and to result in a self-correction by quenching the coherent transport through the diffusive damping. To quantify these statements, we may write down the diffusive damping time as τD=1/k⊥2D, where k⊥ is the wave number perpendicular to the magnetic field.
