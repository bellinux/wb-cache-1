5|$|The {{physical}} processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, {{it is known}} that lung tissue can <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the inertial effect, the spalling effect, and the implosion effect.|$|E

Veronica had previously hired Weevil to destroy Madison’s car, but right before it is about to <b>be</b> <b>crushed,</b> she calls it off.|$|E

5|$|Another source from 684 AD, {{during the}} Tang dynasty and {{recorded}} in Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica, states {{that when the}} leaves are taken internally, they make one incoherent and sleepy, while when used externally they can be effectively used to treat boils, abscesses and itches. Yet another recipe recorded by Li uses the leaves to treat baldness. This formula calls for young leaves of ailanthus, catalpa and peach tree to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> together and the resulting liquid applied to the scalp to stimulate hair growth.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its use in folk medicine, P.atriplicifolia is sometimes used in Russia to flavor a vodka-based cocktail. Its flowers are eaten in parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, including Kashmir, adding a sweet flavor to salads; they can also <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> to yield a blue colorant that can be employed in cosmetics or as a textile dye. This species is considered a candidate for use in phytoremediation because of its rapid growth, tolerance for harsh conditions, and ability to accumulate toxic heavy metals from polluted soil.|$|E

5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} rest of the 1894–95 winter {{preparing}} clothing and equipment for the forthcoming sledge journey. Kayaks were built, to be carried on the sledges until needed for the crossing of open water. Preparations were interrupted early in January when violent tremors shook the ship. The crew disembarked, fearing that the vessel would <b>be</b> <b>crushed,</b> but Fram proved herself equal to the danger. On 8 January 1895 the ship's position was 83°34′N, above Greely's previous Farthest North record of 83°24.|$|E
5|$|While Jainism enjoins {{observance}} of total nonviolence by the ascetics, {{it is often}} argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, breathing and surviving {{in order to support}} his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> by walking.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E
5|$|Now at his wit's end, Presto storms {{backstage}} {{to catch}} Alec, but he accidentally releases a weight holding down some stage props, and his foot gets {{caught in a}} rope that lifts {{him up to the}} fly space above the stage. When his foot comes loose from the rope, he falls, along with suspended scenery (including a piano). Alec, realizing that Presto will <b>be</b> <b>crushed,</b> uses the magic hat to save him, earning the audience's wild approval for both himself and Presto. Presto gives Alec the apparently restored carrot, as well as second billing on the posters advertising the show, and they are rewarded for each show they do, with roses for Presto and carrots for Alec.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{spent the}} {{following}} months {{preparing for the}} forthcoming dash for the pole. They built sledges that would facilitate fast travel over rough terrain and constructed kayaks on the Inuit model, for use during the expected water crossings. There were endless trials of special clothing and other gear. Violent and prolonged tremors began to shake the ship on 3 January 1895, and two days later the crew disembarked, expecting the ship to <b>be</b> <b>crushed.</b> Instead the pressure lessened, and the crew went back on board and resumed preparations for Nansen's journey. After the excitement {{it was noted that}} Fram had drifted beyond Greely's Farthest North record of 83°24, and on 8 January was at 83°34′N.|$|E

5|$|When the Prussians broke camp, {{they left}} {{a handful of}} light troops to {{demonstrate}} before the French advance post commanded by the Comte de Saint Germain. These light troops constituted the flank guard on the Schartau hill, which lay {{at right angles to}} the Janus and Pölzen. Frederick had no intention of either forming a line parallel to the enemy or of retreating. His army could move as a unit twice as fast as the Allies' army. If, at the moment of contact, the Allies had already formed their line of battle facing north, then his attack would strike their right flank; if they were still on the move in columns eastwards or northeastwards, the heads of their columns would <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> before the rest could deploy in the new direction, deployment being a lengthy affair for most armies.|$|E
5|$|When {{war began}} in April 1861, Stevens {{argued that the}} Confederates were revolutionaries, to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> by force. He also {{believed}} that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond {{the protection of the}} U.S. Constitution by making war, and in a reconstituted United States, slavery would have no place. Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republican (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the Conservative or Moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. This position gave him power over the House's agenda.|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the Bering Sea. There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the Bering Sea in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to <b>be</b> <b>crushed,</b> and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E

5|$|Later drafts see vice made {{central to}} the plot, with the Le Chiffre {{character}} becoming head {{of a network of}} brothels (as he is in the novel) whose patrons are then blackmailed by Le Chiffre to fund Spectre (an invention of the screenwriter). The racy plot elements opened up by this change of background include a chase scene through Hamburg's red light district that results in Bond escaping whilst disguised as a female mud wrestler. New characters appear such as Lili Wing, a brothel madam and former lover of Bond whose ultimate fate is to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> {{in the back of a}} garbage truck, and Gita, wife of Le Chiffre. The beautiful Gita, whose face and throat are hideously disfigured as a result of Bond using her as a shield during a gunfight in the same sequence which sees Wing meet her fate, goes on to become the prime protagonist in the torture scene that features in the book, a role originally Le Chiffre's.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Tucker {{described}} the early Harry Potter books as {{looking back to}} Victorian and Edwardian children's stories: Hogwarts was an old-style boarding school in which the teachers addressed pupils formally by their surnames and were most concerned with the reputations of the houses {{with which they were}} associated; characters' personalities were plainly shown by their appearances, starting with the Dursleys; evil or malicious characters were to <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> rather than reformed, including Filch's cat Mrs Norris; and the hero, a mistreated orphan who found his true place in life, was charismatic and good at sports, but considerate and protective towards the weak. Several other commentators have stated that the books present a highly stratified society including many social stereotypes. However Karin Westerman drew parallels with 1990s Britain: a class system that was breaking down but defended by those whose power and status it upheld; the multi-ethnic composition of Hogwarts' students; the racial tensions between the various intelligent species; and school bullying.|$|E
5|$|Since Wellington {{was anxious}} {{not to bring}} on an engagement, he tried to flank Soult out of position. He sent Beresford to cross the Gave de Pau {{downstream}} at Lahontan and circle around Soult's right flank. At the same time, Hill's corps moved directly toward Orthez. By 25 February, Soult had massed his army at Orthez and courted battle with the Allies. The French marshal counted 33,000 foot soldiers, 2,000 horsemen, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 48 field guns. Wellington could bring 38,000 infantry, 3,300 cavalry, 1,500 gunners and sappers, supported by 54 artillery pieces against the French. Five battalions were absent: 1/43rd Foot and 1/95th Rifles from the Light Division, 2nd Provisional from 4th Division, 79th Foot from 6th Division and 51st Foot from 7th Division. Confronted with Soult in a fighting mood, the British commander planned to send Beresford to break Soult's right flank while Picton and three divisions kept the French center busy. Meanwhile, Hill's corps was to attack Orthez, get across the Gave de Pau and envelop the French left flank. With luck, Soult would <b>be</b> <b>crushed</b> between Beresford and Hill.|$|E
