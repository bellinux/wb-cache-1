5|$|The South Tower has one freight {{and three}} {{passenger}} elevators. The elevators are the second fastest {{in the city}} of San Francisco, second only to those in 555 California Street and tied with those in 555 Mission Street. The elevators of the South Tower can travel from the ground floor to the 61st floor (the mechanical level) in only 26 seconds to speed passenger traffic flow. This means the elevators can travel about 1,200 vertical feet (366 m) in a minute. The elevators have artificial intelligence control systems that figure out passenger traffic patterns and dispatch the three elevators to handle passenger needs accordingly. The <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> elevator shaft has a cylinder filled with hydraulic oil to stop a falling elevator without injuring the passengers inside.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{assault on}} Attu Island, 2,400 Japanese troops were killed, and only 25 were captured. The Americans' losses were {{significantly}} lower, at 566 dead and 1,442 wounded. The {{bodies of the}} killed Japanese troops were buried in mass graves on the island – only five per cent of Japanese troops fighting on Attu Island wore dog tags, making identification difficult. In addition, many fallen Japanese were buried by their fellow soldiers up in the island's peaks, and many bodies still remain undiscovered. The American burials were undertaken at Massacre Bay {{as well as at}} Holtz Bay – in the former case, the bodies of the soldiers were buried in group graves. Large holes of seven feet in depth were dug by bulldozers, and eight small foot-deep graves were dug at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of these holes to serve as the American soldiers' final resting places.|$|E

5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, one on each side. Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E

25|$|To make a 35mm print (the {{type of film}} stock most smaller theaters could project), a 35mm print {{with black}} borders along the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> frame was used. When projected, the 2.76:1 aspect ratio was retained. Because the film could be adapted to the {{requirements}} of individual theaters, movie houses did not need to install special, expensive 70mm projection equipment. This allowed more theaters to show the film. Six of the 70mm lenses, each worth $100,000, were shipped to Rome for use by the production.|$|E

25|$|The Flyers {{unveiled}} second-generation jerseys for the 1982–83 season. The {{main difference}} was the increased {{width of the}} shoulder and arm stripes with black trim added to {{the border of the}} stripes. Also, a pinstripe (black for the white jersey, orange for the dark) was added to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> sleeve. With the exception of a similarly designed black jersey replacing the orange and the NHL switching back to wearing darks at home and whites on the road prior to 2003–04, this design was used {{until the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E
25|$|Hyperion's {{surface is}} covered with deep, {{sharp-edged}} craters that give it {{the appearance of a}} giant sponge. Dark material fills the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of carbon and hydrogen and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably Iapetus. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance {{to the fact that it}} has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{the open}} access journal Journal of Medical Internet Research was launched, which from its {{inception}} decided to publish {{the names of the}} reviewers at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> published article. Also in 1999, the British Medical Journal moved to an open peer review system, revealing reviewers' identities to the authors but not the readers, and in 2000, the medical journals in the open access BMC series published by BioMed Central, launched using open peer review. As with the BMJ, the reviewers' names are included on the peer review reports. In addition, if the article is published the reports are made available online as part of the 'pre-publication history'.|$|E

25|$|Another {{carpet in}} the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a {{rectangular}} field {{surrounded by an}} eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each {{at the top and}} <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional wefts can be seen meandering over two warps after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.50–1) See: knot density.|$|E
25|$|P46 is {{the second}} New Testament {{manuscript}} in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the Pauline Epistles dating c. 200. What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting {{in the loss of}} some lines at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> folio. The manuscript split up between the Chester Beatty Library and the University of Michigan. Scholars do not believe the Pastoral epistles were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered authored by Paul, is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly {{appointed}} president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman {{to become the first}} president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake programming division. In 1974, ABC premiered the detective series S.W.A.T. That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program Today. Its first attempt at such competition was AM America; however, that show's success was not straightforward. One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show Good Day!. First premiering in 1973 as Good Morning!, it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area. Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program The Morning Exchange, which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting AM America; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, Good Morning America, which debuted on November 3, 1975.|$|E

25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing. This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of spot welding, thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as the window sill for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
