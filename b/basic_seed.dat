In addition, hybrid seed production is conditioned by the production of <b>basic</b> <b>seed</b> of parental inbreds.

This paper presents a chronological overview of the overall activity since 1945. that led to the modern production of maize seed in our country. The activities have been based on scientific, technical and technological achievements within many fields, ranging from genetics and breeding, through growing practices, processing, quality control and legal regulations concerning all of this.

These lines of <b>basic</b> <b>seed</b> help in improving and balancing the needy commercial traits for a specific season or region. The mid pupal weight group (MPW) of males (6. 50 to 7. 50 g), females (9. 00 to 10. 00 g), their combinations and vice versa of Daba ecorace have shown enhanced moth coupling (8. 7 and 5. 2 %), fecundity (4. 9 and 15. 2 %), egg fertility (3. 5 and 3. 1 %) and egg hatching (23. 8 and 24. 8 %) respectively over the control i. e. random mated group.

The results showed that: (1) {{the effect of the}} climatic conditions in different years on the growth duration and yield of mid-season rice is very significant; (2) the effect of sowing date on the growth duration and yield of mid-season rice is very significant. As the sowing date is delayed, the growth duration is shortened. (y = - 0. 2222 x + 132. 98; R = 0. 9983 *, y represents growth duration and x represents sowing date).

The main results could be summarized as follows: Giza 177 cultivar was identified by low flag leaf area, narrow angle of the flag leaf, pale straw grain colour and partly awned. Giza 178 cultivar was characterized with thin seed width, high flag leaf area narrow angle of the flag leaf, high number of tillers/hill and gold grain colour. Sakha 101 cultivar was identified by short plant height, late time of heading, large angle of the flag leaf, straw grain colour, absent awing and strong lemma and palea pubescence.

By using several approaches, we have cloned, sequenced and characterized {alpha}-satellite sequences from two species representing critical nodes in the primate phylogeny: the white-cheeked gibbon, a lesser ape and marmoset, a New World monkey. Sequence analyses demonstrate that white-cheeked gibbon and marmoset {alpha}-satellite sequences are formed by units of [~] 171 bp and [~] 342 bp, respectively, and they both lack high-order structure found in humans and great apes. FISH characterization shows a broad dispersal of alpha-satellite in the white-cheeked gibbon genome including centromeric, telomeric and chromosomal interstitial localizations. On the other side centromeres in marmoset appear organized in highly divergent dimers roughly of 342 bp that show a similarity between monomers much lower than previously reported dimers thus representing an ancient dimeric structure. All these data shed light on the evolution of the centromeric sequences in Primates.
