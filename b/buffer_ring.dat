40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a design for an object-oriented, interprocess communications subsystem {{that supports the}} migration of communication endpoints. All communication is connection-oriented and occurs between two endpoints, represented by Interface Objects (IObjs). A full-duplex connection between IObjs is implemented by one <b>buffer</b> <b>ring</b> per direction; the buffer rings are conceptually shared by both IObjs through a consumer-producer relationship. This design's architecture is location-transparent for naive objects that are not designed to deal specifically with migrating peers. However, the architecutre can keep highly optimized objects informed {{so that they can}} react to migration events and adjust their behavior. The design supplies a framework with which the system can provide efficient object and process migration while maintaining open connections. 1 Introduction Interprocess communication (IPC) is a key primitive in modern operating systems.

40|$|Abstract-Impact {{power tools}} are still widely {{used by many}} professions. Users of these tools are exposed {{to high levels of}} both {{vibration}} and shock. Reported health effects due to hand-arm vibration are ‘hand-arm vibration syndrome ’ (HAVS) and bone and joint injuries and disorders. In the construction industry a case study was conducted on one specific activity: removing concrete from the head of foundation piles. Pile heads are removed to allow the reinforcement rods to be connected {{to the rest of the}} foundation. Factors determining the vibration exposure were measured and the type and size of other occupational hazards were assessed qualitatively. The results showed that there was excessive exposure to vibration from the widely used hand-operated pneumatic drill as well as high exposure to other occupational hazards. The age of the drill, the make, the working pressure and the presence of a <b>buffer</b> <b>ring</b> have measurable effects on the level of vibration. But these adjustments only have a limited effect on the total workload. Instead of an exposure-oriented solution the present workload requires aource-ori-ented solutions. which are expected to be more effective. A systematic approach towards the generation of possible solutions was adopted following the individual steps of the ‘problem-solving cycle’, in combination with the design analysis technique. Design analysis is a method which can generate different types of solutions resulting in a reduction of the various hazards to an acceptable level. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{document}} addresses {{two issues}} in the original paper entitled 'An Intelligent, Onboard Signal Processing Payload Concept' submitted to the SPIE AeroSense 2003 C 0 nference. l Since the original paper submission, and prior to the scheduled presentation, a correction {{has been made to}} one of the figures in the original paper and an update has been performed to the software simulation of the payload concept. The figure, referred to as Figure 8. Simulation Results in the original paper, contains an error in the voltage versus the capacity drained chart. This chart does not correctly display the voltage changes experienced by the battery module due to the varying discharge rates. This error is an artifact of the procedure used to graph the data. Additionally, the original version of the Simulation related the algorithm execution rate to the lightning event rate regardless of the number of events in the <b>ring</b> <b>buffer.</b> This feature was mentioned in section 5. Simulation Results of the original paper. A correction was also made {{to the size of the}} <b>ring</b> <b>buffer.</b> Incorrect information was provided to the authors that placed the number of possible events at 18, 310. Corrected information has since been obtained that specifies the <b>ring</b> <b>buffer</b> can typically hold only 1, 000 events. This has a significant impact on the APM process and the number of events lost when the size of the <b>ring</b> <b>buffer</b> is exceeded. Also, upon further analysis, it was realized that the simulation contained an error in the recording of the number of events in the <b>ring</b> <b>buffer.</b> The faster algorithms, LMS and ML, should have been able to process all events during the simulation time interval, but the initial results did not reflect this characteristic.

40|$|Multichannel local-area {{networks}} can {{be constructed}} using fiber-optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) techniques. In this paper, WDM is applied to ring networks such as FDDI, token ring, slotted <b>ring,</b> and <b>buffer</b> insertion <b>ring</b> architectures. Crosstalk and insertion loss analyses of grating demultiplexers shows that the ratio of channel separation to channel width must be greater than four. Performance analyses of the multichannel WDM ring are formulated to determine the packet delay. The delay in the multichannel token ring is obtained by summing the remaining service time, token walk time, and the average service time of newly arrived messages. The remaining service time is estimated by approximating {{the system as a}} M/M/m queue. The multichannel slotted <b>ring</b> and <b>buffer</b> insertion <b>ring</b> are modeled by a non-preemptive head-of-the-line priority queuing system. By identifying that portion of the passing ring traffic having priority over local traffic, the delay of a tagged packet can be obtained as the sum of the residual service time and service times of local waiting packets and newly arrived ring packets. Two implementations are identified, one with parallel optical transmitters and receivers and protocol modules, and another using an array of laser diodes and photodetectors and a single protocol module. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Resilient Packet Ring (RPR- IEEE 802. 17) is an {{insertion}} <b>buffer,</b> dual <b>ring</b> technology, {{utilizing a}} back pressure based fairness algorithm to distribute bandwidth when congestion occurs. The fairness algorithm may oscillate and under some conditions the oscillations continue indefinitely even under stable load conditions. In this paper, we evaluate the latency experienced by packets sent during such oscillations. We analyze transient behavior {{and how the}} oscillations of the fairness algorithm influence the jitter caused by unfair access to the ring, as well as jitter caused by the insertion <b>buffers</b> around the <b>ring.</b> We conclude that, in most cases, latency and jitter are within acceptable bounds. A modification to the RPR fairness algorithm has previously been proposed by the authors, but its implications on latency has never before been demonstrated. We compare the improved fairness algorithm to the original, and find that the modified algorithm, for all evaluated scenarios, perform at least {{as well as the}} original with respect to latency and jitter. In some problem scenarios, we find that the modified algorithm performs significantly better than the original...|$|R
