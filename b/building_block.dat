We hypothesize that, in addition to the normal notion of co-operative <b>building</b> <b>blocks,</b> there are also competitive <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> in the population. These competitive <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are all of the rooted variety, all share a similar root struc-ture and compete with each other to spread their particular extensions to the common structure throughout the population. We demonstrate that not only do these competitive <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> exist, but that they work in tandem with non-rooted co-operative <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> ...|$|R

Periphyton is the basic <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter.

5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite <b>building</b> <b>block</b> respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and increases the likelihood of human error.|$|E

30|$|Programmable DNA {{tiles and}} their {{assembly}} into crystals can be exploited to construct arrays of various nanoscale <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> This {{has been accomplished}} by employing the DNA crystals as scaffolds onto which nanoscale <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> systematically attach.

Using these approaches, various <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> were controllably assembled, including arrays of proteins [165, 167, 169 – 171] and nanoparticles [168, 171 – 173].

5|$|The debacle in Russia {{loosened}} the French {{grip on the}} German princes. In 1813, Napoleon {{mounted a}} campaign in the German states {{to bring them back}} into the French orbit; the subsequent War of Liberation culminated in the great Battle of Leipzig, also known as the Battle of Nations. In October 1813, more than 500,000 combatants engaged in ferocious fighting over three days, making it the largest European land battle of the 19th century. The engagement resulted in a decisive victory for the Coalition of Austria, Prussia, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, and it ended French power east of the Rhine. Success encouraged the Coalition forces to pursue Napoleon across the Rhine; his army and his government collapsed, and the victorious Coalition incarcerated Napoleon on Elba. During the brief Napoleonic restoration known as the 100 Days of 1815, forces of the Seventh Coalition, including an Anglo-Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard von Blücher, were victorious at Waterloo (18 June 1815). The critical role played by Blücher's troops, especially after having to retreat from the field at Ligny the day before, helped to turn the tide of combat against the French. The Prussian cavalry pursued the defeated French in the evening of 18 June, sealing the allied victory. From the German perspective, the actions of Blücher's troops at Waterloo, and the combined efforts at Leipzig, offered a rallying point of pride and enthusiasm. This interpretation became a key <b>building</b> <b>block</b> of the Borussian myth expounded by the pro-Prussian nationalist historians later in the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> {{are common}} {{structures}} of high-quality solutions. Genetic algorithms often assume the building-block hypothesis. It is {{hypothesized that the}} high-quality solutions are composed of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> and the solution quality can be improved by composing <b>building</b> <b>blocks.</b> The studies of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> are limited to some artificial optimization functions {{in which it is}} obvious that the <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> exist. A large number of successful applications has been reported without a strong evidence that proves the hypothesis. This paper proposes a quantitative approach for validating the building-block hypothesis. We define the quantity of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> and the degree of discontinuity by using the chi-square matrix. We test the building-block hypothesis with 15 -bit onemax, 5 × 3 -trap, parabola 1 − (x 2 / 10 10), and two-dimensional Euclidian traveling salesman problem (TSP). The building-block hypothesis holds for onemax, 5 × 3 -trap, and parabola. In the case of parabola, Gray coding gives a higher quantity of <b>building</b> <b>blocks</b> than that of binary coding. The hypothesis is accepted for random instances of TSP with a low confidence. ...|$|R
