5|$|Spiroplasma is a cell wall–deficient {{bacterium}} {{related to}} Mycoplasma, which some think may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the TSEs. The {{lack of a}} cell wall means it is not susceptible to conventional antibiotics such as penicillin, which target cell wall synthesis. Frank O. Bastian of Louisiana State University first discovered Spiroplasma-like inclusions in the brain of a CJD patient during an autopsy in 1979 and has hypothesized that this bacterium could possibly <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the TSEs.|$|E

5|$|Divalent {{europium}} (Eu2+) {{in small}} amounts is the activator of the bright blue fluorescence of some samples of the mineral fluorite (CaF2). The reduction from Eu3+ to Eu2+ is induced by irradiation with energetic particles. The most outstanding examples of this originated around Weardale and adjacent parts of northern England; it was the fluorite found here that fluorescence was named after in 1852, {{although it was not}} until much later that europium was determined to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 17th-century Germany, the {{physician}} Eberhard Gockel discovered lead-contaminated wine to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of {{an epidemic of}} colic. He had noticed that monks who did not drink wine were healthy, while wine drinkers developed colic, and traced the cause to sugar of lead, made by simmering litharge with vinegar. As a result, Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Württemberg issued an edict in 1696 banning the adulteration of wines with litharge.|$|E
5|$|Intense and {{prolonged}} exposure to workplace dusts, chemicals and fumes {{increase the risk}} of COPD in both smokers and nonsmokers. Workplace exposures are believed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> in 10–20% of cases. In the United States they are believed to be related to more than 30% of cases among those who have never smoked and probably represent a greater risk in countries without sufficient regulations.|$|E

Machinima takes copyrighted property (such as characters in a game engine) and repurposes it to tell a story, but another common practice in machinima-making is to retell an existing story from a different medium in that engine.|$|E
5|$|Prions are {{infectious}} agents composed {{entirely of}} a protein material that can fold in multiple, structurally abstract ways, {{at least one}} of which is transmissible to other prion proteins, leading to disease {{in a manner that is}} epidemiologically comparable to the spread of viral infection.

5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have very weak manes. Maneless, male African lions have also been {{reported}} from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone {{has been linked to}} mane growth; therefore, castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. In addition, increased testosterone may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. Vaginitis may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of articular cartilage defects in 2% of cases {{in a study of}} 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{in females}} where {{ulceration}} is correlated to the menstrual cycle or to birth control pills, progestogen or {{a change in}} birth control may be beneficial. Use of nicotine replacement therapy {{for people who have}} developed oral ulceration after stopping smoking has also been reported. Starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition. Trauma can be reduced by avoiding rough or sharp foodstuffs and by brushing teeth with care. If sodium lauryl sulfate is suspected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> avoidance of products containing this chemical may be useful and prevent recurrence in some individuals. Similarly patch testing may indicate that food allergy is responsible, and the diet modified accordingly. If investigations reveal deficiency states, correction of the deficiency may result in resolution of the ulceration. For example, {{there is some evidence that}} vitamin B12 supplementation may prevent recurrence in some individuals.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi are less likely to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that it could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E

5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana says: When Ravana {{wants to}} marry Mandodari, Maya warns him that her {{horoscope}} indicated her first-born would destroy her clan and should be killed. Ignoring Maya's advice, Ravana buries his first child by Mandodari in a casket in Janaka’s city, where it is discovered and grew up as Sita. Jain adaptations of the Ramayana like Vasudevahindi, Uttara-purana, and others also state that Sita {{is the daughter of}} Ravana and Mandodari, and is abandoned when she is prophesied to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the end of Ravana and his family.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause.</b> Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
5|$|The team took a brief hiatus after Brands Hatch, {{returning}} for Imola {{once again}} {{but they were}} unable to repeat their previous performance, both cars crashing out. Lancia once again skipped Fuji in Japan, returning for the South African round at Kyalami where Patrese and Nannini led home a 1-2 finish. Although the LC2 earned its second win, none of the leading Porsche teams attended the event in protest of the countries Apartheid laws. Unable to challenge further for the Constructors or Drivers Championships, the team did not attend the final round of the year at Sandown Park in Melbourne, Australia.
