40|$|Background Brick tea type {{fluorosis}} is {{a public}} health concern in the north-west area of China. The asso-ciation between SNPs of genes influencing bone mass and fluorosis has attracted attention, but the association of SNPs with the risk of brick-tea type of fluorosis has not been reported. Objective To investigate the modifying roles of GSTP 1 rs 1695 polymorphisms on this association. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Brick-tea water was tested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> GB 1996 - 2005 (China). Urinary fluoride was tested <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> WS/T 89 - 2006 (China).

30|$|However, while Argentina’s stance was {{not that}} {{peculiar}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> developing countries, where inward-looking development strategies were the norm, it was unusual <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rich countries, the club to which ostensibly Argentina wished to belong, or rather remain. After 1945, the gradual progress of GATT (and in Europe of the EU project after 1957) carried trade integration rapidly forward. But until the Uruguay Round (circa 1990) of negotiations, Argentina, like most other developing countries, stood apart from this process, and policies remained strongly protectionist.|$|R
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} concerts, lectures and {{recitals}} called the Glastonbury Festivals was established with a summer {{school in the}} town of Glastonbury between 1914 and 1926 by classical composer Rutland Boughton (1878–1960), and with their location attracted a bohemian audience <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the time. They featured works by then-contemporary composers, sponsored by the Clark family, as well as a wide range of traditional works, from Everyman to James Shirley's Cupid and Death.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{earnings}} from his offices {{had made him}} a wealthy man, even <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> his patrons. This wealth allowed him to purchase the Balcaskie estate in 1665, and to extend the house and gardens. In 1675 he purchased the larger estate of Loch Leven, Kinross, from the Earl of Morton, which brought him the hereditary sheriffdom of Kinross-shire. In the late 1670s Bruce took on his first architectural projects for entirely new houses.|$|E

5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, unite the disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination {{than most of the}} better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{grew up to}} be {{tall and}} muscular, and was {{considered}} good looking <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the period. He had a reputation as a competent public speaker and was known for his generosity to his household staff. Unusually, he enjoyed rowing, as well as hedging and ditching, and enjoyed associating with labourers and other lower-class workers. This behaviour was not considered normal for the nobility of the period and attracted criticism from contemporaries.|$|E

5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized country <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> Britain, Germany or the United States. A major {{hindrance}} to full industrialisation was {{the lack}} of energy sources such as coal or hydropower. Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E
5|$|He had {{a liberal}} {{education}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> {{his age and}} learned French, German and Latin. He showed {{a special interest in}} history and astrology. A cleric from Wrocław, Nicholas, taught him the basic principles of Christian faith. However, Louis's religious zeal was due to his mother's influence. In a royal charter, Louis remembered that in his childhood, a knight of the royal court, Peter Poháros, often carried him on his shoulders. His two tutors, Nicholas Drugeth and Nicholas Knesich, saved the lives of both Louis and his younger brother, Andrew, when Felician Záh attempted to assassinate the royal family in Visegrád on 17 April 1330.|$|E
5|$|His {{position}} in the firm was sufficiently elevated that he received business correspondence at the factory; for example, a letter to Perrins survives from October 1791, when a John Stratford sought his advice.

The conclusion is that globalization is not the primary obstacle to efforts to address such concerns. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1912 the Davis Library {{was added}} to the campus with space for 5,000 volumes.

5|$|Isabella {{was only}} 12 {{years old at}} the time of her wedding, young <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> the period, and Edward {{probably}} had sexual relations with mistresses during their first few years together. During this time Edward fathered an illegitimate son, Adam, who was born possibly as early as 1307. Edward and Isabella's first son, the future Edward III, was born in 1312 amid great celebrations, and three more children followed: John in 1316, Eleanor in 1318 and Joan in 1321.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{initially}} had a garrison {{of eight}} gunners, five soldiers and a lieutenant, {{under the command}} of a captain.

In the 1580s, the castle caught fire and the timber needed for the repairs required 127 trees to be sent from the New Forest.

5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces.
