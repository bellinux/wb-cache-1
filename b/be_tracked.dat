5|$|On July 16, 1970, a large {{disturbance}} {{separated from}} the Intertropical Convergence Zone near Panama. The broad area of convection dominated the region between Swan Island and western Cuba by July 18.

5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} to cancel the MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes had all been near completion.

In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E

Bond follows a lead to the Bahamas, where he meets up with his CIA counterpart and friend Felix Leiter. The pair suspect a rich playboy, Emilio Largo, and search the area around his yacht and then the area where they think the yacht may have travelled. After finding the plane—but without the nuclear devices on board—the two agents arrange for Largo's yacht to <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> and ambushed once the bombs are being moved by Largo.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E

5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began to loop around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued to loop cyclonically and could <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> for a further day or two within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E
5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not a catastrophic extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
5|$|Shira Chess {{argues that}} the Slender Man exemplifies the {{similarities}} between traditional folklore and the open source ethos of the Internet, and that, unlike those of traditional monsters such as vampires and werewolves, {{the fact that the}} Slender Man's mythos can <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> and signposted offers a powerful insight into how myth and folklore form. Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect the responses of his/her audience).|$|E

5|$|Observed {{by humans}} {{since the dawn}} of history, the {{behaviour}} of ants has been documented and the subject of early writings and fables passed from one century to another. Those using scientific methods, myrmecologists, study ants in the laboratory and in their natural conditions. Their complex and variable social structures have made ants ideal model organisms. Ultraviolet vision was first discovered in ants by Sir John Lubbock in 1881. Studies on ants have tested hypotheses in ecology and sociobiology, and have been particularly important in examining the predictions of theories of kin selection and evolutionarily stable strategies. Ant colonies may be studied by rearing or temporarily maintaining them in formicaria, specially constructed glass framed enclosures. Individuals may <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> for study by marking them with dots of colours.|$|E
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes. They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son Ketamine established natal dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer <b>be</b> <b>tracked.</b> A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. Benzedrine is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E

5|$|The games {{introduce}} Raikou, Entei, and Suicune, {{some new}} types of legendary Pokémon that wander around Johto, changing locations frequently. They can <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> by the Pokédex once encountered, and will always attempt to flee, but will retain HP loss. In addition {{there is the possibility}} of encountering a shiny Pokémon, which have a different coloration than normal Pokémon of their species, and appear very rarely. Two new Pokémon types were added, the Steel-type and the Dark-type. Steel-type Pokémon are immune to Poison-type moves, and they have very high defense and resistance to other types, while Dark-type Pokémon are immune to Psychic-type moves and are strong against Psychic-type Pokémon, as well as having few weaknesses. In Gold and Silver, new moves were added, but Pokémon knowing these moves are not allowed to be traded to the first generation games. To solve this, a move deleter was introduced, capable of erasing moves known by the Pokémon. Another major change was the splitting of the Special stat into Special Attack and Special Defense, which increased aspects of strategy.|$|E
5|$|To {{determine}} winds aloft, rawinsondes determine {{wind speed}} by GPS, radio navigation, or radar tracking of the probe. Alternatively, {{movement of the}} parent weather balloon position can <b>be</b> <b>tracked</b> from the ground visually using theodolites. Remote sensing techniques for wind include SODAR, Doppler lidars and radars, which can measure the Doppler shift of electromagnetic radiation scattered or reflected off suspended aerosols or molecules, and radiometers and radars {{can be used to}} measure the surface roughness of the ocean from space or airplanes. Ocean roughness can be used to estimate wind velocity close to the sea surface over oceans. Geostationary satellite imagery can be used to estimate the winds throughout the atmosphere based upon how far clouds move from one image to the next. Wind engineering describes the study {{of the effects of the}} wind on the built environment, including buildings, bridges and other man-made objects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. If Λ is the Cayley graph of a Gromov {{hyperbolic}} group, {{then it is}} {{a fundamental}} fact that quasi-geodesics in Λ <b>are</b> <b>tracked</b> by geodesics. Let (W,S) be a finitely generated Coxeter system and Λ(W,S) the Cayley graph of (W,S). For general Coxeter groups, not all quasi-geodesic rays in Λ <b>are</b> <b>tracked</b> by geodesics. In this paper we clas-sify the Λ-quasi-geodesic rays that <b>are</b> <b>tracked</b> by geodesics. As corol-laries we show that if W acts geometrically on a CAT(0) space X, then CAT(0) geodesics in X <b>are</b> <b>tracked</b> by Cayley graph geodesics (where the Cayley graph is equivariantly placed in X) and for any A ⊂ S, the special subgroup 〈A 〉 is quasi-convex in X. We also show that if g {{is an element of}} infinite order for (W,S) then the subgroup 〈g 〉 <b>is</b> <b>tracked</b> by a Cayley geodesic in Λ(W,S) (in analogy with the corresponding result for word hyperbolic groups). 1...|$|R
