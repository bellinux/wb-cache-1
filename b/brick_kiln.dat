5|$|Maryland and Delaware plan to {{continue}} to upgrade US 113 to introduce freeway elements and access control to improve service on the U.S. Highway. MDSHA has a Phase 5 in its US 113 divided highway project {{for the construction of}} an interchange between US113 and MD12 in Snow Hill. As of 2007, the interchange was planned to be a dumbbell interchange, a variation on the diamond interchange with roundabouts replacing the two intersections of the ramps with the crossroad. The work would include adding service roads to improve access among US 113, MD 12, Washington Street, and <b>Brick</b> <b>Kiln</b> Road. , Phase 5 was stalled in the design stage with no estimated completion date. The state has long-term plans to establish partial control of access on US 113 between Pocomoke City and {{the south end of the}} Snow Hill bypass. Once that project is complete, the only remaining stretch of US 113 in Maryland without access controls will be from Hayes Landing Road to the south end of the Berlin bypass.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Kathmandu Valley {{among the}} other {{environment}} pollutions, air pollution is one of them. Valley is vulnerable due to its topography, which restricts the wind movement and allows pollutants to remain within the valley and the anthropocentric reasons. <b>Brick</b> <b>kilns</b> are {{the major source of}} air pollution along with other sources. These are not only deteriorating air quality and it is also degrading the health of the people living near the kilns. This research is base on both primary and secondary data sources to know about <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> pollution impacts on human health and environment around <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> zones, and to find out for minimize the air pollution do <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> adopt new technologies. For this research, primary data were collected from Nalin Chock of Bhaktapur district because many <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> were situated there and secondary data sources were provided the information about <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> production of different toxic pollutant components for air pollution and human hazards. Respondents of this research have shared that they are suffering with diseases like respiratory, nasal cognition, burning of eyes and loss of visibility, which accelerated many accidents on that particular area due to <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> However, positive outcome {{of this study is that}} recently government has decided to ban Bulls Trench <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> in Kathmandu as a result; entrepreneurs are searching for environment friendly and cost effective alternative technologies, which will help us to built pollution free city...|$|R

Hence, a study was undertaken in <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> in Bharuch district, Gujarat state, India to study the problem of malaria in the work force. Mass blood surveys were carried out in 15 <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> Blood slides were collected from both febrile and afebrile cases.

About 150 million of children are involved in child labour throughout the world. In South Asia, almost 17 million children between five and seventeen years of age are involved in child labour and 2 million of children are involved in child labour from Nepal. Child labour issue is high among Dalit/lower caste community where one in every three children in Nepal is child laborers and about 1 million children are engaged in hazardous and exploitative activities because of the caste based discrimination and extreme poverty. The Purpose {{of this research is}} to identify the reasons behind the lower castes children involved in laborers activities and further studying in details about the sub-caste of lower caste children, their physical working condition in <b>brick</b> <b>kilns,</b> how they are exploited in work and the pulling factors to work precisely in <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> The research was conducted at the <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> of Kathmandu valley which consists: Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur district. The sample size for the research was 60 which was taken from 2 <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> from each district and from each kiln ten samples were taken, and the purposive sampling method was used. The study is based on questionnaires, interviews, observation, review of literature and reports. Poverty was the major reasons found behind the involvement of lower castes children in labourer’s activities in <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> The second reason is the advance money provided by the owner/naikes of the <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> The third reason is the caste discrimination in the village society where they work and get very less money, or sometimes they have to work without money. The wage in the kiln is based on the quantity i. e. the number of brick produced or the number of brick carried. So, the families who brought their children along with them knowingly or unknowingly involved their children in the work of <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> like clay making, carrying bricks, moulding the bricks, domestic works like preparing food, making tea, cleaning dishes and laundry and as well as looking after their younger siblings. Some of the parents send their children to their relatives and neighbour to work in the <b>brick</b> <b>kilns.</b> Being the lower castes children, they are primarily exploited in the labourer’s activities from their household conditions because of the poor economic background of the families and uneducated parents where they couldn't go to school and are compelled to involve in child labour...|$|R

In 1856 a Methodist Chapel was built. [...] During the mid-19th century, the increasing population led to calls for social amenities to be improved; footpaths were a particular concern, although an examination of ordnance survey mapping demonstrates the continued isolation of the village generally. The success of Warburton's pottery resulted in a street being named after him, but the lack of residential development is evident. Carr Hill glassworks and quarries are still clearly marked, along with Swan Pond and a public house, The Free Gardeners Arms.

As it had turned out, only this small group was stationed at Little Bethel, not the large force that Butler expected to find there. Gordon, in discussing the mistakes of the Union commanders in this operation says: [...] "But behind all this was the most serious mistake of all [...] a mistake in Butler's plan. The Confederates had no outpost of strength at Little Bethel, and the scheme to surround and capture it was an attack on a man of straw." [...] He says that Butler could have struck the road to Yorktown [...] north of Big Bethel and compelled Magruder to withdraw to Yorktown without firing a shot. The 5th New York Infantry (Duryee's Zouaves) had again been sent by Peirce as the leading regiment. Finding the Confederates were in flight from Little Bethel, the 5th New York Infantry burned the church at Little Bethel so the Confederates could not use it as an outpost and also set fire to the homes of several secessionists. The Union force then continued toward Big Bethel.|$|E

The aim of this study isto estimate reduction of air pollutants resulting from <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> functioning with natural gasin Yazdprovince. Methods: In this descriptive-survey research, we estimated consumption of the fuel oil in the <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> with considering the usage of fuel oil instead ofnatural gas at the studied time usingthe heating value of the fuel oil and natural gas consumption of 46 gas-makingbrick kilnsin the Yazd province from 2008 to 2012. Then the produced air pollutants from the natural gasconsumption andproduced air pollutants by assuming consumption of the fuel oil instead of natural gasin the brick kilnsat this timewere compared and the rate and value of reduction in each one of pollutants weredetected. Finally, the value of budget savings and social costs of the environmental damage resulting from the usage of natural gas instead of fuel oil were calculated on the basis ofusing the price per liter of fuel oil and natural gas per cubic meter as well as the studies by the World Bank and the Environmental Protection Agency of Iran. Results: The results indicated that emission of air pollutants is reduced up to 130485. 71 ton in CO 2 and 8695. 63 ton in other pollutants by run-by-gas <b>brick</b> <b>kilns</b> in the studied area since 2008 – 2011 (end of September).
