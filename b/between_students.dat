40|$|The California {{and federal}} governments have enacted {{legislation}} to improve student academic achievement {{with a focus on}} allocating resources to the classroom and teacher. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether a relationship exists <b>between</b> <b>student</b> academic achievement and the responsibilities of school boards and superintendents. Each responsibility contains a subset of district and school-level practices implemented by the board or superintendent. This author (see Appendix E) designed the District Index of Similar Schools Rankings (DISSR) to measure student achievement in an attempt to limit the impact of school and student characteristics on scores of state-mandated assessments. This study also determined whether a relationship exists <b>between</b> <b>student</b> academic achievement and the tenure of superintendents in their current district.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationships between technology-rich laboratories and (a) student attitude toward science, and (b) achievement in science. Forty high school biology students in Southern California were the participants in the study. Students were divided into experimental and control groups in this comparison study. The experimental group used technological tools while conducting laboratory experiments. The control group used traditional methods to conduct their laboratory experiments. The dependent variables, attitude and achievement, were examined independently. The research focused on the following questions: (a) Is there a relationship <b>between</b> <b>student</b> use of technology and student attitude toward science? (b) Is there a relationship <b>between</b> <b>student</b> use of technology and student achievement in science?

In 2016, 44 percent of applications to full-time, first-year studies were accepted. In 2013, the secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Queen's was 89% overall, with the Commerce, Education and Engineering faculties having the highest entrance averages at 91.7%, 90.8%, and 90.6% respectively. The application process emphasizes the mandatory Personal Statement of Experience (PSE). The statement expresses how the applicant's personal experiences may contribute to the university. It focuses on qualifications and involvement outside of academics and is an important factor in determining admission. Several faculties require applicants to submit a supplementary essay.|$|E

The statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, including graduation ceremonies, pep rallies, festivals, and protests. Occasionally, the statue is a target of vandalism in an ongoing historical rivalry <b>between</b> <b>students</b> of Rutgers and Princeton University.

40|$|Michael Moore 2 ̆ 7 s {{theory of}} {{transactional}} distance, {{developed in the}} age of correspondence schools, contributed greatly to theory building in distance education. The theory needs revision, however, when applied to web-based learning environments, specifically by defining transactional distance to include students 2 ̆ 7 relationships with other elements in the learning environment that prohibit their active engagement with learning. The new theoretical model of transactional distance has four dimensions: transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and student (TDSS), transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and teacher (TDST), transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and content (TDSC), and transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and interface: online course management system (TDSI). A preliminary item pool of more than 200 items to measure the constructs of TD, TDST, TDSS, TDSC, and TDSI was generated and sent to a panel of experts for review. Items that the reviewers considered weak or very weak in terms of relevance to the constructs and/or clarity and conciseness were eliminated. After a pilot test and further revisions, the proposed scale of transactional distance was administered to a sample of 100 college students. Confirmatory factor analyses and exploratory analyses indicated that the measurement models, especially after modifications, possessed good fit for the data, and the modified scales possessed factorial validity. Reliability analyses indicated that the scales possessed strong internal consistency, with Cronbach alpha coefficients ranging from 0. 8169 to 0. 9530. Structural equation modeling procedures tested for the causal relationship between the four dimensions and students 2 ̆ 7 general sense of transactional distance in web-based courses. Results indicate that the proposed model of transactional distance is acceptable. The strongest factor that affected students 2 ̆ 7 sense of transactional distance and engagement with learning was found to be transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and students (TDSS), followed by transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and teacher (TDST), and then by transactional distance <b>between</b> <b>student</b> and content (TDSC). The findings have implications {{for the development of a}} revised theory of transactional distance in online education, and provide strong support for constructivist learning theories and social learning theories, reinforcing the importance of establishing learning communities in online learning environments...|$|R

Two days later, at the University at Buffalo, police wounded four more demonstrators. On 15 May city and state police killed two and wounded twelve at Jackson State College (now Jackson State University) in Jackson, Mississippi. Earlier, on 8 May 100,000 protesters had gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco on only ten days notice.
