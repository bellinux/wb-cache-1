5|$|All of M-32 {{consists}} of rural two-lane highway {{outside of the}} city of Gaylord. The highway passes through forest lands outside of the communities along the highway. From US131 east to the eastern terminus at US23, M-32 is listed on the National Highway System (NHS), a group of highways which are determined to be important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The exception is a portion in eastern Otsego and western Montmorency counties, between the corner of Beckett & Turtle Lake Roads, six miles (10km) east of Gaylord to the crossroads known as <b>Big</b> <b>Rock,</b> five miles (8km) west of Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of the valley, the only area traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of <b>Big</b> <b>Rock</b> Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E

BloodPop also detailed the track as containing traditional songwriting and influences of soul, but not in a literal way. [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] is written in the key of F minor with a tempo of 126 beats per minute. The song is composed in the time signature of common time, and follows a basic chord progression of Fm–E/G–Dmaj7–Cm7, and Gaga's vocals span from F3 to D5.|$|E

500|$|In the 1880s, {{the federal}} {{government}} began closing many small arsenals {{around the country in}} favor of smaller ones built near railroads for quick deployment. The arsenal commander received word from Washington that the Little Rock site must be abandoned [...] "not later than October 1, 1890." [...] On April 12, 1893 the tower building and the surrounding buildings were traded to the city of Little Rock for 1,000acres (4km²) in North Little Rock under the condition that the building and land be [...] "forever exclusively devoted to the uses and purposes of a public park" [...] for 1,000acres (4km²) in <b>Big</b> <b>Rock</b> Mountain {{on the north side of}} the Arkansas River, present day North Little Rock.

500|$|In {{his book}} Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams writes that, unlike Lennon and McCartney on their 1970 solo albums, [...] "Harrison {{concentrated}} on pure joyous melodies – {{the kind of}} songs that had made the group so loved", and he says of [...] "Awaiting on You All": [...] "Spector repaid Harrison for his benediction on the Ike and Tina Turner album cover by {{turning it into a}} virtual remake of 'River Deep – Mountain High'." [...] Mark Ribowsky, another Spector biographer, writes of the producer's contribution to this and other songs on All Things Must Pass: [...] "Phil's rhythmically pounding basses and drum feels sutured George's sentimentality with cheerful energy and made Indian asceticism into dance music." [...] Simon Leng describes [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as a [...] "hot gospel stomper" [...] and [...] "the most successful example of Spector's work on the album". Writing for NME Originals in 2005, Adrian Thrills named [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] and [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as examples of [...] "a tendency to over-egg the mix" [...] on the otherwise [...] "magnificent" [...] All Things Must Pass, adding: [...] "it is hard to think of another <b>big</b> <b>rock</b> album on which the tambourine is shaken quite so relentlessly." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} met with high praise from critics. Ashley Zimmerman from the New Times Broward-Palm Beach called the opening night of the tour [...] "memorable", {{describing}} the set by Thirty Seconds to Mars as [...] "a bit like a party", during which lead vocalist Jared Leto provided [...] "raw and beautiful vocals". She further wrote that co-headliner Linkin Park played a [...] "great mix {{of old and new}} songs" [...] that was able to please those who brought the band to fame, while still showcasing the newest work. Jay Cridlin of the Tampa Bay Times commented that the two bands made Steinbrenner Field's return to concert a [...] "smashing spectacle" [...] creating a [...] "powerful, festival-like feeling". He felt that Thirty Seconds to Mars delivered a [...] "fully committed performance", praising the band's energy on stage, and noticed the [...] "futuristic" [...] production of the show by Linkin Park. Alison Angel, writing for Creative Loafing Charlotte, opined that the tour offered fans a chance to catch [...] "three <b>big</b> <b>rock</b> bands" [...] on a single event and felt that each performance was a [...] "sight to behold". She further said, [...] "between AFI tearing up the stage before the headliners even appeared, to the theatrics in Thirty Seconds to Mars' act and the grand performance of hard-rocking Linkin Park, fans walked out with a sense that this moment was truly once in a lifetime." [...] Danny Crandall of The Sun Chronicle commented that Linkin Park [...] "blitzed through an intense, head-bobbing" [...] set, while Thirty Seconds to Mars played a [...] "rousing performance" [...] high on audience interaction.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was mostly positive. Many reviews praised the Moby Dick conversation between Mulder and Scully. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club was positive towards the episode, grading it an A-. He wrote that it [...] "starts off amazingly" [...] and positively noted {{the way the}} monster was handled. However, he noted {{that it was the}} [...] "linger" [...] conversation scene that [...] "sets 'Quagmire' apart from all the other standard Monster Of The Week procedurals." [...] John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode was a strong look into the psychological issues that Mulder and Scully are carrying around this season. The plot of the episode {{is little more than a}} tool chosen to pry into the minds of the two agents, revealing just how dependent they are on each other. A rare case of character development taking center stage." [...] Keegan also wrote positively of the conversation sequence, writing that the [...] "isolation caused by the sinking of the boat [...] forces Mulder and Scully to actually discuss their issues." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called [...] "Quagmire" [...] a [...] "delightful little gem" [...] and [...] "something rather magical". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised Anderson and Duchovny's acting, calling their performances [...] "beautifully played". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She referred to the episode as [...] "part Jaws, part The Lost World, and part Buster Keaton" [...] and noted that the third act was when the episode [...] "becomes truly special, when Mulder and Scully are forced to abandon ship and take refuge on a <b>big</b> <b>rock</b> in the middle of a pitch-black night." [...] Vitaris, however, was critical of the episode's closing shot, noting that the [...] "shot destroys the story's ambiguity. A large ripple in the water would have been much more clever." ...|$|E
