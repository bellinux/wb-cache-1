50|$|Zapata II {{is a true}} Southern California classic {{owned by}} Los Angeles Yacht Club members Sage and Kelly of San Pedro, California, who {{purchased}} her in July 2015 from Jim and Marion Jordan. This unique, custom-built yacht was designed by Wendell “Skip” Calkins. She was commissioned for a Southern California owner in 1964 and built by American Marine in Hong Kong (builder of the 'Grand Banks' line of power boats), using strip planked mahogany over oak frames. Zapata II {{was designed to be}} light (22,000 lb), maximizing sailing performance (unusual during that era) and proved to be hard to beat in west coast racing events. Skip Calkins designed a fast, light, easily driven hull with a powerful rig. This custom design followed the famous (light displacement) “LEGEND”, winner of the 1957 Honolulu race. The yachts were cutting edge for their time. She is 70% the weight with 130% better <b>ballast</b> <b>displacement</b> ratio than the production (Sloop-rigged) Calkins 50. The lines are simple and clean. She is most easily identified by her distinctive flush deck, double-ended hull form (with canoe stern), lack of overhang fore and aft and ketch rig with relatively small aft mast. Maintained to high standards through four Southern California owners, she has benefited from 35 years of continuous ownership by her previous owners, the Jordans. Zapata II was winner of several yacht opening day inspections trophies. She is a classic, one-of-a-kind vessel with an excellent history.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the keys}} to an {{efficient}} loading of oil in the Arctic offshore is probably a subsea solution where the interference with ice is at a minimum. Therefore an attempt to assess the performance of an Arctic Shuttle Barge System including a subsea mooring and loading terminal was done at a model-scale of 1 : 25 in the Hamburg Ship Model Basin (HSVA) ice tank in 1999. The system consists of a barge of about 120 000 tons loaded displacement and 80 000 tons <b>ballast</b> <b>displacement</b> (90 000 DWT, length overall Loa = 265. 5 m,) and a pusher/icebreaker of about 8000 tons displacement (2000 DWT, Loa = 86 m). The pusher serves as the main propulsion and connects/disconnects to a notch in the aft of the barge. The operational performance and forces exerted on the barge, the pusher and the mooring system, including a riser, were investigated. The system was pushed by the pusher through level ice or towed through level ice and pressure ridges by the mooring system. The latter simulated the moored condition in drifting ice. This paper describes the test set-up, procedures and performance of the concept when manoeuvring into the loading position in level ice. The maximum ice breaking force was about 23000 kN during a ridge event. The paper also elaborates on the use of a wedged plough and ice milling propellers to avoid ice from interfering with the mooring lines and riser. Finally we have a brief discussion on how the transhipment at the ice edge could be done. 1...|$|E
50|$|On 12 March 1934, the Japanese {{torpedo boat}} Tomozuru capsized during sea trials due to poor stability, Following this accident, it was {{realised}} that like many Japanese warships, the CH-1 class suffered from excessive topweight, and CH-2 was modified by adding <b>ballast,</b> increasing <b>displacement</b> to 376 LT standard and 400 LT full load.|$|R
5000|$|The {{weight of}} the entire boat is 1180 kilograms, {{including}} the hull and standing rigging. The design concentrates the righting moment of the keel in a 770 kilogram torpedo-shaped bulb {{at the end of}} an airfoil shaped fin. The <b>ballast</b> to <b>displacement</b> ratio is 0.61 which provides an exceptionally [...] "stiff" [...] platform. The high righting moment allows the design to carry a larger than normal sail area which increases power and consequently speed through the water.|$|R

When she was {{carrying}} cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 register tons gross, 1,734 register tons net and 3,100 tons deadweight. The ship drew [...] of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only [...] With 1,200 tons of stones as sailing <b>ballast,</b> her <b>displacement</b> was 2,900 tons and metacentric height [...] Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron. Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{difference}} between a regular runabout and a wakeboarding boat is the wakeboard tower, normally constructed of thick-walled stainless steel or aluminum tubing, which places the [...] "pull point" [...] about 2 m off the water's surface. The high tow point {{makes it easier to}} jump and get air as the rope is not pulling downward as when it is attached to the low tow point used for skiing. Most modern wakeboarding boats also have a variable ballast system, which allows for water to be pumped into and out of ballast tanks from the surrounding water. Adding <b>ballast</b> increases <b>displacement,</b> and consequently enlarges the wake produced.|$|R
50|$|The {{overall length}} of SuomenJoutsen is 96 m. Her hull is 80 m long at the waterline, has {{a beam of}} 12.3 m at midship and depth of 7.29 m to main deck. When she was {{carrying}} cargo, her tonnage was 2,393 register tons gross, 1,734 register tons net and 3,100 tons deadweight. The ship drew 6.35 m of water when loaded, but as a school ship she sailed with a ballast draft of only 5.15 m. With 1,200 tons of stones as sailing <b>ballast,</b> her <b>displacement</b> was 2,900 tons and metacentric height 0.699 m. Later some of the stone ballast was replaced with concrete and iron. Internally her hull was divided into five watertight compartments.|$|R
5000|$|Pocket Cruisers {{are still}} quite {{exciting}} to sail {{much in the}} same sense that a go cart [...] "feels" [...] faster when riding on it as compared to a longer wheelbase automobile going the same speed. Closeness to the water, smaller relative size compared to the wave height, and (as is in the case of some trailer sailors) a lighter <b>ballast</b> to <b>displacement</b> ratio can combine to make for a thrilling sailing experience nonetheless. Some selected small cruisers are designed with flat profiled aft bottom sections and are capable of actually coming up on a plane in breezy to marginal wind conditions in which specific case they may become (if briefly) quite fast indeed even when directly compared to somewhat longer displacement hulls under the same conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} {{characterized}} by a very large <b>ballast</b> to <b>displacement</b> ratio and a narrow hull of 2.2 metres beam and a tall mast with a high aspect ratio sail plan. In concert with most sportboats, the Esse 850 is designed {{as an alternative to the}} complexity of traditional sloop-rigged sailboats, with an emphasis on ease of handling with a small crew and exceptional speeds. Typically, sportboats such as the Esse 850 are much lighter and more powerful than their traditional counterparts. The reduced weight is usually the result of smaller accommodation volume in the hull and lower freeboard, hence less hull structure. The weight reduction over traditional designs means that a larger percentage of the total weight of the boat is concentrated in the keel providing greater stability and the ability to carry a larger sail plan for greater power.|$|R
50|$|The {{design is}} {{characterized}} by a large <b>ballast</b> to <b>displacement</b> ratio and a relatively narrow hull of 2.55 meters beam and a tall mast with a high aspect ratio sail plan. In concert with most sportboats, the Esse 990 is designed {{as an alternative to the}} complexity of traditional sloop-rigged sailboats, with an emphasis on ease of handling with a small crew and exceptional speeds. Typically, sportboat's such as the Esse 990 are much lighter and more powerful than their traditional counterparts. The reduced weight of the Esse 990 design is a result of the use of PVC-cored, epoxy/E-glass composite sections for the hull and deck. The mast and boom are made from carbon fiber to reduce weight and increase strength. The weight reduction over traditional designs means that a larger percentage of the total weight of the boat is concentrated in the keel providing greater stability and the ability to carry a larger sail plan for greater power.|$|R
25|$|With much ingenuity, the Treaty {{limitations}} were (nearly) {{adhered to}} and displacement {{was a little}} over 1500 tons. Despite this, the Hatsuharus retained {{all but one of}} the Special Types' 5inch guns and introduced the oxygen-powered version of the 24inch torpedo. They introduced a forward, superfiring single 5inch gun and retained the tall bridge structure. The impact of the Tomozuru incident, which exposed the instability of contemporary Japanese warship designs, affected the Hatsuharus and the two that had been completed and four more under construction were significantly redesigned. The forward single gun was moved aft to a lower position, the bridge and other structures were reduced or removed and <b>ballast</b> was added. <b>Displacement</b> increased to 2,090 tons and speed was consequently reduced.|$|R
