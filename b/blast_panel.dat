40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study to evaluate the damage and failure mode of hybrid-fiber engineered cementitious composite (ECC) panels caused by large projectiles or fragments with the aim towards quantifying the extent to which hybrid-fiber ECC improves the resistance of <b>blast</b> <b>panels</b> against impact loading. Drop weight tests are conducted on full-scale blast/shelter panels (2 m x 1 m x 0. 1 m) made of hybrid-fiber ECC to study their response and performance under impact loading. Conventional steel reinforced concrete (RC) <b>blast</b> <b>panels</b> are also tested to identify the advantages of using ECC in this application. Both the drop weight projectile with a hemispherical head and the panel specimen are instrumented to facilitate evaluation of the global and local response. The damage incurred on the <b>blast</b> <b>panels</b> are examined in terms of indentation depth, crater size, and cracking condition. Results show that under the drop weight hammer impact, the hybrid-fiber ECC panels exhibit improved resistance and reduced damage compared to the RC panels in terms of the following: (1) much smaller indentation depth and crater size on the impact face, (2) much smaller exit crater on the distal face after perforation, (3) larger volume of material involved in energy absorption providing better resistance, and (4) significant improved impact resistance and energy absorbing capacity against multiple impacts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTypical {{blast walls}} of {{offshore}} platform are stainless steel light-weight walls installed {{to contain the}} effect of an accidental explosion on the topside of an offshore installation. These walls are mostly designed using simplified analytical techniques like single degree of freedom (SDOF) method using global deformation or displacement as primary response parameter. Thin plate structures like stainless steel blast walls when subjected to high impulsive pressure loads, may damage severely in a particular region without experiencing a significant global deformation. This study presents realistic responses of offshore blast walls under various high impulsive pressure loads generated from accidental hydrocarbon explosions by using detailed non-linear finite element analysis (NFEA). The numerical models were verified against past experimental study on similar metal <b>blast</b> <b>panels.</b> An extensive parametric study was conducted using the verified finite element models to construct pressure-impulse (P-I) diagrams for different deformation levels.

40|$|<b>Blast</b> {{resistant}} <b>panels</b> (BRPs) are {{panels that}} are designed to dissipate blast energy through allowable plastic deformation in order to protect against damage from an incoming explosion. The <b>blast</b> resistant <b>panels</b> considered in this paper are metal sandwich structures that consist of two outer face sheets and a honeycomb core. In practice, materials for BRPs are selected from the finite set of available materials; however, selection of materials places bounds on the performance of the panel. Alternatively, by designing the BRP material concurrently with the product, the material properties could be tailored such that the weight of the panel is minimized while meeting deflection constraints. As a step towards this goal, the properties of the BRP material are defined as uncertain design variables rather than static design parameters in order to maintain some design freedom for a subsequent material design or selection problem. If a material does not exist that satisfies the ranges of material properties identified through the design process, a material design would be needed to specify the necessary component materials and processing path to realize the desired material properties. To maintain the performance of the BRP in spite of the uncertainty in the material properties, the BRP should be robust t...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic blast {{testing of}} armor {{components}} often requires explosives {{to generate the}} high pressure, wide area impulses. While explosives provide the most realistic loading conditions, they are difficult to replicate consistently and necessitate remote test facilities for safety. Non-explosive methodologies, such as gas guns and shock tubes, can produce high impulse dynamic events with higher repeatability and increased safety, but are often limited to smaller-sized targets. To impact wide area flexible armor <b>panels</b> with the <b>blast</b> characteristics of a close-in detonation, a non-explosive methodology was investigated using the U. C. San Diego Blast Simulator. The objective {{was to create a}} consistent, economical, and scalable methodology for comparing conventional steel and prototype sandwich panel performance with validation of damage modes and extent of damage using actual blast tests and finite element modeling. A tiled projectile array having spatially and temporally varying pressure pulses was developed to replicate the spherical loading profile of a close-in detonation. Using a high speed servo- hydraulic actuator, the projectile was launched at 23. 0 - 24. 6 m/s, equivalent to 7, 520 - 8, 460 Pa-s with less than 1. 9 % standard deviation over 43 tests. This was comparable to 1. 37 kg of C 4 at 305 mm standoff, which was also used to test five armor panels. Sandwich panel transmitted pressures, measured indirectly via transmission plate acceleration, showed up to 75 % reduction in maximum values compared to the steel armor panels, with up to 49 % weight savings. Deformation profiles of the non-explosive tested panels were similar in both shape and magnitude compared to the <b>blast</b> tested <b>panels,</b> but with more consistency and symmetry. <b>Blast</b> tested <b>panels</b> showed more extensive core crushing for the sandwich panels but no difference for steel. Finite element modeling predicted similar deformation profiles and transmission plate velocities and accelerations.

The applied impulses for the non-explosive tests were also predicted to be higher than the blast tests.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Ammonium Nitrate-Fuel Oil (ANFO) is the {{explosive}} generally {{used in the}} mining industry to blast ore from the rock face. The use and detonation of ANFO explosives in an underground mine is an intrinsically hazardous process. The by-products formed during blasting have been well studied {{over the years and}} modern mining techniques and methods have evolved to mitigate the inherent blasting and gas emission risks. However, there is insufficient research and quantitative data on mine workers’ respiratory exposure to blasting gasses under realistic underground conditions. Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether blasting gasses such as nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ammonia (NH 3) pose an inhalation health risk to underground mine workers cleaning at the <b>blasting</b> <b>panels</b> approximately three hours after the detonation of ANFO explosives. Scraper Winch Operators’ (SWOs) respiratory exposure to selected blasting gasses was simultaneously sampled by means of active and passive sampling methodologies. Method: Personal exposures to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 were measured and analysed in accordance with NIOSH methods 6014 and 6015. Along with the active air samplers, respiratory exposure to NO 2 and NH 3 were measured by means of radial symmetry diffusive samplers (Aquaria® RING). Measurements were taken over an 8 -hour period, where this was not applicable; results were time weighed to an average 8 -hour exposure concentration in order to compare the Scraper Winch Operators’ (SWOs) respiratory exposure to the Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs) contained in the Regulations of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 29 of 1996). Results: The active air sampling results indicated that the SWOs’ respiratory exposure to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 complied with their respective OELs contained in the Regulations of the Mine Health and Safety Act (No. 29 of 1996). However, one of the SWOs had an exposure which exceeded the action level (50 % of OEL) at which level the implementation of control measures are recommended to reduce the SWO’s exposure. Based on the results of the Wilcoxon matched pairs test, statistical significant differences were observed between the exposure results of the two sampling methodologies for NO 2 (p = 0. 00078) and NH 3 (p = 0. 044), with the passive diffusive sampling technique under sampling when compared to the active sampling method. This was also confirmed by a Spearman rank order correlation which indicated a poor relationship between the two sampling methods for NO 2 (r = - 0. 323) and NH 3 (r = 0. 090). Environmental conditions (i. e. temperature and humidity), as presented in an underground mine, may have been a major factor for the variation between the two sampling methods, mostly affecting the passive samplers. Conclusion: It was established that engineering and administrative control measures implemented at the underground mine were effective to control SWOs’ respiratory exposure to NO, NO 2 and NH 3 below their respective OELs. An acute health risk pertaining the inhalation of blasting gasses was, therefore, not presented to mine workers cleaning at the <b>blasting</b> <b>panels</b> approximately three hours after the detonation of ANFO explosives. However, long-term exposure to blasting gasses at low concentrations may present SWOs with a health risk if such exposures are not adequately controlled or mitigated. The dilution and production of blasting gasses also varied from one blasting level to another. Geological formation, explosive charge-up and loading practices, the amount of water vapour inside the stopes and ventilation parameters are among the factors that may have affected the amount of blasting gasses produced underground. In addition, a drop in the carbon monoxide levels as indicated by the mine’s central gas monitoring system would not necessarily mean a lowering in other blasting gas concentrations (i. e. elevated ammonia gas concentrations as identified in the present study). The personal exposure levels between the active and passive sampling measurements also differed considerably. This may be ascribed to the impact underground mining conditions and processes had on the sampling media as well the complexities involved when sampling blasting gasses in general. Master...|$|R

The composite panels consist of fiber-reinforced high-strength concrete on the incident face, together with a specially configured steel sandwich as the distal layer, which functions to dissipate the imparted blast energy. The performance of the novel composite panel is compared to a conventional steel concrete steel (SCS) panel and an ordinary reinforced concrete panel. The dynamic response of the composite panel is obtained numerically using finite element analysis adopting a simplified modeling approach. Parametric studies are carried out by varying the charge weight, the concrete type, {{and a number of}} steel sandwich core structures. Furthermore, the energy absorption capacity is found by calculating the area under the resistance-deflection curve of the proposed composite panel.

A total of nine experiments, corresponding to three different blast intensity levels were conducted in the 28 -inch square shock tube apparatus. Computational models were developed to capture the experimental details and further study the mechanism of <b>blast</b> wave-sandwich <b>panel</b> interactions. The peak reflected overpressure was monitored, which amplified to approximately 2. 5 times of the incident overpressure due to fluid-structure interactions. The measured strain histories demonstrated opposite phases at the center of the front and back facesheets. Both strains showed damped oscillation with a reduced oscillation frequency as well as amplified facesheet deformations at the higher blast intensity. As the blast wave traversed across the panel, the observed flow separation and reattachment led to pressure increase at the back side of the panel. Further parametric studies suggested that the maximum deflection of the back facesheet increased dramatically with higher blast intensity and decreased with larger facesheet and core thickness.

40|$|Traditional {{methods in}} {{engineering}} design involve producing solutions {{at a single}} level. However, in complex engineering design problems, such as concurrent product and materials design, various levels of model complexity are considered. A design process in which design problems are defined and analyzed at various levels of design complexity {{is referred to as}} multilevel design. One example of multilevel design is the design of a material, product, assembly, and system. Dividing a design problem into multiple levels increases the possibility for introducing and propagating uncertainty. Design solutions that perform predictably in the presence of uncertainty are robust designs. Robust design concepts that were originally developed for designs at a single level can be applied to a multilevel design process. The Inductive Design Exploration Method (IDEM) is an existing design method used to produce robust multilevel design solutions. In this thesis, the strategy presented in IDEM is incorporated into design templates in order to extend its overall usefulness. Design templates are generic, reusable, modules that provide the theoretical and computational framework for solving design problems. Information collected, stored, and analyzed from design templates is leveraged for a variety of design problems. In this thesis, the possibilities of a template-based approach to multilevel design are explored. Two example problems, which employ the developed multilevel robust design template, are considered. Multilevel design templates are created for the design of a cantilever beam and its associated material and the design of a <b>blast</b> resistant <b>panel.</b> The design templates developed for example problems can be extended to facilitate a generic, modular, template-based approach to multilevel robust design.

Post-crack behaviour of the LG panel and {{the contribution of the}} interlayer towards blast resistance are treated. Modelling techniques are validated by comparing with existing experimental results. Findings indicate that the tensile strength of glass considerably influences the blast response of LG panels while the interlayer material properties {{have a major impact on}} the response under higher blast loads. Initially, glass panes absorb most of the blast energy, but after the glass breaks, interlayer deforms further and absorbs most of the <b>blast</b> energy. LG <b>panels</b> should be designed to fail by tearing of the interlayer rather than failure at the supports to achieve a desired level of protection. From this aspect, material properties of glass, interlayer and sealant joints play important roles, but unfortunately they are not accounted for in the current design standards. The new information generated in this paper will enhance the capabilities of engineers to better design LG <b>panels</b> under <b>blast</b> loads and use better materials to improve the blast response of LG panels...|$|R
40|$|Materials have {{traditionally}} been selected {{for the design of}} a product; however, advances in the understanding of material processing along with simulation and computation techniques are now making it possible to systematically design materials by tailoring the properties of the material to achieve the desired product performance. Material design offers the potential to increase design freedom and enable improved product performance; however, this increase in design freedom brings with it significant complexity in predictive models used for design, as well as many new design variables to consider. Material selection, on the other hand, is a well-established method for identifying the best materials for a product and does not require the complex models needed for material design. But material selection inherently limits the design of products by only considering existing materials. To balance increasing design costs with potentially improved product performance, designers must have a method for assessing the value of material design in the context of product design. In this thesis, the Design Space Expansion Strategy (DSES) and the Value of Design Space Expansion (VDSE) metric are proposed for supporting a designer s decision between material selection and material design in the context of product design. The strategy consists of formulating and solving two compromise Decision Support Problems (cDSP). The first cDSP is formulated and solved using a selected baseline material. The second cDSP is formulated and solved in an expanded material design space defined by material property variables in addition to other system variables. The two design solutions are then compared using the VDSE metric to quantify the value of expanding the material design space. This strategy is demonstrated in this thesis with an example of <b>blast</b> resistant <b>panel</b> design and is validated by application of the validation square, a framework for the validating design methods.

40|$|In mining industry, the {{challenging}} task of a mining professional comprises of {{the extraction of}} maximum natural resources with utmost safety of the miners. ¡§Blasting Gallery¡¨ method is a unique technique of depillaring thick seams for higher recovery of coal. The present study has been aimed to examine thoroughly BG method operational systems in Indian geo-mining conditions such as: „« Study of roof convergence with respect to face advancement during different stages of extraction of coal in <b>Blasting</b> Gallery <b>panels</b> in SCCL mines. „« Simulation of field conditions in the numerical model generated using FLAC. „« Interpretation of strata behaviour through numerical modeling using FLAC. For this purpose, BG panel of GDK 10 incline, Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) was selected. This mine has a thick coal seam of 11 m, {{at a depth of}} 350 mtr. Convergence behaviour with respect to goaf edge distance (GED) was monitored with the help of high state-of-the-art equipment throughout the life of BG panel. The coal sample was collected from the mine and tested for determination of the rock mass parameters. The geotechnical conditions of the mine were simulated through Numerical Modelling by FLAC. The results obtained from the FLAC were compared to field data so that the validation would represent the system in totality. The different conclusions drawn from this work is enumerated as follows: „« The maximum rate of convergence and cum. convergence recorded in field was 4 mm/day and 61 mm respectively, measured at station C- 5 in 68 Level. „« From the triaxial testing, the major principal stresses of 22, 32 and 41. 5 MPa were obtained at confining stresses of 0, 2 and 3 MPa respectively. „« The results obtained from the RocLab software indicated the Cohesion, Friction Angle, UCS and Tensile Strength values to be 1. 1 MPa, 30. 840, 1. 314 MPa and 0. 32 MPa respectively. „« The model predicted maximum cumulative convergence to be 70 mm while that observed in field is 61 mm...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{materials}} with periodic architectures have been exten-sively investigated {{over the past}} decade for their potential to provide multifunctional solutions for a variety of applications, including lightweight thermo-structural <b>panels,</b> <b>blast</b> resistant structures, and high-authority morphing components. Stiffer and stronger than stochastic foams, periodic cellular materials lend themselves well to geometry optimization, enabling a high degree of tailorability and superior performance benefits. This article reviews a commonly established optimal design protocol, extensively adopted at the macro-scale for both single and multifunctional structures. Two prototypical examples are discussed: the design of strong and lightweight sandwich beams subject to mechanical loads and the combined material/ geometry optimization of actively cooled combustors for hyper-sonic vehicles. With this body of literature in mind, we present a motivation for the development of micro-architected materials, namely periodic multiscale cellular {{materials with}} overall macro-scopic dimensions yet with features (such as the unit cell or subunit cell constituents) at the micro- or nano-scale. We review a suite of viable manufacturing approaches and discuss the need for advanced experimental tools, numerical models, and optimization strategies. In analyzing challenges and oppor-tunities, we conclude that the technology is approaching matu-rity for the development of micro-architected materials with unprecedented combinations of properties (e. g., specific stiffness and strength), with tremendous potential impact on a number of fields.

40|$|Background: Conventional {{cytogenetics}} is {{the gold}} standard in the diagnostic work up of acute leukemia patients. Due to a low mitotic index, lack of sample, and poor chromosome morphology, {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) is widely used as a complementary method to conventional cytogenetics. Additionally, some cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, which are crucial for stratification of patients, can be detected only by FISH. Different FISH panels are proposed to obtain comprehensive cytogenetic information. Methods: Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities were detected using commercially available FISH DNA probes. Results: In 85 % of pediatric AL patients conventional cytogenetics was successfully completed, revealing chromosomal rearrangements in half of them. We introduce an algorithm for inclusion of FISH DNA probes into panel, which is based on cytomorphology and immunophenotype of leukemic <b>blasts.</b> Using these <b>panels,</b> a particular cytogenetic marker was determined in 70 % of tested samples. The difference is even more prominent in B-ALL where conventional cytogenetics is less efficient. The frequency of a particular recurrent aberration is comparable with literature data in general, although some discrepancies were observed. Besides the detection of targeted rearrangements, FISH panels frequently show additional chromosomal changes with defined diagnostic and prognostic significance. Conclusions: The proposed algorithm for inclusion of DNA-probes into FISH panels is particularly efficient in children with B-ALL. In addition, presented results confirm this approach as an appropriate in different leukemias...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The risk of {{accidental}} detonation {{is present}} whenever {{any type of}} high explosives processing activity is performed. These activities are typically carried out indoors to protect processing equipment from the weather and to hide possibly secret processes from view. Often, highly strengthened reinforced concrete buildings are employed to house these activities. These buildings may incorporate several design features, {{including the use of}} lightweight frangible blowout panels, to help mitigate <b>blast</b> effects. These <b>panels</b> are used to construct walls that are durable enough to withstand the weather, but are of minimal weight to provide overpressure relief by quickly moving outwards and creating a vent area during an accidental explosion. In this study the behavior of blowout <b>panels</b> under various <b>blast</b> loading conditions was examined. External loadings from explosions occurring in nearby rooms were of primary interest. Several reinforcement systems were designed to help blowout panels resist failure from external blast loads while still allowing them to function as vents when subjected to internal explosions. The reinforcements were studied using two analytical techniques, yield-line analysis and modal analysis, and the hydrocode AUTODYN. A blowout panel reinforcement design was created that could prevent panels from being blown inward by external explosions. This design was found to increase the internal loading of the building by 20 %, as compared with nonreinforced panels. Nonreinforced panels were found to increase the structural loads by 80 % when compared to an open wall at the panel location...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} achieve higher {{percentage}} of extraction (70 – 85 %) and to overcome {{the problems in the}} extraction of thick seams by conventional bord and pillar method, the Charbonnage de France (CdF) suggested the Blasting Gallery (BG) method for extraction of virgin thick seams as well as developed pillars in thick seams in India. It is a variant of the bord and pillar method of mining. Safe and efficient underground extraction of coal pillars under competent roof strata needs information about amount and nature of the mining induced vertical stress over pillars in and around the <b>Blasting</b> Gallery (BG) <b>panel</b> workings. However, the performance of these workings is highly dependent upon two types of stresses; mining induced stresses (Singh et al. 1996) and in situ stress (Sheorey 1994). For a given site, the in situ stress is more or less static in nature but the mining induced stresses over pillars/stooks keeps changing and is highly influenced by the strata equilibrium dynamics during different stages of the underground coal mining activity. Accidents due to movement of strata in underground coal mines had been a major concern for the mining industry and it is largest contributing factor of underground coal mine accidents. Continuous efforts were being made by all concerned to reduce the hazard of strata movement. The condition of strata and the stress environment around any working place is always dynamic in nature. No two working places are having identical strata condition. It is therefore essential to assess the roof condition of the underground working places at regular intervals by engineering methods. State-of-art of monitoring system through instrumented rock bolts, tell-tales, multiple point borehole extensometers, convergence indicators, load cells etc. are available for continuous monitoring the strata movement.|$|R
