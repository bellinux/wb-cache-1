50|$|This {{indicates}} likely cash generation, {{because the}} higher the share the more cash will be generated. As a result of 'economies of scale' (a basic assumption of the <b>BCG</b> <b>Matrix),</b> {{it is assumed that}} these earnings will grow faster {{the higher the}} share. The exact measure is the brand's share relative to its largest competitor. Thus, if the brand had a share of 20 percent, and the largest competitor had the same, the ratio would be 1:1. If the largest competitor had a share of 60 percent, however, the ratio would be 1:3, implying that the organization's brand was in a relatively weak position. If the largest competitor only had a share of 5 percent, the ratio would be 4:1, implying that the brand owned was in a relatively strong position, which might be reflected in profits and cash flows.

50|$|Rapidly {{growing in}} rapidly growing markets, are what {{organizations}} strive for; but, {{as we have}} seen, the penalty {{is that they are}} usually net cash users - they require investment. The reason for this is often because the growth is being 'bought' by the high investment, in the reasonable expectation that a high market share will eventually turn into a sound investment in future profits. The theory behind the matrix assumes, therefore, that a higher growth rate is indicative of accompanying demands on investment. The cut-off point is usually chosen as 10 per cent per annum. Determining this cut-off point, the rate above which the growth is deemed to be significant (and likely to lead to extra demands on cash) is a critical requirement of the technique; and one that, again, makes the use of the growth-share matrix problematical in some product areas. What is more, the evidence, from fast-moving consumer goods markets at least, is that the most typical pattern is of very low growth, less than 1 per cent per annum. This is outside the range normally considered in <b>BCG</b> <b>Matrix</b> work, which may make application of this form of analysis unworkable in many markets. Where it can be applied, however, the market growth rate says more about the brand position than just its cash flow. It is a good indicator of that market's strength, of its future potential (of its 'maturity' in terms of the market life-cycle), and also of its attractiveness to future competitors. It can also be used in growth analysis.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the idea to}} combine the <b>BCG</b> <b>Matrix</b> analysis with the Delphi methodology. The scientific motivation {{of this approach is}} that in many cases the positioning of products and services of the <b>BCG</b> <b>matrix</b> is based on very limited strategic conversations of experts. Using the Delphi approach will probably increase the validity of product positioning in the <b>BCG</b> <b>matrix.</b> Another methodological benefit of our approach is that it allows a broader base of expertise {{to be used in the}} construction of the <b>BCG</b> <b>matrix.</b> Methodologically, it is possible to present experts’ judgments about current and future aspects of products, although the Delphi methodology has been conventionally used in futures-oriented foresight analyses. The advantage of the Delphi methodology is based on the possibility to evaluate complex issues during various evaluation rounds. This methodological aspect is highly relevant for all evaluations, whether they focus on current issues or future issues. From this methodological verification perspective, a novel combination of these analysis tools makes a lot of sense from a scientific perspectives of accuracy and objectivity.|$|E
30|$|This article {{presents}} a way how the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) analysis tools {{can be combined}} with the Delphi methodology, and especially with the <b>BCG</b> portfolio <b>matrix</b> analysis. The Delphi Method {{is one of the}} most well-known futures research methods. It is an expert group interview process, which is based on two or more iterative rounds of expert interviews. Typical aspects of the Delphi methodology are anonymity and the conventional emphasis of consensus of experts with associated statistical evaluations. A conventional definition of the business portfolio is that it is the collection of businesses and products that make up the company. This article includes an experimental pilot study of the Finnish maritime cluster and its technological future options where integrative BCG Delphi methodology was used. Detailed pilot study results and learning are reported in this article. The study reveals a high potential of the BCG Delphi studies in the industrial and corporate foresight fields. Especially, futures of industrial product and service portfolios can be diagnosed and forecast by this novel methodological approach. The Delphi methodology is according to a metaphor “one of the best and constantly evolving computer’s operating system”, which can be linked to many other “programs”, among others to the conventional BCG tool package. To be strategically oriented from the BCG business perspective, the key issue strategically for European cities and regions is the strong local existence of Cash Cows (good and successful companies). Decision-makers in cities and regions should be interested in the strategy of optimum Cash Cow flows if they want to develop their cities and regions in the long-run. Thus, products with high market share and slow, but stable growth trajectory are Cash Cows.|$|R
40|$|Two-level {{theories}} explain outcomes with causal variables at {{two levels}} of analysis that are systematically related to one another” (Goertz & Mahoney, 2005, p. 497). This thesis analyses the systematic relationship between level one, the environment of dynamic complexity theory, and level two, cognitive decision-making theory. The second-level literature on competence theory suggests that we train executives to make incompetent, rather than competent, decisions. One of several problematic decision-making tools often taught in business schools is the Boston Consulting Group (<b>BCG)</b> market-share/growth <b>matrix.</b> This device causes practitioners to focus on competitor-oriented objectives and neglect profit objectives. Ultimately, competitor-oriented objectives harm performance. First-level literature adds the culpability of environmental context theory to this problem. Simon (1956) posits that competency is dependent upon cognition together with – and often superseded by – the context. Dynamic complexity permeates the context of managerial decisions. With the proposition that incompetency derives from the systematic relationship between cognition and environment, this thesis pursues knowledge {{about the impact of}} incompetency training, and counter-incompetency training, in an environment of dynamic complexity. Experiments were conducted to test 13 hypotheses, working with 541 executives-in-training and experienced practitioners in North America and New Zealand. The research in this thesis extends research to date on the BCG device with two key differences. Armstrong and colleagues (1994, 1996, 2007) identify incompetence but do not test the effects of training or solutions for incompetence, and earlier treatments rely upon competitor profit levels that are, in reality, indeterminable. The research reported here first confirms the general level of incompetent decision-making found in earlier work, then tests various tools for their efficacy in improving executive decisions. Tools considered include the open system non-deterministic strategy formulation metaphors of Weick’s (2007) sensemaking/tool-dropping, and Gigerenzer’s (2006) heuristics. Additionally, the elimination of competitor profit information from the ten treatments of this thesis research provides realistic information for a decision maker in this context.
