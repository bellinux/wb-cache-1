5|$|The 2007 film Hitman re-used {{footage of}} Max and other Manticore {{children}} in training from Dark Angel. It {{was used to}} portray the Hitman protagonist Agent 47, a cloned assassin who, like the Manticore children, has a barcode on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was shot}} {{once in the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> while {{watching}} the play Our American Cousin with his wife Mary Todd Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. at around 10:15 pm {{on the night of}} April 14, 1865. An army surgeon who happened to be at Ford's, Doctor Charles Leale, assessed Lincoln's wound as mortal. The unconscious President was then carried {{across the street from the}} theater to the Petersen House, where he remained in a coma for nine hours before dying the following morning at 7:22a.m. on April 15.|$|E
5|$|A defense-appointed {{expert witness}} {{in the field of}} {{biomechanics}} testified on March 5 that Nosek could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward, he could not have sustained an injury to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He further said that if Nosek fell over the first row of the fans, he must have been not only pushed, but must have jumped himself. The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony, claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time, {{as well as some of}} the eyewitness testimonies, according to which Nosek fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall. The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} match, Carlito faced Mankind, who {{was chosen by}} the fans' vote with 52%. The match began when Carlito {{performed}} a dropkick on Mankind. However, Mankind got the advantage over Carlito. Midway through the match, Mankind tried to use a steel chair on Carlito, but Carlito avoided, executeing drop toe-hold, sending Mankind into the steel steps. Mankind rose to his feet, which led Carlito to perform a standing dropkick, resulting in Mankind to hit the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> into the steel steps. Back in the ring, Mankind received the upper hand after delivering a DDT and forced Carlito to submit with the Mandible claw and win the match.|$|E

After the survivors from the excursion are rescued, Ricks and Upworth have sex in the shower. Midway through, a stowaway Alien prods Upworth with its tail and impales Ricks through the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> killing him {{before moving on to}} Upworth.|$|E

She frees the boy, accidentally telling him she is an FBI agent.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, as you know, on the upstair passage {{there still}} is that queer slit through which the old abbots used to watch the monks at their devotions. Finding the shutter unlocked, the astute Thomas {{followed}} their example, {{as well as he}} could, for he says there was no light in the chapel except that of the fire, by which presently he made out your figure, Miss Fregelius, sometimes playing the violin, and sometimes singing, and that of Morris--again I must quote--'a-sitting in a chair by the fire with his 'ands at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>'ead,</b> a-staring at the floor and rocking 'imself as though he felt right down bad.'

5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> they called an ambulance for fear he might have a concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{individuals}} that Hergé could have learned about through Blanchard's article was the Chicago-based American gangster Al Capone. In the preceding story, Tintin in the Congo, Capone had been introduced as a character within the series. There, {{he was responsible for}} running a diamond smuggling racket that Tintin exposed, setting up for further confrontation in Tintin in America. Capone was one of only two real-life individuals to be named in The Adventures of Tintin, and was the only real-life figure to appear as a character in the series. In the original version, Hergé avoided depicting him directly, either illustrating the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> or hiding his face behind a scarf; this was altered in the second version, in which Capone's face was depicted. It is not known if Capone ever learned about his inclusion in the story, although during initial serialisation he would have been preoccupied with his trial and ensuing imprisonment.|$|E

50|$|This move sees one wrestler wrap a {{forward-facing}} opponent's {{legs around}} his/her waist and apply a gutwrench hold {{to lift the}} opponent up off the ground. At this point another wrestler, who is situated on the top turnbuckle would then jump down to hit the opponent with a top-rope leg drop to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> exposed <b>head,</b> forcefully driving the opponent's face and body {{back down to the}} mat.|$|R
60|$|The train drew {{up sharply}} {{at a small}} road-side station. There {{was no one to}} get into the cars there, and no one to get out except our two waifs. On the road beyond stood a wagon with a couple of spanking bays in it. On the {{platform}} stood a broad-shouldered, deep-chested, short-legged farmer with a face like the sun, and a wide-awake on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bald <b>head.</b>|$|R

25|$|Half an hour later, German radio {{broadcast}} {{the news of}} the rescue, to which the Stammheim inmates could be listening on their radios. In the course of the night, Baader was found dead with a gunshot wound in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and Ensslin was found hanged in her cell; Raspe died in the hospital the next day from a gunshot wound to the head. Irmgard Möller, who had several stab wounds in the chest, survived and was released from prison in 1994.|$|E
25|$|On 21 July 1980, Bitar {{was shot}} dead in Paris. That morning, he {{received}} a telephone call to meet a journalist {{at the office of}} al-Ihiyyaa al-Arabi. As he was exiting the elevator to enter his office, his assassin fired two shots to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> The identity of his killer was never discovered, but it was reported that Assad ordered the assassination. At the time, Bitar had reported to local authorities in France that he had received death threats by mail and telephone. He took personal measures by limiting his movements.|$|E

60|$|She was woke up {{suddenly}} by a noise that froze the marrer in 'er bones-- the most 'art-rending groan she 'ad ever heard in 'er life; and, raising her 'ead, she saw Silas Winch {{standing at the}} foot of the bed. He 'ad done his face and hands over with wot is called loominous paint, his cap was pushed at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>'ead,</b> and wet wisps of 'air was hanging over his eyes. For a moment Mrs. Burtenshaw's 'art stood still and then Silas let off another groan that put her on edge all over. It was a groan that seemed to come from nothing a'most until it spread into a roar that made the room tremble and rattled the jug in the wash-stand basin. It shook everything in the room but Bill, and he went on sleeping like an infant. Silas did two more groans, and then 'e leaned over the foot o' the bed, and stared at Bill, as though 'e couldn't believe his eyesight.|$|R
5000|$|The term baldscape {{came into}} use after an image taken by Nick Marr, {{marketing}} officer {{for a real}} estate company, in which his face was cut off, and only the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shaven <b>head</b> appeared. Marr soon realized the potential of such type of photography, and the artistic component involved. In baldscape pictures, an increased amount of landscape is visible, hence, Marr dubbed the practice [...] "baldscaping". Going with the idea, Marr started taking baldscapes on various different locations worldwide, depicting famous monuments and landmarks.|$|R
25|$|Shepard had {{suffered}} fractures to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> {{and in front}} of his right ear. He experienced severe brainstem damage, which affected his body's ability to regulate his heart rate, body temperature, and other vital functions. There were also about a dozen small lacerations around his head, face, and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate on him. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full life support. While he lay in intensive care and in the days following the attack, candlelight vigils were held around the world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of the game, Chinese forward Li Yi {{deliberately}} kicked Lee's right shin after Lee completed a pass. Having recovered from a recent ankle injury, Lee was upset at Li's foul play and slapped Li on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> thereafter which Li Yi started to roll on the ground grabbing his head. For a while the entire Chinese and Korean squad ran toward the scene resulting in brief ruckus and some degree of physical contact but further conflict did not occur, as the referee awarded a yellow card for Li (simulation) and a red card for Lee (violence).|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} proceedings, no one actually identified who fired the gun that killed Aquino, but Rebecca Quijano, another passenger, testified {{that she saw}} a man behind Aquino (running from the stairs towards Aquino and his escorts) point a gun at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> {{then there was the}} sound of a gunshot. A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony. More suspicions were aroused when Quijano described the assassin as wearing a military uniform.|$|E
60|$|Kit lifted himself awkwardly {{and leaned}} against the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bunk. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> ached horribly and his brain was dull, but he felt the throb of engines and heard water flow along the plates. Mossamedes was {{steaming}} hard and he must get up. He got his leg across the ledge, and then Macallister pushed him firmly back.|$|R
60|$|Talaloo {{agreeing to}} this, they rose and walked away. The {{footpath}} being narrow, they {{were obliged to}} go in single file. Menalee walked behind Talaloo. After having gone a few paces, the former drew his pistol, pointed it at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> countryman's <b>head,</b> and pulled the trigger, but it missed fire. Talaloo hearing the click, turned round, saw the pistol, and immediately fled; but his enemy was swift of foot, soon overtook him, and the two grappled. A severe struggle ensued, Timoa and the woman standing by and looking on, but rendering help to neither party.|$|R
50|$|Mogavir, {{one of the}} key {{enemies of}} the CIA. He appears thrice in the series, first as an escaped prisoner, then as a hired thug for a corrupt official, and again as an escaped prisoner. He is an underworld don or kingpin in Cambala, feared by many, and has {{conducted}} operations even in captivity. He has escaped twice, and been captured on both occasions. He can be identified by tattoos, notably on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shaved <b>head.</b> While he is often portrayed as a feared gang leader, he is also a very intelligent criminal, a skilled woodworker, adept at solving crosswords and also reasonably fluent in English.|$|R
25|$|At 5:15 AM on November 29, 1981, Police Officers Dennis Fitzpatrick and Ronald Zuba {{responded to}} a radio report of an {{incident}} at the Gaseteria service station in Bronx County, New York. Upon arriving at the gas station, the officers found attendant Victoriano Agostini {{lying on the floor}} of the office bleeding from the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> Agostini was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. It was determined that he had sustained two bullet wounds to the head. At 8:00 AM, Detective Patrick Cirincione of the Crime Scene Unit arrived at the gas station where he photographed the scene. He recovered no firearms or spent shells.|$|E
25|$|Although Bane {{had sworn}} off using Venom in Vengeance of Bane II in 1995, and his {{character}} is actually written as having kept {{that promise to}} himself, {{it is still not}} uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> as well as almost all media adaptations of the character show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane's appearance in an issue of Secret Six, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Edge faced Booker T. Booker T gained the {{advantage}} {{early on in}} the match. However, Edge recovered by countering Booker's top rope attack with a hurricanrana and followed this up with a spinning heel kick off the top rope. Booker T executed a Scissors Kick, for a near-fall while Edge delivered a spear for a near fall. After performing his own version of Booker's Spinaroonie, Edge won the match with an Edgecution. Backstage, a cautious Hurricane was interviewed by Jonathan Coachman about winning the Hardcore Championship. The Hurricane's sidekick, Mighty Molly, appeared and suggested the two should go to their Hurri-Cycle. Just as Hurricane headed to that direction, Molly smashed a frying pan onto the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> and pinned him to become the new Hardcore Champion.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Moore struggled; but {{his efforts}} were in vain. Whatever else Tarzan of the Apes {{may or may}} not have handed down to his son he had at least bequeathed him almost as {{marvelous}} a physique as he himself had possessed at the same age. The tutor was as putty in the boy's hands. Kneeling upon him, Jack tore strips from a sheet and bound the man's hands behind his back. Then he rolled him over and stuffed a gag of the same material between his teeth, securing it with a strip wound about the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> victim's <b>head.</b> All the while he talked in a low, conversational tone.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with {{no great}} {{quantity}} of hair, {{and what he}} had, growing on the <b>back</b> and sides <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> <b>His</b> face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not {{in the habit of}} drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered heavy damages.|$|R
6000|$|But one flying {{sentence}} {{goes straight}} to the heart. It is the cry of Humanity over the task of Life, done into unrefined English. An apprentice, grimed to his eyebrows, his cloth cap well on the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> curly <b>head</b> and <b>his</b> hands deep in his pockets, {{is sitting on the}} edge of a tool-box ruefully regarding the very much disorganised engine whose slave is he. A handsome boy, this apprentice, and well made. He whistles softly between his teeth, and his brow puckers. Then he addresses the engine, half in expostulation and half in despair, [...] "Oh, you condemned old female dog!" [...] He puts the sentence more crisply--much more crisply--and Ignorance chuckles sympathetically.|$|R
