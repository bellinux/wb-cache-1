40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} X-ray {{structure of}} a complex of the potent neuraminidase inhibitor 4 -guanidino-Neu 5 Ac 2 en and influenza virus neuraminidase (Subtype N 9) has been obtained utilizing diffraction data to 1. 8 A resolution. The interactions of the inhibitor, solvent water molecules, and the active site residues have been accurately determined. Six water molecules bound in the native structure have been displaced by the inhibitor, and the active site residues show no significant conformational changes on binding. Sialic acid, the natural substrate, binds in a half-chair conformation that is isosteric to the inhibitor. The conformation of the inhibitor in the active site of the X-ray structure concurs with that obtained by theoretical calculations and validates the structure-based design of the inhibitor. Comparison of known high-resolution structures of neuraminidase subtypes N 2, N 9, and <b>B</b> shows <b>good</b> structural <b>conservation</b> of the active site protein atoms, but {{the location of the}} water molecules in the respective active sites is less conserved. In particular, the environment of the 4 -guanidino group of the inhibitor is strongly conserved and is the basis for the antiviral action of the inhibitor across all presently known influenza strains. Differences in the solvent structure in the active site may be related to variation in the affinities of inhibitors to different subtypes of neuraminidase...|$|R

5000|$|... “No till” is the {{practice}} of planting seed directly into the ground without disturbing the soil prior to planting. This practice eliminates the tillage pass, saving the farmer the associated costs. Planting no-till places seed directly into a cooler and wetter seed bed, which can slow germination. This process is considered a <b>good</b> <b>conservation</b> practice because tilling disturbs the soil crust, causing erosion. The practice of no-till is currently on the rise among farmers in the midwestern United States.|$|R
40|$|A {{conservative}} {{method of}} level set type for moving interfaces in divergence free velocity fields is presented. The interface is represented implicitly by the 0. 5 level set of a function U being a smeared out Heaviside function, i. e., a function being zero {{on one side}} of the interface and one on the other. In a transition layer of finite, constant thickness U goes smoothly from zero to one. The interface is moved implicitly by the advection of U, which is split into two steps. First U is advected using a standard numerical method. Then an intermediate step is performed to make sure that the smooth profile of U and the thickness of the transition layer is preserved. Both these steps are performed using conservative second order approximations and thus conserving òU. In this way <b>good</b> <b>conservation</b> of the area bounded by the 0. 5 contour of U is obtained. Numerical tests shows up to second order accuracy and very <b>good</b> <b>conservation</b> of the area bounded by the interface.
