40|$|Background: Household <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> {{are widely}} used to harvest energy in rural areas of {{developing}} countries. Understanding core prokaryotic communities, their co-occurrence patterns, and their relationships to environmental factors is important to manage these small-scale anaerobic digestion systems effectively. In this study, 43 household <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> were collected across eight provinces in China. Prokaryotic communities were investigated using 454 pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes. Results: Fourteen core genera and ten core OTUs were identified in household <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters.</b> They were mainly affiliated with the phylum Firmicutes, Synergistetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Spirochaetes. Core prokaryotic genera were mainly composed of Clostridium, Clostridium XI, Syntrophomonas, Cloacibacillus, Sedimentibacter, and Turicibacter. Prokaryotic communities in the 43 samples were clearly divided into two clusters. Cluster I was dominated by Clostridium, while Cluster II was dominated by members of Spirochaetes, Bacteroidales, Clostridia, and abundant syntrophs and methanogens. NH 4 +-N and COD {{contributed significantly to the}} assembly of the prokaryotic community in Cluster I, while NH 4 +-N, pH, and phosphate contributed significantly to Cluster II. Correlation-based network analysis showed that the prokaryotic communities in the <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> were dominated by some functional modules. Cluster I was dominated by acetotrophic methanogenic modules and the Clostridium-driven primary fermentation module, while the network of Cluster II was dominated by hydrogenotrophic and acetogenic methanogenesis modules and multi-group-driven (Spirochaetes, Bacteroidales, and Clostridia) primary fermentation modules. The network of Cluster II was more complex and functionally redundant. Conclusions: Prokaryotic communities identified in the household <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> varied significantly and were affected by environmental factors, such as NH 4 +-N, pH, and COD. However, core prokaryotic communities existed, and most of them were also dominant populations. Cosmopolitan OTUs tended to co-occur. Prokaryotic communities in <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> were well organized by some functional modules. The modular structure of the prokaryotic community, which has functional redundancy, enhances the resistance against environmental stress and maintains digestion efficiency in the anaerobic digestion process...|$|R
40|$|Women {{living on}} rural Kenyan dairy farms spend {{significant}} amounts of time collecting wood for cooking. <b>Biogas</b> <b>digesters,</b> which generate <b>biogas</b> for cooking from the anaerobic decomposition of livestock manure, are an alternative fuel source. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify the quality of life and health benefits of installing <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> on rural Kenyan dairy farms with respect to wood utilisation. Women from 62 farms (31 biogas farms and 31 referent farms) participated in interviews to determine reliance on wood and the impact of <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> on this reliance. Self-reported back pain, time spent collecting wood and money spent on wood were significantly lower (p < 0. 01) for the biogas group, compared to referent farms. Multivariable linear regression showed that wood consumption increased by 2 lbs/day for each additional family member living on a farm. For an average family of three people, the addition of one cow was associated with increased wood consumption by 1. 0 lb/day on biogas farms but by 4. 4 lbs/day on referent farms (significant interaction variable - likely due to additional hot water for cleaning milk collection equipment). <b>Biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> represent a potentially important technology that can reduce reliance on wood fuel and improve health for Kenyan dairy farmers...|$|R

50|$|Biogas {{digestion}} {{deals with}} harnessing the methane gas that is released when waste breaks down.

40|$|The {{application}} of small scale <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> to supply <b>biogas</b> to households {{in developing countries}} is well established. The biogas is used for different applications, amongst other cooking. Generally, no further treatment of the biogas is applied. Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) is present in varying concentrations within the biogas. H 2 S has negative effects on the durability of the equipment (highly corrosive), thus resulting in high material replacement costs. Furthermore, H 2 S is very poisonous and exposure must be prohibited. Removal of H 2 S is essential for an optimal functioning of the biogas system {{as well as for}} the health of the people and the environment. The challenge is to provide a cost-effective, robust, regenerative system for effective removal of H 2 S from small scale <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters.</b> TNO has developed an energy efficient, robust and cheap removal system of H 2 S from small scale <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> (1 - 20 Nm 3 /day) to the lower ppm range. The technology uses an iron chelate solvent. The absorption of H 2 S and the regeneration of the solvent is combined in a single vessel. A small volume of air is required to be mixed with the incoming biogas to regenerate the solvent, causing the extension of the lifetime of the solvent...|$|R

5000|$|Temperatures {{as low as}} −15 °C {{are found}} in pockets of very salty water (brine) {{surrounded}} by sea ice. Psychrophiles are true extremophiles because they adapt not only to low temperatures but often also to further environmental constraints. They can be contrasted with thermophiles, which thrive at unusually hot temperatures. In addition to that, distinctions between mesophilic and psychrophilic cold-shock response, including lack of repression of house-keeping protein synthesis {{and the presence of}} cold-acclimation proteins (Caps) in psychrophiles, does exist. The environments they inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of our planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 15 °C. They are present in alpine and arctic soils, high-latitude and deep ocean waters, polar ice, glaciers, and snowfields. They are of particular interest to astrobiology, the field dedicated to the formulation of theory about the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and to geomicrobiology, the study of microbes active in geochemical processes. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks, a 1000-litre <b>biogas</b> <b>digester</b> using psychrophiles harvested from [...] "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" [...] has produced 200-300 litres of methane per day, about 20-30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates.|$|E

40|$|Multi-criteria {{decision}} analysis (MCDA) techniques {{are becoming increasingly}} popular in decision making for technology selection because {{of their ability to}} capture the multi-dimensionality of technologies. Biogas typically refers to an odourless gas produced by anaerobic digestion of biomass using microorganisms. Its production can occur naturally in marshes and landfills or more commonly, in specifically designed plants called <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> under controlled conditions. For techno-economic efficiency of a biodigester, several factors such as cost of plant are taken into consideration. This paper examines various available technologies for <b>biogas</b> <b>digesters</b> using defined selection criteria via MCDA and chooses the best alternatives at various scales of biogas production for a case study in South Africa with municipal biowaste as the target feedstock. 14 biogas plants were analysed in this study and the Puxin and Bio 4 gas digesters were the best alternatives for small and large scale biogas production respectively...|$|R
