50|$|The hybrid game eight-ball {{rotation}} is {{a combination}} of eight-ball and rotation, in which the players must pocket their balls (other than the 8, which remains last) in numerical order. Specifically, the solids player starts by pocketing the 1 <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> ascends to the 7 <b>ball,</b> <b>and</b> the stripes player starts by pocketing the 15 <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> descends to the 9 ball.|$|R

50|$|<b>Ball</b> <b>and</b> shot {{retained}} {{the ability to}} fire shotgun shells, whilst being able to fire useful bullets accurately at short ranges, in a gun of manageable weight. A typical 12 bore <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> shot gun weighed 7 to 8 lb, whilst a fully rifled 12 bore rifle would weigh over more than 10 lb. <b>Ball</b> <b>and</b> shot guns were available {{in a variety of}} calibres, from 8 bore to 28 bore.|$|R
5|$|After the 1997 season, the Tigers traded Nevin and catcher Matt Walbeck to the Anaheim Angels, where Collins was manager, {{for minor}} league player Nick Skuse. After {{an injury to}} {{starting}} catcher Todd Greene, Collins gave Nevin the opportunity {{to compete for the}} starting job with Walbeck. Nevin, by then well known for his volatile temper, tore off his jersey while arguing <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> strike calls with the home plate umpire in a 1998 game.|$|E
5|$|Australia's streak {{looked in}} danger during the First Test in Mumbai when they fell to 5/99 in reply to India's 171 when Gilchrist {{came to the}} crease. He counterattacked savagely, scoring 122 in just 112 <b>balls,</b> <b>and</b> {{featuring}} in a 197-run partnership with Matthew Hayden in only 32 overs. This swung the momentum back to Australia, who reached 349. Gilchrist took six catches and was named Man of the Match in a ten wicket victory, extending the world record run to 16.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> sockets (joint replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|E

5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal <b>balls,</b> <b>and</b> by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{traditionally}} carp, but now other firm {{white fish}} too, are minced and shaped into loaves or <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> cooked in fish broth, {{such as the}} gefilte fish of the Ashkenazi Jews, who also brought pickled herring from Eastern Europe. Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Hawaii on 22 July, {{the ships}} next stopped at Auckland, Sydney, and Melbourne. High seas and winds {{hampered}} the ships {{for part of}} the voyage to New Zealand, but they arrived on 9 August; festivities, parades, <b>balls,</b> <b>and</b> games were staples of the visits to each city. The highlight of the austral visit was a parade of 12,000 U.S. Navy, Royal Navy, and Commonwealth naval and military personnel in front of 250,000 people.|$|E

40|$|A {{model of}} an impact between a tennis <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> freely {{suspended}} racket, normal to string plane, was derived using rigid body dynamics. The inputs to this model were the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> racket physical parameters (e. g. racket mass), and the experimentally determined coefficient of restitution for an impact on a head-clamped racket. The predicted values of <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> racket post-impact velocities were compared with experimental results and typically correlated within ~ 5 %...|$|R
40|$|The normal {{proportional}} derivative (PD) {{control is}} modified to a new dual form for the regulation of a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> plate system. First, to analyze this controller, a novel complete nonlinear model of the <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> plate system is obtained. Second, an asymptotic stable dual PD control with a nonlinear compensation is developed. Finally, the experimental results of <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> plate system are provided to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methodology...|$|R

5|$|The painting's {{depiction}} of {{preparation for a}} fancy dress party would have been familiar to Etty's generally wealthy audience.

5|$|Wilberforce's staunchly Church of England {{mother and}} grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist {{influences}} {{and at his}} leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to Hull in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken {{to be separated from}} his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life, but as his religious fervour diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> played cards.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow of the knee.|$|E
5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy <b>balls</b> <b>and</b> crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
