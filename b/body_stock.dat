This buffer restores the sequence by (i) changing the positions of vehicles in the altered sequence, resequencing function and (ii) inserting spare vehicles instead of defective vehicles or late vehicles which fell behind more than buffer capacity, {{so it is not}} possible to change the position of a vehicle by just resequencing, storage function.|$|E

40|$|Prediction of {{more than}} four ears in a cup drawing process can be {{successfully}} achieved by considering r-value and stress directionalities. Yld 2004 - 18 p based on associated flow rule and Yld 2000 - 2 D based on non-associated flow rule are the examples. The former, however, is more costly in terms of computational efficiency than the latter. In this work, an anisotropic constitutive model based on non-associated flow rule which combines two different functions, Hill (1948) and Yld 2000 - 2 d, is implemented to a user defined material model. The accuracy of the anisotropic directionalities (yield stresses and plastic strain ratios) is evaluated. Simulation of a mini-die cup drawing with a <b>body</b> <b>stock</b> alloy predicted eight ears, in good agreement with the experimental results. The use of Hill (1948) model for the yield function and Yld 2000 - 2 d for plastic potential under the framework of non-associated flow rule led to accurate prediction of up to eight ears at the lower computational cost...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a study concerning both the deep drawing and ironing process-es. The process conditions considered {{are the ones}} of the BENCHMARK 1 - Earing Evolution During Drawing and Ironing Processes, proposed under the NUMISHEET 2011 conference. The deep drawing and ironing operations are performed considering two typical <b>body</b> <b>stock</b> materials: AA 5042 aluminum alloy and AKDQ steel. The results analyzed are the average cup heights after drawing and ironing processes {{as well as the}} required punch load. Two yield criteria were considered: Hill’ 48 [9] and Cazacu and Barlat, 2001 [3]. The constitutive parameters for the Hill’ 48 and the Cazacu and Barlat, 2001 were determined based on the experimental results for tensile tests with different orientations to the rolling direction, disk compression test and the equibiaxial tension test, using DD 3 MAT in-house code. The numeri-cal simulations of the forming process are performed using DD 3 IMP in-house code. The blank sheet is discretized using 3 D solid elements, allowing the accurate description of the contact conditions during the ironing process. The numerical results are compared with the experimental and numerical ones reported in the NUMISHEET 2011 conference proceedings [7]. Globally, the numerical results show that the earing prediction is sensitive to the blank holder modeling, the yield criterion selected, the work hardening law and the strategy used to identify the materials parameters...|$|E

Deep {{drawing of}} metal {{sheeting}} is a commercially significant manufacturing process and {{as with all}} metal forming processes is subject to geometric defects. One defect of particular concern, termed earing, is characterised by an uneven edge to the drawn article. This work covers {{the implementation of a}} suitable constitutive model in a general purpose finite element code ABAQUS Version 5. 4 to simulate this earing phenomenon in aluminium can <b>body</b> <b>stock.</b> Earing is caused by plastic anisotropy of the blank material and anisotropy induced during the drawing process. It is the result of crystallographic textures or preferred grain orientations that develop during the sheet rolling process. In polycrystalline materials it may be modelled via either crystallographic texture models or phenomenological yield surface models. Crystallographic models have the advantage over phenomenological ones in that they are able to describe both initial and evolving anisotropy. However, they are very demanding in terms of computational power and are reported to over predict the plastic strain ratios in anisotropic materials. A phenomenological yield surface model proposed by Karafillis and Boyce was consequently selected as a suitable constitutive model to investigate the earing phenomenon. This model can describe the elasto-plastic behaviour of both isotropic and anisotropic three dimensional polycrystalline materials. It is a pressure independent yield surface which is convex in stress space and assumes an associated flow rule. It was implemented in ABAQUS as a FORTRAN 77 User-Material Subroutine. An Euler Backward integration scheme was adopted and a consistent tangent modulus used. Four axisymmetric cupping operations were simulated: two with the model's parameters set to represent the aluminium alloy under consideration and two to investigate the effect of the yield surface on earing. For comparison purposes, a fifth case was run using the Hill (1948) anisotropic material model...|$|E

40|$|Hot Plane Strain Compression (PSC) {{testing is}} a {{thermomechanical}} testing method used {{to simulate the}} deformation condition of industrial rolling. Thermomechanical processing (TMP) {{factors such as the}} amount of strain, strain rate and temperature all influence the microstructural evolution. The geometry of the PSC test sample and anvil are important factors in order to achieve the plane strain condition and acceptable strain distribution within deformed sample. Geometrical factors such as the breadth ratio (BR) relates the the samples breadth (b) to anvils face width (w) and this ratio has a significant effect on the breadth spread of the sample. The height ratio (HR) relates w to the samples height (h) and this ratio has a significant effect on the strain distribution. Two different geometric PSC testing configurations were investigated for this study, the one configuration had less favourable geometric ratios with a BR of 3 and a HR of 1 and the other configuration had more favourable ratios, with the BR of 4. 62 and the HR of 1. 3. This investigation is to evaluate the feasibility of a newly installed TMP machinery, the Gleeble 3800, to simulate the hot finishing rolling conditions by the use of hot PSC tests for the production of the can <b>body</b> <b>stock</b> (CBS) aluminium alloy AA 3104.
