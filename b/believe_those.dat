5|$|Stigma is {{commonly}} experienced, around the world, {{by those with}} epilepsy. It can affect people economically, socially and culturally. In India and China, epilepsy {{may be used as}} justification to deny marriage. People in some areas still <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> with epilepsy to be cursed. In Tanzania, as in other parts of Africa, epilepsy is associated with possession by evil spirits, witchcraft, or poisoning and is believed by many to be contagious, {{for which there is no}} evidence. Before 1970 the United Kingdom had laws which prevented people with epilepsy from marrying. The stigma may result in some people with epilepsy denying that they have ever had seizures.|$|E

25|$|A {{professor}} of American history at Harvard University {{specializing in the}} history of gender and sexuality has researched gender roles and marriage trends for decades. Dr. Cott has testified for the plaintiffs in both United States v. Windsor and Hollingsworth v. Perry. Cott offered several examples of discriminatory practices involving marriages over the years which are no longer accepted, among them interracial marriages once being banned, American women who married foreigners once lost their citizenship and property, and the U.S. government at times not acknowledging Native American and Japanese marriages. Cott testified on February 28, 2014 that “The trend is moving toward same-sex gender neutrality/gender equality marriages; and the trend is moving toward same-sex marriages.” She also testified that “The Michigan Marriage Amendment obstructs that trend from continuing.” In explaining how marriage has evolved, Cott cited the 300-year ban on interracial marriage, which was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in Loving v. Virginia in 1967. Cott said marriage is a “civil contract” that only be legally sanctioned by legislatures and the courts. In addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage, she said religious authorities have no legal standing over marriages even though they are allowed to conduct marriage ceremonies. Cott testified that there have been no laws in U.S. history that made procreation a requirement for marriage, an argument used by opponents of same-sex marriage. Under cross-examination by state attorney Michelle Brya, Cott admitted the state of Michigan does have an interest in marriage {{between a man and a}} woman for population purposes and sometimes economic reasons but did not <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> two issues should stand in the way of same-sex couples legally marrying.|$|E

500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Karl Barth, an {{influential}} Swiss Reformed theologian, argued that baptism {{should not be}} administered to infants because it represented a completed association with Christ which could only be accepted or rejected by adults. Further, Barth {{in his later years}} rejected the idea that baptism was actually used by God to accomplish anything, or could even properly be called a sacrament. Instead, he taught that water baptism is a human act of obedience. His views have been called [...] "neo-Zwinglian" [...] for this reason, and he himself identified Zwingli's views on sacraments as the believer's oath as his own. He continued to accept the validity of infant baptisms, and did not <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> baptized as infants should be rebaptized.|$|E

In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They have to know that they are a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments.

500|$|In {{this book}} Wallace did not confine {{himself to the}} {{biogeography}} of living species, but also included evidence from the fossil record to discuss the processes of evolution and migration that had led to the geographical distribution of modern animal species. For example, he discussed how fossil evidence showed that tapirs had originated in the Northern Hemisphere, migrating between North America and Eurasia and then, much more recently, to South America after which the northern species became extinct, leaving the modern distribution of two isolated groups of tapir species in South America and Southeast Asia. Wallace was very aware of, and interested in, the mass extinction of megafauna in the late Pleistocene. In The Geographical Distribution of Animals (1876) he wrote, [...] "We live in a zoologically impoverished world, from which all the hugest, and fiercest, and strangest forms have recently disappeared". He added that he believed the most likely cause for the rapid extinctions to have been glaciation, {{but by the time}} he wrote World of Life (1911) he had come to <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> extinctions were [...] "due to man's agency".|$|E

2500|$|Although Asimov pins the {{creation}} of the Three Laws on one particular date, their appearance in his literature happened over a period. He wrote two robot stories with no explicit mention of the Laws, [...] "Robbie" [...] and [...] "Reason". He assumed, however, that robots would have certain inherent safeguards. [...] "Liar!", his third robot story, makes the first mention of the First Law but not the other two. All three laws finally appeared together in [...] "Runaround". When these stories and several others were compiled in the anthology I, Robot, [...] "Reason" [...] and [...] "Robbie" [...] were updated to acknowledge all the Three Laws, though the material Asimov added to [...] "Reason" [...] is not entirely consistent with the Three Laws as he described them elsewhere.

The video is {{an interpretation of}} the authors personal experience with methamphetamine, before his religious conversion. At the time the album was pulled, Brian Welsh released a statement about the visual content of the video, relating its symbolism to his personal experiences of addiction and redemption. He also issued the following statement: [...] "The video for 'Flush' is about crystal meth addiction and the crazy things anyone addicted to meth will do while they're high or to get their fix. Everything the models were doing in the video is what I was wrapped up in while I was addicted to meth... I believe I would be dead right now if I continued using meth, but instead, I chose to surrender my life to Christ and die to myself so He could share His resurrection with me...

2500|$|Queen Victoria {{was also}} against the match. No British prince had ever married a Romanov, and she foresaw {{problems}} with Maria's Orthodox religion and Russian upbringing. The Queen considered that Russia was generally [...] "unfriendly" [...] towards Britain. Victoria was also suspicious about Russian {{moves in the}} direction of India. The Queen was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumours going about St Petersburg that Maria Alexandrovna had compromised herself with Prince Golitsyn, the Tsar's aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled. Alfred refused to <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> rumours and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved. Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride and said nothing. Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not have anyone else. As the Tsarina failed to find a German prince acceptable for her daughter, a meeting among Alfred, the Tsarina and her daughter took place in Sorrento, Italy in mid April 1873. That year, there was an Anglo-Russian dispute [...] over the Afghan border. The Queen’s ministers thought that a marriage might help to ease the tension between the two countries, if only by putting the monarchs into closer contact with one another.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), God {{directed}} Moses to tell Israel's elders what God had promised, and predicted {{that they would}} heed Moses and go with him to tell Pharaoh that God had met with them and request that Pharaoh allow them to go three days' journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to God. God knew that Pharaoh would not let them go unless forced by a mighty hand, so God would strike Egypt with wonders, and then Pharaoh would let them go. God would make the Egyptians view the Israelites favorably, so that the Israelites would not leave empty handed, but every woman would ask her neighbor for jewels and clothing and the Israelites would strip the Egyptians. Moses predicted {{that they would not}} believe him, so God told him to cast his rod on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. God told Moses to take it by the tail, he did so, and it became a rod again. God explained that this was so that they might believe that God had appeared to Moses. Then God told Moses to put his hand into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. God told him to put his hand back into his bosom, he did, and when he took it out, it had returned to normal. God predicted that if they would not heed the first sign, then they would believe the second sign, and if they would not <b>believe</b> <b>those</b> two signs, then Moses was to take water from the river and pour it on the land, and the water would become blood. Moses protested that he was not a man of words but was slow of speech, but God asked him who had made man's mouth, so Moses should go, and God would teach him what to say. Moses pleaded with God to send someone else, and God became angry with Moses. God said that Moses' well-spoken brother Aaron was coming to meet him, Moses would tell him the words that God would teach them, he would be Moses' spokesman, and Moses would be like God to him. And God told Moses to take his staff with him to perform signs. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and the fourth open portion ( [...] , petuchah) end here.|$|E
