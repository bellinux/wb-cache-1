5|$|<b>Bacterial</b> {{disease is}} {{uncommon}} in Narcissus but includes Pseudomonas (<b>bacterial</b> streak) and Pectobacterium carotovorum sp. carotovorum (<b>bacterial</b> soft rot).|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like <b>bacterial</b> flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton {{gradient}} across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The <b>bacterial</b> flagellum shares a common ancestor with the type III secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from <b>bacterial</b> type IV pili. In contrast to the <b>bacterial</b> flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E
5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from <b>bacterial</b> flagella. Whereas <b>bacterial</b> flagella evolved from the <b>bacterial</b> Type III secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Henson's death, doctor David Gelmont first {{announced}} that he died from Streptococcus pneumoniae, a <b>bacterial</b> infection that causes <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia. However, on May 29, Gelmont later confirmed that Henson's {{cause of death was}} organ failure resulting from streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (caused by Streptococcus pyogenes). S. pyogenes is the <b>bacterial</b> species that causes strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. It can also cause other infections.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbits are {{susceptible}} to diseases such as <b>bacterial</b> wilt (Erwinia tracheiphila), anthracnose (Colletotrichum spp.), fusarium wilt (Fusarium spp.), phytophthora blight (Phytophthora spp. water molds), and powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.). Defensive responses to viral, fungal, and <b>bacterial</b> leaf pathogens do not involve cucurbitacin.|$|E
5|$|Transduction of <b>bacterial</b> genes by {{bacteriophage}} is {{a consequence}} of infrequent errors during intracellular assembly of virus particles. Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system, is determined by plasmid genes that encode the machinery necessary to transfer a new copy of the plasmid DNA from one <b>bacterial</b> host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host <b>bacterial</b> chromosome and subsequently transfers part of the host <b>bacterial</b> DNA to another bacterium.|$|E
5|$|While {{these studies}} {{highlight}} some potentially valuable medical applications, only 31-48.8% of the reads could {{be aligned to}} 194 public human gut <b>bacterial</b> genomes and 7.6-21.2% to <b>bacterial</b> genomes available in GenBank which indicates {{that there is still}} far more research necessary to capture novel <b>bacterial</b> genomes.|$|E
5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by <b>bacterial</b> infection. The symptoms of viral and <b>bacterial</b> infection may be indistinguishable, but only <b>bacterial</b> pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of <b>bacterial</b> pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E
5|$|Allosteric enzymes include {{mammalian}} tyrosyl tRNA-synthetase, {{which shows}} negative cooperativity, and <b>bacterial</b> aspartate transcarbamoylase and phosphofructokinase, which show positive cooperativity.|$|E
5|$|As {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{it affects the}} ability of bacteria to produce protein. This either stops growth or results in <b>bacterial</b> death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the start of protein production, rather {{than one of the}} later steps. As of 2014 <b>bacterial</b> resistance to linezolid has remained low.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic {{material}} is typically a single circular <b>bacterial</b> chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the <b>bacterial</b> ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. <b>Bacterial</b> ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit <b>bacterial</b> protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bacterial</b> infections may {{be treated}} with antibiotics, which are {{classified}} as bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent <b>bacterial</b> growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class inhibits {{a process that is}} different in the pathogen from that found in the host. An example of how antibiotics produce selective toxicity are chloramphenicol and puromycin, which inhibit the <b>bacterial</b> ribosome, but not the structurally different eukaryotic ribosome. Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth, where they may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in <b>bacterial</b> populations. Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilising the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also sterilised to prevent contamination by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles {{may suffer}} from <b>{{bacteria}}l</b> infections. Aeromonas and Pseudomonas are two genera of bacteria that cause pneumonia in individuals. <b>Bacterial</b> aggregates (sometimes known as biofilms) {{have also been}} found in the lungs of two deceased specimens discovered in 1982 and 1995 from colonies in the southern population.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic <b>bacterial</b> prostatitis (not acute <b>bacterial</b> prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent urinary tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of urinary tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is a <b>bacterial</b> {{protein synthesis}} inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large <b>bacterial</b> ribosome subunit, overlapping with the binding sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E
5|$|Complications of {{smallpox}} arise most commonly in the respiratory system and range from simple bronchitis to fatal pneumonia. Respiratory complications tend to develop {{on about the}} eighth day of the illness and can be either viral or <b>bacterial</b> in origin. Secondary <b>bacterial</b> infection of the skin is a relatively uncommon complication {{of smallpox}}. When this occurs, the fever usually remains elevated.|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} {{deemed to be}} due to a viral infection. Others use the term more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, <b>bacterial</b> tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to <b>bacterial</b> infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|Dintzis and Hastings {{are able}} to stop urease {{production}} in mice with antibiotics, suggesting a relationship between urease and a <b>bacterial</b> infection.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{and related}} {{bacteria}} possess {{the ability to}} transfer DNA via <b>bacterial</b> conjugation or transduction, which allows genetic material to spread horizontally through an existing population. The process of transduction, which uses the <b>bacterial</b> virus called a bacteriophage, is where {{the spread of the}} gene encoding for the Shiga toxin from the Shigella bacteria to E. coli helped produce , the Shiga toxin-producing strain of E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Exocytosis in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} exocytosis, {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} <b>bacterial</b> outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate <b>bacterial</b> signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many <b>bacterial</b> vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most <b>bacterial</b> vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate immune system and maximize immunogenicity.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|Periodontitis, a <b>bacterial</b> disease {{affecting}} the jaws, is particularly virulent in marsh rice rats; the animal {{has been proposed}} {{as a model for}} research on the disease in humans. The identity of the <b>bacterial</b> agent remains unknown. Vitamin E, fluoride, and iodide protect against bone loss associated with this disease in the rice rat and a high-sucrose diet increases the severity of periodontitis. A case of kyphosis has been observed in a North Carolina marsh rice rat.|$|E
5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} <b>bacterial</b> chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through <b>bacterial</b> conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells. They reproduce by binary fission or sometimes by budding, but do not undergo meiotic sexual reproduction. However, many <b>bacterial</b> species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal gene transfer process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction. Under optimal conditions bacteria can grow extremely rapidly and can double as quickly as every 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|A further {{factor is}} an {{increase}} in the <b>bacterial</b> mass and activity of the ileum as some fibers e.g., pectin are digested by bacteria. The <b>bacterial</b> mass increases and cecal <b>bacterial</b> activity increases.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestine}} <b>bacterial</b> overgrowth (SIBO), also termed <b>bacterial</b> overgrowths, {{or small}} bowel <b>bacterial</b> overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS), is a disorder of excessive <b>bacterial</b> {{growth in the}} small intestine. Unlike the colon (or large bowel), which is rich with bacteria, the small bowel usually has fewer than 10,000 organisms per millilitre. Patients with <b>bacterial</b> overgrowth typically develop symptoms including nausea, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, malnutrition, weight loss and malabsorption, which {{is caused by a}} number of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Targeting of {{identified}} <b>bacterial</b> {{proteins that}} are involved in complement inhibition would neutralize the key <b>bacterial</b> virulence mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>bacterial</b> {{infection}} (especially with Staphylococcus aureus) {{is common}} and may require antibiotics. Clinicians who are unfamiliar with cutaneous leishmaniasis may mistake the lesion for a pure <b>bacterial</b> infection (especially after isolation of S. aureus from <b>bacterial</b> skin swabs) {{and fail to}} consider the possibility of leishmaniasis.|$|E
25|$|Coryza in rubella may {{convert to}} {{pneumonia}}, either direct viral pneumonia or secondary <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia, and bronchitis (either viral bronchitis or secondary <b>bacterial</b> bronchitis).|$|E
25|$|<b>Bacterial</b> vaginosis is not {{considered}} a sexually transmitted infection, and treatment of a male sexual partner {{of a woman with}} <b>bacterial</b> vaginosis is not recommended.|$|E
25|$|Omadacycline (formerly {{known as}} PTK-0796) in phase III {{clinical}} trials for acute <b>bacterial</b> skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community acquired <b>bacterial</b> pneumonia (CABP).|$|E
25|$|Unlike eukaryotes, the <b>bacterial</b> DNA is not {{enclosed}} {{inside of}} a membrane-bound nucleus but instead resides inside the <b>bacterial</b> cytoplasm. This means that the transfer of cellular information through the processes of translation, transcription and DNA replication all occur within the same compartment and can interact with other cytoplasmic structures, most notably ribosomes. The <b>bacterial</b> DNA is not packaged using histones to form chromatin as in eukaryotes but instead exists as a highly compact supercoiled structure, the precise nature of which remains unclear. Most <b>bacterial</b> chromosomes are circular although some examples of linear DNA exist (e.g. Borrelia burgdorferi). Along with chromosomal DNA, most bacteria also contain small independent pieces of DNA called plasmids that often encode for traits that are advantageous but not essential to their <b>bacterial</b> host. Plasmids can be easily gained or lost by a bacterium and can be transferred between bacteria {{as a form of}} horizontal gene transfer. So plasmids can be described as an extra chromosomal DNA in a <b>bacterial</b> cell.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent of}} arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} colonization and species affects the <b>bacterial</b> {{population in the}} rhizosphere. <b>Bacterial</b> species differ in their abilities to compete for carbon compound root exudates. A change in the amount or composition of root exudates and fungal exudates due to the existing AM mycorrhizal colonization determines the diversity and abundance of the <b>bacterial</b> community in the rhizosphere.|$|E
25|$|Direct {{observation}} of <b>bacterial</b> mats and fracture-fill carbonate and humin of <b>bacterial</b> origin in deep boreholes in Australia are also taken as {{evidence for the}} abiogenic origin of petroleum.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{sinusitis}} {{is usually}} precipitated by an earlier {{upper respiratory tract}} infection, generally of viral origin, mostly caused by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza viruses, others caused by adenoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, and metapneumovirus. If the infection is of <b>bacterial</b> origin, the most common three causative agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Until recently, Haemophilus influenzae {{was the most common}} <b>bacterial</b> agent to cause sinus infections. However, introduction of the H. influenza type B (Hib) vaccine has dramatically decreased H. influenza type B infections and now non-typable H. influenza (NTHI) are predominantly seen in clinics. Other sinusitis-causing <b>bacterial</b> pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus and other streptococci species, anaerobic bacteria and, less commonly, gram negative bacteria. Viral sinusitis typically lasts for 7 to 10 days, whereas <b>bacterial</b> sinusitis is more persistent. Approximately 0.5% to 2% of viral sinusitis results in subsequent <b>bacterial</b> sinusitis. It is thought that nasal irritation from nose blowing leads to the secondary <b>bacterial</b> infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of action is unique and complex. The drug works by damaging <b>bacterial</b> DNA, since its reduced form is highly reactive. This is {{made possible by the}} rapid reduction of nitrofurantoin inside the <b>bacterial</b> cell by flavoproteins (nitrofuran reductase) to multiple reactive intermediates that attack ribosomal proteins, DNA, respiration, pyruvate metabolism and other macromolecules within the cell. Nitrofurantoin exerts greater effects on <b>bacterial</b> cells than mammalian cells because <b>bacterial</b> cells activate the drug more rapidly. It is not known which of the actions of nitrofurantoin is primarily responsible for its bactericidal activity. The broad {{mechanism of}} action for this drug likely is responsible for the low development of resistance to its effects, as the drug affects many different processes important to the <b>bacterial</b> cell.|$|E
