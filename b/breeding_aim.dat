2500|$|Because moringa is {{cultivated}} {{and used}} in different ways, there are different breeding aims. The breeding aims for an annual or a perennial plant are obviously different. The yield stability of fruits is an important <b>breeding</b> <b>aim</b> for the commercial cultivation in India, where moringa is cultivated as an annual. On less favorable locations, perennial cultivation has big advantages. Erosion is much smaller with perennial cultivation. In Pakistan, varieties have been tested for their nutritional composition of the leaves on different locations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the times, Rottalers were {{expected}} to be versatile enough to pull the plow during the week and the carriage to church on Sundays. Throughout the 19th century, Anglo-Norman, Cleveland bay and Oldenburg horses were imported to keep the Rottaler vibrant, and by 1906 the Rottaler Warmblood Horse Breeding Association was formed. In 1963, the <b>breeding</b> <b>aim</b> was redirected towards the production of more agile, sensitive riding horses, and the brand was changed from [...] "R" [...] to [...] "B". The Rottaler mares were bred to Hanoverians and Westphalians, and over successive generations, the breed threatened to disappear forever. It wasn't until 1991 that the Rottaler was re-established within the Bavarian association, and by that time there were scant few lines left. However, what struck the spectators at the first inspection of Rottaler mares in 1994 was the vitality of the mares, which had an average age of over 15.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{critical}} {{characteristic of a}} warmblood registry is that its breeding goal (or [...] "breeding aim") is to breed sport horses.

The <b>breeding</b> <b>aim</b> is reflective {{of the needs of}} the market. In eras and regions which called for cavalry mounts, warmbloods were bred to fit that need; when and where horses for light to moderate agricultural work were needed, warmbloods have also filled those roles.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is the {{evaluation}} of performance of basic herd in breeding of ZVPP Doublovičky of Agricultural Company Kosova Hora a. s. The age structure of the herd {{and the results of}} rearing piglets were evaluated. The results of rearing piglets were compared with PIC <b>breeding</b> <b>aims.</b> Basic herd was consisted of 480 - 530 sows. The herd was divided into 4 groups for assessing the age structure of herd - gilts, sows on 1 st and 2 nd litters, 3 rd to 5 th litters, 6 th and higher litters. Sows on the 6 th and higher litters had the majority (35, 9 %). It was also evaluated the decommissioning of sows. The most common reason was the age or musculoskeletal disorders for exclusion. Indicators of fertility were evaluated too - the total number of born, the number of live born and weaned piglets. For this monitoring the basic herd was divided into reproductive and productive herd. Comparing with the objectives of PIC, the results of monitored sows were about 0. 8 - 1 piglet smaller than the PIC <b>breeding</b> <b>aims.</b> Fertility was also monitored according to parity number. The highest number of live born piglets was on the fourth litter. Losses of live born piglets to weaning were 11. 2 %. Most gilts were embedded first in the age of 216 - 225 days. In the pursued breeding piglets were weaned mostly around the 20 th day. In 2014 the intensity of fertility was 2. 44 litter per sow per year, while the PIC <b>breeding</b> <b>aims</b> are 2. 4 litter per sow per year...|$|R

40|$|Crop <b>breeding</b> <b>aims</b> {{to balance}} disease {{resistance}} with yield, however single resistance (R) genes {{can lead to}} resistance breakdown and R gene pyramiding may impact growth fitness. Here we report that the rice Pigm locus contains a cluster of genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptors that confer durable resistance to the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae without yield penalty. In the cluster, PigmR confers broad-spectrum resistance, whereas PigmS competitively attenuates PigmR homodimerization to suppress resistance. PigmS expression, and thus PigmR-mediated resistance, are subjected to tight epigenetic regulation. PigmS increases seed production to counteract the yield cost induced by PigmR. Therefore, our study reveals a mechanism balancing high disease resistance and yield through epigenetic regulation of paired antagonistic NLRs, providing a tool to develop elite crop varieties.
