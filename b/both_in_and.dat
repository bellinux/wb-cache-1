5|$|After high school, Mitsuda {{decided to}} leave town and become independent. With {{encouragement}} from his father and sister, he moved to Tokyo and enrolled in the Junior College of Music. Despite the school's low prestige, Mitsuda received solid instruction from his professors, most of them practicing musicians who would take Mitsuda to gigs with them to help carry and set up equipment. At the cost of being used for free physical labor, Mitsuda got a first-hand view of the Japanese music world and valuable training <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the classroom. As part of his college course, he was granted an intern position at the game development studio Wolf Team, studying under composer and musician Motoi Sakuraba, whom Mitsuda would work with together on game projects decades later.|$|E

5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the host sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the host to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the host. If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the host, the host sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts <b>both</b> <b>IN</b> <b>and</b> OUT packets.|$|E
5|$|Athletes have {{historically}} been willing to take legal and health risks to improve their performance, with some even stating their willingness to risk their lives, as exemplified by research by Mirkin, Goldman and Connor in researching attitudes to the so-called Goldman dilemma. To prevent use of performance-enhancing substances, athletes must submit to drug tests that are conducted <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of competition by anti-doping officials or accredited medical staff. Penalized athletes are susceptible to higher testing upon return to competition. Athletes found to have taken substances on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list receive sanctions and may be banned from competition {{for a period of}} time that corresponds to the seriousness of the infraction. However, the use of substances not on the prohibited list may also result in sanctions if the substance is deemed similar to a banned substance in either composition or effect. Athletes may also be sanctioned for missing tests, seeking to avoid testing or tampering with results, refusing to submit to testing, through circumstantial evidence, or confession of use.|$|E
5|$|Dance Dance Revolution, {{released}} in 1998, is a rhythm {{game in which}} players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> outside Japan, unlike games such as GuitarFreaks, DrumMania and Beatmania, though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's Bust a Groove features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.|$|E

However, Harvey was not a peaceable man and his life <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the Navy was frequently punctuated by disputes with fellow officers and politicians. One such dispute, {{a consequence of the}} Battle of Basque Roads, eventually cost Harvey his career; a bitter exchange with Lord Gambier forcing Harvey into early retirement in 1809. Although reinstated a year later, Harvey was never again employed in an official capacity and further promotions were only bestowed as a matter of seniority.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano basin {{supports}} a large range of plant life, including over 1,100 species of plant which grow {{on the river}} bank, in the river bed or more broadly. The basin also {{supports a}} large range of animal life <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> around the river. However, {{the development of the}} river has threatened the continuing existence of a number of different species. Across the country, thirty to fifty (or higher) percent of endangered species are from freshwater river systems and the impact on the Shinano river system is also clear. Primarily this affects fish and amphibians due to their reliance on the river. The construction of weirs and dams to support agriculture and industry as well as the introduction of invasive species and pollution have been the main causes of ecosystem degradation. The Shinano basin provides a habitat for around twenty-five percent of Japan's fish species (around fifty-five of the 200 fish species living in Japan) including both endemic freshwater fish as well as diadromous fish.|$|E
5|$|Under Wilkes' ownership, the Spirit, which {{previously}} had covered mainly sporting events, expanded its coverage to include political matters. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Wilkes covered the battles also. He {{was present at}} the First Battle of Bull Run and wrote an account of it. He continued to serve as a correspondent throughout the war and contracted the kidney disease which he later died from during his war journalism. Wilkes also used literary feuds with other newspapers, <b>both</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the sporting press, to help his subscription rates. After the Civil War, Wilkes' Spirit was one of the three leading newspapers in New York City. Two, including the Spirit, of the three were mainly devoted to horse racing– the other being The Turf, Field and Farm by Sanders D. Bruce.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to observe the change of the times concerning sexual consciousness and sexual behavior freshmen between 1978 and 1990. The investigation was taken of 275 males <b>and</b> 157 females <b>in</b> 1978, <b>and</b> 258 males <b>and</b> 232 females <b>in</b> 1990. The results were summarized as follows: 1. The rates of the desire for a kiss, petting and coitus were higher in males than <b>in</b> females <b>both</b> <b>in</b> 1978 <b>and</b> 1990, respectively. The desire for coitus was higher in 1990 than <b>in</b> 1978 <b>both</b> <b>in</b> males <b>and</b> female subjects. 2. The rates of experience in a kiss, petting and coitus were higher in 1990 than 1978 <b>both</b> <b>in</b> males <b>and</b> females, and there were obviously significant differences in males. 3. Concerning the limit to friends of men and women, coitus was higher in males than <b>in</b> females, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> 1990 than <b>in</b> 1978 <b>both</b> <b>in</b> males <b>and</b> female subjects. 4.
