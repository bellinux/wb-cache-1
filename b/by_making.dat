40|$|Maker {{movement}} is often celebrated as a rekindled interest in <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand, {{as well as}} a promise for new forms of manufacturing and economic growth. In contrast to this popularized image, the theoretical background in the maker movement remains ambivalent. This article {{takes a look at the}} theoretical foundation of the maker movement and proposes a phenomenological approach to <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand as a framework for maker movement. A particular focus is on the knowledge making process in the maker movement following Finnish craft researcher Kojonkoski-Rännäli's account of <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand. Basing her theory on Martin Heidegger’s philosophical analysis, Kojonkoski-Rännäli sees <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand an essential way of existing in the world: <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand develops not only maker’s handicraft skills but also her/his knowledge, responsibility and caring for the world as it appears to her/him through the act of making. In this paper, I explore maker movements’ relation to Kojonkoski-Rännäli’s philosophy of <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand. Moreover, I focus on how the maker movements approach to digital and digitalization relate to <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand. Keywords: Maker movement, code literacy, craft education, philosophy, <b>making</b> <b>by</b> hand </div...|$|R
