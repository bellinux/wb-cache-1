25|$|The {{absorption}} of gases in liquids {{depends on the}} solubility of the specific gas in the specific liquid, the concentration of gas, customarily measured by partial pressure, and temperature. In the study of decompression theory the behaviour of gases dissolved in the tissues is investigated and modeled for variations of pressure over time. Once dissolved, distribution of the dissolved gas may be by diffusion, {{where there is no}} <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> of the solvent, or by perfusion where the solvent (blood) is circulated around the diver's body, where gas can diffuse to local regions of lower concentration. Given sufficient time at a specific partial pressure in the breathing gas, the concentration in the tissues will stabilise, or saturate, at a rate depending on the solubility, diffusion rate and perfusion. If the concentration of the inert gas in the breathing gas is reduced below that of any of the tissues, there will be a tendency for gas to return from the tissues to the breathing gas. This is known as outgassing, and occurs during decompression, when the reduction in ambient pressure or a change of breathing gas reduces the partial pressure of the inert gas in the lungs.|$|E

40|$|Hones 1977 {{points out}} the marked {{disagreement}} between the plasma flow measurements reported by Frank et al. 1976 and those obtained with the LASL plasma analyzer. He suggests (1) that solar ultraviolet background rates may have been incorrectly accounted for in the computation of proton <b>bulk</b> <b>flows</b> in the magnetotail as reported by Frank et al. 1976 and (2) that <b>bulk</b> <b>flows</b> with substantial speeds, i. e., those speeds greater than 50 km per sec, are seldom encountered in the plasma sheet at geocentric radial distances approx. equal to 35 R sub E.

25|$|The {{available}} {{space for}} air and moisture in wood {{depends on the}} density and porosity of wood. Porosity is the volume fraction of void space in a solid. The porosity {{is reported to be}} 1.2 to 4.6% of dry volume of wood cell wall (Siau, 1984). On the other hand, permeability {{is a measure of the}} ease with which fluids are transported through a porous solid under the influence of some driving forces, e.g. capillary pressure gradient or moisture gradient. It is clear that solids must be porous to be permeable, but it does not necessarily follow that all porous bodies are permeable. Permeability can only exist if the void spaces are interconnected by openings. For example, a hardwood may be permeable because there is intervessel pitting with openings in the membranes (Keey et al., 2000). If these membranes are occluded or encrusted, or if the pits are aspirated, the wood assumes a closed-cell structure and may be virtually impermeable. The density is also important for impermeable hardwoods because more cell-wall material is traversed per unit distance, which offers increased resistance to diffusion (Keey et al., 2000). Hence lighter woods, in general, dry more rapidly than do the heavier woods. The transport of fluids is often <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> (momentum transfer) for permeable softwoods at high temperature while diffusion occurs for impermeable hardwoods (Siau, 1984). These mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, {{but it will not}} make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of matter between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E

2500|$|The {{situation}} is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that {{his definition of}} [...] "heat transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell {{in a situation of}} continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the diffusive flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> of internal energy and diffusive flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density {{does not have to be}} constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> to internal energy by viscosity.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. The hydrodynamic model was developed to describe microbial growth kinetics within heap bioleaching systems. Microbial partitioning between the <b>bulk</b> <b>flowing</b> pregnant leach solution (PLS) and ore-associated phases that exist within the low-grade chalcopyrite ore bed, {{as a function of}} microbial transport between these identified phases, was investigated. Microbial transport between the <b>bulk</b> <b>flowing</b> PLS and ore-associated phases was postulated to be driven by the microbial concentration gradient between the phases, with advection and dispersion forces facilitating microbial colonisation of, and transport through, the ore bed. The population balance model (PBM) was incorporated into the hydrodynamic model to estimate mineral dissolution rates as a function of available surface area appropriately. Temporal and spatial variations in microbial concentration in the PLS and ore-associated phases are presented together with model predictions for overall ferrous and ferric iron concentrations, which account for iron concentrations in the <b>bulk</b> <b>flowing</b> PLS and that {{in the vicinity of the}} mineral surface. The model predictions for PLS and ore-associated microbial concentrations are validated with experimental data, demonstrating the improvement of this model over the previously presented ‘biomass model’. Based on Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, model-predicted true maximum specific growth rates for Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in the PLS and ore-associated phases were found to be 0. 0004 and 0. 019  h − 1, respectively. Estimated microbial attachment and detachment rates suggest that microbial growth is more prolific in the ore-associated phases with subsequent transport to the <b>bulk</b> <b>flowing</b> PLS. Sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic transport model to changes in the advection mass transfer coefficient, dispersion coefficient and inoculum size are discussed. For the current reactor configuration, increasing the irrigation rate from 2 to 2. 5  L m − 2  h − 1, i. e. increasing the advection mass transfer rate, resulted in a significant decrease in microbial retention within the ore bed.

2500|$|Since {{the revised}} and more {{rigorous}} {{definition of the}} internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves {{a problem for the}} definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible. According to Max Born, the transfer of matter and energy across an open connection [...] "cannot be reduced to mechanics". In contrast to the case of closed systems, for open systems, in the presence of diffusion, there is no unconstrained and unconditional physical distinction between convective transfer of internal energy by <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> of matter, the transfer of internal energy without transfer of matter (usually called heat conduction and work transfer), and change of various potential energies.

2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the <b>bulk</b> <b>flow</b> figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

40|$|The early Universe is a {{precious}} probe {{of the birth}} of primordial objects, first star formation events and consequent production of photons and heavy elements. Higher-order corrections to the cosmological linear perturbation theory predicts the formation of coherent supersonic gaseous streaming motions at decoupling time.

By analytical estimates and N-body hydrodynamical chemistry numerical simulations including atomic and molecular evolution, gas cooling, star formation, feedback effects and metal spreading for individual species from different stellar populations according to the proper yields and lifetimes, we discuss the role of these primordial <b>bulk</b> <b>flows</b> {{at the end of the}} dark ages and their detectable impacts during the first Gyr in view of the upcoming SKA mission. Early <b>bulk</b> <b>flows</b> can inhibit molecular gas cooling capabilities, suppressing star formation, metal spreading and the abundance of small primordial galaxies in the infant Universe.
