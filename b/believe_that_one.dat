5|$|When Monk {{returns with}} Natalie (Traylor Howard) to Dr. Kroger's office, they meet Francis Merrigan (Gordon Clapp), who owns an {{importing}} and exporting business {{based in the}} same building. Merrigan is carrying a milk carton, which {{he says he is}} utilizing for a coffeemaker. That night, someone throws a rock through the window of Dr. Kroger's house. Stottlemeyer and Disher keep the suspicion on one of Dr. Kroger's patients. As they interview the Kroger family, they learn Kroger suspects his rebellious son Troy (Cody McMains) did it. Monk, however, believes that whoever killed Teresa might have thrown the rock to make everyone <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of Dr. Kroger's patients is involved. Monk recognizes the rock, though he does not know where he saw it.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} have come to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel {{the creation of the}} Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
25|$|Many Parker biographers, {{including}} Dirk Vellenga and Alanna Nash, {{have stated}} that Parker's gambling really began {{to get out of}} hand in the mid-1960s. With his wife's health deteriorating, and Presley's career struggling, Parker found an escape at the Las Vegas casinos. Fans and biographers alike <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of the main reasons Parker signed Presley to a Las Vegas hotel in 1969 for his live comeback was to help cover the losses he had experienced in their casino. He would often spend 12–14 hours at a time gambling, betting large sums of money instead of small amounts. At the time of Presley's death it was suspected that Parker owed the Las Vegas Hilton $30 million. In a lifetime that saw him earn in excess of $100 million, Parker's estate was barely worth $1 million when he died.|$|E

25|$|When Gandhi was in prison, Patel {{was asked}} by Members of Congress to lead the satyagraha in Nagpur in 1923 against a law banning the raising of the Indian flag. He {{organised}} thousands of volunteers {{from all over the}} country to take part in processions of people hoisting the flag. Patel negotiated a settlement obtaining the release of all prisoners and allowing nationalists to hoist the flag in public. Later that year, Patel and his allies uncovered evidence suggesting that the police were in league with local dacoits in the Borsad taluka even as the government prepared to levy a major tax for fighting dacoits in the area. More than 6,000 villagers assembled to hear Patel speak in support of proposed agitation against the tax, which was deemed immoral and unnecessary. He organised hundreds of Congressmen, sent instructions, and received information from across the district. Every village in the taluka resisted payment of the tax, and through cohesion, also prevented the seizure of property and land. After a protracted struggle, the government withdrew the tax. Historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> of Patel's key achievements was the building of cohesion and trust amongst the different castes and communities, which had been divided along socio-economic lines.|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her know}} if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it difficult to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E

500|$|The Court {{returned}} {{to the issue of}} abortion in the 2000 case of Stenberg v. Carhart, in which it invalidated a Nebraska statute outlawing partial-birth abortion. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote for the Court that the law was unconstitutional because it did not allow an exception for the health of the woman. Scalia dissented, comparing the Stenberg case to two of the most reviled cases in Supreme Court history: [...] "I am optimistic enough to <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>one</b> day, Stenberg v. Carhart will be assigned its rightful place {{in the history of this}} Court's jurisprudence beside Korematsu and Dred Scott. The method of killing a human child... proscribed by this statute is so horrible that the most clinical description of it evokes a shudder of revulsion".|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC {{does not have an}} ideology, and that the party {{organization}} is pragmatic and interested only in what works. This view is considered wrong by some in many ways, since official statements make it very clear the party does have a coherent worldview. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is [...] "threatening to divide us" [...] and that [...] "the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets". The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message. Before the [...] "Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth" [...] campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> {{of the reasons for the}} dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Soviet Union's communist party, whose ideology they believe became [...] "rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Cornwallis {{returned}} to America in July 1779, {{where he was}} to {{play a central role}} as the lead commander of the British [...] "Southern strategy". [...] At the end of 1779, Clinton and Cornwallis transported a large force south and initiated the second siege of Charleston during the spring of 1780, which resulted in the surrender of the Continental forces under Benjamin Lincoln. [...] Cornwallis and Clinton at first worked closely together during the siege, but their relationship deteriorated. [...] Cracks had formed between the two as early as October 1776, when Cornwallis reported to General Howe critical comments that Clinton made about Howe's conduct at White Plains. [...] Clinton also seemed to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> reason for Cornwallis's trips to England was to scheme for an independent command. [...] Cornwallis as second in command held a dormant commission and would replace Clinton as commander in chief. [...] He was aware that Clinton wanted to resign, but {{he did not want to}} be saddled with a difficult command situation should that occur. [...] Cornwallis consequently avoided advising Clinton as much as possible, in order to avoid responsibility for poor outcomes. [...] The deterioration in their relationship set the stage for some of their communication difficulties that resulted in Cornwallis's eventual surrender at Yorktown. [...] In late April, Clinton detached a force under Cornwallis to ensure that the enemy's communications and supplies were interrupted around the city. [...] Because of this, Cornwallis missed most of the siege bombardment and the surrender in May; forces directed by Cornwallis and led by Banastre Tarleton completed the encirclement of Charleston, skirmishing with the Americans at Monck's Corner and Lenud's Ferry. [...] After the American surrender Clinton ordered Cornwallis to secure South Carolina's interior, while Clinton organized control of Charleston. [...] Not long after Tarleton defeated Abraham Buford's Virginia regiments at Waxhaw, Clinton {{returned to}} New York, leaving Cornwallis in command in the south.|$|E
