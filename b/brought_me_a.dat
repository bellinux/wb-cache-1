25|$|But in 1951 I {{found myself}} in serious difficulty. I had been {{commissioned}} by the National Broadcasting Company to write an opera for television, with Christmas as deadline, and I simply didn't have one idea in my head. One November afternoon as I was walking rather gloomily through the rooms of the Metropolitan Museum, I chanced to {{stop in front of}} the Adoration of the Kings by Hieronymus Bosch, and as I was looking at it, suddenly I heard again, coming from the distant blue hills, the weird song of the Three Kings. I then realized they had come back to me and had <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> gift.|$|E
2500|$|In his journals, Stefansson wrote {{often of}} his {{relationship}} with the early whaling captain. [...] "Captain George Leavitt of the Narwhal had entertained me aboard his ship in winter quarters at Herschel Island several times during the winter of 19061907, and had now <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> consignment of ammunition, kerosene, alcohol for the preservation of scientific specimens, and various things of that sort, sent North in his care by the American Museum of Natural History." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003–04 season, Valencia won La Liga {{with three}} games to spare and beat Marseille 2–0 in the UEFA Cup final. Despite this success, Benítez fell out with Jesús García Pitarch, the club's {{director}} of football, {{over control of}} new signings and the club's failure to reinforce the squad with the players he wanted. He famously said, [...] "I was hoping for a sofa [...] and they've <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lamp ," [...] {{in reference to the}} positions he wanted to be strengthened. These differences of opinion saw Benítez resign as Valencia coach on 1 June 2004.|$|E
6000|$|So Lady Delahaye {{drove away}} down the white dusty road, and I {{walked back to the}} study from whence her coming had <b>brought</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> I sat down to my {{interrupted}} work I smiled. How little she understood! ...|$|R

60|$|But, as chance {{would have}} it, the morning post <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> {{unexpected}} letter, which helped <b>me</b> not <b>a</b> little in unravelling the problem. It was a crumpled letter, written on rather soiled paper, in an uneducated hand, and it bore, like Hilda's, the Basingstoke postmark.|$|R
2500|$|... "On {{learning}} that I was with Crook, Crawford at once hunted me up, {{and gave me}} a letter from General Sheridan, announcing his appointment as a scout. He also informed me that he had <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> present from General Jones, of Cheyenne. 'What kind of a present' I inquired, seeing no indication of any package about Jack. 'A bottle of whiskey!' he almost shouted. I clapped my hand over his mouth. News that whiskey was in the camp was likely to cause a raid... I will say in passing that I don't believe there is another scout in the West that would have brought a full bottle of whiskey 300 miles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malcah Zeldis {{collaborated with}} her daughter, Yona Zeldis, {{to write and}} {{illustrate}} a number of children's books. Yona says, [...] "The collaboration I really owe to her. She {{really wanted to do}} a children's book with me, and I said, 'No no no no no, I can't do that,' and she said, 'Yes you can.' She persisted and in effect <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> contract." [...] Zeldis and her daughter have written and illustrated Eve and Her Sisters: Women of the Old Testament, God Sent a Rainbow and Other Bible Stories, Anne Frank, Sisters in Strength: American Women Who Made a Difference, and Hammerin' Hank. [...] Malcah Zeldis has also illustrated Honest Abe and Martin Luther King.|$|E
2500|$|... "On {{the night}} of the 6th , I got into Camp tired and wet, went to bed and slept very soundly. About midnite a courier <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> note that each brigade should move with its own ordnance. By a very dim light and just aroused, I read the note incorrectly, that each {{division}} shall move with its own ordnance. When I discovered my mistake I explained the matter to General S. He said that my explanation was perfectly satisfactory and asked me to make it in writing in order that he might forward it to Gen. Lee. I did so and just before Lee rec'd the explanation he ordered S. to arrest me and prefer charges. So here I am in arrest." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{says the}} captain, [...] "I must go {{and tell the}} {{governor}} what you say, and see what I can do {{to bring him to}} consent to it." [...] So he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> account of the temper he found them in; and that he verily believed they would be faithful.|$|R
60|$|I swore. I {{made three}} {{steps to the}} window, and this <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> within <b>a</b> yard of that accursed drawer.|$|R
2500|$|According to Pirozhkova, [...] "Before I met Babel, I {{used to read}} a great deal, though {{without any}} {{particular}} direction. I read whatever I could get my hands on. Babel noticed this and told me, 'Reading that way will get you nowhere. You won't have time to read the books that are truly worthwhile. There are about a hundred books that every educated person needs to read. Sometime I'll try {{to make you a}} list of them.' And a few days later he <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> list. There were ancient writers on it, Greek and Roman — Homer, Herodotus, Lucretius, Suetonius — and also all the classics of later European literature, starting with Erasmus, Rabelais, Cervantes, Swift, and Coster, and going on to 19th century writers such as Stendhal, Mérimée, and Flaubert." ...|$|E
2500|$|Think Big and Kick Ass {{emphasizes}} the importance of maintaining large goals for oneself, [...] "If you’re going to be thinking anything, you might as well think big." [...] He elaborates on his think big thesis, [...] "The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do." [...] Trump advises budding business careerists to have an optimistic outlook. Trump writes, [...] "think positively and expect the best. My positive attitude has <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot of luck." [...] He says those who seek out their passions in life will find financial success. He tells readers to devote two hours a day focusing on how to generate money. The book talks about the importance of concentration on the task at hand, writing, [...] "Focus is a tricky thing. Focus does not mean that you narrow your mind and become inflexible. That is taking focus too far." [...] Trump describes his expectations of loyalty from his employees, writing, [...] "I try to hire people who are honest and loyal. I value loyalty very much. I put the people who are loyal to me on a high pedestal and take care of them very well. I go out of my way for the people who were loyal to me in bad times." [...] Trump cites Hillary Clinton as an example of an individual with [...] "the ability to think big", calling her [...] "a fantastic person" [...] and a [...] "very good person". He warns about repercussions for disloyalty, [...] "They must respect or even fear you, or things will go very wrong. If you do not create an atmosphere of respect and loyalty, you will be in for a struggle." ...|$|E

60|$|I glanced {{round the}} room. Just {{at that moment}} a waiter from the {{restaurant}} presented himself. He <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> card upon a salver.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{went with}} the utmost caution, {{and a moment later}} a sharp turn in the tunnel <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> to <b>an</b> opening into a large, brilliantly lighted chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, King," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am glad to}} see you again. Have you <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> down <b>a</b> {{message from}} Captain Jones or any of our fellows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{then she}} was gone too, and I alone. What an easy, consoling thing--not to care. But though Fanny might forgive, she must have found it unamusing to forget. The next evening's post <b>brought</b> <b>me</b> <b>an</b> exquisitely written little fable, signed [...] "F. B.," [...] and {{entitled}} Asteroida and the Yellow Dwarf.
