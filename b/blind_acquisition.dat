40|$|Abstract – A {{multiuser}} demodulation algorithm for the up-link of an asynchronous multicarrier {{code division}} multiple access (MC-CDMA) based wireless communication system is derived. The estimation of the multipath channel parameters and the symbol detection are incorporated in a joint demod-ulation scheme which employs a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm for the iterative maximization of the log-likelihood function. Two different ap-proaches to initialize the parameter estimates are presented based on the transmission of preambles as well as on a <b>blind</b> <b>acquisition</b> scheme. The performance of the algorithm is inves-tigated in Monte Carlo simulations. The bit-error rates indi-cate that the scheme is robust in near-far situations as opposed to conventional demodulation and is thus particularly suited for systems without a tight power control. ...|$|E

The timing phase offset generated by the proposed symbol timing recovery algorithm is located close to the optimal timing phase offset compared to the Gardner [2] or band-edge algorithms [3] without help of the equalized data without feedback from the equalizer. Hence, the proposed algorithm can be used with the data aided approaches in the place of the Gardner algorithm for ATSC receivers.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} blind estimation of linear chip-spaced receivers for the demodulation {{of a particular}} short-code DS-CDMA mobile user under multipath propagation {{and in the absence}} of timing information. We propose a family of schemes for <b>blind</b> <b>acquisition</b> and equalization based on Donoho's Minimum Entropy principle and propose a specific algorithm that uses the second- and fourth-order moments of a pre-whitened chip-rate received signal. The proposed algorithm can be considered a near-far resistant initialization procedure for, and application of, the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) to DS-CDMA. 1 Introduction Direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) systems have received considerable attention as a flexible means of communication between multiple mobile users and centralized base stations.

40|$|Deep space laser {{communications}} require extremely accurate beam {{pointing to}} take advantage of the narrow beams achievable at optical wavelengths. This pointing accuracy must be achieved in the presence of spacecraft basebody motion which may exceed laser pointing requirements by orders of magnitude. In this paper a model of an optical band transceiver pointing control system is developed that can be used to predict performance under various operating scenarios. The transceiver model consists of an electro-mechanical model of the telescope platform and isolator. A novel photon counting detector array is used in the simulation as the focal plane detector. In the simulation we are able to inject various cases of spacecraft basebody motion based on both flight data and future mission spacecraft jitter requirements. Various models of uplink beacon flux levels and atmospheric scintillation are also available for analysis. Using these models, detector processing and control functions are implemented in the simulation. A complete acquisition sequence is demonstrated with <b>blind</b> <b>acquisition</b> and tracking of the modulated uplink beam and positioning of the downlink beam on the focal plane array. These simulations predict that pointing requirements will be met with representative disturbance models and uplink beam scintillation...|$|E
40|$|SummaryNongenetic {{transmission}} of behavioral traits via social learning allows local traditions in humans, and, controversially, in other animals [1 – 4]. Social learning is usually studied as an intraspecific phenomenon (but see [5 – 7]). However, other species with some overlap in ecology {{can be more}} than merely potential competitors: prior settlement and longer residence can render them preferable sources of information [8]. Socially induced acquisition of choices or preferences capitalizes upon the knowledge of presumably better-informed individuals [9] and should be adaptive under many natural circumstances [10, 11]. Here we show with a field experiment that females of two migrant flycatcher species can acquire a novel, arbitrary preference of competing resident tits for a symbol attached to the nest sites. The experiment demonstrates that such <b>blind</b> <b>acquisition</b> of heterospecific traits can occur in the wild. Even though genetic variation for habitat preferences exists in many taxa [12] and overlap between bird species likely induces costs [13], this result shows that interspecific social learning can cause increased overlap in nest-site preferences. Conventional, negative species interactions push ecological niches of species apart, {{but the use of}} competing species as a source of information counters that force and may lead to convergence...|$|E

The system {{also serves as a}} model for the phenomenon of pronoun reversal among congenitally blind children, as the system learns that “you ” is its own name when it is blinded. The system is novel among grounded systems in that it learns language by observing interactions between other agents, rather than from a helpful caregiver, and in that it associates words with social roles rather than reasoning about visual appearance alone.

30|$|Image {{quality of}} 140 -keV {{conventional}} CT and 65 - and 50  keV VM images was evaluated by two board-certified radiologists with 8 and 21  years {{of experience in}} abdominal CT, who were <b>blind</b> to <b>acquisition</b> parameters of each image and clinical background. The images at the anatomical slice level including the hepatic hilum in the early arterial, late arterial, and portal venous phase were selected phase by phase and then randomly serialized on the workstation with the standard abdominal window (window level 50 HU, window width 350 HU). The radiologists independently graded the images for image contrast, image noise and overall image quality. Image contrast and overall image quality of the conventional and VM images were rated on a 4 -point scale: 1, unacceptable; 2, acceptable; 3, good; 4, excellent. Image noise as graded similarly: 1, severe noise present and unacceptable; 2, moderate noise present and interfering; 3, mild noise not interfering with depiction of structures; 4, no substantial noise. The initial setting of window level and width was set as the standard abdominal window.|$|R

CBTs for PD were originally envisioned {{as a way to}} replace the dopaminergic nigral neurons lost with the disease. Several sources of catecholaminergic cells, including autografts of adrenal medulla and allografts or xenografts of mesencephalic fetal tissue, were successfully assessed in animal models, but their clinical translation has yielded poor results and much controversy. Recent breakthroughs on cell biology are helping to develop novel cell lines {{that could be used for}} regenerative medicine. Their future successful clinical application depends on identifying and solving the problems encountered in previous CBTs trials. In this review, we critically analyze past CBTs' clinical translation, the impact of the host in graft survival, and the role of preclinical studies and emerging new cell lines.

40|$|The future {{wireless}} communications systems {{should be able}} to offer wide variety of applications, which have vastly different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The time-variable QoS may require the support of variable bit rates on the wireless links to the individual users. Multi-rate DS/CDMA is a promising basis on which to support the variable bit rates on the individual wireless links. Currently, the study on channel estimation and multiuser detection for multi-rate DS/CDMA, which makes full use of the nature of multi-rate signals, is still at its early stage. The thesis deals with the application of subspace-based techniques to blind channel estimation and multiuser detection for multi-rate DS/CDMA, including single-carrier and multicarrier scenarios. For the single-carrier case, space-time blind linear multiuser detection is investigated for synchronous dual-rate systems over the AWGN channel. The performance is evaluated analytically. The multi-rate generalization and the asynchronous extension are discussed. Two-stage space-time dual-rate blind detectors are also presented. Furthermore, blind adaptive channel estimation and detection schemes for asynchronous dual-rate systems over frequency-selective multipath channels are developed. In the context of multicarrier DS/CDMA, based on a finite-length truncation approximation on the band-limited chip waveform, <b>blind</b> timing <b>acquisition</b> and channel estimation scheme is proposed for multi-rate systems. The channel estimation error due to the finite-length chip waveform truncation is analyzed by exploiting a first-order perturbation approximation...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall results}} of this {{laboratory}} evaluation are quite encouraging. The gyro data is in good agreement with the system's overall pointing performance, which is quite close to the technical objectives for the Deep Space Network (DSN) application. The system can be calibrated to the levels required for millidegree levels of pointing performance, and initialization performance is within the required 0. 001 degree objective. The <b>blind</b> target <b>acquisition</b> performance is within a factor {{of two of the}} 0. 0001 degree objective, limited only by a combination of the slow rate (0. 5 deg/sec) and the existing production quantization logic (0. 38 arc-sec/pulse). Logic circuitry exists to better this performance such that it will better the objective by 50 percent. Representative data with this circuitry has been provided for illustration. Target tracking performance is about twice the one millidegree objective, with several factors contributing. The first factor is the bias stability of the gyros, which is exceptional, but will limit performance to the 0. 001 and 0. 002 degree range for long tracking periods. The second contributing factor is the accelerometer contributions when the system is elevated. These degrade performance into the 0. 003 to 0. 004 degree range, which could be improved upon with some additional changes. Finally, we have provided a set of recommendations to improve performance closer to the technical objectives. These recommendations include gyro, electronics, and system configurational changes that form the basis for additional work to achieve the desired performance. In conclusion, we believe that the RL- 34 ring laser gyro-based advanced navigation system demonstrated performance consistent with expectations and technical objectives, and it has the potential for even further enhancement for the DSN application...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) is {{targeted}} at identifying sensitive biomarkers and {{risk factors of}} symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA) onset and progression. Quantitative cartilage imaging in the OAI relies on validated fast low angle shot (FLASH) sequences that suffer from relatively long acquisition times, and on a near-isotropic double echo steady-state (DESS) sequence. We therefore directly compared the sensitivity to cartilage thickness changes and the correlation of these protocols longitudinally. MethodsBaseline (BL) and 12 month follow-up data of 80 knees were acquired using 1. 5 mm coronal FLASH and 0. 7 mm sagittal DESS (sagDESS) sequences. In these and in 1. 5 mm coronal multi-planar reconstructions (MPR) of the DESS the medial femorotibial cartilage was segmented with <b>blinding</b> to <b>acquisition</b> order. In the weight-bearing femoral condyle, a 60 % (distance between the trochlear notch and the posterior femur) and a 75 % region of interest (ROI) were studied. ResultsThe standardized response mean (SRM=mean change/standard deviation of change) in central medial femorotibial (cMFTC) cartilage thickness was − 0. 34 for coronal FLASH, − 0. 37 for coronal MPR DESS, − 0. 36 for sagDESS with the 60 % ROI, and − 0. 38 for the 75 % ROI. Using every second 0. 7 mm sagittal slice (DESS) yielded similar SRMs in cMFTC for the 60 % and 75 % ROI from odd (− 0. 35 /− 0. 36) and even slice numbers (− 0. 36 /− 0. 39), respectively. BL cartilage thickness displayed high correlations (r≥ 0. 94) between the three protocols; the correlations of longitudinal changes were ≥ 0. 79 (Pearson) and ≥ 0. 45 (Spearman). ConclusionsCartilage morphometry with FLASH and DESS displays similar longitudinal sensitivity to change.

40|$|Objective. Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament (ACL) rupture involves {{an increased risk}} of osteoarthritis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore changes in cartilage thickness over 5 years after ACL rupture. Methods. A total of 121 young active adults (ages 18 - 35 years; 26 % women) from the Knee ACL, Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment (KANON) study, who had acute traumatic rupture of the ACL were studied. Sagittal magnetic resonance images were acquired within 4 weeks of ACL rupture (baseline) and at the 2 -year and 5 -year followup assessments. Medial and lateral femorotibial cartilage was segmented (with <b>blinding</b> to <b>acquisition</b> order), and the mean cartilage thickness was computed across 16 femorotibial subregions. Total femorotibial cartilage thickness change was the primary analytic focus. Maximal subregional mean cartilage thickness loss (ordered value 1 [OV 1]) and gain (ordered value 16 [OV 16]), independent of its specific location in individual knees, were the secondary analytic focus. Results. Overall femorotibial cartilage thickness increased by 31 mu m/year over 5 years (95 % confidence interval 18, 44). The increase was similar in men and women and was significantly greater in those younger, as compared with those older, than the median age (25. 3 years). The rate of total cartilage thickness change did not differ significantly between the first 2 years and the later 3 years. However, the maximal annualized subregional cartilage loss (OV 1) and gain (OV 16) were both significantly greater (P < 0. 001 and P < 0. 05, respectively) during the earlier interval than during the later interval (- 115 versus - 54 mu m [OV 1] and 116 versus 69 mu m [OV 16]). Conclusion. Cartilage thickening was observed over 5 years following ACL injury, particularly in the medial femorotibial compartment and in younger subjects. Major perturbations in cartilage homeostasis were seen over the first 2 years after ACL rupture, with simultaneous subregional thinning and thickening occurring within the same cartilage plate or compartment...|$|R

MethodsBy using a single cadaver, 14 different whole-body low-dose CT protocols were individually assessed by 2 radiologists, <b>blinded</b> to <b>acquisition</b> parameters (kVp and mAs, reconstruction algorithm, dose reduction software). Combinations of kVps that range from 80 - 140 kVp, and tube current time product from 14 – 125 mAs were individually scored by using a Likert scale from 1 – 5 in 4 separate anatomical areas (skull base, thoracic spine, pelvis, and distal femora). Correlation between readers scores and effective doses were obtained by using correlation coefficient statistical analysis, statistical significance was considered P <. 01. Interobserver agreement was assessed by using a Bland and Altman plot. Interobserver agreement in each of the 4 anatomical areas was assessed by using kappa statistics. A single set of parameters was then selected for use in future clinical trials in a cohort of patients referred for investigation of monoclonal gammopathy, including multiple myeloma. ResultsSeveral sets of exposure parameters allowed low-dose whole-body CT to be performed with effective doses similar to skeletal survey while preserving diagnostic image quality. Individual reader's and average combined scores showed a strong inverse correlation with effective dose (reader 1, r = – 0. 78, P =. 0001; reader 2, r = – 0. 75, P =. 0003); average combined scores r = – 0. 81, P <. 0001). Bland and Altman plot of overall scores shows reasonable interobserver agreement, with a mean difference of 1. 055. ConclusionWhole-body low-dose CT can be used to obtain adequate CT image quality to assess normal osseous detail while delivering effective doses similar to those associated with conventional radiographic skeletal survey...|$|R
40|$|Diffusion MRI tractography {{has emerged}} as a useful and popular tool for mapping {{connections}} between brain regions. In this study, we examined the performance of quantitative anisotropy (QA) in facilitating deterministic fiber tracking. Two phantom studies were conducted. The first phantom study examined the susceptibility of fractional anisotropy (FA), generalized factional anisotropy (GFA), and QA to various partial volume effects. The second phantom study examined the spatial resolution of the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and QA-aided tractographies. An in vivo study was conducted to track the arcuate fasciculus, and two neurosurgeons <b>blind</b> to the <b>acquisition</b> and analysis settings were invited to identify false tracks. The performance of QA in assisting fiber tracking was compared with FA, GFA, and anatomical information from T 1 -weighted images. Our first phantom study showed that QA is less sensitive to the partial volume effects of crossing fibers and free water, suggesting that it is a robust index. The second phantom study showed that the QA-aided tractography has better resolution than the FA-aided and GFA-aided tractography. Our in vivo study further showed that the QA-aided tractography outperforms the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies. In the shell scheme (HARDI), the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 30. 7 %, 32. 6 %, and 24. 45 % of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided tractography has 16. 2 %. In the grid scheme (DSI), the FA-aided, GFA-aided, and anatomy-aided tractographies have 12. 3 %, 9. 0 %, and 10. 93 % of the false tracks, respectively, while the QA-aided tractography has 4. 43 %.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} „Making another world visible. Medial representation, strategies and {{communication in the}} World Social Forum Process” comprises {{the analysis of the}} process in terms of social movement theory and in terms of its public impact. In order to understand the course of the “cycle of contention”, it has also to be asked how is the declining media interest connected to the internal debates about the orientation of the WSF Process? As in so far as the WSF Process aims at helping the creation of a “global civil society”, also the shape of the public which is to be addressed plays a significant role: does a “transnational public sphere” already exist, which it can address? The classification of the WSF Process – often also termed as “movement of movements” - is not only challenging because {{of the structure of the}} WSF as a transnational process and more and more developing into a network of networks, but also because of the blind spots in social movement theory concerning social movements of the global south. In order to measure the impact of the WSF Process on the (mediated) public sphere, the shifts in the media sector have to be taken into consideration. Here, the commodification of information and the “paradigm of the privatization of public goods” have led to a loss in the quality of journalism and different forms of censorship. The perspective of the global south is getting even more out of focus and the “New World Information and Communication Order” in the interest of the newly founded states after their independence in the 1960 s and 1970 s could not be put into effect going against the interests of the USA and Europe. In this situation many media activists saw the internet as the solution: the internet technology should cause the re-democratization of the public sphere and level the relationship of sender and receiver. The technological utopianism – which was also in effect at the introduction of the modern media – caused many enthusiasts for cyberspace to be <b>blind</b> to the <b>acquisition</b> of the internet by neoliberal strategists and the social disruption into information poor and rich. So it has to be asked what are the preferred media of a WSF Process which has its basis in the global south and mostly in rural areas there? A media analysis of the WSF 2007 in Kenya showed that the reports deviated strongly locally in the mainstream media and it also showed that the media interest had decreased significantly as compared to the first years of the WSF. This is one of the causes for the strategy debate inside the WSF Process which is also investigated in this dissertation. At stake is the definition of the WSF as “space” or “actor” and with it scrutinizing the “hegemony competence” of it. Effected also by the reflection on the orientation and the agency of the WSF Process was an enhanced interest in communication rights and media work. This could not stop the ebbing of mainstream media interest but the buildup of alternative – often locally orientated – media allowed the WSF Process to be represented adequately and also reaches the basis of social movements active in the WSF. In some Latin American countries communication rights campaigns, springing from the WSF Process, have attained to legislation changes with the intention of de-commercializing the media sector. The Forum of Free Media established itself as an independent network within the WSF Process. Participant observations as the third method of this study leads to the conclusion that the right to communication and the condition of the public sphere and the media sector are important themes for post-socialist, horizontal movements if they want to be successful...|$|R
