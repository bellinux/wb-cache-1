An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: [...] "I understand they're afraid of everything, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> annoying.

60|$|From this curious comparison, {{it becomes}} {{apparent}} that the variations {{of the difference in}} question depend upon the amount of variations of temperature which take place in the free air, and on the slowness with which such changes are communicated to the stagnant atmosphere of woods; in other words, as Herr Rivoli boldly formulates it, a forest is simply a bad conductor. But this is precisely the same conclusion as we have already arrived at with regard to individual trees; and in Herr Rivoli's table, what we see is just another case of what we saw in M. Becquerel's--the different progression of temperatures. It must be obvious, however, that the thermal condition of a single tree must be different in many ways from that of a combination of trees and more or less stagnant air, such as we call a forest. And accordingly we find, {{in the case of the}} latter, the following new feature: The mean yearly temperature of woods is lower than the mean yearly temperature of free air, while they are decidedly colder in summer, and very little, if at all, warmer in winter. Hence, on the whole, forests are colder than cleared lands. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what might have been expected from the amount of evaporation, the continued descent of cold air, and its stagnation in the close and sunless crypt of a forest; and one can only wonder here, as elsewhere, that the resultant difference is so insignificant and doubtful.|$|E
60|$|How, then, {{shall we}} get rid of the foul air {{at the top of the}} room? After all that has been written and tried on ventilation, I know no simpler method than putting into the chimney one of Arnott's {{ventilators}}, which may be bought and fixed for a few shillings; always remembering that it must be fixed into the chimney as near the ceiling as possible. I can speak of these ventilators from twenty-five years' experience. Living in a house with low ceilings, liable to become overcharged with carbonic acid, which produces sleepiness in the evening, I have found that these ventilators keep the air fresh and pure; and I consider the presence of one of these ventilators in a room more valuable than three or four feet additional height of ceiling. I have found, too, that their working proves how necessary they are, from this simple fact:--You would suppose that, as the ventilator opens freely into the chimney, the smoke would be blown down through it in high winds, and blacken the ceiling: <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what does not happen. If the ventilator be at all properly poised, so as to shut with a violent gust of wind, it will at all other moments keep itself permanently open; proving thereby that there is an up-draught of heated air continually escaping from the ceiling up the chimney. Another very simple method of ventilation is employed in those excellent cottages which Her Majesty has built for her labourers round Windsor. Over each door a sheet of perforated zinc, some 18 inches square, is fixed; allowing the foul air to escape into the passage; and in the ceiling of the passage a similar sheet of zinc, allowing it to escape into the roof. Fresh air, meanwhile, should be obtained from outside, by piercing the windows, or otherwise. And here let me give one hint to all builders of houses. If possible, let bedroom windows open at the top as well as at the bottom.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Spiers {{tried to}} get us {{admittance}} to the Bodleian Library; <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the moment when it is closed {{for the purpose of}} being cleaned; so we missed seeing the principal halls of this library, and were only admitted into what was called the Picture Gallery. This, however, satisfied all my desires, so far as the backs of books are concerned, for they extend through a gallery, running round three sides of a quadrangle, making an aggregate length of more than four hundred feet,--a solid array of bookcases, full of books, within a protection of open iron-work. Up and down the gallery there are models of classic temples; and about midway in its extent stands a brass statue of Earl Pembroke, who was Chancellor of the University in James I's time; not in scholarly garb, however, but in plate and mail, looking indeed like a thunderbolt of war. I rapped him with my knuckles, and he seemed to be solid metal, though, I should imagine, hollow at heart. A thing which interested me very much was the lantern of Guy Fawkes. It was once tinned, no doubt, but is now nothing but rusty iron, partly broken. As this is called the Picture Gallery, I must not forget the pictures, which are ranged in long succession over the bookcases, and include almost all Englishmen whom the world has ever heard of, whether in statesmanship or literature, I saw a canvas on which had once been a lovely and unique portrait of Mary of Scotland; but it was consigned to a picture-cleaner to be cleansed, and, discovering that it was painted over another picture, he had the curiosity to clean poor Mary quite away, thus revealing a wishy-washy woman's face, which now hangs in the gallery. I am so tired of seeing notable things that I almost wish that whatever else is remarkable in Oxford could he obliterated in some similar manner.|$|E

6000|$|The {{recognition}} and the tribute {{to my father}} were so graciously given that I warmed with gratitude and pride, while Mr. Kyme smiled a little, remarking that I {{was a friend of}} Jerry's. Theodore Watling, for being here, had suddenly assumed in my eyes a considerable consequence, though the note he struck in that house was a strange one. It was, however, his own note, and had a certain distinction, a ring of independence, of the knowledge of self-worth. Dinner at Weathersfield we youngsters had usually found rather an oppressive ceremony, with its shaded lights and precise ritual over which Mr. Kyme presided like a high priest; conversation had been restrained. That night, as Johnnie Laurens afterwards expressed it, [...] "things loosened up," [...] and Mr. Watling was responsible for the loosening. Taking command of the Kyme dinner table appeared to me to be no mean achievement, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what he did, without being vulgar or noisy or assertive. Suavitar in modo, forbiter in re. If, as I watched him there with a newborn pride and loyalty, I had paused to reconstruct the idea that the mention of his name would formerly have evoked, I suppose I should have found him falling short of my notion of a gentleman; it had been my father's opinion; but Mr. Watling's marriage to Gene Hollister's aunt had given him a standing with us at home. He possessed virility, vitality in a remarkable degree, yet some elusive quality that was neither tact nor delicacy--though related to these differentiated him from the commonplace, self-made man of ability. He was just off the type. To liken him to a clothing store model of a well-built, broad-shouldered man with a firm neck, a handsome, rather square face not lacking in colour and a conventional, drooping moustache would be slanderous; yet he did suggest it. Suggesting it, he redeemed it: and the middle western burr in his voice was rather attractive than otherwise. He had not so much the air of belonging there, as of belonging anywhere--one of those anomalistic American citizens of the world who go abroad and make intimates of princes. Before the meal was over he had inspired me with loyalty and pride, enlisted the admiration of Jerry and Conybear and Johnnie Laurens; we followed him into the smoking-room, sitting down in a row on a leather lounge behind our elders.|$|E
6000|$|And {{there is}} no other light. If a man does not work trusting in Christ, whom God has set for the light of the world, he works in the night, where God never set or meant him to work; and stumble he will, and make a fool of himself, sooner or later, because he is walking in the night, and sees nothing plainly or in a right view. For as our Lord says truly, [...] "There is no light in him." [...] No light in him? In one sense {{there is no}} light in any one, be he the wisest or holiest man who ever lived. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what three people out of four will not believe. They will not believe that the Spirit of God gives man understanding. They fancy that they have light in themselves. They try, conceitedly and godlessly, to walk by the light of their own eyes--to make their own way plain before their face for themselves. They will not believe old David, a man who worked, and fought, and thought, and saw, far more than any one of us will ever do, when he tells them again and again in his Psalms, that the Lord is his light, that the Lord must guide a man, and inform him with His eye, and teach him {{in the way in which}} he should go. And, therefore, they will not pray to God for light--therefore they will not look for light in God's Word, and in the {{writings}} of godly men; and they are like a man in the broad sunshine, who should choose to shut his eyes close, and say, 'I have light enough in my own head to do without the sun;' and therefore they walk on still in darkness, and all the foundations of the earth are out of course, because men forget the first universal ground rules of common sense, and reason, and love, which God's Spirit teaches. I tell you, all the mistakes that you ever made--that ever were made since Adam fell, came from this, that men will not ask God for light and wisdom; they love darkness rather than light, and therefore, though God's light is ready for every man, shining in the darkness to shew every man his way, yet the darkness will not comprehend it--will not take it in, and let God change its blindness into day.|$|E
6000|$|I grant {{then that}} I am often tempted to conceive, as I read your [...] letters, that we differ only in your terms being more abstract, [...] mine more concrete; and yet I really don't think this {{difference}} is [...] exhaustive. If I thought Philosophy capable ever of being reduced [...] to logical compass or realising itself as science, I should give in [...] at once. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what I cannot think. Philosophy is the [...] doctrine exclusively of the infinite in the finite, and deals with [...] the latter therefore only as a mask, only as harbouring the [...] former. But if you formulate it scientifically your terms are [...] necessarily all finite, as furnished by experience, and the [...] infinite is excluded or at most creeps in as the [...] indefinite--Hegel's becoming for example. Thus Hegel's dialectic [...] modulates only {{in the sphere of}} his distance. His being is [...] universal existence, and, as universals have only a logical truth, [...] being in se is equivalent to Nothing. But Nothing hasn't even a [...] logical basis. Lithe as human thought is it can't compass the [...] conception. It is a mere brutum fulmen devised to disguise the [...] absence of thought or its inanition; and Hegel, if he had been [...] wise, would have said no-thought instead of no-thing. For no-thing [...] doesn't express the complete absence of existence. Existence is of [...] two sorts, real and personal, sensible and conscious, quantitative [...] and qualitative. The most you are entitled to say therefore when [...] existence disappears in quantitative, real or sensible, form is [...] that it has been taken up into purely qualitative, personal or [...] conscious form; no-thing being the logical equivalent of [...] all-person. Thus I, who in Hegel's formula presumably extract [...] existence from being, survive the operation as person, and though I [...] am most clearly no-thing I am yet not being. Indeed I am not even [...] existence any longer, since by knocking thing out of being I have [...] forfeited my own reality, and consent henceforth to be pure [...] personality, i.e. phenomenality. And personal or phenomenal [...] existence is constituted by referring itself to a foreign source, [...] or, what is the same thing, confessing itself created: so that the [...] fundamental word of Philosophy, by Hegel's own formula, is [...] creation; which, however, as I understand him, he denies in any [...] objective sense of the word. This then is what I complain of in [...] him--with deference of course to your better knowledge, which, [...] however, you do not urge as yet in what seems to me a silencing [...] way--that he makes existence essential to being, so that take [...] existence away and being becomes nothing. It would not be a whit [...] less preposterous in me to say that thought is essential to thing, [...] subject to object, marble to statue, canvas to picture, woman to [...] wife, mother to child. It is literally putting the cart before the [...] horse and converting Philosophy to a practical quagmire. Being [...] implies existence of course just as picture implies canvas, or as [...] personality implies reality, or as chick implies egg; but it [...] implies it only to a lower intelligence than itself, an unspiritual [...] intelligence to wit, which has no direct or inward intuition of [...] being, and requires to be agitated to discerning it. When I [...] recognise the spiritual life of Art I never think of marble or [...] canvas as entering even conditionally into its manifestations.|$|E
