60|$|Yesterday {{evening at}} half after six a {{pleasant}} little diner {{was given by}} Madame McFiggin of Rock Street, to her boarders. The salle a manger was very prettily decorated with texts, and the furniture upholstered with cheveux de horse, Louis Quinze. The boarders were all very quietly dressed: Mrs. McFiggin was daintily attired in some old clinging stuff with a corsage de Whalebone underneath. The ample board groaned under the bill of fare. The boarders groaned also. Their groaning was very noticeable. The piece de resistance was a hunko de boeuf <b>boile,</b> flanked with some old clinging stuff. The entrees were pate de pumpkin, followed by fromage McFiggin, served under glass. Towards {{the end of the}} first course, speeches became the order of the day. Mrs. McFiggin was the first speaker. In commencing, she expressed her surprise that so few of the gentlemen seemed to care for the hunko de boeuf; her own mind, she said, had hesitated between hunko de boeuf <b>boile</b> and a pair of roast chickens (sensation). She had finally decided in favour of the hunko de boeuf (no sensation). She referred at some length to the late Mr. McFiggin, who had always shown a marked preference for hunko de boeuf. Several other speakers followed. All spoke forcibly and to the point. The last to speak was the Reverend Mr. Whiner. The reverend gentleman, in rising, said that he confided himself and his fellow-boarders to the special interference of providence. For what they had eaten, he said, he hoped that Providence would make them truly thankful. At the close of the Repas several of the boarders expressed their intention of going down the street to a restourong to get quelque chose a manger.|$|E

5000|$|Sociofact {{is a term}} {{coined by}} Sir Julian Sorell Huxley, used {{together}} with the related terms [...] "mentifact" [...] (sometimes called a psychofact) and [...] "artifact" [...] to describe how cultural traits take {{on a life of}} their own, spanning over generations. This idea has been related to memetics. The idea of the sociofact was developed extensively by David Bidney in his textbook Theoretical Anthropology. Bidney used the term to refer to objects which consist of interactions between members of a social group. [...] The concept has been used by philosophers and social scientists in their analyses of varying kinds of social groups. For instance, semiotician of music Charles <b>Boilès,</b> in a discussion of the semiotics of the tune [...] "Taps", claims that although it is a single piece of music, it can be seen as three distinct musical sociofacts: as a [...] "last call" [...] signal in taverns frequented by soldiers, as an [...] "end of day" [...] signal on military bases, and hence symbolically as a component of military funerals. The claim has been made that sociofactual analysis can play a decisive role for the performance of, and collaboration within, organizations.|$|R
5000|$|A {{first attempt}} to join the two {{distinct}} disciplines of Musicology and Archaeology {{took place at the}} conference of the International Musicological Society at Berkeley in 1977. One of the round tables was designated [...] "Music and Archaeology", to which were invited specialists to discuss the musical remains of ancient cultures - Bathia Bayer (Israel), Charles <b>Boilès</b> (Mexico), Ellen Hickmann (Egypt), David Liang (China), Casja Lund (Scandinavia). The main stimulus for this was the sensational discovery of an ancient Mesopotamian musical system by Anne D. Kilmer, assyriologist in Berkeley. On the basis of this she was able to advance a decipherment and transcription into Western notation of a late Bronze Age hymn in the Hurrian language, excavated from Ugarit, which contained notation based on the Mesopotamian system. With the help of musicologist Richard L. Crocker (Berkeley) and instrument maker Robert Brown, a replica of a Sumerian lyre was made, and Kilmer's version of the Hurrian hymn was recorded, accompanied by a carefully prepared commentary, as Kilmer/Crocker/Brown, Sounds from Silence, Recent Discoveries in Ancient Eastern Music (LP with information booklet, Bit Enki Publications, Berkeley, 1976). At the round table in Berkeley, Kilmer explained their method of reconstruction and demonstrated the resulting sound. This was the starting point of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology, officially founded within the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) in Seoul/Korea in 1981, and recognized by the ICTM in New York in 1983 following its first meeting on current music-archaeological research in Cambridge/UK in 1982.|$|R

The product was dried from an initial moisture content of 62 % (w. b) to 11. 9 % (w. b) with hourly moisture loss and drying rate values measured and calculated. A factorial experiment in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) involving three levels of temperature (50, 60 and 70 0 C); three levels of pretreatment (blanching, boiling and control), and two levels of slice orientation (round and flat) were used. The results were statistically analysed using SPSS 16. 0 and Duncan‟s New Multiple Range Tests (DNMRT) to determine the level of significance among the treatment factors. Drying occurred in two phases of the falling rate period. Drying rate increased with increase in temperature for all the samples. Control and blanched round slices had the highest drying rate of 8. 76 g/hr at 70 0 C. The interaction between slice orientation―temperature was significant on the drying rate. The protein, fat and fibre content decreased with increase in temperature but the ash content increased with increase in temperature. Control flat slices had the highest protein and fibre contents of 4. 33 % and 1. 29 % respectively at 50 0 C. <b>Boile...</b>|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of a micro-cogeneration system for residential use based on a 1 kWe proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell. A detailed system analysis of the fuel cell stack operating at an average temperature of 62 C and the surrounding balance-of-plant (BoP) are taken into account. The gas processing section and the heat recovery system were also designed and optimized in term of heat recovery. Low-grade waste heat, mainly recovered from the PEM stack and the burner exhaust, has been found suitable for feeding a low-temperature thermal user such a radiant floor heating system (operating at ∼ 35 - 45 C). According to this configuration, the heat-exchanger network has been optimized following the pinch analysis methodology, and the floor heating system has been sized accordingly. The micro-cogeneration system has been modelled in term of mass and energy balances while efficiency maps were obtained for a varying fuel utilization and current density of the stack. The maximum electrical efficiency achieved is around 36 % (AC, LHV), with a stack current of 30 A and a Fuel Utilization (FU) of 80 %. The global efficiency (that includes also heat recovery toward the thermal utility) is above 75 % for same stack operating conditions. From the floor heating system sizing, the considered micro-CHP PEM system is able to supply around 22. 4 % of the heat demand by a 50 m 2 medium-low efficiency building (class E - EU classification) during the winter season. Nevertheless, taking into account a high efficiency building (class A++ - EU classification), the heat released by the PEM plant can supply the overall required thermal load without requiring an auxiliary <b>boile...</b>|$|E
40|$|Power {{producing}} {{companies have}} faced {{a new situation}} following the development of unregulated electricity markets. Strong competition forces them to take power production costs into account more carefully {{in order to maintain}} or increase profits. Additionally, to promote the efforts to reduce CO 2 emissions,legislation and taxation drives operators to increase the use of coal and renewable energy sources more efficiently and over a wider range. This results in an increasing interest in the use of solid-biomass-based fuels in pulverized coal fired power plants. Therefore, fuel flexibility due to the combustion of varying relative shares of coal and biomass poses new challenges for plant operators. The understanding of deposition formation and its behavior and consequences has become a key issue in optimizing plant operation and in securing plant performance and availability. The investigation presented in this dissertation was carried out as part of the EU-ADMONI project. The overall objective of the work presented here is the development of advanced monitoring models for solid fuel fired steam power plants. To obtain such advanced monitoring methods, three kinds of models are to be coupled with each other. They are: Process Monitoring Models, Dynamic Process Models and 3 D Boiler Models. This coupling consists of the exchange of different boundary conditions (BCs) with each other. Although the development of an overall monitoring methodology has been outside the scope of this work, this dissertation contains descriptions and examples of the three separate modelling techniques needed to obtain the overall monitoring methodology which can be used for improving the operation of steam power plants. Process monitoring models have been developed to predict or monitor either heat transfer resistances of the heat exchanging equipment of the steam cycle (this is an indicator of the amount of deposit formation) or the overall steam cycle efficiency of the power plant at hand, using the process data provided by the Data Acquisition System (DAS) of the plant. The novelty of the models presented in this work is the investigation of the possible use of exergy analysis within the existing monitoring models to detect a possible decay of plant performance due to arising operational problems. Dynamic process models of the steam cycle have been developed to provide insight in the physics and plant behavior when (co) -firing varying biomass and coal blends. The results of these models can be very important for the design of the control system of plants which are co-firing these kinds of mixtures. Physically based models have been formulated, since no historical data is available in the design phase, and thus black box models were not an option. A methodology for the dynamic modelling of energy conversion systems has been proposed, and the modelling of a simple single pressure, small, steam power cycle, has been done as a "proof-of-concept". An accurate methodology for the simulation of 3 D pf combustion has been developed to accurately predict the flow and temperature fields inside the boiler. To be able to accurately predict these phenomena, detailed combustion models are necessary. Various combustion models for solid fuel combustion have been proposed in literature, but an extensive validation of these models is hardly given. Therefore, several combustion models have been validated against experimental data and the most accurate model has been used for full scale 3 D <b>boile...</b>|$|E
