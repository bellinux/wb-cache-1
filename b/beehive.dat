40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of Apis mellifera <b>beehives</b> submitted or unsubmitted to an energetic-protein supplementation. The experiment was realized from May to December 2003, in an apiary in Ituporanga (SC). The <b>beehives</b> were randomly distributed in the experimental area. The energetic-protein supplementation consisted of the syrup of reversed sugar plus a vitamin-protein called L Promoter® and it was applied to five beehives; five other <b>beehives</b> did not receive the supplementation. Data on the number of eggs, larva, pupae, pollen and honey area were evaluated. Significant differences were observed between the treatments for each parameter analyzed. <b>Beehives</b> with the energetic-protein supplementation presented higher values for eggs, larva and pupae when there was little food available in the environment. <b>Beehives</b> with no supplementation presented an increase in pollen area starting in June, while the supplied <b>beehives</b> presented a greater pollen storage when the period of available pollen in nature was decreased and the climatic conditions were not favorable for the harvesting and development of <b>beehives.</b> The energetic-protein supplementation improved the storage of food by the bees, but did not bring forward the development of their <b>beehives...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>beehives</b> were dated by {{carbon-14}} {{radiocarbon dating}} at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, using organic material (wheat found {{next to the}} <b>beehives).</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{third floor}} is a single, unparitioned room that was likely used for storage. The cellar of the jail has a chimney {{on the west}} that has several ovens, {{including}} a <b>beehive</b> oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a <b>beehive</b> metal {{sculpture}} by Thompson Dagnall in Hyde, Greater Manchester, was {{criticized by the}} council for installment adjacent to the children’s play area in Hyde park for looking too rude and phallic. Although Dagnall was paid £3,500 a week for his efforts, council workers modified the structure by stumping it and moved it {{to another part of}} the park.|$|E
5|$|In the {{six years}} leading up to 2013, more than 10 million {{beehives}} were lost, often to CCD, nearly twice the normal rate of loss. To put this in perspective, according to U.N. FAO data, the world's <b>beehive</b> stock rose from around 50 million in 1961 to around 83 million in 2014, which is about 1.3% average annual growth. Average annual growth has accelerated to 1.9% since 2009.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the <b>Beehives</b> {{relocated}} from Weston to Etobicoke and dropped [...] "Toronto" [...] from their name. On April 3, 2011, the Dixie <b>Beehives</b> officially ceased operations.|$|R

30|$|There is an {{increasing}} trend {{in the production of}} honey from modern <b>beehives.</b> Modern <b>beehives</b> and honey extracting technology are mostly supplied by government agencies and non-governmental organizations (e.g., ARDO, REST-local NGO which stands for Relief Society of Tigray, World Vision, the Ethiopian Orthodox and the Catholic Church). For example, in 2008 the Regional Agricultural and Rural Development Office (ARDO) provided 26, 676 units of modern <b>beehives</b> to smallholders in Tigray.|$|R
5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark <b>beehive.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{returned}} to Salt Lake City in 1870 {{and became a}} professor of German. However, he resigned from this position {{to return to the}} Twentieth Ward Seminary. In 1870, he also taught at the University of Deseret, helping to develop their teacher training program. Maeser wrote articles in the <b>Beehive</b> Series of the Juvenile Instructor during 1870. In 1871, he was elected the president of the Salt Lake Teacher's Association. For {{a short period of time}} he was also an assistant organist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.|$|E

There she joined in services at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and was feted at a <b>Beehive</b> House reception, attended by many expatriate Native Hawaiians. In 1906, she was baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by Elder Abraham Kaleimahoe Fernandez. However, her interest in Mormonism later waned.|$|E

However, four years later, he complains about not having received any income from the monastery: the Abbot gave, as an excuse that the <b>beehives</b> had been destroyed. The monks were also renowned for concocting medicine from various herbs.|$|R

5|$|Although he {{had little}} {{interest}} in formal education and rarely attended classes, Sylvester was enrolled at Jordan High School. He graduated in 1969 at the age of 21; in his graduation photograph, he appeared in drag wearing a blue chiffon prom dress and <b>beehive</b> hairstyle. By the end of the decade, the Disquotays had begun to drift apart, with a number of them abandoning cross-dressing and others recognizing that they were trans women and undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Sylvester always considered himself male and began to tone down the feminine nature of his clothing, aiming for a more androgynous look which combined male and female styles and which was influenced by the fashions of the hippie movement.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a <b>beehive</b> and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Marge's {{distinctive}} blue <b>beehive</b> hairstyle {{was inspired}} by a combination of the Bride's in Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore in the 1960s. Julie Kavner, {{who was a member of}} the original cast of The Tracey Ullman Show, was asked to voice Marge so that more voice actors would not be needed. Kavner has won several awards for voicing Marge, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992. She was also nominated for an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in an Animated Feature for her performance in The Simpsons Movie. In 2000, Marge, along with the rest of her family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Professor Johannes Krahn, {{who built}} several churches and early skyscrapers {{such as the}} <b>Beehive</b> House in Frankfurt am Main, {{designed}} a space recalling elements of an early Romanesque Basilica. In a simple shape, a single long nave is concluded by a semicircle choir around the altar. On the right side the wall opens to a side chapel, reminiscent of a transept. The outer walls are sandstone, visible both inside and outside. Light flows in from a band of windows under the plain wooden ceiling. The combination of materials {{has been compared to}} Le Corbusier. The building recalls the austere style of sacred architecture of the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a <b>beehive,</b> and even livestock. Flowers, used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. Flowers common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' flowers such as primroses and violets, along with flowers with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple flowers like daisies. In time, cottage-garden sections were added to some large estate gardens as well.|$|E

5|$|At street level, three arched entranceways line Broad Street. The central arch is {{slightly}} larger than the others to indicate {{the entrance to the}} main banking hall. Carved into the facade above the center arch is the building's name. Inside the arches and above the doorways are windows designed by d'Ascenzo Studios. Leaded panes of glass of various shades of amber are surrounded by a Renaissance-style border. Below the windows are bronze doors, each with 24 high-relief panels depicting the history of commerce and civilization. Bas-relief figures decorate each of the arches' spandrels. A male figure with a hammer representing industry and a female figure with a <b>beehive</b> representing thrift decorate the center arch. The arch closest to Sansom Street is decorated by two figures with cornucopias to represent abundance. The arch nearer to Walnut Street is decorated by a painter and a sculptor to represent art.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Bart {{set out for}} help, {{unaware that}} Maggie is tagging along, while Marge and Lisa stay behind. Separated from Homer and Bart, Maggie is soon adopted by a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart plummet into a raging river where they lose their clothes, but hide their nakedness with leaves and mud. Marge and Lisa make {{themselves}} comfortable by a campfire, while the boys freeze in the wilderness. The next day, Homer tries to steal honey from a <b>beehive,</b> only to be attacked by the bees, but evades them by jumping into a mud pit. A nature photographer takes a picture of Homer covered in mud, mistaking him for Bigfoot, and soon the forest is inundated with Bigfoot enthusiasts and reward seekers.|$|E
5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a <b>beehive</b> can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E
