40|$|In {{the honey}} bee, {{hygienic}} behaviour, {{the removal of}} dead or diseased brood from capped cells by workers, is a heritable trait that confers colony-level resistance against <b>brood</b> <b>diseases.</b> This behaviour is quite rare. Only c. 10 % of unselected colonies show high levels of hygiene. Previous studies suggested that hygiene might be rare because it also results in the removal of healthy brood, thereby imposing an ongoing cost even when <b>brood</b> <b>diseases</b> are absent. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying hygienic behaviour in 10 colonies using a standard technique, the freeze-killed brood (FKB) bioassay. At the same time, we also quantified the removal of untreated brood. The study colonies showed a wide range in hygienic behaviour, removing 19. 7 – 100 % of the FKB.

However, there was no correlation between the two removal rates {{for any of the}} four age groups of untreated brood studied (eggs, young larvae, older larvae from uncapped cells and larvae/pupae from capped cells).

For MLST, seven housekeeping gene loci, ilvD (dihydroxy-acid dyhydrogenase), tri (triosephosphate isomerase), purH (phospharibosyl-aminoimidazolecarboxamide), recF (DNA replication and repair protein), pyrE (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase), sucC (succinyl coenzyme A synthetase β subunit) and glpF (glycerol uptake facilitator protein) were studied and applied for primer designs. Previously, ERIC type DNA fingerprinting was applied to these same isolates and the data showed that almost all represented the ERIC I type, whereas using BOX-PCR gave an indication of more diversity.

Recently, several non-ribosomally produced peptides (NRP) and peptide/polyketide (NRP/PK) hybrids produced by P. larvae were identified.

However, we could neither demonstrate cytotoxicity of paenilarvins towards cultured insect cells nor towards larvae in feeding assays. Accordingly, exposure bioassays performed with larvae infected by wild-type P. larvae and a knockout mutant of P. larvae lacking production of paenilarvins did not substantiate a role for the paenilarvins as virulence factor.

Objective of our study was to measure HB of Apis mellifera unicolor colonies (N = 403) from three geographic regions (one infested and two free of V. destructor) in Madagascar. The pin-killing method was used for evaluation of the HB. Responses were measured from 3 h 30 min to 7 h after perforation of the cells. Colonies were very effective in detecting perforated cells. In the first 4 h, on average, they detected at least 50 % of the pin-killed brood. Six hours after cell perforation, colonies tested (N = 91) showed a wide range of uncapped (0 to 100 %) and cleaned cells (0 to 82 %). Global distribution of the rate of cleaned cells at 6 h was multimodal and hygienic responses could be split in three classes. Colonies from the three regions showed a significant difference in HB responses. Three hypotheses (geographic, genetic traits, presence of V. destructor) are further discussed to explain variability of HB responses among the regions. Levels of HB efficiency of A. mellifera unicolor colonies are among the greatest levels reported for A. mellifera subspecies.

Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic used in apiculture to protect bees against a variety of <b>brood</b> <b>diseases.</b> Romanian authorities have included it in the National Monitoring Program for honey manufacturers. In this study, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening test was validated as a detection method of streptomycin residues in honey. The ELISA experimental results were compared to those obtained by using an HPLC method. The values generated by the two methods were very close to each other. This fact certifies that ELISA method can be successfully used for quantitative detection {{of the amount of}} streptomycin in honey samples. Following validation, three types of honey (polyfloral, lime and acacia) were analyzed for streptomycin content after exposure to 4, 22, 30, 40 or 70 °C for 20 weeks. The results show that streptomycin mass fraction decreased with time and with the increase of temperature in all honey samples. The data collected were used to fit a second-order multiple linear regression model for predicting the degradation of streptomycin in honey samples as a function of temperature and storage period. Values of the calculated statistical indicators confirm a good predictive capability of mathematical and statistical models...|$|R

E. hive, and miller hives. All U.S. states require beekeepers to use movable frames to allow bee {{inspectors}} to check the <b>brood</b> for <b>disease.</b> This allows beekeepers to keep Langstroth, top-bar and D.E. hives without special permission, granted for purposes such as museum use. Modern hives also enable beekeepers to transport bees, moving from field to field as crops require pollinating (a source of income for beekeepers).|$|R
