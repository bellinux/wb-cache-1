In response to the trials of the conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 20, 1997 by President Clinton to allow the victims of the bombing (and the victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings.

500|$|There were {{objections}} to the system, which would apparently be too far from Manhattan, in addition to precluding development on the site. Prominent opponents included Mayor Franklin Edson, who believed that the system of parks was too big and expensive to acquire, and Assemblyman Theodore Roosevelt, who opposed the bill's being pushed through. However, newspapers and prominent lobbyists, who supported such a park system, were able to petition the bill into the New York State Senate, and later, the New York State Assembly (the legislature's lower house). In June 1884, Governor Grover Cleveland signed the bill, now {{referred to as the}} [...] "New Parks Act", as law, authorizing the creation of the park system. As part of the proposed system, Bronx Park would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the system. It was connected to Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest via Mosholu Parkway; to Pelham Bay Park in the east via Pelham Parkway; and to Crotona Park in the south via Crotona Parkway.

500|$|In 1935, swing music {{became popular}} with the public and quickly {{replaced}} jazz as the most popular type of music (although there was some resistance to it at first). Swing music {{is characterized by a}} strong rhythm section, usually consisting of a double bass and drums, playing in a medium to fast tempo, and rhythmic devices like the swung note. Swing is primarily a kind of 1930s jazz fused with elements of the blues and the pop sensibility of Tin Pan Alley. Swing used bigger bands than other kinds of jazz had and was headed by bandleaders that tightly arranged the material, discouraging the improvisation that had been an integral part of jazz. David Clarke called swing the first [...] "jazz-oriented style (to <b>be)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> popular music ... as opposed to merely giving it backbone". By the end of the 1930s, vocalists became more and more prominent, eventually taking center stage following the American Federation of Musicians strike, which made recording with a large band prohibitively expensive. Swing came to be accompanied by a popular dance called the swing dance, which was very popular across the United States, among both white and black audiences, especially youth.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} of his game, Ledonne became an unwitting spokesman for the games industry, facing the medium's opponents in debates and forums. The furor resulting from Slamgate was called out by Ledonne and others in the media as a sign that video games had not yet outgrown the traditional stereotype of children's games. Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that despite being confused and tawdry, Super Columbine Massacre [...] "symbolizes a growing understanding that videogames have more to say than 'shoot the enemies and pick up health.'" [...] Authors Andreas Jahn-Sudmann and Ralf Stockmann consider controversial video games such as Super Columbine Massacre and the Grand Theft Auto [...] "Hot coffee mod" [...] evidence of sociopolitical tensions present between gamers and older generations. The game and others like it continue to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the video games as art debate, and Gamasutra credited Super Columbine Massacre and Slamgate as having two highly positive and far-reaching effects; first, forcing print game journalism to focus on the issue; and second, the [...] "evangelization of the notion that games can be as meaningful and important as other media, even if the example is offensive to the sensibilities of most Americans [...] To win is to lose, but to play is to experience an enrichment that cannot be scored." ...|$|E

2500|$|British {{physicist}} and army captain Henry Kater in 1817 realized that Huygens' principle {{could be used}} to find the length of a simple pendulum with the same period as a real pendulum. [...] If a pendulum was built with a second adjustable pivot point near the bottom so it could be hung upside down, and the second pivot was adjusted until the periods when hung from both pivots were the same, the second pivot would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> oscillation, and the distance between the two pivots would be the length L of a simple pendulum with the same period.|$|E
2500|$|Fossil fuel companies: Traditional {{fossil fuel}} {{corporations}} could benefit or lose from stricter global warming regulations. [...] A {{reduction in the}} use of fossil fuels could negatively impact fossil fuel corporations. [...] However, the fact that fossil fuel companies are a large source of energy, are also the primary source of carbon dioxide, and are engaged in energy trading might mean that their participation in trading schemes and other such mechanisms might give them a unique advantage and makes it unclear whether traditional fossil fuel companies would all and always be against stricter global warming policies.

He moved back to New York to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the art scene and {{resigned}} from Rutgers University in 1964 to concentrate on his painting. Lichtenstein used oil and Magna (early acrylic) paint in his best known works, such as Drowning Girl (1963), which was appropriated from the lead story in DC Comics' Secret Hearts #83. (Drowning Girl now hangs in the Museum of Modern Art, New York.) Drowning Girl also features thick outlines, bold colors and Ben-Day dots, as if created by photographic reproduction. Of his own work Lichtenstein would say that the Abstract Expressionists [...] "put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{culture and}} {{intellectual}} {{output of the}} Jewish community in Poland {{had a profound impact}} on Judaism as a whole. Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as Polania or Polin in Hebrew, and as transliterated into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as [...] "good omens" [...] because Polania can be broken down into three Hebrew words: po ("here"), lan ("dwells"), ya ("God"), and Polin into two words of: po ("here") lin (" [...] dwell"). The [...] "message" [...] was that Poland was meant to be a good place for the Jews. During the time from the rule of Sigismund I the Old until the Nazi Holocaust, Poland would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi David ben Shemu’el ha-Levi (Taz) that Poland was a place where “most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel” (Divre David; 1689).|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Hu {{took charge}} of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China, which oversaw day-to-day {{operations}} of the Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CPC cadres.

2500|$|Other admirers {{included}} Jane Austen, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Sir Walter Scott, {{who used}} numerous quotes from Crabbe's poems in his novels. During Scott's final illness, Crabbe {{was the last}} writer he asked to have read to him. [...] Lord Byron admired Crabbe's poetry, and called him [...] "nature's sternest painter, yet the best". According to critic Frank Whitehead, [...] "Crabbe, in his verse tales in particular, is an important—indeed, a major—poet whose work has been and still is seriously undervalued." [...] His early poems, which were non-narrative essays in poetical form, gained him the approval of literary men like Samuel Johnson, followed by a period of 20 years in which he wrote much, destroying most of it, and published nothing. In 1807, he published his volume Poems which started off the new realistic narrative method that characterized his poetry {{for the rest of}} his career. Whitehead states that this narrative poetry, which occupies the bulk of Crabbe's output, should <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> modern critical attention.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{the spectra}} show both broad and narrow {{permitted}} lines, {{which is why}} they are classified as an intermediate type between Type Inbsp&and Typenbsp&II, such as Typenbsp&1.5 Seyfert. The spectra of some of these galaxies have changed from Typenbsp&1.5 to Typenbsp&II in {{a matter of a few}} years. However, the characteristic broad Hα emission line has rarely, if ever, disappeared. The origin of the differences between Typenbsp&I and Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies is not known yet. There are a few cases where galaxies have been identified as Typenbsp&II only because the broad components of the spectral lines have been very hard to detect. It is believed by some that all Typenbsp&II Seyferts are in fact Typenbsp&I, where the broad components of the lines are impossible to detect because of the angle we are at with respect to the galaxy. Specifically, in Typenbsp&I Seyfert galaxies, we observe the central compact source more or less directly, therefore sampling the high velocity clouds in the broad line emission region moving around the supermassive black hole thought to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the galaxy. By contrast, in Typenbsp&II Seyfert galaxies, the active nuclei are obscured and only the colder outer regions located further away from the clouds' broad line emission region are seen. This theory is known as the [...] "Unification scheme" [...] of Seyfert galaxies. However, it is not yet clear if this hypothesis can explain all the observed differences between the two types.|$|E
