A near-net forming process for six-wedge belt pulleys manufacturing was put forward. For this purpose, the required tooth shape and size can be formed directly by spinning without machining. The whole manufacturing procedures include blanking, drawing and spinning. The spinning procedure includes five processes, performing, drumming, thickening, toothing and finishing.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the potential for}} restoration of the Maple River in western Michigan (Muskegon and Newaygo Counties). The Maple River is an abandoned anabranch channel of the Muskegon River. Historically the Muskegon split to form Maple Island but in the late 19 th century flow was diverted down the northern channel of the Muskegon and the southern branch became {{what is now the}} Maple River. In the field I mapped the existing and underlying historic channel <b>bottom</b> <b>size</b> and shape. Then using HEC-RAS I developed a one-dimensional hydraulic model of the Maple River channel for both present and past condition. The model outputs were used to explore channel bankfull conveyance capacity and flooding thresholds. In addition I performed Weighted Useable Area (WUA) analysis to estimate potential increases in hydraulic habitat that restored connectivity with the Muskegon River might bring. Fishes in the Maple River were found to be less plentiful in diversity and evenness when compared to the Muskegon River. With the removal of nearly a meter of soft sediment the restored channel model provided more conveyance capacity than the existing channel model and contributed to an increase in hydraulic capacity for some of the life stages of the species of interest in this study. Hydraulic weighted useable area was predicted to increase for the eggs of chinook salmon, adult walleye, and both juvenile and adult steelhead under the restored channel model conditions. There is much more research necessary to weigh all the options for a restoration of the Maple River but there is evidence that hydraulic habitat may be improved for some fishes with the removal of the accumulated sediment throughout the Maple River channel...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - With the {{development}} of electronic devices, including the desires of integration, miniaturization, high performance and the output power, cooling requirement of chips have been increased gradually. Water-cooled minichannel is an effective cooling technology for cooling of heat sinks. The minichannel flow geometry offers large surface area for heat transfer and a high convective heat transfer coefficient with only a moderate pressure loss. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze a minichannel heat sink having the <b>bottom</b> <b>size</b> of 35 mm x 35 mm numerically. Two kinds of chip arrangement are investigated: diagonal arrangement and parallel arrangement. Design/methodology/approach - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is used to investigate the flow and thermal fields in forced convection in a three-dimensional minichannels heat sink with different chip arrangements. The standard k-e turbulence model is applied for the turbulence simulations on the minichannel heat sink. Findings - The results show that the bottom surface of the heat sink with various chip arrangements will have different temperature distribution and thermal resistance. A suitable chip arrangement will achieve a good cooling performance for electronic devices. Research limitations/implications - The fluid is incompressible and the thermophysical properties are constant. Practical implications - New and additional data will be helpful as guidelines in the design of heat sinks to achieve a good thermal performance and a long lifetime in operation. Originality/value - In real engineering situations, chips are always placed in various manners according to design conditions and constraints. In this case the assumption of uniform heat flux is acceptable for the surfaces of the chips rather than for the entire bottom surface of the heat sink...|$|E

40|$|Underwater Video Spot Detector (UVSD) is a {{software}} package designed to analyze underwater video for continuous spatial measurements (path traveled, {{distance to the}} bottom, roughness of the surface etc.) Laser beams of known geometry are often used in underwater imagery to estimate {{the distance to the}} bottom. This estimation is based on the manual detection of laser spots which is labor intensive and time consuming so usually only a few frames can be processed this way. This allows for spatial measurements on single frames (distance to the <b>bottom,</b> <b>size</b> of objects on the sea-bottom), but not for the whole video transect. We propose algorithms and {{a software}} package implementing them for the semi-automatic detection of laser spots throughout a video which can significantly increase the effectiveness of spatial measurements. The algorithm for spot detection is based on the Support Vector Machines approach to Artificial Intelligence. The user is only required to specify on certain frames the points he or she thinks are laser dots (to train an SVM model), and then this model is used by the program to detect the laser dots {{on the rest of the}} video. As a result the precise (precision is only limited by quality of the video) spatial scale is set up for every frame. This can be used to improve video mosaics of the sea-bottom. The temporal correlation between spot movements changes and their shape provides the information about sediment roughness. Simultaneous spot movements indicate changing distance to the bottom; while uncorrelated changes indicate small local bumps. UVSD can be applied to quickly identify and quantify seafloor habitat patches, help visualize habitats and benthic organisms within large-scale landscapes, and estimate transect length and area surveyed along video transects...|$|E
40|$|A recent {{emphasis}} of the Department of Energy's (DOE's), Coal Preparation Program has been the development of high-efficiency technologies that offer near-term, low-cost improvements {{in the ability of}} coal preparation plants to address problems associated with coal fines. In 1992, three cost-shared contracts were awarded to industry, under the first High-Efficiency Preparation (HEP I) solicitation. All three projects involved bench-scale testing of various emerging technologies, at the Federal Energy Technology Center*s (FETC*s), Process Research Facility (PRF). The first HEP I project, completed in mid- 1993, was conducted by Process Technology, Inc., with the objective of developing a computerized, on-line system for monitoring and controlling the operation of a column flotation circuit. The second HEP I project, completed in mid- 1994, was conducted by a team led by Virginia Polytechnic Institute to test the Mozely Multi-Gravity Separator in combination with the Microcel Flotation Column, for improved removal of mineral matter and pyritic sulfur from fine coal. The last HEP I project, of which the findings are contained in this report, was conducted by Custom Coals Corporation to evaluate and advance a micronized-magnetite-based, fine-coal cycloning technology. The micronized-magnetite coal cleaning technology, also know as the Micro-Mag process, is based on widely used conventional dense-medium cyclone applications, in that it utilizes a finely ground magnetite/water suspension as a separating medium for cleaning fine coal, by density, in a cyclone. However, the micronized-magnetite cleaning technology differs from conventional systems in several ways: ! It utilizes significantly finer magnetite (about 5 to 10 micron mean particle size), as compared to normal mean particle sizes of 20 microns. ! It can effectively beneficiate coal particles down to 500 M in size, as compared to the most advanced, existing conventional systems that are limited to a particle <b>bottom</b> <b>size</b> of about 28 M - 100 M. ! Smaller diameter cyclones, 4 to 10 inches, are used to provide the higher G-force required to separate the finer feed coal. ! Cyclone feed pressures up to 10 times greater than those used in conventional cleaning systems are employed to enhance the separating forces...|$|E

The floating breakwater is inclined at a well defined angle with the sea bottom; its seaward end in pro-truding above the water surface. In static equilibrium, without incoming waves, the body weight, the buoyance force, and the restoring forces from the mooring lines which are modeled using linear springs keep the breakwater at a fixed angle.

For the numerical solution a combination of finite element approximation as well as eigen function expansion technique is used.
