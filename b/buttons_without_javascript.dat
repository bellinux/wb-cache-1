50|$|As some web {{tracking}} services depend on JavaScript, and as JavaScript exposes browser and operating system configuration details, NoScript can increase privacy and anonymity as seen via the EFF's Panopticlick tool. NoScript {{also can be}} used by web developers as a convenient way to test how well sites work <b>without</b> <b>JavaScript,</b> particularly since modern versions of Firefox have removed JavaScript controls from the regular configuration pane.|$|R

50|$|As he {{is about}} to leave one stand, Special Agent Gregory of the FBI {{intercepts}} Brad, asking if the circus doctor looks like the photograph of a man he is hunting (the photo is of <b>Buttons</b> <b>without</b> makeup). Having never seen <b>Buttons</b> <b>without</b> makeup, Brad doesn't recognize the man in the photo. The detective boards the train to continue his investigation. Brad mentions this to Buttons, who tells him that Sebastian has feeling in his injured hand - a sign that his disability is not permanent. Brad makes the connection between Buttons and the fugitive doctor and comments that the police will be taking fingerprints at the next stand. The implication is that Buttons should make himself scarce until the detective leaves the show to search elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|For example, a {{site has}} a hyperlink. With Javascript enabled, Ajax {{is used to}} [...] "hijack" [...] the link's default {{behavior}} when clicked - where Hijax gets its name - and loads {{a small amount of}} new page content. <b>Without</b> <b>Javascript</b> enabled, it will load a full new page, a graceful degradation. With Ajax, the browser's loading signs will be observable and the URL will update, but only certain page elements will have changed.|$|R

Web development comprises a small subset of the whole. <b>Without</b> <b>JavaScript,</b> CSS, HTML, Databases like MySQL, and several server side languages such as PHP, the internet would be far less user friendly. Since a vast amount of code is duplicated between projects, web application frameworks were born. Some of these frameworks are basic and others are very feature-rich. This paper provides some metrics for evaluating the MVC (model-view-controller) based frameworks. More specifically, four frameworks ar...|$|R

Users {{are able to}} quickly identify and mute tabs that play audio without having to search for individual tabs. Safari supports AirPlay video streaming to an Apple TV without the need to broadcast the entire webpage. Safari extensions are now hosted and signed by Apple {{as part of the}} updated Apple Developer program and they received native support for content blocking, allowing developers to block website components (such as advertisements) <b>without</b> <b>JavaScript</b> injection. The app also allows the user to customize the font and background of the Reader mode.|$|R
50|$|Hijax is {{a hybrid}} {{development}} technique meant to address Ajax's accessibility and SEO shortcomings. It encourages developers {{to plan for}} Ajax from the beginning, but only implement {{it at the end}} of a project, forcing them to build a site that is functional and accessible <b>without</b> <b>Javascript</b> techniques. Ajax is then added in ways that enhance the site experience for browsers that support Javascript while not isolating content from users and search engines that do not have this luxury. In other words, it is progressive enhancement theory applied to Ajax; one starts with just basic content, and adds better functionality for browsers that support it without breaking the site for those that do not.|$|R

50|$|Remote Touch is {{also the}} first vehicle {{interface}} to incorporate user-adjustable haptic feedback, and utilize movement in two spatial axes. The incorporation of haptic feedback, similar to the Wii Remote, enables the driver to feel the placement of buttons and icons on the screen by touch. The use of force feedback enables the cursor to snap-to buttons, {{making it easier to}} select <b>buttons</b> <b>without</b> precise movement. To ease drivers transition to Remote Touch, the same on-screen layout and menus as the prior touchscreen-based system are used on models equipped with the new control system.|$|R

Dynamic queries allow users to formulate queries {{and explore the}} databases with graphical widgets, such as sliders and <b>buttons,</b> <b>without</b> requiring them to have any knowledge about the underlying structure of the database query languages, or command language syntax. Three interfaces for presenting directories were developed and tested with eighteen subjects in a within-subject design.

40|$|We {{introduce}} FingerFlux, an output {{technique to}} generate near-surface haptic feedback on interactive tabletops. Our system combines electromagnetic actuation with permanent magnets {{attached to the}} user’s hand. FingerFlux lets users feel the interface before touching, and can create both attracting and repelling forces. This enables applications such as reducing drifting, adding physical constraints to virtual controls, and guiding the user without visual output. We show that users can feel vibration patterns up to 35 mm above our table, and that FingerFlux can significantly reduce drifting when operating on-screen <b>buttons</b> <b>without</b> looking.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{describe}} a modified surgical technique {{for the treatment}} of patients in the early stage of keratoconus, when it is still possible to correct the astigmatic ametropia with contact lenses. METHODS: Excimer laser lamellar keratoplasty of augmented thickness (ELLKAT) is a procedure in which a deep plano excimer laser ablation is done on the host cornea and a donor lamellar <b>button</b> with or <b>without</b> an excimer laser refractive ablation on the posterior surfaceis sutured into the recipient bed. In 12 of 20 eyes, the homoplastic button, which had parallel faces and was devoid of any dioptric power, was treated refractively on its stromal face with a Chiron Keracor 116 excimer laser to correct the axial and/or induced myopia present due to the weakened cornea. RESULTS: The 8 eyes that received donor <b>buttons</b> <b>without</b> excimer laser ablation had improved spectacle-corrected visual acuity from a mean preoperative value of 20 / 100 (no eye saw 20 / 40 or better before surgery) to a mean posto [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Attacks from {{automated}} web {{clients are}} a significant problem on the Internet. Many web sites employ CAPTCHAs, Turing tests that hassle automated agents. Unfortunately, they require frequent human user input, can be subverted by adversaries willing to hire humans to solve challenges, and become ineffective as computer vision techniques improve. Several alternative defenses based upon cryptographic methods have been proposed {{to achieve the same}} goals. “Proof-of-Work” (PoW) systems prioritize clients based on their willingness to solve computational challenges of client-specific difficulty. Unfortunately, few proof-of-work schemes are ever deployed since they require wide-scale adoption of special client software to operate properly. This demonstration presents mod_kaPoW, a novel system that combines the efficiency and human-transparency of proof-of-work with the software backwards-compatibility of CAPTCHA schemes. mod_kaPoW attaches challenges to HTML links and the client’s browser uses JavaScript to solve them before requesting the linked content. Accessibility is maintained for clients <b>without</b> <b>JavaScript...</b>|$|R

The [...] will need a close button, perhaps a visual 'spinner' to show that data is loading, etc. Finally, when the Ajax data arrives, the handler hides the spinner and inserts the full-size image into the new [...] for display.|$|R
50|$|Flyme is a {{stock and}} {{aftermarket}} firmware developed by Meizu for smartphones {{based on the}} Android operating system. Some of its key features are completely redesigned apps, one-handed usability and performance optimizations. The current version of Flyme features distinguished flat design, various optimizations for performance. Flyme also has a feature called mBack, which is specific for Meizu smartphones. It allows easier navigation using only one physical <b>button</b> <b>without</b> on-screen navigation <b>buttons.</b> The back button function is implemented by tapping the physical button, while the home button function is used by pressing the physical button.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} novel {{perspective}} {{on the design of}} toolbar buttons that aims to increase keyboard shortcut accessibility. IconHK implements this perspective by blending visual cues that convey keyboard shortcut information into toolbar <b>buttons</b> <b>without</b> denaturing the pictorial representation of their command. We introduce three design strategies to embed the hotkey, a visual encoding to convey the modifiers, and a magnification factor that determines the blending ratio between the pictogram of the button and the visual representation of the keyboard shortcut. Two studies examine the benefits of IconHK for end-users and provide insights from professional designers on the practicality of our approach for creating iconsets. Building on these insights, we develop a tool to assist designers in applying the IconHK design principle...|$|R
50|$|A {{report was}} {{supposedly}} prepared and {{presented to the}} United States Congress, and was soundly rejected as far too dangerous. So a proposal was made directly to the United States Department of Defense promising a powerful new weapon that could drive an enemy insane, inducing the symptoms of schizophrenia {{at the touch of}} a <b>button.</b> <b>Without</b> Congressional approval, the project would have to be top secret and secretly funded. The Department of Defense approved. Funding supposedly came from a cache of USD $10 billion in Nazi gold recovered from a train found by U.S. soldiers in a train tunnel in France. The train was blown up and all the soldiers involved were killed. When those funds ran out, additional funding was secured from ITT and Krupp AG in Germany.|$|R

[...] Silva {{won the first}} 2 rounds but Côté proved how good his chin was by taking a {{roundhouse}} kick and flying knee right on the <b>button</b> <b>without</b> getting rocked {{in the very first}} round. In the third round, Côté's movement inside the octagon caused too much pressure {{on the back of his}} right leg (which he was using to move forward) and an injury caused him to fall to the mat grasping his right knee in pain. Referee Herb Dean declared the fight over when Côté could not continue, ruling the bout a TKO victory for Silva. Côté, however, became the first of Silva's UFC opponents to make it into the third round.|$|R
