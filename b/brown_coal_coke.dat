40|$|The {{task of the}} {{research}} and development project was to lower the PCDD and PCDF emissions from secondary aluminium smelting by the development of new and improved processes. The processes under consideration were situated in the primary path (firing and smelting) {{as well as in the}} secondary path (waste gas processing). As a primary measure, the influence of oxygen was analysed. The oxygen was loaded by an oxygen lance which was installed in the rotary furnace opposite to the burner. In alternative, the burner was driven with natural gas-air and with natural gas-oxygen. In the secondary path, the project comprised the examination of a double-stage-filter in which hydrated lime as well as hydrated lime and mixtures of lime and powdered <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> were applied as sorption agents. Further examinations referred to a single-stage filter in which mixtures of lime and coal were tested as well, partly with recirculation. The most important results were: - A potential in the diminution of PCDD/PCDF emissions can't be derived from the use of oxygen burners. There is a tendency towards a deterioration of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. - The application of the oxygen burners led to a considerable higher emission of nitrogen oxides. In order to obtain an improvement in this field, a correction in the design of the furnace seal on the side of the burner would be necessary. - An oxygen lance could reduce the load to total organic carbon (TOC). However, the required control technique is not yet available. - A double-stage filter improves the separation of dust and consequently of PCDD/PCDF. Furthermore, the application of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> considerably increases the separation of PCDD/PCDF. - Also single-stage filter shows a similar good purification effect if lime/coke mixtures with recirculation are used as sorption agents. The application of a filter medium made of Gore-Tex caused an increased separation of finest dust, but it didn't result in a considerable improvement of the PCDD/PCDF emissions. (orig.)

40|$|Coal is on of {{the most}} {{important}} energy source and its significance will increase in a future. In Czech republic coal is except else widely used as a fuel for combustion in a small boilers (up to 50 kW). Low efficiency of the small boilers which is often below 50 % together with high emissions of the harmful substances into near surroundings cause in average 40  70 % of total local air pollution. The research was performed in a scope of the Grant no. 101 / 98 / 0820 of Grant Agency of Czech Republic was focused on quality of combustion process related to combustion efficiency and creation of harmful substances at combustion of domestic fuels. Experiments were performed to compare combustion of <b>brown</b> <b>coal,</b> clack <b>coal,</b> <b>coke</b> and black <b>coal</b> slurry. Extremely high creation of harmful substances (CO, NOX, solid particles and organic substances) was measured when the black coal slurry was used as a fuel, measured in kg of emissions per GJ of burned fuel. Combustion of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> produced significant emissions of solid particles which bond harmful substances as metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and others) together with high emissions of SO 2. Strong dependence between emissions of CO and low quality of combustion given by low combustion temperature, shortage of combustion air, not suitable design of after-combustion chamber and short duration of fuel presence in a combustion area was found out. Emissions of wide range of metals were investigated. The results of the research grant project describe and explain the combustion process and creation of harmful substances in small boilers plus give suggestions and recommendations leading to rational operation of the small boilers and lowering their negative impact to environment...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{kinetic model}} for the oxidation of NH 3 and reduction of NO in FBC is used to model the NO concentration profile in an 8 MW CFB. Three different fuels were burned in the full scale tests: Bituminous <b>coal,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> and petroleum <b>coke.</b> Kinetics were measured in a laboratory reactor using samples of char and bed material from the boiler. The simulation results show that char is an important catalyst for the oxidation of NH 3 and reduction of NO when burning bituminous <b>coal</b> and petroleum <b>coke.</b> The char content in the <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> bed is low and very active bed material with a high ash content is the important catalyst in this case.

The bed material is composed of particle mixture of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> and quartz sand. A <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> of the bed material works as a carbonous feedstock, while quartz sand functions as a thermal storage/transfer medium inside the reactor. The fluidized bed reactor, having a transparent window due to incoming radiation of concentrated solar beam on {{the ceiling of the}} reactor, is designed to be combined with a solar reflective tower or beam-down optics. A potential of quartz sand in the internally-circulating fluidized bed reactor is evaluated forsteam gasification of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> by gasification performance (CO, H 2 and CO 2 production rates, carbon conversion, and light-to-chemical efficiency). The gasification performances for use of the particle mixture in the reactor are compared with that for use of <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> particle. The fluidized bed of a particle mixtureincluding <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> and quartz sand was gasified at lower temperature with a higher rate in comparison to that of a <b>coal</b> <b>coke.</b> Furthermore, a use of smaller and lighter <b>coal</b> <b>coke</b> particles were easily converted to gaseous species due to larger surface area as well as the gasification rates...|$|R

Industial hard <b>coal,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> and furnace <b>coke</b> were obtained, dried, milled (ERM-EF 411 and ERM-EF 413) and filled into aluminium laminated sachets. Between-unit homogeneity were quantified and stability during dispatch and storage were assessed in accordance with ISO Guide 35 : 2006. Within-unit heterogeneity was quantified to determine the minimum sample intake. The material was characterised by an intercomparison among laboratories of demonstrated competence and adhering to ISO/IEC 17025. Technically invalid results were removed but no outlier was eliminated on statistical grounds only. Uncertainties of the certified values were calculated {{in compliance with the}} Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) and include uncertainties related to possible heterogeneity and instability and to characterisation. The materials are intended for quality control and assessment of method performance. As any reference material, they can be used for control charts or validation studies, as well. The CRMs are available in sachets containing 50 g of dried material. The minimum amount of sample to be used, depending on the analyte, varies from 30 mg to 1 g.

30|$|A major {{drawback}} {{to the use}} of <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> as a carrier material, however, is its high moisture content (typically 60 – 70  % for <b>brown</b> <b>coals</b> mined in Victoria, Australia).

Dried <b>brown</b> <b>coal</b> is prone to crumble into a fine dust when handled, increasing its propensity to undergo spontaneous combustion.
