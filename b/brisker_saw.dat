50|$|Soon thereafter, Brisk {{commenced}} escorting convoys between New York and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a prosaic {{but highly}} important duty {{that kept her}} employed through V-E Day {{in the spring of}} 1945. <b>Brisk</b> <b>saw</b> action on August 1st 1943 while escorting Convoy NG-376 30 miles west of Great Inagua. She drove down U-boat U-732 that was lying in wait for the convoy, allowing it to pass unmolested. Upon the conclusion of her last convoy mission, with GN-204 (Guantanamo to New York) — which reached New York on 15 May 1945 — Brisk sailed for Norfolk, Virginia, on 11 June. She continued south from there on 23 June and arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, two days later.|$|R
50|$|Miller {{introduced}} previously unseen {{characters who}} had played a major part in his youth, such as Elektra, an ex-girlfriend turned lethal ninja assassin. Elektra was killed fighting Bullseye in issue #181 (April 1982), an issue which <b>saw</b> <b>brisk</b> sales.|$|R
5000|$|Drank was {{introduced}} and manufactured by Innovative Beverage Group of Houston, Texas in January 2008. It was {{widely available in}} many convenience stores and <b>saw</b> <b>brisk</b> sales. In 2012, a new flavor, [...] "Island Time", {{was introduced}}, but to a lukewarm response. Poor sales of both flavors saw the product disappear off store shelves in 2013. In 2014, Drank was sold to Source Financial Group, L.L.C. who has reintroduced the brand. Its availability is much reduced and found in very select convenience stores in the Houston, TX and Saginaw, MI area. Little or no sources outside of Houston have been found, {{and it does not}} appear to have a website of its own.|$|R
6000|$|Again {{with the}} eyes of her mind she beheld that grim, stalwart figure, saw his great nose, his greying hair, his fierce mustachios and his stern, quick eyes. Again she heard the rasp of his {{metallic}} voice with its <b>brisk</b> derision. She <b>saw</b> him in the hall below, his foot upon the neck of that popinjay of Condillac daring them all to draw a breath, should he forbid it; again in fancy she rode on the withers of his horse at the gallop towards Grenoble. A sigh escaped her. Surely {{that was the first}} man who was indeed a man she had ever set eyes on since her father died. Had Garnache been spared, she would have felt courage and she would have hoped, for there was something about him that suggested energy and resource such as it is good to lean upon in times of stress. Again she heard that brisk, metallic voice: [...] "Are you content, madame? Have you had fine deeds enough for one day?" ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, Pluto {{pulled at}} the reins, and stopped the chariot right between the tall, massive pillars of the gateway. The mastiff {{of which he had}} spoken got up from the threshold, and stood on his hinder legs, so as to put his fore paws on the chariot wheel. But, my stars, what a strange dog it was! Why, he was a big, rough, ugly-looking monster, with three {{separate}} heads, and each of them fiercer than the two others; but fierce as they were, King Pluto patted them all. He seemed as fond of his three-headed dog {{as if it had been}} a sweet little spaniel, with silken ears and curly hair. Cerberus, on the other hand, was evidently rejoiced to see his master, and expressed his attachment, as other dogs do, by wagging his tail at a great rate. Proserpina's eyes being drawn to it by its <b>brisk</b> motion, she <b>saw</b> that this tail was neither more nor less than a live dragon, with fiery eyes, and fangs that had a very poisonous aspect. And while the three-headed Cerberus was fawning so lovingly on King Pluto, there was the dragon tail wagging against its will, and looking as cross and ill-natured as you can imagine, on its own separate account.|$|R
60|$|As he {{came back}} to the hearth, limping {{slightly}} but with a <b>brisk</b> step, Stephen <b>saw</b> the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no spark of Ignatius's enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of apostleship. It seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and little, if at all, the ends he served. SIMILITER ATQUE SENIS BACULUS, he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace.|$|R
2500|$|The console {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan on June 23, 1996. Though the initial shipment of 300,000 units sold {{out on the}} first day, Nintendo successfully avoided {{a repeat of the}} Super Famicom launch day pandemonium, in part by using a wider retail network which included convenience stores. In the months between the Japanese and North American launches, the Nintendo 64 <b>saw</b> <b>brisk</b> sales on the American grey market, despite import stores charging as much as $699 plus shipping for the system. The Nintendo 64 was first sold in North America on September 26, 1996, despite having been advertised for the 29th. It was launched with just two games in the United States, Pilotwings 64 and Super Mario 64. In 1994, prior to the launch, Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln emphasized the quality of first-party games, saying [...] "... we're convinced that a few great games at launch are more important than great games mixed in with a lot of dogs". The PAL version of the console was released in Europe on March 1, 1997. According to Nintendo of America representatives, Nintendo had been planning a simultaneous launch in Japan, North America, and Europe, but market studies indicated that worldwide demand for the system far exceeded the number of units they could have ready by launch, potentially leading to consumer and retailer frustration.|$|R
2500|$|Not all BevMo! {{expansion}} {{has been}} welcomed by city residents. In March 2010 in Santa Barbara, California, a group voiced opposition at a city board meeting, delaying {{approval of a}} BevMo! store. Concerns brought up at the meeting included complaints about the company's plans to cut down a tree in the parking lot, and about loading dock plans that would increase congestion in a narrow alley. The city's Architectural Board of Review member Paul Zink recommended against BevMo!'s plans to have pedestrians cross a parking lot to enter the store, saying that [...] "there's a tie-in between what's inside and the street". Zink continued, [...] "here in Santa Barbara, we like to window shop." [...] Area retailers noted that a new liquor store within range of nine smaller liquor stores and several supermarkets that sell liquor would decrease sales for longstanding area businesses. Sarkis Abdulhi, a liquor store owner, asked, [...] "how can a politician say they support small business when they bring in giant chains? How many employees {{are they going to}} have, 13? What good does that do anybody when they put nine or 10 small shops out of business?" [...] Area resident Trudy Fernandez said the opening of chain location [...] "takes away from what people like me who have been in Santa Barbara 40 years came here for. This is a small town—we don't want to be L.A." [...] The store, BevMo's 105th, <b>saw</b> <b>brisk</b> business upon opening.|$|R
