50|$|Roman culture worshiped the body, and {{therefore}} the health of it. The hot springs or public baths became meeting places for {{people from all walks}} of life, and their use was encouraged by the authorities, which sometimes covered their expenses which allowed free access to the population.

Those available in separate sections for men and women, the separate areas devoted to them were given the name spas.|$|R

One of the first characters he did on the show was Bathtime Bob the Hygiene Cowboy, who sang about <b>bath</b> <b>time,</b> but like many of Stack's characters he had a very dark, tragic underbelly to his upbeat nature. Stack had previously tried to develop this character at Second City, but it never appeared in any shows.|$|E

50|$|In 1981 the 'White Water Flume' {{opened to}} the public as the world's longest log flume with it's 2600ft {{waterway}} themed around the Canadian Falls, by 1983 the ride had acquired it's traditional and more popular name of 'The Log Flume' & for the next 23 years operated as such. Between 1984-95 it also featured props from 'Dinosaur Land' which had been closed the previous season to make way for The Black Hole, including a prehistoric family inside the tunnel section of the flume. In 2004 the ride was re-themed to 'The Flume' with a bath theme, as sponsored by a soap manufacturer; new 'bath' boats replacing the logs, new lining, maintenance, a refurbished station, a yellow duck, shower and other bath-time theming. In 2008, the area in which the ride operated was re-themed to Mutiny Bay, however the ride retained its <b>bath</b> <b>time</b> theme.|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of nuclear magnetic resonance, we consider the general problem of the coherent control of a spin coupled to a bath by means of composite or continuous pulses of duration τ_p. We show explicity {{that it is possible}} to design the pulse in order to achieve a decoupling of the spin from the bath up to the third order in τ_p. The evolution of the system is separated in the evolution of the spin under the action of the pulse and of the <b>bath</b> <b>times</b> correction terms. We derive the correction terms for a general time dependent axis of rotation and for a general coupling between the spin and the environment. The resulting corrections can be made vanish by an appropriate design of the pulse. For π and π/ 2 pulses, we demonstrate explicitly that pulses exist which annihilate the first and the second order corrections even if the bath is fully quantum mechanical, i. e., it displays internal dynamics. Such pulses will also be useful for quantum information processing. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures. Published versio...|$|R

50|$|Barium {{chromate}} {{has been}} found to be useful in many capacities. The compound is often used as a carrier for the chromium ions.One such case is the use of barium chromate as a sulfate scavenger in chromium electroplating <b>baths.</b> Over <b>time</b> the chromium concentration of the bath will decrease until the bath is no longer functional. Adding barium chromate enhances the life of the bath by adding to the chromic acid concentration.|$|R
