5000|$|Neither the trilogy's title Achilleis nor the {{grouping}} of the plays is explicitly attested from antiquity, but {{the existence of}} a unified trilogy with Achilles as its focus has long been accepted by modern scholars. In his commentary on the The Libation <b>Bearers,</b> Garvie <b>states</b> that it is [...] "highly likely that Aeschylus often, though not always (of the surviving plays Persae is an almost certain exception) composed trilogies consisting of tragedies connected in their subject matter." [...] In addition to the Oresteia (to which 'The Libation Bearers' belongs), the Seven Against Thebes and Suppliants formed part of connected trilogies, as did the lost plays that make up the Lycurgeia.The satyr plays that accompanied these examples had plots related to those of the tragedies, and {{it has been suggested that}} the Achilleis might also have been followed by a comedic play related to its dramatic content, but there is no evidence as to what the subject of this satyr play might have been.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Market freedoms {{resemble}} in {{many aspects}} fundamental rights. Since individuals can invoke {{them against the}} measures of Member States, they are subjective rights which restrict the compe¬tence of the Member States in favour of the individual. Besides this most apparent function, market freedoms are also about the distri¬bution of competence among Member States, and between Member States and the European Union. Market freedoms appear to confer the right to market access in the remaining area of their application. Thus, market freedoms seem to reserve an area of protection to the indivi¬dual, which is necessary {{for them to be}} deemed fundamental rights. This area, however, is only reserved in relation to the Member States. According to the incompetence approach which is presented here, Eu¬ropean institutions are bound by market freedoms only in an indirect way. It is just {{due to a lack of}} competence that a conflict between mar¬ket freedoms and measures of European institutions seldom conflict. Since market freedoms do not strive for comprehensive protection in relation to any <b>bearer</b> of <b>state</b> authority, they lack the decisive feature of fundamental rights...|$|R

For much of the post-war period, the dominant image has been of a world divided into separate, formally equal, sovereign nation-states. This {{image of the}} global system envisages politics as occurring within states because it is only there where {{the full range of}} social relations exists between individuals constituted as a demos. By contrast, international politics taken literally is an oxymoron, since the absence of a global demos means that individuals can only relate to each other in power terms, as <b>bearers</b> of their <b>state’s</b> sovereignty and ‘national interest’...|$|R

30|$|Regarding non-GBR <b>bearers,</b> as <b>stated</b> above, {{the network}} has no {{obligation}} to guarantee a given bit rate to the EPS bearers. Then, it {{raises the question of}} how should the PDB attribute be interpreted for non-GBR bearers that are expected to support elastic traffic. If a communication link supports traffic (e.g., elastic TCP-based) with an upper bound on link capacity, this path is not able to guarantee a given target delay for that traffic unless a restrictive rate shaping function (e.g., leaky bucket) is applied [18]. However, in LTE, the MBR parameter is not applicable to non-GBR bearers. In this respect, the 3 GPP specification [2] states that “in general, the rate of congestion related packet drops can not be controlled precisely for Non-GBR traffic.” Additionally, it indicates that a queue management function can contribute to control the packet drop rate. Regarding the satisfaction of the PDB for non-GBR traffic 3 GPP, the specification [2] states that “ 98 percent of the packets that have not been dropped due to congestion should not experience a delay exceeding the QCI’s PDB.” Therefore, ultimately, we conclude that (i) the 3 GPP specification acknowledges that non-GBR bearers (e.g., supporting elastic traffic) are expected to suffer packet drops due to congestion and (ii) the delay of packets that are not dropped should not exceed the PDB, but this delay limit is not as strict as for GBR bearers.|$|R
40|$|Clark and Chalmers (2002) advance two {{hypotheses}} {{that both}} cognition {{and the mind}} extend into the environment. Both hypotheses are grounded in active externalism about mental content and the Parity Principle. Active externalism proposes that the external features of the environment in the present directly influence our mental contents and behavior. The Parity Principle states that a process or state in the environment is cognitive if it is functionally equivalent to a comparable intracranial cognitive process. This paper reviews two of the strongest replies to the hypotheses, namely that arguments for them commit the coupling-constitution fallacy and that the hypothesis of extended cognition is incompatible with any satisfactory criteria that distinguishes between cognitive and non-cognitive processes. This paper argues that a dynamical systems approach avoids both objections and offers a conceptual and methodological framework for an extended cognitive science. Lastly, an account of collective intentionality will be considered to show how groups of individuals can be the <b>bearers</b> of mental <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|Can we {{understand}} being valuable for {{in terms of}} being valuable? Three different kinds of puzzle cases suggest that we must answer this question negatively. In what follows, I articulate a positive answer to this question, carefully present the three these puzzle cases, and then explain how a friend of the positive answer can successfully respond to them. This response requires us to distinguish different kinds of value bearers, rather than different kinds of value, and hold that among the value <b>bearers</b> are totality <b>states</b> of affairs. The project of understanding being valuable for {{in terms of being}} valuable is more viable than one might have thought. According to G. E. Moore, there is only one kind of primitive value, which he calls ‘intrinsic value’. This is the kind of value cherished by those consequentialists who endorse the motto that one should do the best one can. 1 But it is also recognized by moral theorists who hold that the value of th...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Further details are {{available}} from; [URL] computing is {{a branch of}} artificial intelligence that deals with the design of devices which can process human emotions. The data gathered by passive sensors {{can be compared to}} the cues humans use to perceive the affective state of others (e. g. a video camera might capture facial expressions, body posture or gestures). An automatic, machine-based emotion recognition system could operate {{on the basis of the}} output of these sensors. CCTV surveillance is a potential application for such a system which might be used to constantly monitor for mal-intent through the emotional cues exhibited by surveillance targets and alert CCTV operators as appropriate. Previous research showed that firearms are known to elicit certain emotional <b>states</b> in their <b>bearers.</b> Consequently, these <b>states</b> might be reflected in the change of the individuals body language. The potential for automating the detection of the associated emotional cues in image processing algorithms is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Theorists of {{learning}} organisations argue that learning {{calls for the}} emancipation of workers. Yet many critical analyses of contemporary control systems argue that this freedom implies a deeper slavery. This paper seeks to resolve this paradox through a theoretical analysis {{of the effects of}} control systems on workers. We argue that in its standard formulation, the paradox of control implies an inadequate conception of the nature of workers in contemporary organisations. Workers are perceived as passive, malleable, individuals. But as Gilles Deleuze claims, creative labourers in the controlled environments of the present day are not only (or even primarily) individuals - they are dividuals, that is, <b>bearers</b> of cognitive <b>states</b> and affective traits that are shared in common with others. As dividuals, workers participate in insurgent "becomings", collectively constituting modes of "minor" biopolitics that break with norms established by "major" regimes of biopolitical control. In our view, it is not the creative individual, but the generative dynamic between major and minor biopolitics that drives organisational learning as a complex bio-technological event...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this work is to show the present {{situation}} of public administration in Croatia concerning the process of Association to European Union and to define in which direction the further adjustment have to go. Namely, Croatia has by signing the Agreement of stabilization and association started a number of great adjusting of legalization with EU legal acquest, and great changes is nearly all parts of social and managing life. One {{of the most important}} <b>bearer</b> of <b>stated</b> changes is surely the public administration. It’s importance is additional empfahized by Madrid criterion too, that is, administrative criterion for the state candidates. Public administration will be defined as the main bearer of all changes, and the success of all reforms is based on successful reform of public administration. During investigation of the present statement and sugestions for the future adjustments, we investigated the present statement in negotiations of accession between Croatia and EU for the reason that they define the direction and the way of adjustment process. In Croatia the monitoring is present from the moment of request, and the results are carefully controlled and are published as returning informations and measurement for further process. Furthermore, the Government and Ministry for Foreign Affairs regulary publish the reports of achieved reforms and national programs which on the best way show the position of Croatia in the complette process. Everything stated before make the firm base for evaluation of the present, and the proposal for improvement of the statemnt. Instead of results, we can conclude that the process of reform of public adminsitration is nenecesary and it is the last time to do it. For the reason that the process of accommodation lasts some time, {{it can be said that}} the formal steps are present, but it is not even enough, because there is lack practice, and the time is shorter and shorter. association to EU, public administration, memebership criteria, reform of public administration, condition for membership, governance, tax system, health sector, energetics, references...|$|R
40|$|Resume In {{the first}} part of the {{graduation}} thesis Limits of Democracy qualifies the term of democ- racy, the return to democracy sources, especially to the archaic Greece, where democracy began and then developed thanks to the philosophers were like Socrates, Plato or Aristotle. At that time, democracy had strong competition and was created various ideologies and forms of government. Democracy was not made at that time and was standing in the shad- ows of history. In the next part of the graduation thesis author deals with return of democratic thinking in the French Revolution, their thinkers were like Charles Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu and Jean-Jeacques Rousseau who became the inspiration for a revolutionary campaign. In France after the revolution started to emerge riots, wars with neighbors and followed terror. In this part of the graduation thesis author defines the term totalitarian democracy and points to the "democratic" process in 2011 during the Arab Spring. Then the author focuses on today's modern democracy and analyzes the United States as a <b>state,</b> as a <b>bearer</b> of democracy. <b>State</b> that this ideology spreads and becomes uncompro- misingly authority that considers what is democratic and what is not.
