25|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect</b> {{presents}} an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial {{conditions for a}} system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of ensemble forecasting, in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect</b> {{can also}} be {{demonstrated}} by very simple systems. For example, the randomness of the outcomes of throwing dice depends on this characteristic to amplify small differences in initial conditions—the precise direction, thrust, and orientation of the throw—into significantly different dice paths and outcomes, which makes it virtually impossible to throw a dice {{exactly the same way}} twice.|$|E

40|$|Agent-centered {{constraints}} on harming hold that some harmful upshots of our conduct cannot be justified by its generating equal or somewhat greater benefits. In this paper I argue that all plausible theories of agent-centered {{constraints on}} harming are {{undermined by the}} likelihood that our actions will have <b>butterfly</b> <b>effects,</b> or cause cascades of changes that make the world dramatically different {{than it would have}} been. Theories that impose constraints against only intended harming or proximally caused harm have unacceptable implications for choices between more and less harmful ways of securing greater goods. This leaves as plausible only theories that impose constraints against causing some unintended distal harms. But, I argue, given the distal harms our actions are likely to cause through their <b>butterfly</b> <b>effects,</b> these theories entail that any way of sustaining our lives is overwhelmingly likely to involve unjustified killing, and that we are therefore morally required either to allow ourselves to waste away or kill ourselves...|$|R

25|$|Chaos {{theory is}} {{a branch of}} {{mathematics}} focused {{on the behavior of}} dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. 'Chaos' is an interdisciplinary theory stating that within the apparent randomness of chaotic complex systems, there are underlying patterns, constant feedback loops, repetition, self-similarity, fractals, self-organization, and reliance on programming at the initial point known as sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect</b> describes how a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state, e.g. a butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil can cause a hurricane in Texas.|$|E
25|$|In {{continuous}} time dynamical systems, chaos is {{the phenomenon}} of the spontaneous breakdown of topological supersymmetry which is an intrinsic property of evolution operators of all stochastic and deterministic (partial) differential equations. This picture of dynamical chaos works not only for deterministic models but also for models with external noise, which is an important generalization from the physical point of view because in reality all dynamical systems experience influence from their stochastic environments. Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect,</b> is a consequence of the Goldstone's theorem in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.|$|E
25|$|Notes: 1) The {{story has}} some {{parallels}} to {{the legend of}} John Henry. 2) In this story it is learned that England's American colonies broke off into a new nation - the Federated Commonwealths of America - in 1738, and westward expansion began much sooner than in our history, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous humans in the regions to be colonized. 3) The character Trevithick is American rather than British, and appears to be 20 years older than his historic age, so he is probably not the historical figure but an analog. In Turtledove works, it is common for historic figures to have fictitious offspring (as with Edward Wingfield's daughter and her own great-grandson Thomas Kenton above) as a result of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

25|$|Relevant is {{the fact}} that {{certainty}} is never absolute in practice (and not just because of David Hume's problem of induction). The equations of Newtonian mechanics can exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions. This {{is an example of the}} <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect,</b> which is one of the subjects of chaos theory. The idea is that something even as small as a butterfly could cause a chain reaction leading to a hurricane years later. Consequently, even a very small error in knowledge of initial conditions can result in arbitrarily large deviations from predicted behavior. Chaos theory thus explains why it may be practically impossible to predict real life, whether determinism is true or false. On the other hand, the issue may not be so much about human abilities to predict or attain certainty as much as it is the nature of reality itself. For that, a closer, scientific look at nature is necessary.|$|E
25|$|The film {{touches on}} themes such as free will vs. determinism, {{the role of}} chance in people's destiny, and obscure cause-effect relationships. Through brief flash-forward {{sequences}} of still images, Lola's fleeting interactions with bystanders are revealed to have surprising and drastic effects on their future lives, serving as concise illustrations of chaos theory's <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect,</b> in which minor, seemingly inconsequential variations in any interaction can blossom into much wider results than is often recognized. (However, another explanation is that Lola's interactions with them didn't really cause anything. It's just that each person inherently has vastly different possibilities of life trajectory, a different version of which is explored and shown in the three iterations.) The film's exploration {{of the relationship between}} chance and conscious intention comes to the foreground in the casino scene, where Lola appears to defy the laws of chance through sheer force of will, improbably making the roulette ball land on her winning number {{with the help of a}} glass-shattering scream.|$|E

5000|$|How {{innovation}} butterflies are 'chased' {{is highly}} managerially relevant.

However, some butterflies can also unleash regime-altering emergent outcomes within an entire industry segment.

500|$|In 2010, Quesada wrote {{a sequel}} storyline, [...] "One Moment in Time".

The storyline also established that May was saved by Doctor Strange, despite Strange saying during [...] "One More Day" [...] that it was beyond his power to save her, who also worked with Iron Man and Mister Fantastic to create a mass mind-wipe across the globe to protect Peter's identity, using the Extremis as a dispersal system to simultaneously erase Spider-Man's identity and establish a 'psychic blindspot' that prevents anyone from realising that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, regardless of the evidence they might discover, unless Peter is unmasked {{in front of them}} (although this 'blindspot' was lost during the events of Spider-Island, due to Peter's public use of his powers while unmasked claiming that he was just one of many people infected with a virus that gave them Spider-Man's powers, Strange noting that this loophole means that people can now deduce Peter's identity even if they won't remember Peter's prior unmasking).|$|E
30|$|But the {{assumption}} that, by reducing uncertainty, we so exhaustively rearticulate {{our relationship with}} time that the future ceases to be an unknown, is as flawed now {{as it was when}} Roman priests assumed animal entrails would foretell what the future might bring. For whilst we have been very successful at utilising scientific understanding to make certain predictions about the natural world—such as the date of equinoxes or how two elements will react when brought together, that same understanding also tells us that there are also strict limitations imposed by nature upon our capacities to predict the future. The <b>butterfly</b> <b>effects</b> within complex, non-linear systems, the NP limits of computable functions or uncertainties at the quantum level itself are amongst multiple kinds of phenomena which remind us that unpredictability is not just an epistemic fact but something which operates at a far deeper, ontological level in the world. And as Sennett and others have argued (cf Floridi 2015) this may be something to be embraced, rather than evaded, Thus, in a world irreducibly shaped by indeterminacy and the random effects of human subjectivity, to assume that technology will guarantee us secure knowledge of the future is not just folly but stupidity of the highest order.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} and {{explores the}} phenomenon of intimacy in sensory-corporeal-based encounters in contemporary participatory theatre exemplified in three case studies: Tino Sehgal’s Kiss, Wunderland’s Sommerfugleeffekter (Eng: <b>Butterfly</b> <b>Effects)</b> and Dries Verhoeven’s Guilty Landscapes: Episode 1 – Hangzhou. This thesis perceives intimacy in theatre as a (syn) aesthetic phenomenon that fuses and connects perceptions of closeness with distance and difference in a multitude of sense-making processes. The notion of ‘(syn) aesthesia’ is by Josephine Machon described as a multitude of perceptions and processes of somatic and semantic sense-making(s) dominating contemporary affective performance in both as means of expression and reception. The connectivity of closeness within distance and difference is by Liesbeth Groot Nibbelink perceived as the circumstance of intimacy in theatre. What generate intimacy in theatre is modes of interaction and engagements of senses and corporeality that is maintained through elements of mutuality, which is theorised by Bennett Helm. The analysis of the case studies shows that intimacy {{is not to be}} understood as one specific experience. Instead three different intimacies – affected by (syn) aesthetic perceptions and processes of closeness and distance evoking emotions and sense-makings – are generated {{as a result of the}} three performances’ different modes of affectivity, engagement and interaction. This research concludes that intimacy can be evoked in a theatrical setting despite theatre’s reproducibility and the unfamiliarity of performers in close encounters through new deconstructed understandings of closeness and distance in a society of today dominated by intermedial and technological influences. The ambivalent and challenged experiences of intimacy in theatre create potential for reflection over the role and phenomenon of intimacy in the social world...|$|R
500|$|The film {{also makes}} {{substantial}} use of chaos theory, string theory, and the <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect</b> {{to accentuate the}} lack of control that humanity as individuals possesses. Often at each stage of his life there is a scene where Nemo {{is subject to the}} whims of chance, often plunging into water, a place where humans lack all control. This is a visual symbol of the powerlessness attributed to the human condition. The theories are used to compound reality in the film, it is why the smoke never goes back into the cigarette, time is always moving in one direction. [...] At the end when it assumes that the universe is on the precipice of ultimate chaos, making use of the Big Crunch theory, time halts, and it begins to reverse. Thus signalling the absolute freedom Nemo had been seeking – being able to live a life without choice, for while you never choose all things remain possible. The tale of Nemo Nobody reflects a life of choices, whether or not we made the correct choice and what would happen if we could go back and change them. In the reveal Mr. Nobody age 118 states that it doesn't matter what we choose, because each choice, once made has just as much significance as any alternate choice. The film portrays a life where we are all subject to chance, to the dimensions by which we construct our reality (height, length, width and time), and to the imagination of our former selves. And once the boy Nemo knows the outcomes of either choice, he instinctively opts for another.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect,</b> pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

This creates a <b>butterfly</b> <b>effect</b> influencing the main characters' pasts but otherwise stabilizing both universes due {{to the creation of}} the bridge. Peter is pulled into this new timeline due to the actions of the alternate timeline's Fringe team, which includes Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Peter initially works to return to his own timeline, fueled by fears that his memories are altering Cortexiphan-dosed Olivia's of this timeline, but after encountering a wounded September, Peter comes to learn that this timeline is truly his home, and both he and Olivia come to accept the change, rekindling their affair. September also reveals to Peter that the Observers needed to erase Peter's son, Henry, to assure their future will be created, though noting that Peter's future child with Olivia will be important. Meanwhile, in the present, William Bell has instructed David Robert Jones, alive in this timeline, to work with the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp to synchronize the two universes, aiming to collapse them both and pave the way for a third universe under Bell's control, using Olivia's Cortexiphan powers to enable the collapse. The Fringe division is forced to close the dimensional bridge, but this fails to stop Bell's plan. Walter is left with one choice, to shoot and kill Olivia, her death disrupting the process and saving the world. Olivia's [...] "death" [...] is only temporary, as the Cortexiphan in her body is consumed to repair the bullet wound, leaving her alive and healthy but lacking her psionic abilities. As Olivia and Peter begin their lives together, September appears to Walter and warns that the Observers [...] "are coming".|$|E

We {{show that there is}} a large latitudinal variation in host use and that butterfly populations select plant individuals based on their flowering phenology.
