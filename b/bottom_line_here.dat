40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{critically}} {{the notion of}} “Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> ” accounting.

We then use these claims as a basis upon which to argue (a) that what is sound about the idea of a Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> is not novel, and (b) that what is novel about the idea is not sound. We argue on both conceptual and practical grounds that the Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> is an unhelpful addition to current discussions of corporate social responsibility. Finally, we argue that the Triple <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> paradigm cannot be rescued simply by attenuating its claims: the rhetoric is badly misleading, and may in fact provide a smokescreen behind which firms can avoid truly effective social and environmental reporting and performance...|$|R

A less studied aspect of critical-analytic thinking pertains to individual differences, particularly in the set of foundational or componential cognitive skills that embody this construct. The <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>here</b> is whether, all else being equal (i. e., the same situation and the same developmental/educational stage), there is variation in whether, when, and how people think critically/analytically.

This review focuses on theoretical and empirical evidence, identifying the cognitive processes that serve as the sources of these individual differences and capturing these processes’ differential contributions to both the critical and analytic components of this construct.

40|$|This paper uses a Ceridian transaction-by-transaction {{data set}} on {{purchases}} of diesel fuel by over-the-road truckers {{to form a}} monthly diesel volume purchase index from 1999 to 2011, purged of weekday, holiday and calendar effects. These high-frequency data support a new and improved set of options to correct for (1) the variability in the weekday composition of months and (2) the drift of holiday effects between months. With only monthly data, Census seasonal adjustment methods are forced to make inferences {{about the effects of}} both weekday composition and holiday drift. With daily data, these can be directly observed, and removed from the data, if the patterns repeat. But the drift of holiday effects between December and January resists statistical treatment, leaving the December/January comparison the most noisy in a seasonally adjusted monthly series.

40|$|A {{biomarker}} is {{a diagnostic}} indicator {{of a medical}} condition— a sign that provides a physician or healthcare specialist with the critical information needed to diagnose, monitor, prognosticate and/or treat a disease or other condition of biological or medical interest. 1 Organisms and their maladies are exceedingly complex, but biomarkers, by representing faithfully the underlying reality, allow the physician to reduce the complexity of disease and thereby deal with it. A biomarker is a small bit of information that stands in for the enormous and unattainable facts of biological existence. Fever, for example, serves and has served patients, shamans, and other healthcare practitioners as a useful biomarker {{for thousands of years}} before Western medical science discovered the immune system, pathogens, cytokines and all the rest; fever is a faithful biomarker because it is a simple, measurable outcome of the enor-mous complexity of known and unknown factors that generate it. Healthcare would just not be possible without biomarkers. The <b>Bottom</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Here,</b> I submit that: (1) the immune system is a healthcare system; (2) the immune system, like any good doctor or shaman, uses biomarkers to manage the body; (3) pathogens use biomarkers to subvert the immune system to their own ends; and (4) effective vaccines can be constructed using biomarkers chosen for desirable ends; I bring the example of HSP 60 peptides in conjugate vaccines...|$|E
30|$|The {{establishment}} of enclosures in Chepareria was also observed {{to be due}} to an inherent need to manage and utilize land as individuals saw fit. Increased land degradation and pasture scarcity was attributed to increased overuse and mismanagement of the free-for-all communal fields in Chepareria. To fully exploit the land, individuals felt that they could better manage the vast lands if they were demarcated and boundaries established. Following the exit of the colonialists and the subsequent failure of the highly disliked group ranch management system, individuals seized this opportunity to wind up the group ranch management which was poorly coordinated in favour of individual landholdings; one which they had some degree of ownership, independence and control. Previous studies amongst enclosures owners in Somaliland by Gaani (2002) and in Ethiopia by Keene (2008) and McCarthy et al. (2003) have shown that individuals felt that they could better utilize and manage the land if they owned it. However, in some instances as indicated in research findings by Keene (2008), the allocation of grazing commons to individual private holders is also common when the state believes or assumes that privatization through individualization will encourage a more responsible use of the land. While the elements of individual willingness and government support for the {{establishment of}} enclosures in Chepareria are evident; the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>here</b> lies in the realization that, by establishing enclosures, individuals in Chepareria not only have independence in land management and utilization but also gain the accruing land use/management benefits as observed by Saxer (2014) in Chepareria.|$|E

40|$|In this study, Turkish {{foreign policy}} (FP) during the Özal (1983 - 1993) and Erdo&# 287;an eras (2003 - 2012) is {{comparatively}} analyzed. There {{are two main}} motivations in conducting this research. The first one {{is related to the}} arguments that the Erdo&# 287;an leadership has been pursuing a novel FP line compared to the past experiences of the Turkish Republic. This study suggests that even if it is an advanced form based on a serious theoretical and conceptual ground, the Erdo&# 287;an leadership’s FP is an extension of Özal leadership’s FP line. Considering their common goals to make Turkey first a regional and later a global actor, it is hypothesized that both leaderships have pragmatically evaluated Turkey’s potential in accordance with their identity definitions and shaped their FP approaches and practices according to their identity perceptions and paradigms. It is also hypothesized in this respect that similar identities bring about similar FP understandings and practices. Therefore, the second goal of the dissertation is to employ constructivism with its identity-oriented brand so as to explain Turkish FP in two different time periods. In this context, the social construction processes of both leaderships’ identities have been particularly highlighted. Subsequently, the FP approaches and the corresponding FP principles in both eras have been discussed and the impact of identity on their FP understandings as well as policy practices has been studied. With a view to analyzing the reflection of these FP approaches and principles to the practical level, bilateral relations between the USA and Turkey are elaborated with an eye to these two allies’ common interests in the Middle East, Balkans and Central Asia. In this manner, while this study seeks to demonstrate the similarities in terms of FP approaches and policy practices of both Özal and Erdo&# 287;an leaderships, it aims to explain the differences at the practical level again from a constructivist point of view. The last goal of this thesis is to make an academic contribution to the literature by suggesting the accuracy of the holistic constructivist approach to explain the FP practices and find out their roots. Holistic constructivism seeks to take the domestic and international as two faces of a single social order and underlines the importance of accommodating all factors affecting the identities and interests of state. Thus, this dissertation proposes that FP of a country, like Turkey, cannot be analyzed only with the role of agents. Even if these agents might be extraordinarily influential, other factors such as structure might be also determining. However, the <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>here</b> is how the agents see and perceive the structure as well as other determining factors of FP and define the course of FP of their countries. In dieser Studie wird die türkische Außenpolitik während der Özal- (1983 - 1993) und Erdo&# 287;an-Epochen (2003 - 2012) vergleichend analysiert. Es gibt zwei Hauptmotive bei der Durchführung dieser Forschung. Die erste bezieht sich auf das Argument, das die Erdo&# 287;an-Fürhung eine neuartige außenpolitische Linie im Vergleich zu den bisherigen Erfahrungen der türkischen Republik verfolgt. Diese Studie weist darauf hin, dass die außenpolitischen Prinzipien und ihre Anwendung unter Erdo&# 287;an weitgehend eine Erweiterung der außenpolitischen Linie Özals darstellen. An dieser Stelle wird hervorgehoben, dass ein ähnliches politisches Selbstverständnis eine entscheidende Rolle für ähnliche Konzepte und Handelungen in der Außenpolitik spielen...|$|E
