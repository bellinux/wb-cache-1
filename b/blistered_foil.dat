Shelf life restrictions of the blister pack components can be problematic for low volume users due to the requirement to purchase larger quantities.

40|$|The aim {{of present}} work is {{cultivation}} of probiotic bacteria L. acidophilus, B. breve and B. longum {{in such a}} way that the culture forms cells clusters or comprehensive biofilm on the variety of free carriers. Biofilm formation of L. acidophilus on the silica from point of view bile and acid tolerance in gastrointestinal tract was studied. While the number of living cells in planktonic form (planktonic form) at pH 1 fell by 30 %, the viability of the biofilm cells was maintained to 90 % under the same environmental conditions. The biofilm culture showed also the protection against environment contained bile. Furthermore, the possibilities of drying procedures of biofilm cultures used as commercial technologies in pharmaceutical industry were studied. The comparison of freeze-drying and fluidization bed drying showed, that freeze-drying is more suitable method, which is able to achieve higher amount of viable cells after drying than fluidization bed drying. The effectivity of freeze-drying method is dependent on the selection of suitable cryprotective medium. In this case, about 90 % higher viability after freeze drying was achieved in comparison with fluidization bed drying. Finally, the industrial processing of probiotic strains into the solid dosage form was studied. Tablets should be produced at hardness between 70 and 90 N and water activity of tablet mixture can be maintained below 0. 3. Consequently, the drying step of the tablets in a hermetically closed space with at least 10 % of silica gel must be ensured. Thereafter, the tablets contain (5. 4 ± 0. 7) 109 viable cells after 6 months of drying process. Capsule production technology has no significant effect on the cell‘s viability during production. The triplex <b>blistering</b> <b>foil</b> for primary <b>blistering</b> of probiotic capsules was chosen. The triplex foil, which has low values of water vapour transition rate (0. 07 g H 2 O / (m 2 × day) and oxygen transition rate (0. 01 cm 3 /m 2 × day), was chosen. Other studied <b>blistering</b> <b>foils</b> commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry are not suitable for long storage of solid dosage forms contained probiotics...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of cold forming, an aluminum-based {{laminate}} film is simply pressed into a mold {{by means of a}} stamp. The aluminum will be elongated and maintain the formed shape. In the industry these blisters are called cold form <b>foil</b> (CFF) <b>blisters.</b> The principal advantage of cold form <b>foil</b> <b>blisters</b> is that the use of aluminum offers a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date. The principal disadvantages of cold form <b>foil</b> <b>blisters</b> are: the slower speed of production compared to thermoforming; the lack of transparency of the package (a therapy compliance disadvantage); and the larger size of the blister card (aluminum can not be formed with near 90 degree angles).In cold forming aluminium is offering a near complete barrier for water and oxygen, allowing an extended product expiry date.|$|R

Experiments to date have looked at the trapping of helium in 2000 Å films and the resulting film deformation as well as the spectroscopic properties of the implanted helium with the aim of better understanding blister formation mecsb give rise to a helium depleted zone, surrounding each blister, we use a proton microbeam on a helium implanted, <b>blistered</b> Al <b>foil</b> as a means of testing this hypothesis. Helium concentration is measured using elastic resonant proton backscattering at 2. 2 MeV with a spatial resolution of 3 μm. Results and their significances to blister formation are presented...|$|R

40|$|H 2 -blisters are metal bubbles {{filled with}} {{hydrogen}} molecular gas resulting from recombination processes of protons in metal lattice. Bubble formation depends on many physical parameters, for instance: proton energy, proton flux, or {{the temperature of}} an exposed sample. Up to now no metallic sample that has been exposed to conditions prevalent in the interplanetary medium has been returned to Earth. Therefore, a direct evidence that blistering appears in space is missing. However, blistering is certainly a candidate of degradation processes which may occur in space. It could {{play an important role}} in the solar sail technology, where the performance of the sail is significantly affected by both the sail geometry but especially by optical properties of sail materials. Thus, both theoretical and laboratory studies of the blistering process have to be performed. The here presented model simulates the growth of molecular hydrogen bubbles on metallic surfaces. Additionally, it calculates the decrease of reflectivity of the by <b>blistering</b> degraded <b>foils.</b> First theoretical results show that the reflectivity of an Aluminum foil decreases by about 27...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{fatigue and}} {{oxidation}} {{data were obtained}} for 62 brazed specimens of 3 iron-, 3 nickel-, and 1 cobalt-base alloy. Fluidized bed thermal cycling was conducted over the range 740 / 25 C employing 10 cm long single-edge wedge specimens. Immersion time was always 4 minutes in each bed. Types of test specimens employed in the program include those with brazed overlays on the specimen radius, those butt brazed at midspan and those with a brazed foil overlay on the specimen radius. Of the 18 braze overlay specimens, 5 generated fatigue cracks by 7000 cycles. Thermal cracking of butt brazed specimens occurred exclusively through the butt braze. Of the 23 butt brazed specimens, 7 survived 11, 000 thermal cycles without cracking. Only 2 of the 21 foil overlaid specimens exhibiting cracking in 7, 000 cycles. <b>Blistering</b> of the <b>foil</b> did occur for 2 alloys by 500 cycles.
