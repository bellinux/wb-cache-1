5|$|Various {{parts of}} the {{mushroom}} display characteristic color reactions to chemical tests commonly used in mushroom identification. The cap cuticle will turn a blackish color with {{the application of a}} drop of potassium hydroxide (KOH), iron sulfate (FeSO4) solution, or ammonia solution. The mushroom flesh turns grayish-green to greenish <b>black</b> <b>with</b> a drop of FeSO4, and olive to greenish <b>black</b> <b>with</b> KOH or NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> glossy skins and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|E
25|$|In the 1998 survey, blacks (34%) {{were nearly}} {{four times as}} likely as whites (9%) to have answers that {{identified}} them as being of the most anti-Semitic category (those agreeing with at least 6 of 11 statements that were potentially or clearly antisemitic). Among <b>blacks</b> <b>with</b> no college education, 43% responded as the most anti-Semitic group (vs. 18% for the general population). This percentage fell to 27% among <b>blacks</b> <b>with</b> some college education, and 18% among <b>blacks</b> <b>with</b> a four-year college degree (vs. 5% for the general population).|$|R

5|$|The American crow is all <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> {{iridescent}} feathers. It {{looks much}} like other all-black corvids. They {{can be distinguished}} from the common raven (C. corax) because American crows are smaller and from the fish crow (C. ossifragus) because American crows do not hunch and fluff their throat feathers when they call.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet play-by-play {{was done}} by Nikolai Ozerov. In the style of that time, the Soviets did not {{televise}} anything during the pre-game, intermissions or post-game.

After the games, the broadcast simply ended and Soviet television networks returned to regular programming.|$|E

50|$|Personal {{backgrounds}} play a huge role {{in terms}} of holding prejudiced versus tolerant views. Among <b>black</b> Americans <b>with</b> no college education, 43% fell into the most antisemitic group (versus 18% for the general population) compared to that being only 27% among <b>blacks</b> <b>with</b> some college education and just 18% among <b>blacks</b> <b>with</b> a four-year college degree (versus 5% {{for those in the}} general population with a four-year college degree). That data from the ADL's 1998 polling research shows a clear pattern.|$|R
5|$|The {{adult male}} of the {{nominate}} subspecies, S. c. carolinensis, has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), {{and a black}} band on the upper back. The wing coverts and flight feathers are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are <b>black</b> <b>with</b> broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
5|$|The bill of the {{specimen}} is <b>black</b> <b>with</b> a yellowish tip, and the cere is also <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> feathers {{on the upper}} side, almost to the nostrils. The lores are naked, and {{the upper part of}} the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the nape and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as hackles), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-buff spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the scapular feathers, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is <b>black</b> <b>with</b> browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, cinnamon-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with <b>black,</b> <b>with</b> that of the female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is <b>black</b> <b>with</b> white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech is without a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E

The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament. Like the Ardennais, it is an easy keeper, able to survive outdoors in all seasons, even in the harsh climatic conditions sometimes seen in Morvan and Nievre.|$|E

5|$|Black was the {{overriding}} colour for this period, with one exception. Streamlined locomotives Nos. 6245–6248 were outshopped at Crewe in 1943 painted plain black. The following two batches, Nos. 6249–6255, constructed without streamlining, were also painted unlined black; the lettering and numerals {{on all these}} locomotives was in serif style coloured yellow with red shading. From 1946 onwards de-streamlined locomotives were mostly repainted in <b>black</b> <b>with</b> LMS-style lining. The lining comprised a broad maroon centre with fine straw yellow edging. Lettering and numbers were in a sans-serif Grotesque font, coloured yellow with an inner maroon line. By the end of 1947, 29 of the 37 locomotives were painted thus.|$|E
