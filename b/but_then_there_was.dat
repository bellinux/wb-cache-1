60|$|My {{heart was}} like lead, and I felt bad enough, Heaven knows; <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{plenty of work}} to be done, which kept my {{thoughts}} from becoming too much for me.|$|E
60|$|Fenn had {{not spoken}} to him at breakfast, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little table talk at Kay's. Perhaps {{the quality of the}} food {{suggested}} such gloomy reflections that nobody liked to put them into words.|$|E
60|$|FLORRIE. Yes, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{so many of}} them, {{one never}} looks, I suppose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{children}} are mentioned {{a few times}} after The Banker’s death <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no more mention of their whereabouts.|$|R
3000|$|... [...]. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{difficulty}} with the continuity of such operator. In fact the operator ℋ from (16) having [...]...|$|R
60|$|Bobby Frog did {{not quite}} see his way to assent to that. The waterfalls on the iceberg were bigger, he admitted, {{than those in the}} pantomime, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not so much glare and glitter around them.|$|E
60|$|There {{was nobody}} about. Perhaps he might break in somehow. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing {{to get to}} work with. He could not kick the door down. No, he must give it up, and the ferrets' breakfast-hour must be postponed. Possibly Harvey might be able to think of something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just as I took {{my place}} another round shot hummed by; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a long {{interval}} of silence. With a field-glass every feature {{must have been}} distinguishable to the gunners, and I {{had no doubt that}} they were waiting for orders as to what to do next.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yer honor, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the Union Jack {{floating}} at the masthead. Do {{you think}} the creeturs don't know the differ?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay! that is {{all very}} well; but {{handsome}} is that handsome does. I {{have no objection to}} Alexina marrying, and even Helena; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> Lais--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that," [...] Harz {{answered}} defiantly, [...] "it maybe wise to hang them, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> so {{many other}} men {{that it would be}} wise to hang." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. I knew that. She {{wanted me}} to be useful, so of course I came. I shall stay here this week, and then be back in September." [...] Up to this moment Captain Gunner had not {{received}} any invitation for September, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no reason why he should not do so.|$|E
60|$|Georgie, at length, earned, in this way, quite {{a little}} sum of money. It was nearly all in cents; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one fourpence which a lady gave {{him for a}} four-wheeled wagon that he made. He kept this money {{in a corner of}} his drawer, and, at last, there was quite a handful of it.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first we}} were {{appalled by the}} suggestion. We didn't believe that Peg Bowen was a witch. But to go to her--to seek her out in that mysterious {{woodland}} retreat of hers which was invested with all the terrors of the unknown! And that this suggestion should come from timid Cecily, of all people! <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> poor Pat! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jonas, [...] "there is Oliver, {{though he}} don't play much. He works {{nearly all the}} time. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> Josey, though he has gone home now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not, Sir Wycherly," [...] {{put in the}} vicar, in a consolatory manner; [...] "you {{have had}} a sharp attack, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a good {{constitution}} to withstand it." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "It may {{surprise}} you, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also rights issues concerning {{the design of}} the unique Batmobile design used in the show, and possibly a separate issue regarding some of the costumes as well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|This {{circumstance}} {{may serve}} to give a notion [...] Of the high talents of this new Vauban: [...] But the town ditch below was deep as ocean, [...] The rampart higher than you 'd wish to hang: [...] <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a great want of precaution [...] (Prithee, excuse this engineering slang), [...] Nor work advanced, nor cover'd way was there, [...] To hint at least 'Here is no thoroughfare.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have that, your honor, {{many and}} many a time; and it's little I cared for it. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a place to}} go into, and dry clothes to put on, and a warm male to look forward to, with perhaps a drop of the crater afterward; and that makes all the {{difference}} in the world. What we are going to do to-night, sorra of me knows." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few days}} there were hopeful signs, and the physicians, deceived by them, said they thought the President would recover. This was glad news to Theodore Roosevelt. Yet he lingered on, fearful to go away, lest the news should prove untrue {{and he should be}} needed. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a still {{brighter}} turn, and he thought of his own family, and of the fact that one of his children was again ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally--amongst {{those of}} your own order. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> very little {{difference}} between the aristocracies of every race in the world. It is the bourgeoisie which tells, which sets its stamp upon a nation's character." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{have told}} them all about it, and I have kept things up; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> so many {{who want to see}} you, and so many things that you alone could settle and manage." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{others that}} may only seek to set fires {{during times of}} great stress. Some of the {{symptoms}} of pyromania are depression, conflicts in relationships, and poor {{ability to cope with}} stress and anxiety.|$|R
60|$|The {{corners of}} the room were rounded into niches. Three of these were filled with statues of {{gigantic}} proportions. Their beauty was Grecian, their deformity Egyptian, their tout ensemble French. In the fourth niche the statue was veiled; it was not colossal. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a taper ankle, a sandalled foot. De L'Omelette pressed his hand upon his heart, closed his eyes, raised them, and caught his Satanic Majesty--in a blush.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{felt very}} much like that, too. It was not a bit like what it was when we took that brig; I felt cool enough when we jumped on to her deck. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no noise to speak of, while the row this morning was tremendous. I tried to cheer when the men did, but I could not hear my own voice, and I don't know whether I made any sound or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lillie, however, {{surveyed}} the scene, {{the first night}} that she took possession, with a quiet determination to re-modernize on the very earliest opportunity. What would Mrs. Frippit and Mrs. Nippit say to such rooms, she thought. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> time enough to attend to that. Not a shade of these internal reflections was visible in her manner. She said, [...] "Oh, how sweet! How perfectly charming! How splendid!" [...] in all proper places; and John was delighted.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{may be as}} {{the weather}} proves. I warrant me your legs would be a-weary before you had {{followed}} its bed into the Rocky Mountains; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> seasons when it might be done without wetting a foot." ...|$|R
6000|$|Young Morse {{saw that}} the safest plan was to admit the truth of her surmise. [...] "Oh, well, I never did have any hand in the actual mining, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> plenty of other work to be done." ...|$|R
5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} without a clock, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> usually a rule {{preventing}} a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states that players may not delay their move beyond {{the time that it}} takes for their partner to make three moves.|$|R
6000|$|The {{case was}} {{becoming}} serious. {{it was now}} past midnight. The hotels at Skiplake and Henley would be crammed; and we could not go round, knocking up cottagers and householders {{in the middle of}} the night, to know if they let apartments! George suggested walking back to Henley and assaulting a policeman, and so getting a night’s lodging in the station-house. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> the thought, “Suppose he only hits us back and refuses to lock us up!” ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Baker did {{go up to}} town, leaving Adela to Miss Todd's hospitality. She did go up, but {{in doing}} so {{resolved}} to return as soon as possible. Sir Lionel was now in the Paragon nearly every other day. To be sure, he did generally call in Montpellier Terrace on the alternate days. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a reason for that. They had to talk about George and Caroline. What possible reason could there be for his going to the Paragon? ...|$|E
60|$|The whole {{household}} {{soon became}} {{in a state}} of bustle with the preparations for the early departure of Mr. Ferrars. It seemed difficult to comprehend how filling a portmanteau and a carpet-bag could induce such excited and continuous exertions. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> so much to remember, and then there was always something forgotten. Mrs. Ferrars was in her bedroom surrounded by all her maids; Mr. Ferrars was in his study looking out some papers which it was necessary to take with him. The children were alone.|$|E
50|$|Christus {{has had a}} sideproject since fall 2007 that {{is called}} Black Jesus - the name was later changed to Black Jezus and then changed back to Black Jesus. When he left Negative, at first people thought Christus had {{disappeared}} <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> dates announced in February.|$|R
50|$|The {{same idea}} applies if K is a {{commutative}} ring and V is a module over K.K can even <b>be</b> a rig, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no additive inverse.If K is not commutative, the distinct operations left scalar multiplication cv and right scalar multiplication vc may be defined.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story can}} be seen in two ways: from an adult's perspective, or from that of a child's innocence. The soldier's tales could very well be lies {{in order to get the}} girls to help him, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the chance that he could be telling the truth.|$|R
