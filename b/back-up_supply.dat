40|$|AbstractA {{facility}} location problem considers locating {{a certain}} number of facilities with the objective of finding their best locations. For most real life situations, it is more realistic to consider the requirement of satisfying a demand with multiple facilities in order to ensure a backup supply. The <b>back-up</b> <b>supply</b> is necessary especially for public or emergency service location problems where a covered demand may not be serviced if its designated facility is engaged serving other demands. Moreover, this issue is more likely to occur when the number of demand locations is much higher. In this study we consider two classic location models, the p-median and maximal coverage location, and compare their performances with respect to five decision criteria under Q-coverage requirement. For this purpose we generate random problem instances and solve each instance with both models for different Q-coverage values. Our comparisons reveal the tradeoffs in selecting the location model for a given problem when the decision maker assesses the performance with multiple criteria...|$|E
40|$|Most public {{utilities}} depend {{on electric power}} to function, so it is paramount that a constant power source is available. These {{public utilities}} get their supply from the public mains {{and in the case}} where the public mains fails a back-up power source is necessary to ensure the continuous operation of the public utilities. Switching the public utilities from the mains to the back-up power creates a period of time when the utilities will be without power and the longer the time delay the lesser the efficiency of the public utilities. The stress of manual switching also makes the utilities inefficient. Examples of these public utilities are street lights, traffic lights, water pumps and traffic sign indicators. A device that completely eliminates the stress of manually switching public utilities from the mains supply to the <b>back-up</b> <b>supply</b> is the Automatic Mains and Phase Changer (AMPC). It also greatly reduces the power outage time delay experience during the switching. This paper reports a research that evaluates the relationship between the stress levels during manual load switching and the stress levels using the AMPC for automatic load switching.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{system has}} a high {{potential}} in the future, since it is clean, environmental friendly and has secure energy sources.

40|$|Recently, {{power system}} {{customers}} {{have changed the}} way they interact with public networks, playing a more and more active role. End-users first installed local small-size generating units, {{and now they are}} being equipped with storage devices to increase the self-consumption rate. By suitably managing local resources, the provision of ancillary services and aggregations among several end-users are expected evolutions in the near future. In the upcoming market of household-sized storage devices, sodium-nickel chloride technology seems to be an interesting alternative to lead-acid and lithium-ion batteries. To accurately investigate the operation of the NaNiCl 2 battery system at the residential level, a suitable thermoelectric model has been developed by the authors, starting from the results of laboratory tests. The behavior of the battery internal temperature has been characterized. Then, the designed model has been used to evaluate the economic profitability in installing a storage system in the case that end-users are already equipped with a photovoltaic unit. To obtain realistic results, real field measurements of customer consumption and solar radiation have been considered. A concrete interest in adopting the sodium-nickel chloride technology at the residential level is confirmed, taking into account the achievable benefits in terms of economic income, <b>back-up</b> <b>supply,</b> and increased indifference to the evolution of the electricity market...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel control strategy {{for a high}} penetrated wind based hybrid Remote Area Power Supply (RAPS) system. The proposed RAPS system consists of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) based variable speed wind turbine and a battery energy storage system with a dump load for DC bus voltage control and a diesel generator as a <b>back-up</b> <b>supply.</b> An integrated control approach based on active and reactive power balance of the proposed RAPS system has been proposed and developed {{with a view to}} regulate the voltage and frequency within an acceptable bandwidth. The proposed integrated control algorithm is implemented by developing controller for the individual system components in the RAPS system including wind energy conversion system, diesel generator, battery storage and dump load while coordinating their responses to achieve optimal operation. The optimised operation for the proposed RAPS system is realised by operating the wind turbine generator on its maximum power extraction mode while restricting the operation of diesel generating system at low-load conditions. In addition to the detailed model, which associated with non-linear high order characteristic of each system components, a linearlised model of the RAPS system is presented with a view to compare the active power sharing among the system components. The suitability of the proposed control strategy has been tested under varying system conditions including fluctuating wind and variable load...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectives:To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} rabies {{and the effectiveness of}} post-exposure treatment (PET) in Pakistan. Methods:Rabies cases admitted from July 1993 to December 1994 to a public rabies isolation hospital were analyzed. Two samples (one sample each from a separate peripheral site) of a single batch of sheep brain vaccine (SBV) were also tested for potency by the National Institute of Health (NIH) test in May 1997. Results:Forty patients were admitted with a history of clinical rabies. The median age was 22 years and 55 % were under 15. Thirteen (23 %) victims did not receive any vaccine; the remaining 27 (67 %) received SBV only, and of these, 16 (40 %) received a full course of SBV. No rabies immunoglobulins (RIG) or cell culture vaccines were administered. There were frequent power blackouts and no <b>back-up</b> <b>supply</b> at the public hospital. In-house potency testing of the vaccine batch by the manufacturer was adequate, athough it was not tested by the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended NIH test. Samples of SBV of the same batch collected at the peripheral sites showed no potency. Rabies incidence was estimated to range between 7. 0 to 9. 8 cases per million annually. Conclusion:A multi-sectorial approach is needed to decrease rabies incidence in Pakistan. Public and healthcare practitioner education on prompt and appropriate PET, especially the use of cost-effective cell culture intradermal regimens, is needed urgently. The NIH test should be employed for vaccine potency testing. An independent agency is needed for monitoring vaccine quality and strategies are needed for maintaining cold chain. SBV should be replaced by locally manufactured second-generation cell culture rabies vaccine. Purified equine rabies immunoglobulin (ERIG) should be manufactured locally to meet national needs. Furthermore, effective dog control strategies should be implemented to decrease the rabies reservoir...|$|E
