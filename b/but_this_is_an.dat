5|$|A Gothic {{screen was}} also {{added to the}} Norman nave at Peterborough, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> {{architectural}} oddity with no precedent or successor. The screen is composed of three enormous open arches, the two outer ones being much wider than that which frames the central door. The overwhelming composition is somewhat spoilt by the later porch {{and the fact that}} two towers of very different height pop up from behind the screen. Despite this, it is {{regarded as one of the}} supreme masterpieces of Gothic, revealing the enormous diversity and imagination of English medieval architects.|$|E
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E

The film had a wide release, with theater advertisements known in Kansas, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. Some later advertisements for the film may have been referring to the Kalem Company's Tangled Lives released in May 1911. The Kalem film is extant. Rare typographical errors also resulted in the Reliance Film Company having a film of this name in some advertisements, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> error on Tangled Lines.

5|$|The {{month of}} August (Latin: Augustus) {{is named after}} Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so {{because it had been}} the sixth month of the {{original}} Roman calendar and the Latin word for six is sex). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see Julian calendar). According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.|$|E

Analyzing all the possible combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.|$|E

25|$|Hastings {{invested}} $2.5 {{million in}} startup cash for Netflix. Randolph admired the fledgling e-commerce company Amazon {{and wanted to}} find a large category of portable items to sell over the internet using a similar model. He and Hastings considered and rejected VHS tapes as too expensive to stock and too delicate to ship. When they heard about DVDs, which were available in only a few markets in 1997, they tested the concept of selling or renting DVDs by mail by mailing a compact disc to Hastings' house in Santa Cruz. When the disc arrived intact, they decided to take on the $16 billion home video sales and rental industry. Hastings is often quoted saying that he decided to start Netflix after being fined $40 at a Blockbuster store for being late to return a copy of Apollo 13 <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> apocryphal story that he and Randolph designed to explain the company's business model and motivation.|$|E
25|$|Hinduism {{originated}} on the Indian subcontinent. It {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} the world's oldest extant religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of scripture, divided as revealed and remembered, expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the Vedas and the Upanishads as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The , a treatise excerpted from the , is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: Dharma, Samsara, Karma, and Moksha. Hinduism is sometimes called a polytheistic religion, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, monism and even atheism. For instance, the Advaita Vedanta school holds {{that there is only one}} causal entity (Brahman), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism worship Vishnu and Shiva in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the parabrahman and atman). A number of scholars even consider the Samkhya school of thought to have atheistic leanings.Weightman (1997). Pg 263.|$|E

500|$|The [...] {{structure}} {{contains some}} typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates, {{such as the}} presence of highly cornified outer layers, renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands. Local thickenings (often called warts) are common, such as those found on toads. The outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece, in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes. Amphibians often eat the sloughed skin. Caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin. The similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial. Lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages.|$|E
