The framework consists of additional data structures stored at the nodes and of special control packets that traverse the network, estimate the goodness of their paths and update accordingly the data structures of the nodes. The performance of the framework, which has been implemented on an event-driven OBS network simulator, is evaluated on several network topologies and compared with that obtained with centralized routing path optimization. The simulation results show that the distributed routing path selection framework significantly improves the performance of OBS networks by reducing data loss and that it attains a performance comparable to that of the centralized algorithm. The results also suggest that the framework is robust to changes in its parameters.

There have been several deflection routing techniques as contention resolution. While contention is resolved by traditional deflection routing, it can not guarantee that the control packet will reserve all wavelengths successfully to the destination on the alternate path, especially when traffic load is high in a network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Deflection Routing with Virtual Wavelength Assignment (DR-VWA) algorithm in order to provide more guarantee of resource for loss-sensitive traffic bursts. The proposed DR-VWA scheme 1) dynamically decides the alternate path with the least traffic load and 2) allows high-priority bursts in terms of loss to be assigned wavelengths virtually over the path. The proposed scheme is evaluated through simulation, and it is shown that significant improvement with regard to burst loss and wavelength conversion cost can be achieved.

In the proposed architecture, all processing and buffering are concentrated at the network edge and <b>bursts</b> are <b>routed</b> over an optical transport core using dynamic wavelength assignment. It is assumed that there are no buffers or wavelength conversion in core nodes and that fast tuneable laser sources are used in the edge routers.

40|$|Abstract: With {{the growing}} demand of {{bandwidth}} and the development being made in the optical components technology, the IP over DWDM using optical burst switching {{seems to be the}} best solution {{to take advantage of the}} huge capacity of the fiber and accommodate high traffic of information. In this architecture the optical network is seen as an optical cloud with intelligent edges capable to interpret the IP address and store the information in electronic domains as well as checking and correcting errors. Optical burst switching [1, 3] achieves better bandwidth exploitation because all the fiber wavelengths are shared among the bursts without resource pre-allocation and the whole wavelength capacity can be used by a burst. However with higher load, contention increases, and hence the number of dropped burst increases leading to a big lost of performance. Several methods can be used to lower the burst-dropping probability such as wavelength conversion [5] and the use of buffers [6], but these solutions are still not there due to the high cost and the immaturity of technology. In this paper we will propose another method where the burst is segmented into several parts of equal length and in case of contention only the parts at the beginning, causing the conflict, will be discarded. We will analyze and compare this method with other practical methods: delayed <b>burst,</b> deflection <b>routing.</b> The segments of burst can be used to carry different class of service since the dropping probability of each segment depends on its position in the burst. The parts at the end have the smallest probability to be dropped. We prove trough analysis and simulation that the segmented burst improves the performance and is more suitable for traffic with several class of service.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} exact {{emulation}} of two types of optical queues: (i) N-to- 1 output-buffered multiplexers with variable length bursts, and (ii) N × N outputbuffered switches with variable length bursts. For both queues, the delay of a packet is known upon its arrival. As such, one can emulate such queues by finding a delay path that yields the exact delay for each packet. For emulating the delay of a packet in such queues, {{in this paper we}} consider a mutlistage feedforward network with optical crossbar Switches and fiber Delay Lines (SDL). For any fixed delay d, there exist multiple delay paths in such a network. A delay path is feasible if it satisfies the following three constraints: (i) conflict constraint: no more than one packet can be scheduled at the same input/output ports of each crossbar switch at the same time, (ii) causality constraint: no packet can be scheduled before its arrival, and (iii) strong contiguity constraint: packets in the same <b>burst</b> should be <b>routed</b> through any fiber delay lines contiguously. By the worst case analysis, we find sufficient conditions for the numbers of delay lines needed in each stage of such a feedforward network to achieve exact emulation of both queues. For N-to- 1 output-buffered multiplexers, our sufficient conditions are also necessary when each burst contains exactly one packet. By computer simulation, we also show that the number of delay lines in each stage can be greatly reduced due to statistical multiplexing gain. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{studies the}} {{blocking}} performance of optical burst switching (OBS) networks using a sequential office control (SOC) state-independent deflection routing policy. We show that unprotected deflection routing may destabilize OBS resulting in higher blocking probabilities than if bursts were not deflected but simply blocked. This study {{was motivated by}} the well-known destabilizing effect that alternative routing has on circuit switching in classical telephony networks. We propose two forms of protection to guard against destabilization: 1) wave-length reservation, which is analogous to trunk reservation in circuit switching; and, 2) preemptive priority, which is {{a new form of}} protection where bursts that have not been deflected are given preemptive priority over bursts that have been deflected. Our main contribution is a one-moment reduced-load approximation to evaluate the blocking performance of OBS networks using deflection routing protected by either wavelength reservation or preemptive priority. Our reduced-load approximation relies on the usual assumptions of link independence and Poisson distributed link arrivals. We quantify the error admitted in making these two assumptions via simulation. Using our reduced-load approximation, we evaluate the blocking performance of protected and unprotected deflection routing in several randomly generated networks. The chief conclusion of our study is that deflection routing in OBS should be given some form of protection to avoid destabilization resulting from upward load variations, and in terms of blocking performance, preemptive priority is the best form of protection for OBS. We use simulation to verify that our conclusions remain valid for a realistic traffic scenario.

40|$|Abstract—There {{has been}} {{proposed}} the method for evaluating the routing cost {{which is based on}} the account of fractal properties of the network traffic and pre-set limits for the latency time and the number of lost packets. This method calculates the fractality of the traffic and the value of bursts. Depending on these parameters, the routing costs are recalculated and the optimal one is chosen for transferring. If the traffic is the usual Poisson flow, then the routing is not changed. If the traffic has strong long-term dependence and high <b>bursts,</b> then the <b>routing</b> cost increases in proportion to the value of Hurst exponent and the extend of bursts. The proposed method for evaluating the routing cost with regard to fractal properties of the traffic has been tested on an open platform of graphical simulation of HUAWEI networks in the existing network of "Market-port " company. During the experiment the network parameters have been defined (bandwidth, load capacity of the channels, the number of lost data, transmission delays, fractality) in the real "Market-port" network. Then the network similar to a real one has been modelled and configured {{in such a way that}} transmission time, the number of lost packets, the average latency time of the packets in the network coincides with the data having been defined in a real network of "Market-port " company. The source of the implementations of traffic in the experiments was the realization of the real network traffic captured in the network of "Market-port " company and the model implementation generated by these parameters.

However, a major concern for OBS networks is contention on outgoing data channels, which can result in burst loss. Therefore, contention resolution is necessary in order to handle the case where more than one burst are destined to go out of the same output port at the same time. This work explores the contention problem that occurs in optical burst switching. In order to control the contention and pave the way to optical burst switching to be more suitable for Internet traffic, we propose to use OBS with segmentation where a burst is broken into many small (in size) segments. In case of contention we remove only the segments involved in the contention. We also propose a hybrid architecture where part of the wavelengths is used for OBS and the others are used for wavelength routing technique. The edge node can use both of them and send the data according to the class of traffic. Another solution consists of controlling the network load. Indeed, under heavy traffic, the loss in OBS increases. Therefore one needs to control the traffic and keep the network away from congestion. Here we propose a protocol that reports the losses in the network to the edge nodes, so they can adjust the traffic accordingly. We propose also another protocol to retransmit the lost bursts.
