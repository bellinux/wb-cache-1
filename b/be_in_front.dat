5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national flags, including corporate flags and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} flags are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other flags in the group. Its flagpole must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other flags, it must be {{at the head of the}} marching procession, or if carried with a row of flags in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the object.|$|E
5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed {{to the right of the}} Indian flag.|$|E

25|$|The first {{theory for}} {{targeting}} {{is based on}} the proximity of the arms in relation to the body. It is said that when the elbows are pulled back behind the body, this targets the long head more. To target the short head, the elbows should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the body.|$|E
25|$|When in {{formation}} and standing, the color bearer keeps the military colors near his foot, holding {{his right hand}} down on the rod and his left hand on the rod, at his chest level. The rod's low end must <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of his right foot. When saluting from this position, the military colors are bowed at horizontal for the Romanian President and other heads of state and at 45degrees for the other civil and military staff. When marching, the color bearer holds the military colors vertically. If the unit is walking more than 100m, the rod is introduced inside the scarf's muff. When traveling by vehicle, the color bearer with the military color stands inside the unit commander's car. During the march, the color bearer salutes by bowing the military colors at 45degrees, regardless the person. When two military units cross each other (either {{one or both of}} them are marching {{in formation}}) the military colors are bowed for salute at 45degrees. In case of raining, snowing or strong winds, the military colors are protected by a transparent plastic cover.|$|E

25|$|With {{respect to}} the display, placing and {{precedence}} of the national flag by both itself and {{in relation to other}} flags, the Department has made a number of suggestions. No flag or pennant should be flown above the national flag. When the flag is carried with another flag, or flags, it should be carried in the place of honour— that is on the marching right, or on the left of an observer towards whom the flags are approaching. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be carried on the immediate left of the national flag, or, as seen by an observer when the flags are approaching, on the immediate right of the national flag. In the event of a display of crossed staffs, the national flag should be to the right and to the fore— that is {{to the left of the}} observer who is facing the flag. Its staff should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other flag or flags.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught his sleeve in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. The head of one of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden picture frame, though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming too obvious, Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in the picture. For example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
25|$|The Egyptians {{were one}} of the first major civilizations to codify design {{elements}} in art. The wall painting done {{in the service of the}} Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images based on what they knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of tiered space, where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. Also, you may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.|$|E

Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "". Coto credited this to his idea for the fourth season saying, [...] "What I really wanted to do this season is make the episodes that I as a Star Trek fan would have to see.

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might take a picture of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E

Designed as a permanent crisis resolution mechanism for the countries of the Euro area, the ESM issues debt instruments in order to finance loans and other forms of financial assistance to the involved Member States; finally, (3) the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG), whose final version was signed on 2 March 2012 by the leaders of all euro area members and eight other EU member states, and entered into force on 1 January 2013.
