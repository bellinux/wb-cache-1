50|$|The Speak & Spell {{was created}} by a small team of {{engineers}} led by Paul Breedlove, himself an engineer, with Texas Instruments (TI) during the late 1970s. Development began in 1976 with an initial budget of $25,000, as an outgrowth of TI's research into speech synthesis. The completed proof version of the first console utilized TI's trademarked Solid State Speech technology to store full words in a solid state format similar to {{the manner in which}} calculators of the time stored numbers. Additional purchased cartridges (called expansion modules) could be inserted through the <b>battery</b> <b>receptacle</b> to provide new solid-state libraries and new games. This represented the first time an educational toy utilized speech that was not recorded on tape or phonograph record (as with Mattel's See 'n Say line or the earlier Chatty Cathy dolls).|$|E
50|$|Cold-weather {{battery holder}} was {{available}} from 1969 and minor changes {{were applied to}} the appearance. The cold-weather battery holder allowed the relocation of the battery by using a long cord with a dummy <b>battery</b> carrier and <b>receptacle</b> for the original battery holder to then {{be placed in a}} warm pocket to avoid battery failure due to cold. Along with the availability macro lenses for close work, a selection of extension tubes and in both the standard bayonet and the outer bayonet were available as well. As well as a compact and convenient variable extension was also available. For more flexibility a bellows system was available as well as a slide copier accessory.|$|R
