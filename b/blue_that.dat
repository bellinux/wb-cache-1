5|$|During World War II, {{the design}} of the jersey was {{modified}} because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort. This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original <b>blue</b> <b>that</b> had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.|$|E
5|$|On {{their first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Crimson Tide extended their lead further to 31–0 after Yeldon scored on a three-yard run that capped a drive that featured a 34-yard Yeldon run and 42-yard Amari Cooper reception. On the Kentucky possession that ensued, the Wildcats scored their only points of the game on a 30-yard Maxwell Smith touchdown pass to Javess <b>Blue</b> <b>that</b> made the score 31–7. The touchdown was the first allowed by the Alabama defense since the Texas A game and ended a 14-quarter touchdown-free streak for the Crimson Tide.

The actress Peggy Joyce - her wealth was such that Cole Porter wrote a lyric that said My string of Rolls-Royces, is longer than Peggy Joyce's - gave regular $200 bonus prizes, or primes.

25|$|Han purple in its pure form is {{actually}} a dark <b>blue,</b> <b>that</b> is close to electric indigo. It is a purple {{in the way the}} term is used in colloquial English, i.e., it is a color between red and blue. It is not, however, a purple in the way the term is used in color theory, i.e. a nonspectral color between red and violet on the 'line of purples' on the CIE chromaticity diagram. Perhaps the most accurate designation for the color would be to call it 'Han indigo', although it could also be regarded as a bright shade of ultramarine (classifying ultramarine as a color and not a pigment).|$|E

The appearance was often said to be on the night before a death.|$|E
