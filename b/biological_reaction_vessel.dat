Oil bubblers can {{tolerate}} an underpressure in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> Oil is sucked into a sump in lieu of air.

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for the evaluation of}} the activity of an antifungal agent administered as a gas. This system is composed of a batch-flow type <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel,</b> a gas flow system, and a microscopic observation system. The agar plate was prepared on the ceiling of the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel,</b> and the mycelium of a fungus (Aspergillus niger or Rhizoctonia solani) was inoculated onto it. After preincubation at 25 degrees C for 24 h, the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> was connected to the gas flow system. An appropriate hypha was selected, and its elongation rate was measured. Then a sample holder containing an antifungal compound was inserted into the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> from the side hole to saturate the atmosphere inside with its vapor. The retardation or inhibition of the hypha elongation was observed on a television monitor and recorded on a video tape recorder. The antifungal compound was then removed, and the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> was flushed with air. If the hypha lived, it began to elongate again. By this method, antifungal activity of seven odor compounds could be evaluated quantitatively within several hours...|$|R

30|$|Methods: Radiolabelling was {{performed}} with a partly automated synthesis device, by applying a previously reported 18 F-labelling procedure [2]. Dry [18 F]KF/K 222 complex {{was formed by}} azeotropic drying of the cyclotron produced [18 F]fluoride at 120 °C.

The stannylated precursor was added to the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> in dimethylacetamide (DMA) or MeCN. When using DMA as a solvent, MeCN was first evaporated at 120 °C. The <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> was then heated at 120 °C and samples for analytical radio-HPLC were collected during 30 minutes every 5 minutes. When using MeCN as a solvent, the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> was heated at 80 °C and samples for analytical radio-HPLC were collected during 75 minutes every 15 minutes. Deprotection has been performed by changing the solvent (DMA to THF), evaporating THF to dryness and then treating with 48 % HBr.|$|R
30|$|The {{prepared}} celluloses as {{starting materials}} were then treated individually in a semi-flow HCW system. The conversion {{system and its}} operational procedures as explained elsewhere were adapted for this study [24 – 26]. Briefly, about 0.4  g of cellulose was treated individually within a 5 -mL <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> The ambient distilled water from a water tank was flown through the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> by a pump to pressurize the system at 10  MPa controlled by a back-pressure regulator. To raise the temperature, the preheating unit monitored by thermocouples was used to reach at the designated temperatures of 230, 250 and 270  °C for about 20  min under 10  MPa and remains constant for additional 15  min, totally 35  min. In addition, another heating unit was installed at the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> to maintain the designated temperature in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel,</b> into which the HCW was passed through at the flow rate of 10  mL/min.|$|R
40|$|The {{two most}} {{characteristic}} properties of an ultrasonic wave are {{the frequency and}} the power. It is therefore important to determine the power in a given reactor. This {{can be done by}} calorimetry, i. e. by measuring the temperature rise in the vessel during sonication starting at thermal equilibrium with the surroundings (classic calorimetry) [1 – 3]. However, the classic ultrasonic calorimetry has drawbacks. In particular it is difficult to evaluate the temperature rise at thermal equilibrium, because the relevant initial time and temperature intervals are small and measurement errors in the temperature readings are large. Also the initial temperature response of the probe is complex [4]. The authors propose to start the calorimetric measurement at thermal disequilibrium, i. e. with a lower temperature in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel.</b> During sonication the temperature in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> rises faster than in the surrounding and passes thermal equilibrium. The acoustic power transferred to the vessel at thermal equilibrium can then be calculated. The method consists of: • Setting up the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> at lower temperature than the surroundings (ultrasonic bath or air). • Measuring temperature rise in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel</b> and the surroundings during sonication. • Determine the temperature rise at intercept by interpolation and calculate the ultrasonic power in the <b>reaction</b> <b>vessel...</b>|$|R

To characterize the seal integrity, approximately 1 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was sealed and heated at 165 °C for 1 h. In all experiments, < 14 μL of volume was lost (< 1.5 %).
