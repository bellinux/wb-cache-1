40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 02 - 04, 1967 / Marriott Motor Hotel, Washington, D. C. This paper {{discusses}} the design concepts {{of a central}} data system (CDS) for more efficient" flexible data management and its application in an advanced deep space solar probe. The design features high data sampling rates, programmable data processing, <b>bulk</b> data <b>storage</b> capability (for data sampled during periods of noncommunication), and standard experiment package/CDS interfaces. The basic system concept is based upon sampling each data point at a high rate in a fixed sequence and allowing a central processor to select, process, and format sampled data into a highly efficient format for transmission. The CDS is programmable so that data formatting and processing may be reprogrammed via the command link to optimize data transmission for unexpected conditions. Preliminary design efforts have indicated that a CDS to process data from seven particle and fields experiments can be designed, using present state-of-the-art components, to weigh 16. 5 lb and consume 5. 4 watts (not including <b>bulk</b> data <b>storage</b> <b>unit)</b> from the DC/DC converter...|$|R
40|$|Storing grain in <b>bulk</b> <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> {{results in}} grain packing from {{overbearing}} pressure, which increases grain <b>bulk</b> density and <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> capacity. This study compared pack factors of hard red winter (HRW) wheat in vertical storage bins using different methods: the existing packing model (WPACKING), the USDA Risk Management Agency (RMA) method, and the USDA Farm Service Agency Warehouse Licensing and Examination Division (FSA-W) method. Grain bins containing HRW wheat were measured in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Packing {{was measured in}} corrugated steel bins and reinforced concrete bins with diameters ranging from 4. 6 to 31. 9 m (15. 0 to 104. 6 ft) and equivalent level grain heights ranging from 4. 1 to 41. 6 m (13. 4 to 136. 6 ft). The predicted masses of compacted stored wheat based on WPACKING, RMA, and FSA-W were compared to the reported mass from scale tickets. Pack factors predicted by WPACKING ranged from 0. 929 to 1. 073 for steel bins and from 0. 986 to 1. 077 for concrete bins. Pack factors predicted by the RMA method ranged from 0. 991 to 1. 157 for steel bins and from 0. 993 to 1. 099 for concrete bins. Pack factors predicted by the FSA-W method ranged from 0. 985 to 1. 126 for steel bins and from 1. 012 to 1. 101 for concrete bins. The average absolute and median differences between the WPACKING-predicted mass and reported mass were 1. 64 % and - 1. 26 %, respectively, for corrugated steel bins and 3. 75 % and 2. 16 %, respectively, for concrete bins. In most cases, WPACKING underpredicted the mass in corrugated steel bins and overpredicted the mass in concrete bins. Comparison of the RMA-predicted mass and reported mass showed an average absolute difference of 4. 41 % with a median difference of 1. 91 % for HRW wheat in steel bins and an average absolute difference of 3. 25 % with a median difference of 1. 03 % for concrete bins. For the FSA-W-predicted mass versus reported mass, the average absolute and median differences were 3. 40 % and 3. 86 %, respectively, for steel bins and 4. 34 % and 3. 50 %, respectively, for concrete bins. Most of the mass values were overpredicted by both the RMA and FSA-W methods. Some of the large differences observed for concrete bins {{can be attributed to}} the unique geometry of these bins and the difficulty in describing these bin shapes mathematically. Overall, compared to the reported mass, WPACKING predicted the mass of grain in the bins with less error than the current RMA and FSA-W methods. Some of the differences may be because the RMA and FSA-W methods do not include the effects of grain moisture content, bin wall type, and grain height on pack factors...|$|R

The results of simulation show that optimizing the dimensioning of a <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> is as important as choosing the fittest technology. Furthermore we provide evidence that the optimal set-up of a <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> can adapt to exogenous factors such as grid tariff and local electricity price characteristics.

Latent heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> enable an isothermal energy storage and release, which is applicable in two-phase industrial processes. This concept has been demonstrated in low-temperature applications such as heating and refrigeration; however experience in the high temperature range is limited. Cost effective implementation of <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> demands cost effective designs of the <b>storage</b> <b>unit.</b> Due to the usually low thermal conductivity in the phase change materials, a fin design has been developed to counter this deficiency.

In this paper, the interactions and energy trading decisions of a number of geographically distributed <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> are studied using a novel framework based on game theory. In particular, a noncooperative game is formulated between <b>storage</b> <b>units,</b> such as PHEVs, or an array of batteries that are trading their stored energy. Here, each <b>storage</b> <b>unit's</b> owner can decide on the maximum amount of energy to sell in a local market so as to maximize a utility that reflects the tradeoff between the revenues from energy trading and the accompanying costs. Then in this energy exchange market between the <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> and the smart grid elements, the price at which energy is traded is determined via an auction mechanism. The game is shown to admit at least one Nash equilibrium and a novel proposed algorithm that is guaranteed to reach such an equilibrium point is proposed.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to investigate heat storage in a heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> utilizing a phase change material (PCM). This included finding an optimal geometry for heat transfer from the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings, finding an effective thermal conductivity of the PCM, and combine these in an overall PCM heat storage model. The advantage of using a PCM is that the PCM can store large amounts of heat in liquid phase as latent heat. This will contribute to a stable heat release to the surroundings. Methods for enhancing the heat transfer from a PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> to the surroundings were studied. The research considered both free convection and radiation heat transfer. Further objectives were to find a suitable geometry of fins for heat rejection to the surroundings. Heat transfer from two different fin arrangements to the surroundings were investigated, a fin array and fin channels. The dimensions of the geometries were optimized. Both geometries showed satisfying results, but {{it was concluded that}} fin channels were preferable to a fin array. A heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was investigated experimentally. The experiments considered two different setups, supplying heat to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>units</b> top surface, and supplying heat to the bottom surface. The results were compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from the top surface showed good agreement compared to results from numerical simulations. The heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> heated from below proved that heat transfer by free convection in the liquid phase {{had a significant impact on}} the melting pace of the PCM. The comparison with results from numerical simulations did however not show an immediate agreement. The effective thermal conductivity of the PCM was found based on the experiments and compared to literature values. An uncertainty analysis was performed on the obtained effective conductivity. The results showed that the method employed for studying the effective conductivity was inaccurate. An overall heat storage model was developed to combine heat supply, heat storage and heat distribution. The simulations were performed using PCM as well as PCM with aluminium foam to enhance the heat distribution in the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> and the heat transfer rate to the surroundings. The heat supplied to the heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was based on calculations of batch combustion of wood. The results showed that none of the tests for the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> or the optimization of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit,</b> reached the requirements of heat transfer to the surroundings set for the model. The length of the PCM heat <b>storage</b> <b>unit</b> was also proved to be excessive...|$|R
