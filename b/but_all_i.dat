500|$|The {{match was}} hailed {{as one of the}} most {{exciting}} finals in modern times, with Alan Hansen declaring: [...] "the best final ever." [...] Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier hailed his players after the match: [...] "When you play in a European final, you are looking for immortality. People remember who was playing and when you look at programmes from finals you just recall the facts of the game. These boys have produced a game which will be remembered for a long time — and that is thanks to Alavés too." [...] Houllier hit back at critics that had labelled Liverpool as boring before the match: [...] "Maybe we are a boring side — as I seem to keep reading — but I will put up with that. We must have scored 122 of our 123 goals on the counter attack, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> know is that our total this season is the third highest in Liverpool's history." ...|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town <b>but,</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that." ...|$|E
500|$|Thom Brennaman {{immediately}} {{hailed the}} game {{as one of the}} greatest upsets in the history of sports; Charissa Thompson told coach Jerry Moore that it was [...] "one of the greatest upsets in college football history." [...] Many media outlets described it as one of, if not the greatest, upsets in the history of college football. The win marked the first time an FCS team had beaten a ranked FBS program. [...] Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports wrote that: [...] "This game was supposed to be the prime example of what had gone wrong in money hungry college football. The powers that be had expanded the season a couple years back, adding an extra game so big schools could bring in cream-puff opponents while collecting millions in revenue. Michigan had never played a I-AA opponent in its history. Now we know why, the Wolverines were ducking them. Instead of an easy tune-up for Michigan, Appalachian State leaves with its most profound victory ever and a check for $400,000 that was supposed to be their pay for getting punished." [...] Sports Illustrated writer Stewart Mandel wrote that he felt [...] "utterly unqualified" [...] to put the game into perspective, and said [...] "there's no logical reason whatsoever this should have happened. But it did. And it wasn't the slightest bit fluky." [...] He also expressed disappointment that he would not be able to vote for the Mountaineers in his AP Poll ballot, explaining that [...] "it may well turn out that Michigan was grossly overrated, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> know is this: There will not be 25 other teams that accomplish more this opening weekend than Appalachian State did Saturday. There won't even be five." [...] Pat Forde of ESPN.com called it [...] "the most astonishing college football result I can remember," [...] saying that [...] "we'll still be talking about it a few decades from now. Especially in the locker rooms of every huge underdog, where they'll say, 'If Appalachian State can beat Michigan, why can't we shock the world, too?.'" [...] He felt the upset was particularly impressive because upsets of such a magnitude do not happen often in college football. The New York Times writer Viv Bernstein called the game [...] "one of the biggest upsets in college football history" [...] and called it [...] "a stunning upset by any measure." [...] The game was the lead story on SportsCenter and was the cover story for the following week's edition of Sports Illustrated; Appalachian State wide receiver Dexter Jackson was featured on the cover, which has the headline [...] "Alltime Upset: Appalachian State Stuns No. 5 Michigan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I wish I could say that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E

[...] "Parents {{of a child with}} autism everywhere need to hear it, functionally and spiritually. I knew this story had to be told and given my access as a talent representative in the entertainment industry, I felt it was my responsibility to make that happen." [...] Through Grandin's agent, Gerson Saines asked to meet Grandin for lunch. [...] "She came in wearing her cowgirl shirt—-in her very Temple way, in her very Temple walk. I realized that there were people staring at her, and in a different lifetime I might have been one of them, <b>but</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> could think of was, 'I can't believe how lucky I am to be here.

2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|According to Washburn, he and Cimino {{spent three}} days {{together}} in Los Angeles at the Sunset Marquis, hammering out the plot. The script eventually went through several drafts, evolving into a story with three distinct acts. Washburn did not interview any veterans to write The Deer Hunter nor do any research. [...] "I had a month, that was it," [...] he explains. [...] "The clock was ticking. Write the fucking script! <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{had to do was}} watch TV. Those combat cameramen in Vietnam were out there in the field with the guys. I mean, they had stuff that you wouldn't dream of seeing about Iraq." [...] When Washburn was finished, he says, Cimino and Joann Carelli, an associate producer on The Deer Hunter who went on to produce two more of Cimino's later films, took him to dinner at a cheap restaurant off the Sunset Strip. He recalls, [...] "We finished, and Joann looks at me across the table, and she says, 'Well, Deric, it's fuck-off time.' I was fired. It was a classic case: you get a dummy, get him to write the goddamn thing, tell him to go fuck himself, put your name on the thing, and he'll go away. I was so tired, I didn't care. I'd been working 20 hours a day for a month. I got on the plane the next day, and I went back to Manhattan and my carpenter job." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. <b>But</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{would like to say}} is that it has broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E
