40|$|The {{validity}} of the discrete element method (DEM) {{as a tool to}} predict impact damage of fruit was investigated for 'Jonagold' apples.

The parameters for the contact force models, needed as input for the simulations, and the bruise prediction model were determined on the same batch of apples, utilized in the validation experiments. The validations indicated that DEM can predict in an acceptable way apple bruise damage (bruise depth).

Often it seemed as if he were rummaging through a toy <b>box,</b> <b>shaking</b> this and striking that, then moving on blithely to the next thing.

40|$|In this paper, {{we focus}} on the {{development}} and performance of the 1 -g model testing system to monitor the liquefaction occurrence of saturated soils, under subsequent one-dimensional shake table tests. The system is composed of one-dimensional laminar box, cone penetration system, soil model, system for hydraulic soil pumping to achieve loose soil deposit, instrumentation and associated testing hardware. In order to simulate the free-field conditions in the laboratory, the laminates slide on each other using rollers placed between each laminate. The static calibration test results demonstrate that the friction effects between the laminates and the rollers are satisfactorily low. The loosest and the most liquefiable sand deposit is prepared inside the laminar box by hydraulic filling process and subjected to four subsequent shaking tests at different intensities. First, the laminar <b>box</b> and <b>shake</b> table performance is verified by using time-histories of acceleration and displacement test results. Then, the measured data inside the soil and on the laminates are compared with the numerical model. The previously calibrated numerical model UBCSAND which shows the seismic loading conditions in the free field is used in the simulations. Those shake table test results and the numerical simulations of the box and the soil indicate that the usefulness of the laminar <b>box</b> system for <b>shaking</b> table tests is satisfactory for dynamic model tests in 1 -g gravity.

40|$|For the {{experimental}} study of liquefaction of saturated sands by shaking, there are generally two methods. One is by dynamic triaxial and dynamic simple shear tests, {{and the other is}} by means of a sand <b>box</b> on the <b>shaking</b> table. However, each has its merits and demerits. The major drawback with the latter method is that the stress conditions in the sand box cannot be regulated strictly. To cope with this problem, the author contrived a means of applying the consolidating pressure by use of compressed air, {{in order to reduce the}} disadvantage to some extent. In this experiment, it was confirmed that, for a given apparent density of the sand, the occurrence of its liquefaction is also determined by the ratio of shearing stress in the sand and initial effective pressure. Then, in order to evaluate {{the experimental}} results by a shaking sand box; both dynamic triaxial and simple shear tests were also made for the same kinds of sands, thereby comparing between the three respective techniques. The differences in the angle of internal friction at the time of a liquefaction were further examined for these methods.

40|$|Seismic loading {{reduces the}} bearing {{capacity}} of soils and large settlement can occur. These effects {{have not been}} considered adequately in design codes. In this dissertation, the seismic bearing capacity and settlement of soils have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. The theoretical analysis was developed for a dry c-φ soil, considering {{the effect of the}} cohesion, and the vertical and the horizontal acceleration components. The seismic bearing capacity was examined by using the concept of shear fluidization of soil, while the seismic settlement was examined using the sliding block model technique. The theory of the shear fluidization of soil was developed for c-φ soils and extended the original application which was limited to cohesionless soils. The experiments were conducted on dry and saturated cohesionless soil using a <b>shake</b> <b>box</b> designed and constructed during this research. The <b>shake</b> <b>box</b> was designed to subject the soil to simple shear conditions during shaking. Model footings, constructed from lead, were used to study the seismic bearing capacity and settlement of shallow footings. The parameters investigated include the horizontal acceleration, the frequency, the safety factor, the footing width, the footing shape and size, the depth of embedment, and the relative density of the soil. The theoretical and the experimental results showed good agreement. Significant reduction in the bearing capacity of the soil, even at low acceleration (e. g. < 0. 3 g) and excessive settlement can occur if the seismic bearing capacity becomes lower than the allowable static bearing capacity. Seismic design procedures are proposed and illustrative examples are used to demonstrate the design procedures...|$|R

For certain parameter values, the particle becomes regularly chattered at one of the walls, thereby loosing all its kinetic energy relative to that wall. The number of container oscillations between two chattering events depends in a fractal manner on the parameters of the system. In contrast to a vertically vibrated particle, for which chattering is claimed to be the generic fate, the horizontally shaken particle can become trapped on a periodic orbit and follow the period-doubling route to chaos when the coefficient of restitution is changed. We also discuss the case of a completely elastic particle, and the influence of friction between the particle and the bottom of the container. Comment: 11 pages RevTex.
