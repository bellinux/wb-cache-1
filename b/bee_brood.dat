5|$|Brood parasites {{occur in}} several bee {{families}} including the apid subfamily Nomadinae. Females of these bees lack pollen collecting structures (the scopa) {{and do not}} construct their own nests. They typically enter the nests of pollen collecting species, and lay their eggs in cells provisioned by the host bee. When the cuckoo bee larva hatches it consumes the host larva's pollen ball, and often the host egg also. The Arctic bee species, Bombus hyperboreus, in particular are an aggressive species that attack and enslave other bees of the same subgenus. However, unlike many other <b>bee</b> <b>brood</b> parasites, they have pollen baskets and often collect pollen.|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study {{was carried out}} in Galicia, NW Spain, in order to estimate the magnitude of honey bee colony losses and to identify potential risk factors involved. A total of 99 samples from 99 apiaries were collected in spring using simple random sampling. According to international guidelines, the apiaries were classified as affected by colony loss or asymptomatic. Each sample consisted of worker <b>bees,</b> <b>brood</b> and comb-stored pollen. All worker <b>bees</b> and <b>brood</b> samples were analysed individually in order to detect the main honey bee pathogens. Moreover, the presence of residues of the most prevalent agrotoxic insecticides and acaricides was assessed in comb-stored pollen. The general characteristics of the apiaries and sanitary information regarding previous years was evaluated through questionnaires, while the vegetation surrounding the apiaries sampled was assessed by palynological analysis of comb-stored pollen. The colony loss prevalence was 53. 5 % (CI 95 %= 43. 2 - 63. 9) and Nosema ceranae was found to be the only risk factor strongly associated with colony loss. The decision tree also pointed out the impact of the Varroa mite presence while variables such as apiary size, the incorrect application of Varroa mite treatments, and the presence of Acarapis woodi and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) were identified as possible co-factors...|$|R

50|$|The {{model for}} the {{population}} dynamics is exponential growth when <b>bee</b> <b>brood</b> are available, and exponential decline when no brood is available. In 12 weeks, the number of mites in a western honey bee hive can multiply by (roughly) 12.

40|$|In 2001 and 2002, {{studies were}} {{conducted}} on a pollen substitute formulated for easy home preparation. Tests were done with free flying honey bee colonies. In 2001, pollen supply was restricted with pollen traps in 9 experimental colonies.

In 2002 the design was similar except that the bee bread treatment was replaced with a control treatment without pollen trap or supplements. The pollen substitute was readily consumed by <b>bees,</b> and <b>brood</b> development (fraction of larvae achieving pupa) did not differ among treatments. In 2002, longevity of bees was highest in colonies fed pollen substitute even though this group had a pollen trap. The average concentration of haemolymph protein did not differ among treatments in 200 1, but in 2002 this value was significantly highest in colonies without a pollen trap.

50|$|Of contact pesticides, {{dust and}} {{wettable}} powder pesticides {{tend to be}} more hazardous to bees than solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. When a bee comes in contact with pesticides while foraging, the bee may die immediately without returning to the hive. In this case, the queen <b>bee,</b> <b>brood,</b> and nurse bees are not contaminated and the colony survives. Alternatively, the bee may come into contact with an insecticide and transport it back to the colony in contaminated pollen or nectar or on its body, potentially causing widespread colony death.|$|E
50|$|Freshly created beeswax comb {{may appear}} white at first. After the first {{generation}} of bees hatch from the brood comb it becomes yellow and darker in color (Comb that is exclusively used for honey comb appears lighter). Brood comb that is used for subsequent generations of <b>bee</b> <b>brood</b> becomes darker and darker until it almost appears black. The cocoon sticks to the hexagonal walls of the cell and is not removed. The change in broodcomb color is due to the cocoon that remains inside the cell and also small soil and pollen particles that are tracked in by the bees over time.|$|E
50|$|Comb {{trapping}} method (also {{known as the}} swarming method) is based on interrupting the honey <b>bee</b> <b>brood</b> cycle. It is an advanced method that removes capped brood from the hive, where the Varroa mites breed. The queen is confined to a comb using a comb cage. At 9-day intervals, the queen is confined to a new comb, and the brood in the old comb is left to be reared. The brood in the previous comb, now capped and infested with Varroa mites, is removed. The cycle is repeated. This complex method can remove up to 80% of Varroa mites in the hive.|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} criteria on scientific studies at honeybee colonies are colony population development. A commonly used division is to estimate capped and uncapped brood areas. At {{this point of}} view, {{it is important to}} measure brood area in colony beside frame of <b>bees.</b> <b>Brood</b> area that contained eggs, larvae, and pupae on the combs in each bee colony has been measured as its size. Assessing a whole colony for strength provides a very good snapshot in time of colony size, brood production and food status. The estimation technique may take a bit of getting used to, but with experience it can be done quickly and accurately. To estimate the total area of capped worker brood cells in the colony can be used usually a 1 x 1 inch wire grid placed over the brood comb to estimate the total square inches of brood for each side of the comb. Another alternative method is digital photography. Measurements of worker brood area are determined by measuring sealed brood to the nearest cm 2 using Adobe Photoshop CS 2 9. 0. This method based on estimating capped and uncapped brood. Colonies with new comb produced a greater area (cm 2) of brood, a greater area (cm 2) of sealed brood...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{species in}} the genus are eusocial, with colony sizes range from very small (two to four bees) to large (>200).

40|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) {{was first}} {{reported on the}} east coast of the United States in 2006. Symptoms of CCD include the rapid loss of adult worker honeybees, few or no dead bees found in the hive, presence of immature <b>bees</b> (<b>brood)</b> and a small cluster of bees with a live queen present, as well as pollen and honey stores still in the hive. Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are a keystone species because they provide a number of pollination services for various ecosystems. They are also extremely important organisms within human society, both agriculturally and economically. With a third of human food coming directly and indirectly from honeybee pollination, colony collapse disorder will have significant economic, ecological, and social impacts if further colony losses are not prevented. The fact that a direct cause has not been determined suggests that CCD is a complex problem with a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors. Possible instigators of CCD include: mites, viral and fungal diseases, increased commercial transportation, decreased genetic diversity, pesticides, {{and a variety of other}} factors. The interaction among these potential causes may be resulting in immunity loss for honeybees and the increased likelihood of collapse. This thesis will discuss the various factors that have been researched as possible causes for colony loss as well as explore the long-term effects that this decline could have.

40|$|Recently it {{has become}} a serious problem that honeybees {{suddenly}} vanish in their colony, which is referred to as a colony collapse disorder（ CCD）. We have made it clear by the field experiments for about four months what effect neonicotinoid pesticides such as dinotefuran and clothianidin have on the occurrence of CCD. Eight colonies consisting of about ten-thousand honeybees in each colony were investigated under the practical beekeeping conditions in our apiary. In this study foods containing dinotefuran of 1 ppm to 10 ppm or clothianidin of 0. 4 ppm to 4 ppm were fed into a beehive. Three levels of concentration were 10 （ high-conc. ）, 50 （ middle-conc. ） and 100 （low-conc. ） times lower than that in practical use. The changes of adult <b>bees,</b> <b>brood</b> and the pesticide intake in each colony were directly examined. They suggest that each colony with the pesticide administered collapses to nothing after passing through a state of CCD, the high-concentration pesticides seem to work as an acute toxicity and the low- and middle-concentration ones do as a chronic toxicity. CCD looks mysterious, but it is just one of situations where a colony dwindles to nothing. We have proposed a CCD occurrence mechanism based on our results. The NMR spectral analyses of dinotefuran and clothianidin in aqueous solution give the speculations that both are thermally stable under the heating condition of 50 ℃ × 24 hours and dinotefuran is radiationally stable under the ultraviolet-irradiation condition of 310 nm× 50 W/m 2 but clothianidin is unstable...|$|R
40|$|Honeybee larvae and pupae are {{extremely}} stenothermic, i. e. they strongly depend on accurate regulation of brood nest temperature for proper development (33 – 36 °C). Here we study {{the mechanisms of}} social thermoregulation of honeybee colonies under changing environmental temperatures concerning the contribution of individuals to colony temperature homeostasis. Beside migration activity within the nest, the main active process is “endothermy on demand” of adults. An increase of cold stress (cooling of the colony) increases the intensity of heat production with thoracic flight muscles {{and the number of}} endothermic individuals, especially in the brood nest. As endothermy means hard work for bees, this eases much burden of nestmates which can stay ectothermic. Concerning the active reaction to cold stress by endothermy, age polyethism is reduced to only two physiologically predetermined task divisions, 0 to ∼ 2 days and older. Endothermic heat production is the job of bees older than about two days. They are all similarly engaged in active heat production both in intensity and frequency. Their active heat production has an important reinforcement effect on passive heat production of the many ectothermic bees and of the brood. Ectothermy is most frequent in young bees (<∼ 2 days) both outside and inside of brood nest cells. We suggest young <b>bees</b> visit warm <b>brood</b> nest cells not only to clean them but also to speed up flight muscle development for proper endothermy and foraging later in their life. Young <b>bees</b> inside <b>brood</b> nest cells mostly receive heat from the surrounding cell wall during cold stress, whereas older bees predominantly transfer heat from the thorax to the cell wall. Endothermic <b>bees</b> regulate <b>brood</b> comb temperature more accurately than local air temperature. They apply the heat as close to the brood as possible: workers heating cells from within have a higher probability of endothermy than those on the comb surface.

The differential individual endothermic and behavioral reactions sum up to an integrated action of the honeybee colony as a superorganism...|$|R
