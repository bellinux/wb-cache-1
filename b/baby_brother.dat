5000|$|In 1970, {{they signed}} with King Records as the <b>Baby</b> <b>Brothers,</b> but their three {{releases}} did not sell well.

50|$|Alex, a 10-year-old child, {{develops}} {{an unhealthy}} obsession with morbid imagery, which marks him asocial.

25|$|Another {{view is that}} a stutter (stammer) is {{a complex}} tic. This view is held for the {{following}} reasons. It always arises from repetition of sounds or words. Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling, the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction. They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour. The more tension that is felt, the less one likes change. The more change, the greater can be the repetition. So, when a 3 year old finds {{he has a new}} <b>baby</b> <b>brother</b> or sister he may start repeating sounds. The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech. More boys stammer than girls, in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl. This is because the male Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis is more active. Whilst they are pumping out more cortisol than females under the same provocation, they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive.|$|E

These two women and a girl represent political saviours who facilitate the deliverance of a city, community, and an individual via persuasive words.
