5|$|In 1926, Parker Brothers Inc. republished The Mansion of Happiness in its {{original}} form, with minor modification to game spaces. The game included the circular end space introduced by J. Bufford in the third edition. This sixth edition used a folding game board with a fabric and cardboard pocket on the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the game board. The teetotum was made using a wood dowel and cardboard hexagon.|$|E
5|$|A {{squall line}} (also {{known as a}} quasi-linear {{convective}} system or QLCS) is a line of thunderstorms forming along or ahead of a cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. It contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight-line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Strong straight-line winds can occur where the squall line is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo. Tornadoes can occur along waves within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP), where mesoscale low-pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes which develop within the summer season are known as derechos, and they move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can be present, sometimes associated with a heat burst.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E

5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D doppler radar, high winds on the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we apply}} the theory {{predicting}} neighbor dis-tribution of arbitrary random graphs {{to analyze the}} network coverage of the peers in unstructured peer-to-peer(p 2 p) networks that use TTL-based flooding mechanism for search and query. However, we find that for many cases, the theory cannot be directly applied to obtain correct estimate of network coverage due {{to the presence of}} certain types of edges that we refer as cross and <b>back</b> <b>edges.</b> It is also observed that the presence of cross and <b>back</b> <b>edges</b> in the p 2 p networks reduce the cover-age of the peers and also generates large number of redundant messages, thus wasting precious bandwidth. We refine the theory and develop a model to estimate the network coverage of the peers in the presence of cross and <b>back</b> <b>edges.</b> We simulate our model for different networks with various degree distribution properties. The results indicate that our models provide good estimates of second neighbor and network coverage distribution. We perform a case study of the Gnutella networks to ana-lyze the effects cross and <b>back</b> <b>edges</b> on network coverage and message complexity in these networks. Based on our study, we propose a new bootstrapping algorithm for Gnutella networks named HPC 5 that sub-stantially improves the network coverage and message complexity. The results have been validated using simulations...|$|R
50|$|A {{convenient}} {{description of}} a depth first search of a graph {{is in terms of}} a spanning tree of the vertices reached during the search. Based on this spanning tree, the edges of the original graph can be divided into three classes: forward edges, which point from a node of the tree to one of its descendants, <b>back</b> <b>edges,</b> which point from a node to one of its ancestors, and cross edges, which do neither. Sometimes tree edges, edges which belong to the spanning tree itself, are classified separately from forward edges. If the original graph is undirected then all of its edges are tree <b>edges</b> or <b>back</b> <b>edges.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{the mixed}} doubles version of curling, a rule called a power play was {{introduced}} in the 2016-17 season. Each team can exercise the power play in one end per game, only when they have the hammer (throwing the last rock in an end). Instead of positioning the rock in the house on the center line, it is placed to a position straddling the edge of the eight-foot circle, with the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the stone touching the tee line. The opponent's guard stone is place in line with the stone {{in the house and the}} hack. The power play cannot be used in an extra end.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourteen}} dorsal vertebrae are weakly amphicoelous, or concave on both ends, {{typical of}} basal sauropodomorphs. Also typical {{is the presence}} of blade-like keels on the undersides of the first to third dorsal vertebrae, which are not seen elsewhere; additionally, the dorsal vertebrae near the front have the typical low, short, and somewhat plate-like neural spines. Unusually, however, the same kinds of neural spines are also seen in the last three dorsal vertebrae, which is only otherwise seen in basal saurischians like Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor. In the middle and back dorsal vertebrae, the top back corner of the neural spines project outward to produce a concave <b>back</b> <b>edge,</b> which is seen in some other basal sauropodomorphs but not Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, Yunnanosaurus, and Riojasaurus.|$|E
50|$|Suppose block M is a dominator {{with several}} {{incoming}} edges, {{some of them}} being <b>back</b> <b>edges</b> (so M is a loop header). It is advantageous to several optimization passes to break M up into two blocks Mpre and Mloop. The contents of M and <b>back</b> <b>edges</b> are moved to Mloop, {{the rest of the}} edges are moved to point into Mpre, and a new edge from Mpre to Mloop is inserted (so that Mpre is the immediate dominator of Mloop). In the beginning, Mpre would be empty, but passes like loop-invariant code motion could populate it. Mpre is called the loop pre-header, and Mloop would be the loop header.|$|R

25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, the crease is a certain area demarcated by white lines painted or chalked {{on the field of}} play, and {{pursuant}} to the rules of cricket they help determine legal play in different ways for the fielding and batting side. They define the area within which the batsmen and bowlers operate. The term crease may refer to any of the lines themselves, particularly the popping crease, or to the region that they demark. Law 7 of the Laws of Cricket governs the size and position of the crease markings, and defines the actual line as the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the width of the marked line on the grass, i.e., the edge nearest to the wicket at that end.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebrae}} of {{the back}} are not pneumatised. They are amphiplatyan with an oval cross-section and bear low spines with a hexagonal profile. Just below {{the top of the}} spine on the front and <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> a small beak-shaped process is present. In 1998 interpreted as a reduced hyposphene-hypanthrum complex, a system of secondary vertebral joints shown by many theropods, it was by the 2011 study seen as a pair of attachment points for tendons, as identified in 2006 in Compsognathus. Exceptionally, with the thirteenth vertebra the two rib joint processes, the parapophysis and the diapophysis, are positioned at the same level. The five sacral vertebrae have not yet fused into a real sacrum. The tail vertebrae are platycoelous with low spines and backward slanting chevrons.|$|E
500|$|If squall lines form over arid regions, a {{duststorm}} {{known as}} a haboob may result from the high winds in their wake picking up dust from the desert floor. [...] Well behind mature squall lines, a wake low can develop on the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the rain shield, {{which can lead to}} a heat burst due to the warming up of the descending air mass which is no longer being rain-cooled.|$|E

500|$|A {{squall line}} is an {{elongated}} line of severe thunderstorms that can form along and/or {{ahead of a}} cold front. In the early 20th century, the term {{was used as a}} synonym for cold front. The squall line contains heavy precipitation, hail, frequent lightning, strong straight line winds, and possibly tornadoes and waterspouts. Severe weather in the form of strong straight-line winds can be expected in areas where the squall line itself is {{in the shape of a}} bow echo, within the portion of the line that bows out the most. Tornadoes can be found along waves within a line echo wave pattern, or LEWP, where mesoscale low pressure areas are present. Some bow echoes in the summer are called derechos, and move quite fast through large sections of territory. On the <b>back</b> <b>edge</b> of the rain shield associated with mature squall lines, a wake low can form, which is a mesoscale low pressure area that forms behind the mesoscale high pressure system normally present under the rain canopy, which are sometimes associated with a heat burst. This kind of storm is also known as [...] "Wind of the Stony Lake" [...] (Traditional Chinese:石湖風 – shi2 hu2 feng1, Simplified Chinese: 石湖风) in southern China.|$|E

500|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the skull was the different-shaped teeth (heterodonty) for which the genus is named, which is {{otherwise}} mainly known from mammals. Most dinosaurs (and indeed most reptiles) have a single type of tooth in their jaws, but Heterodontosaurus had three. The beaked {{tip of the snout}} was toothless, whereas the hind part of the premaxilla in the upper jaw had three teeth on each side. The first two upper teeth were small and cone-shaped (comparable to incisors), while the third on each side was much enlarged, forming prominent, canine-like tusks. These first teeth were probably partially encased by the upper beak. The first two teeth in the lower jaw also formed canines, but were much bigger than the upper equivalents. The canines had fine serrations along the <b>back</b> <b>edge,</b> but only the lower ones were serrated at the front. Eleven tall and chisel-like [...] "cheek"-teeth lined each side of the posterior parts of the upper jaw, which were separated from the canines by a large diastema (gap). The cheek-teeth increased gradually in size, with the middle teeth being largest, and decreased in size after this point. These teeth had a heavy coat of enamel on the inwards side, and were adapted for wear (hypsodonty), and they had long roots, firmly embedded in their sockets. The tusks in the lower jaw fit into an indentation within the diastema of the upper jaw. The cheek-teeth in the lower jaw generally matched those in the upper jaw, though the enamel surface of these were on the outwards side. The upper and lower teeth rows were inset, which created a [...] "cheek-recess" [...] also seen in other ornithischians.|$|E
