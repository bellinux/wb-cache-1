50|$|The Neuekrug-Hahausen-Goslar railway is a double-tracked, non-electrified {{main line}} in Lower Saxony in central Germany. The line, which {{runs along the}} {{northern}} edge of the Harz mountains, begins in Goslar and forms a junction with the Brunswick-Kreiensen railway to Seesen and Kreiensen at Neuekrug-Hahausen. Because the <b>branch-off</b> <b>station</b> is passed through nowadays without stopping, it is often called the Goslar-Seesen railway. It is often described in the local area as the North Harz Line (Nordharzstrecke) but the term may cause confusion. The most important, and now the only, intermediate station is Langelsheim.|$|E
