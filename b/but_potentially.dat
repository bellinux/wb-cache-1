5|$|A {{group of}} {{antibodies}} {{can be called}} monovalent (or specific) if they have affinity for the same epitope, or for the same antigen (<b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> different epitopes on the molecule), or for the same strain of microorganism (<b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> different antigens on or in it). In contrast, a group of antibodies can be called polyvalent (or unspecific) if they have affinity for various antigens or microorganisms. Intravenous immunoglobulin, if not otherwise noted, consists of polyvalent IgG. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are monovalent for the same epitope.|$|E
5|$|There are {{circadian}} {{variations in}} CSF secretion, with the mechanisms not fully understood, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> relating {{to differences in}} the activation of the autonomic nervous system {{over the course of}} the day.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or dislodged teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure {{is similar to that}} of the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Bedford Castle {{required}} huge resources. Siege engines were brought from Lincoln, Northampton and Oxfordshire, while carpenters built others on site using timber from Northamptonshire; ropes from London, Cambridge and Southampton; hides from Northampton and tallow from London. Labourers from across Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire were {{gathered by the}} relevant sheriffs, and miners from Hereford and the Forest of Dean. Crossbow bolts were ordered from a depot at Corfe Castle and from the provinces; 43,300 crossbow bolts {{are known to have}} been ordered by the king. Local trees were cut down, and stone quarrying begun to provide ammunition for siege engines. Tents and pavilions for the King were sent from London along with supplies of luxury foods and wine, also for the King. In total, Henry's wage bill for the siege came to Â£1,311; it is uncertain exactly how large Henry's army was, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> there were between 1,600 and 2,700 men present at any one time. To support the siege, Langton instructed his bishops to mobilise one man from every 24 hectares (60 acres) of land they owned and levied a special tax on the churches' estates.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{goes into}} cardiac arrest and is taken into an {{operating}} room she is temporarily stabilized, pending further surgery. She is moved into intensive care, while neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh) is flown in by helicopter {{in case the}} baby has to be delivered prematurely. Robbins and Sloan argue over Torres's treatment; Robbins believes that Torres would not risk endangering the baby, but Sloan argues for saving Torres at all costs. The attending surgeons devise a treatment plan, led by trauma surgeon Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd). As they do so, Torres dreams about the moments preceding the accident. Her dream self sings to Robbins, interspersed with shots of the hospital staff singing and dancing with their own partners. Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) suggests treating Torres with a high-risk <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> effective cardiothoracic procedure she learned from her old mentor, Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington). Her current mentor, Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), refuses to perform it, but when Torres's condition deteriorates and she is rushed back into surgery, Hunt agrees that Yang should attempt the procedure.|$|E

25|$|Uncommonly, {{breast and}} gluteal abscesses can occur due to haematogenous and lymphangiomatous spread. Regional bone {{infection}} (BCG osteomyelitis or osteitis) and disseminated BCG infection are rare complications of BCG vaccination, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> life-threatening. Systemic antituberculous therapy {{may be helpful}} in severe complications.|$|E
25|$|Many {{high-quality}} Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems {{also use}} high platforms at station stops to allow fast and efficient level boarding and alighting, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> leaving hazardous {{gaps between the}} platforms and the buses. Alignment setups such as Kassel curbs help to reduce platform gaps without requiring time-consuming manual alignment at each BRT station stop.|$|E
25|$|Teddesley Hall {{was built}} north-west of Penkridge, on Teddesley Hay. The Hay had been {{acquired}} about two centuries earlier, when the Tudor dynasty disposed {{of the old}} royal forest lands. It was heath and bog land, difficult to cultivate <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> attractive. There the Littletons had Teddesley Lodge, a moated house that had accommodated junior members of the family, including an earlier Fisher Littleton, who had helped recover the family property after the English Civil War.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} construction, {{the medial}} graph, {{coincides with the}} line graph for planar graphs with maximum degree three, but is always planar. It has the same vertices as the line graph, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> fewer edges: two vertices of the medial graph are adjacent {{if and only if}} the corresponding two edges are consecutive on some face of the planar embedding. The medial graph of the dual graph of a plane graph {{is the same as the}} medial graph of the original plane graph.|$|E
25|$|Human iron {{metabolism}} is the set {{of chemical}} reactions that maintain human homeostasis of iron at both the systemic and cellular level. The control of this necessary <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> toxic metal {{is an important part}} of many aspects of human health and disease. Hematologists have been especially interested in systemic iron metabolism because iron is essential for red blood cells, where most of the human body's iron is contained. Understanding iron metabolism is also important for understanding diseases of iron overload, such as hereditary hemochromatosis, and iron deficiency, such as iron deficiency anemia.|$|E
25|$|At the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, Straczynski {{announced}} that a Babylon 5 film was planned to go into production in 2016. It {{is to be a}} reboot of the story, <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> one using old cast members in different roles. Studio JMS would produce it on a budget of $80â100 million if Warner Bros. did not take up the offer. At the 2016 San Diego Comic Con, Straczynski said the film has been delayed until he makes one or two more television series or films, to build up his reputation and ensure the desired $100 million plus, budget.|$|E
5000|$|Trans-Global Highway, highway {{systems that}} would link {{all six of}} the {{inhabited}} continents on Earth.

5000|$|... #Caption: UK directors, {{like those}} at Cadbury facing the {{takeover}} from Kraft, {{are unable to}} use corporate powers to block takeover bids and enrich themselves, <b>but</b> this <b>potentially</b> leaves employees vulnerable to job cuts, or reductions in environmental or ethical standards.|$|R
25|$|Well-known {{minerals}} containing yttrium include gadolinite, xenotime, samarskite, euxenite, fergusonite, yttrotantalite, yttrotungstite, yttrofluorite (a {{variety of}} fluorite), thalenite, yttrialite. Small amounts occur in zircon, which derives its typical yellow fluorescence {{from some of}} the accompanying heavy lanthanides. The zirconium mineral eudialyte, such as is found in southern Greenland, contains small <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> useful amounts of yttrium. Of the above yttrium minerals, most played a part in providing research quantities of lanthanides during the discovery days. Xenotime is occasionally recovered as a byproduct of heavy-sand processing, but is not as abundant as the similarly recovered monazite (which typically contains a few percent of yttrium). Uranium ores from Ontario have occasionally yielded yttrium as a byproduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{group was}} formed in Spring 1958 by Federal Bureau of Investigation agent Jimmy Woo to rescue President Dwight D. Eisenhower from the villainous Yellow Claw. Woo first {{recruits}} Venus and Marvel Boy. He then tries to recruit Namora, who declines but tells Woo where to find a broken <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> useful robot named M-11. While Marvel Boy fixes M-11, Woo asks Jann of the Jungle to take Marvel Boy to extend an invitation to Gorilla-Man, who accepts Woo's offer. The group quickly rescues President Eisenhower and remains together for six months until the federal government, deciding the public is not ready for such a group, disbands it and classifies information about it.|$|E
25|$|On various Internet forums, some gamers have {{expressed}} disapproval of publishers having creative control since publishers {{are more apt}} to follow short-term market trends rather than invest in risky <b>but</b> <b>potentially</b> lucrative ideas. On the other hand, publishers may know better than developers what consumers want. The relationship between video game developers and publishers parallels the relationship between recording artists and record labels in many ways. But unlike the music industry, which has seen flat or declining sales in the early 2000s, the video game industry continues to grow. Also, personal computers have made the independent development of music almost effortless, while the gap between an independent game developer and the product of a fully financed one grows larger.|$|E
