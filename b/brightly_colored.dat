Her paintings then turned into <b>brightly</b> <b>colors</b> and detailed work on folk genre, including women vendors, potters and workers. Figurative works placed emphasis on her subject’s physical appearance. After obtaining her bachelor's degree, she resided {{with her husband}} Angelito Antonio. Being idle for 10 years, she had her solo works exhibited at Metro Gallery in 1976. Ever since then, she had nine one-person shows exhibited at different galleries such as: Luz Gallery and ABC Gallery.|$|R
2500|$|Generally, {{checkered}} beetles are elongated and oval {{in shape}} and range from 3–24 millimeters (.1–1 in). Their entire bodies are covered with bristly hairs, and many display an ornate body color pattern. These often <b>brightly</b> <b>color</b> patterns can be red, yellow, orange, or blue. The antennae are clubbed at the tip for most species, but others can be [...] "clubbed, saw-tooth, or thread-like." [...] The pronotum region is nearly cylindrical and characteristically narrower than the elytra (special hardened front wings), while the head is as wide or wider than the pronotum. Their elytra have tiny pits or depressions, and never expose more than two tergites (dorsal plates).|$|R

50|$|It {{is a low}} growing species, {{typically}} being a foot high or smaller. The leaf {{emerges in}} the early spring and will senesce in late summer. The leaf is roughly triangularly shaped and 15-50 cm in size and held roughly parallel to the ground. The leaf is 3-4 times pinnately compound, <b>brightly</b> green <b>colored,</b> and feels soft to the touch. The stem is round and bicolor, being pinkish or light tan at the base but greenish nearer the branches or leaves. The diploid number is 184.|$|R
5|$|The only finch in its {{subfamily}} {{to undergo}} a complete molt, the American goldfinch displays sexual dimorphism in its coloration; the male is a vibrant yellow {{in the summer and}} an olive color during the winter, while the female is a dull yellow-brown shade which brightens only slightly during the summer. The male displays <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> plumage during the breeding season to attract a mate.|$|E
5|$|The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> {{offshoot}} of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.|$|E
5|$|Cultivars of Hippeastrum {{are popular}} indoor {{ornamental}} plants prized for their large <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> flowers (including red, pink, salmon, orange and white). As such {{they have a}} very important place in the floriculture trade for sale as cut flowers or potted plants. Although the market is dominated by the Netherlands, and South Africa, other areas of production include Israel, Japan and the United States (Florida). Brazil also produces 17 million Hippeastrum bulbs annually.|$|E
5|$|The domes {{are often}} <b>brightly</b> painted: their <b>colors</b> may informally symbolise {{different}} aspects of religion.

5000|$|This {{painting}} {{suggests a}} whirling {{dance of the}} grief-stricken. They inhabit a flattened space, comprising a sculptural congregation of <b>brightly</b> demarcated <b>colors.</b> The vortex of the composition droops down towards the limp body of Jesus off center in the left. Those lowering Christ appear to demand our help in sustaining both {{the weight of his}} body (and the burden of sin Christ took on) and their grief. No Cross is visible; the natural world itself also appears to have nearly vanished: a lonely cloud and a shadowed patch of ground with a crumpled sheet provide sky and stratum for the mourners. If the sky and earth have lost color, the mourners have not; bright swathes of pink and blue envelop the pallid, limp Christ.|$|R
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of <b>brightly</b> <b>colored,</b> {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style gowns and wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a rodent in {{the genus}} Oryzomys of family Cricetidae from {{interior}} western Mexico, {{in the states}} of Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Michoacán. First described in 1901 as a separate species, it was later lumped under O.couesi and the marsh rice rat (O.palustris) until it was reinstated as a species in 2009. It differs from neighboring Oryzomys populations in size and measurements and is a large, <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> species with a long tail and robust skull and molars. Its range has been much impacted by agricultural development, but isolated populations are thought to persist.|$|E

50|$|Nylint {{then moved}} away from {{realistic}} Ford trucks to more modern-looking toys—some with futuristic styling. This “Mod Styling Era” phase started about 1966, and by 1968 was {{a significant part of}} the Nylint Product line. Nylint’s Ford toy trucks, while still being manufactured to resemble a full-scale truck, lost some of their Ford detail identity. “Ford” was removed from hubcaps and the Ford hood decal disappeared. New toys introduced were either of the “turbine” cab style or other modern 1970s look. Many were painted in the then-popular fluorescent colors. As part of the marketing strategy, many toys in this era were being geared towards girls with <b>brightly</b> painted <b>color</b> schemes and animal accessories. Although toys from this era may not be as collectible as earlier toys, Nylint’s profits during this period showed their willingness to change with the market.|$|R

In the MacDowell Colony he made friends with the painters Milton Avery, Sally Avery, Giorgio Cavllon, Linda Lindeberg and many others who were among the Fellows of MacDowell Colony. In 1958 Prestopino's landscape paintings were showing abstract tendencies. There is a noticeable cubist influence in his work as well. Much of his more cubist work uses <b>brightly</b> contrasting <b>colors</b> and involves human forms. Wet, sensuous color areas appeared on his canvases. Mythological figures, woods, brooks, fields, islands, mountains were joined-on powerful canvases that showed Prestopino’s new vitality. According to the celebrated photographer Russel Lynes “the sound of the city…gave way to the sounds of the country, the relentless of bricks and pavement and steel to the happy disorder of dappled things.” ...|$|R
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The perianth has six <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The perianth segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, Saigon {{designers}} {{tightened the}} fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Trần Kim of Thiết Lập Tailors and Dũng of Dũng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> áo dài hippy was introduced in 1968. The áo dài mini, a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.|$|E

In 1941, hand-painted patterns on the Coralitos and Arcadia shapes were introduced: Grape, Strawberry, Hibiscus, French Ivy, and Shasta Daisy.|$|R
50|$|Susak {{is perhaps}} best known for the ornate and {{elaborate}} costumes worn by younger women primarily for special occasions such as a wedding or feast day. The costume is made up of a short, <b>brightly,</b> almost neon, <b>colored</b> skirt with multiple ruffled petticoats underneath which gives the wearer the appearance that she is dressed in a ballet tutu. A similar-colored vest is generally worn over a long-sleeved, white chemise. The outfit is accentuated by pink or orange woolen stockings, leather shoes, and a headpiece which matches the colors of the skirt. When wearing this traditional outfit, women generally place one or both hands their hips to emphasize the dress’s uniqueness.|$|R

Wind Cave National Park, established in 1903 in the Black Hills, has an extensive cave network {{as well as a}} large herd of bison. Badlands National Park was created in 1978. The park features an eroded, <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> landscape surrounded by semi-arid grasslands. Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills was established in 1925. The sculpture of four U.S. Presidents was carved into the mountainside by sculptor Gutzon Borglum.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, {{needle-like}} structure used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are <b>brightly</b> <b>colored</b> yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E

25|$|E. imperialis can be {{identified}} from other bees by its relatively large size and relatively sparse hairs, which expose their <b>brightly</b> metallic <b>color.</b> Males have conspicuous white marks around the mouth, whereas similar markings are diminutive in females. Males also have a broad hind tibia, rhomboid or triangular in shape and rounded distally, used as a storage organ for aromatic materials. Male forelegs have five tarsal segments, which have dense tufts of hairs (or ‘brushes’) on the ventral surface, that are useful for picking up oily liquids by capillarity. An elongated pit covered by long hairs (a ‘scar’) {{can also be seen}} on the outer rear surface of the tibia, which shows two lobes, each of which has an opening into the tibial organ. The wall of the tibial organ is extremely wrinkled, on which the inner surface has many large branched hairs. Males also display a characteristic pattern of short, dense hairs on the outer surface of the mid tibia, with one or two small hairy patches within a much larger patch. All E. imperialis are known to have relatively long tongues in comparison to other bee species. They also have two widely separated tufts of hair without any obvious tubes or slits on the second (metasomal) sternum.|$|R
