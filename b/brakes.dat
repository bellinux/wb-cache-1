5|$|Magnetic <b>brakes</b> {{were first}} used on Nitro at Six Flags Great Adventure in 2001. Magnetic <b>brakes</b> slow down trains {{much faster than}} {{friction}} brakes; most B roller coasters built in or after 2001 {{have at least one}} set of magnetic <b>brakes.</b> Magnetic <b>brakes</b> do not make contact with the train. Fins that run parallel to the train are fitted beneath the seats. As the fins pass through the <b>brakes,</b> the magnetic field created by the <b>brakes</b> slows the train. Magnetic <b>brakes</b> have also been used as an alternate type of trim brake on B roller coasters such as Leviathan at Canada's Wonderland.|$|E

5|$|When B {{was first}} founded, the linear {{magnetic}} eddy brake {{had yet to}} be developed, so it used friction <b>brakes</b> as its main braking system. On the train, pads are fitted beneath the seating areas. On the <b>brakes,</b> similar pads are connected to steel supports. When the pads on the train come into contact with the <b>brakes,</b> friction is created which slows the train. Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction <b>brakes</b> have also been used as trim <b>brakes</b> that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>braking</b> torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic <b>braking</b> and regenerative <b>braking</b> system. The <b>braking</b> torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required <b>braking</b> torque and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required <b>braking</b> torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque required for the anti-lock <b>braking</b> system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions are classified as the emergency <b>braking</b> and the normal <b>braking.</b> In the case of emergency <b>braking,</b> the required <b>braking</b> torque is to be equal to the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque. In the case of normal <b>braking,</b> the command <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required <b>braking</b> torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum <b>braking</b> torque and the command <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good <b>braking</b> performance when the required <b>braking</b> torque is smaller than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by the regenerative <b>braking</b> system; when the required <b>braking</b> torque is bigger than the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, the whole <b>braking</b> torque can be provided by both the hydraulic <b>braking</b> system and the regenerative <b>braking</b> system, while the maximum <b>braking</b> torque of the regenerative <b>braking</b> system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s <b>braking</b> intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum <b>brakes,</b> instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum <b>brakes</b> were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum <b>brakes</b> in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum <b>brakes)</b> still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised {{to become a part of}} British Railways.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn out of the station. It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block <b>brakes.</b> These <b>brakes</b> lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block <b>brakes</b> and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block <b>brakes.</b> The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

5|$|Between 1927 and 1933 {{multiple}} unit compartment stock {{was built by}} the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon and Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for services from Baker Street and the City to Watford and Rickmansworth. The first order was only for motor cars; half had Westinghouse <b>brakes,</b> Metro-Vickers control systems and four MV153 motors; they replaced the motor cars working with bogie stock trailers. The rest of the motor cars had the same motor equipment but used vacuum <b>brakes,</b> and worked with converted 1920/23 Dreadnought carriages to form 'MV' units. In 1929, 'MW' stock was ordered, 30 motor coaches and 25 trailers similar to the 'MV' units, but with Westinghouse <b>brakes.</b> A further batch of 'MW' stock was ordered in 1931, this time from the Birmingham Railway Carriage & Wagon Co. This was to make seven 8-coach trains, and included additional trailers to increase {{the length of the}} previous 'MW' batch trains to eight coaches. These had GEC WT545 motors, and although designed to work in multiple with the MV153, this did not work well in practice. After the Met became part of London Underground, the MV stock was fitted with Westinghouse <b>brakes</b> and the cars with GEC motors were re-geared to allow them to work in multiple with the MV153-motored cars. In 1938, nine 8-coach and ten 6-coach MW units were re-designated T Stock. A trailer coach built in 1904/5 is stored at London Transport Museum's Acton Depot, although it has been badly damaged by fire, and the Spa Valley Railway is home to two T stock coaches.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{researched}} the vehicle <b>braking</b> sense in three aspects of human, vehicle and environment and analysed their impacts on <b>brake</b> feeling.

Moreover we discussed how to establish the evaluation system of vehicle <b>braking</b> condition.

For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110V battery. This will remove the need for shunting at the depots and cut costs.|$|E
