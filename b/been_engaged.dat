5|$|By 1797, Britain {{and the new}} French Republic had <b>been</b> <b>engaged</b> in the French Revolutionary Wars {{for nearly}} four years. Although there had been {{significant}} fighting in Europe, the East Indies had remained largely under British control. French forces in the region were limited, and apart from a few raiding cruises the French squadron in the region had been under intermittent blockade at Île de France. The Royal Navy, commanded in Eastern waters by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier had focused on commerce protection {{and the elimination of}} the colonies of the French-allied Batavian Republic, capturing Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies in 1795 and 1796. Rainier had <b>been</b> <b>engaged</b> in pacifying local uprisings around Malacca during {{the latter part of the}} campaign, and there had been few forces left in reserve to protect British interests in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
