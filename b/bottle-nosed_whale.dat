50|$|Long-beaked common {{dolphins}} are {{not common}} in human care {{as they are}} extremely difficult to keep in captivity. In the wild, however, they have been seen travelling with <b>bottle-nosed</b> dolphins, pilot <b>whales,</b> and yellowfin tuna.|$|R
50|$|The rich {{offshore}} {{waters of}} Mauritania {{are home to}} a diverse fauna of cetaceans. Upwellings off the coats create rich feeding grounds for baleen whales and these include blue whale, sei whale and Bryde's whale, although the North Atlantic right whale is now extinct in the eastern Atlantic and it was recorded off Mauretania. Other whales and dolphins found off Mauritania's coast include harbour porpoise, Atlantic spotted dolphin, <b>bottle-nosed</b> dolphin, sperm <b>whale,</b> short-finned pilot whale and orca.|$|R
5000|$|The {{organisation}} was {{the subject}} of widespread media coverage in January 2006 due to its efforts in leading the attempted rescue of a northern <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>whale</b> (the [...] "River Thames whale") which became disorientated and distressed after swimming up the River Thames into central London. A large rescue operation began on the morning of Saturday 21 January and lasted until the evening when the whale died.|$|E
50|$|On 20 January 2006, a 16-18 ft {{northern}} <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>whale</b> {{was seen}} in the Thames as far upstream as Chelsea. This was extremely unusual: this whale is generally found in deep sea waters. Crowds gathered along the riverbanks to witness the extraordinary spectacle but there was soon concern, as the animal came within yards of the banks, almost beaching, and crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding. About 12 hours later, the whale {{is believed to have been}} seen again near Greenwich, possibly heading back to sea. A rescue attempt lasted several hours, but the whale died on a barge.

40|$|Performance at Starr Auditorium, Tate Modern 19 th September 2005 The {{research}} theorises {{the engagement}} of collectives and crowds {{in art and}} non-art live events. It takes Hannah Arendt’s model of a ‘space of appearance’, Bourriard’s relational aesthetics and the theoretical depiction of ‘we collectivity’ put forward by Jean-luc Nancy and Irit Rogoff as points of departure. In these models, a space or specific site is determined as a locus of specific attention. An activated relationship then spreads out from the individual or the few to engage the interest of multiple individuals or crowd. In the Tate performance, a number of models of cultural behaviour were referred to in art and non-art fields included the social dynamics of crowd behaviour in the sports stadium turned public shelter following Hurricane Katrina {{and the appearance of}} a <b>bottle-nosed</b> <b>whale</b> in the River Thames which caused crowd movements following its passage through the water. Analogies were then drawn with art practices since the 1960 s including performance art and spectator engagement in contemporary art installations A symposium organised by the researcher was held on November 17 th 2006 University of Ulster in which the participants took an aspect of the title. No single participant could respond to the whole title. Participants included theorist John Reardon, art historian Pamela Lee and artist Cristobel Bianchi. A paper in the Department of Education and Learning for Northern Ireland funded Footnotes, ‘The Artist- Speaker’, describes the theoretical positioning of the research (ISBN 978 - 1 - 905902 - 02 - 6). In this manifestation of How do we Measure the Responsibility of a Crowd, the academy, or place of learning, is considered as a site for the locus of attention spreading to the centre through the artist-speaker mediates between the practice and the audience provoking responses in the audience...|$|E
