5|$|Donen's last {{theatrical}} {{film was}} the May – December romance Blame It on Rio in 1984. The {{film is a}} remake of the 1977 Claude Berri film Un moment d'égarement and was written by Gelbart and Charlie Peters. It stars Michael Caine, Joseph Bologna, Michelle Johnson, Valerie Harper and Demi Moore and was shot on location in Rio de Janeiro. Caine and Bologna play wealthy executives on vacation with their families in Rio, where Caine has an affair with Bologna's teenage daughter (Johnson). It received poor reviews, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> modest success financially.|$|E

5|$|Elagabalus {{declared}} {{the date of}} the victory at Antioch to be the beginning of his reign and assumed the imperial titles without prior senatorial approval. This violated tradition <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> common practice among 3rd-century emperors nonetheless. Letters of reconciliation were dispatched to Rome extending amnesty to the Senate and recognizing the laws, while also condemning the administration of Macrinus and his son.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Bhardwaj again adapted Shakespeare's tragedy Othello, as Omkara. Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the political system in Uttar Pradesh, the film had Ajay Devgan as the titular character. It premiered at the 6th Marrakech International Film Festival, and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. At the 54th National Film Awards, Bhardwaj received the Special Jury Award for the film. Omkara met with critical acclaim, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> box office disappointment. It however opened to positive box-office response in North America and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{slated for}} release in June 2012, {{the film was}} delayed in order to convert to 3D and boost {{interest}} in international markets.

5|$|Palmyra's gods were {{primarily}} {{part of the}} northwestern Semitic pantheon, {{with the addition of}} gods from the Mesopotamian and Arab pantheons. The city's chief pre-Hellenistic deity was called Bol, an abbreviation of Baal (a northwestern Semitic honorific). The Babylonian cult of Bel-Marduk influenced the Palmyrene religion and by 217 BC the chief deity's name was changed to Bel. This did not indicate the replacing of the northwestern Semitic Bol with a Mesopotamian deity, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mere change in the name.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} critical praise, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{box office}} disappointment. Nonetheless, Tucker: The Man and His Dream produced {{a spike in}} prices of Tucker Sedans, {{as well as a}} renewed appreciation for Tucker and his automobiles.|$|E

5|$|While filming Silver Streak, Wilder {{began working}} on a script for The World's Greatest Lover, {{inspired}} by Fellini's The White Sheik. Wilder wrote, produced, and directed The World's Greatest Lover, which premièred in 1977, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> critical failure. The Frisco Kid (1979) was Wilder's next project. The film was to star John Wayne, but he dropped out {{and was replaced by}} Harrison Ford, then an up-and-coming actor.|$|E
5|$|With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Burton {{was hired}} as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was {{released}} to mixed reviews, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised. Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.|$|E

5|$|A Night to Remember {{was only}} Lord's second book <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> huge success, thanks {{in no small}} part to the {{aggressive}} advertising campaign carried out by R & W Holt following its launch in November 1955. The book also undoubtedly benefited from the popularity of the 1953 film Titanic and other coverage of the disaster that was published around the same time. Within two months of its publication, the book had sold 60,000 copies and remained listed as a best-seller for six months. The Ladies' Home Journal and Reader's Digest both published condensed versions and it was selected in June 1956 by the Book of the Month Club. The first paperback edition was published by Bantam Books in October 1956.|$|E
5|$|After Tillman {{returned}} from Chicago to South Carolina, he suggested he had delivered an intentionally radical speech {{so as to}} allow Bryan to look statesmanlike by comparison. This interpretation was mocked by his enemies. Tillman is not known to have otherwise discussed his feelings at the failure of his presidential bid, and the political grief was likely overwhelmed by personal sadness {{a week after the}} convention when his beloved daughter Addie died, struck by lightning on a North Carolina mountain. Tillman campaigned for Bryan, <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> favorite target of cartoonists denigrating the Democratic candidate and supporting the Republican, former Ohio governor William McKinley. Bryan had also been nominated by the Populists, who selected their own vice presidential candidate, Georgia's Thomas E. Watson. Tillman was active in efforts to get Watson to withdraw, having a 12-hour meeting with the candidate, apparently without result. Tillman traveled widely to speak on Bryan's behalf, and drew large crowds, but his speeches were of little significance. Despite undertaking an arduous campaign, Bryan lost the election. Simkins suggested that Tillman, by helping forge an image of the Democratic Party as anarchic, contributed to Bryan's defeat.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Horvath {{attended}} Ohio State University on a work scholarship, {{but managed}} to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – <b>but</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quick runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a disappointment in 1940, however, finishing {{the season with a}} 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio high school coach who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level of discipline and organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.|$|E
