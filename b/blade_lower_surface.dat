40|$|The complex flowfield {{which is}} {{associated}} with a rotor wake gives rise to the multitude of aerodynamic interactions that may occur during rotorcraft operation. These interactions may give rise to undesirable noise and lead to an unacceptable performance degradation, and as such the investigation of the fundamental mechanics of such interactions, that which occurs between the tail rotor and the trailing tip vortices shed from the main rotor assembly, is the focus of the current investigation. As the purpose of the tail rotor is to provide balance for the torque of the main rotor, these types of interaction will adversely impact on the overall rotorcraft performance. The basis of the present thesis has been an experimental investigation of the orthogonal BVI, in which the axis of the interacting vortex (in the plane of the vortex core axial flow) is nominally orthogonal to the interacting blade chordline, representing the tail rotor interaction. The tests have been conducted using a specifically designed facility at the University of Glasgow, with the flow interrogated using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PVI) technique. The PVI method allows global flowfield information to be obtained pertaining {{to the nature of the}} interaction. The methodology was benchmarked against synthetic flowfields, and with the accuracy of the flowfield measurements improved dramatically with the implementation of the Forward/Reverse Tile Test (FRTT), which improved the accuracy in the flowfields to 3 % in two-dimensional interrigation, and 5 % in three-dimensional. The interrogation of the flowfield around the representative tail rotor blade demonstrated that the characteristics imparted vortex due to the BVI event could be attributed to the manner in which the axial flow component of the vortex was affected by the interaction. The results for the isolated flow conditions agreed well with those from previous measurements of the vortical structure, and the post interaction structure clearly indicated distinct differences determined by the direction of the axial flow relative to the blade chordline. Initial testing indicated that the thickness ratio had a marked effect on the progression of the OBVI, and for a suitably high thickness ratio, there was little evidence to suggest that the vortex core axial flow is 'cut' by the interacting body in the manner observed for the lower thickness ratios. For lower thickness ratios, as the vortex core is blocked by the interacting blade surface, the retardation of the axial component on the <b>blade</b> <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> leads to rapid redistribution of the fluid into the surrounding flow, and the corresponding enlargement and distortion to the vortex tangential velocity components promoted by the radial outflow. On the upper blade side, regions of negative axial flow velocity indicate the presence of some fluid passing down through the core towards the surface of the blade, which are accompanied by a split divergence pattern around the vortex core. The effects immediately behind the trailing edge continue to be of interest due to the manner in which the vortex might be regenerated after the interaction and before any subsequent interactions with following blades. A relative lack of distortion within the out-of-plane component indicates that a rapid regeneration of the axial flow component may occur once the vortex has passed over the trailing edge. The use of passive control techniques in reduction of the effects associated with the orthoganal BVI have also been addressed, considering the effect of a counter-rotating vortex pair on the progression of the interaction. Although the inclusion a notch in the leading edge and outboard sweep on the rotor blade producing the representative trailing tip vortex did produce a well defined inboard vortex structure, there is evidence to suggest that this structure is ingested into the outboard tip vortex, as there is no significant modification to the progression of the OBVI.

40|$|Strawberry guava has {{characteristic}} gray-brown to reddish bark that {{peels off}} in irregular patterns. Common Guava Common guava (Psidium guajava L.) is a shrub or small tree, usually under 15 feet tall (rarely to 30 feet), with scaly bark. Branches are 4 -angled and hairy. The opposite leaves {{have a short}} stalk/ petiole and elliptic to oblong leathery <b>blades.</b> The <b>lower</b> <b>blade</b> <b>surface</b> is covered with soft hairs, contains numerous glandular dots and has very noticeable riblike lateral veins. Inflorescences are usually 1 -flowered in leaf axils. The five sepals are united. The five petals are white, showy, rounded and just under 1 inch long. Stamens are numerous. The ovary is imbedded below {{the rest of the}} flower parts (inferior). The usually dull yellow fruits are rounded or pear-shaped, manyseeded berries about 1 to 2 1 / 2 inches long with pink or yellowish flesh. Reproduction is by seeds. Blooming occurs all year. Common guava has been cultivated and distributed by man and animals for so long {{that it is difficult to}} be certain of its place of origin but it is believed to be from an area extending from southern Mexico into or through Central America (Morton 1987).

40|$|The {{topic of}} laminar flow effects on hover {{performance}} is introduced {{with respect to}} some historical efforts where laminar flow was either measured or attempted. An analysis method is outlined using combined blade element, momentum method coupled to an airfoil analysis method, which includes the full e(sup N) transition model. The analysis results compared well with the measured hover performance including the measured location of transition on both the upper and <b>lower</b> <b>blade</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The analysis method is then used to understand the upper limits of hover efficiency {{as a function of}} disk loading. The impact of laminar flow is higher at low disk loading, but significant improvement in terms of power loading appears possible even up to high disk loading approaching 20 ps f. A optimum planform design equation is derived for cases of zero profile drag and finite drag levels. These results are intended to be a guide for design studies and as a benchmark to compare higher fidelity analysis results. The details of the analysis method are given to enable other researchers to use the same approach for comparison to other approaches...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} is {{a natural}} flow wing and a method for constructing the same. The method comprises contouring a three-dimensional upper surface and a three-dimensional <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> of the natural flow wing {{independently of one another}} into a prescribed shape. Experimental data and theoretical analysis show that flow and pressure-loading over an upper surface of a wing tend to be conical about an apex of the wing, producing favorable and unfavorable regions of performance based on drag. The method reduces these unfavorable regions by shaping the upper surface such that the maximum thickness near a tip of the natural flow wing moves aft, thereby, contouring the wing to coincide more closely with the conical nature of the flow on the upper surface. Nearly constant compressive loading characterizes the flow field over a <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> of the conventional wing. Magnitude of these compressive pressures on the <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> depends on angle of attack and on a streamwise curvature of the <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> of the wing and not on a cross-sectional spanwise curvature. The method, thereby, shapes the <b>lower</b> <b>surface</b> to create an area as large as possible with negative slopes.
