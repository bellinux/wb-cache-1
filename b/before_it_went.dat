In 1974, experts again tried to restore it to its original condition <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on public exhibition in Moscow. The most recent restoration process took place between 2006 and 2008, when the painting was finally returned to its former glory.|$|E

5|$|P. S. Raman, {{who went}} to Chennai in 1963 to join a medical college, was asked to see Sridhar, who was auditioning {{newcomers}} for the film. Raman was renamed Ravichandran and introduced in this film, as the character Ashok. Sivakumar had auditioned for the role <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to Ravichandran. During a flight, Sridhar met an air-hostess named Vasundhara Devi and approached her to play one of the female leads. Because she shared her name with Vasundhara Devi, the mother of actress Vyjayanthimala, Sridhar renamed her Kanchana to avoid confusion. Telugu actor Krishna has stated that he was offered {{a role in the}} film by Sridhar, but he could not accept it due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil.|$|E

25|$|With no {{two-point}} conversion option (that {{would not}} be adopted by the league until 1993), Cleveland needed two scores to come back. Pagel led the Browns 71 yards to score on his 2-yard touchdown pass to Slaughter, cutting the score to 24–23 with 31 seconds left. Cleveland attempted an onside kick, which they failed to recover, but got another chance due to an Oilers penalty. Then the Browns recovered, but {{had to do it}} over again due to a penalty against them. Finally on the third try, Cleveland was penalized for touching the ball <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> 10 yards, resulting in a penalty that gave Houston the ball and the win.|$|E
25|$|The club's current home jumper {{design is}} black and {{features}} a yellow sash running from the top left of the jumper to the bottom right. For away games against teams with dark coloured jumpers, the club wears a clash strip with a reverse of this design, a black sash on a yellow base. In its first season, Richmond wore a blue jumper with a thin yellow-and-black sash running from right to left. Between 2011 and 2016, the club guernseys were manufactured by sportswear company BLK, who were known as KooGa Australia prior to 2014, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> into receivership in November 2016.

25|$|VIII Fighter Command {{assigned}} the 56th Fighter Group two-letter squadron identification codes {{to be painted}} on the fuselages of its fighters, and each squadron assigned its aircraft individual letter identifiers. (The letters chosen for the 56th had previously been assigned to the 1st Fighter Group <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to the Twelfth Air Force.) In early February 1944 the 56th replaced its white cowl bands with a different color for each squadron. This innovation lasted until mid-March, when VIII Fighter Command adopted a color system for all Eighth Air Force fighter groups. The 56th painted its noses red and later applied the squadron colors to the tail rudders of its Thunderbolts, an innovation that VIII Fighter Command also borrowed. The 56th discontinued use of squadron colors when it changed to P-47M's.|$|E

25|$|Amahl and the Night Visitors was {{the first}} network {{television}} Christmas special to become an annual tradition. There had already been several television productions of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol since about 1947, but {{they had not been}} shown annually or presented by the same television network, with the same general technical staff, as Amahl was. Until 1963, Amahl was nearly always presented with many of the same singers and production staff. From 1951 until 1966 it was presented every year on NBC (which commissioned Menotti to write it) on or around Christmas Eve, as an episode of an existing anthology series, such as The Alcoa Hour, NBC Television Opera, or the Hallmark Hall of Fame. The 1978 production of Amahl also premiered on NBC, <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> to cable television in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Nabokov {{played in}} his second NHL All-Star Game on January 27, 2008. He stopped all eight shots that came at him, marking {{the first time since}} Nikolai Khabibulin's period in the 2002 game that a goalie played an All-Star period where no goals were scored. He secured the {{scoreless}} period when he blocked both of Ilya Kovalchuk’s shots in the last minute of the second period. On May 4, during game six of the 2008 NHL Playoffs Western Conference Semi-Finals, Nabokov made what has been called one of the best glove saves in decades, when he saved a shot from Brad Richards of the Dallas Stars by sliding over {{from the other side of}} the post and gloving the puck. The save was reviewed for several minutes before making it clear Nabokov saved it <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> over the goal line. The game, which ended in a Dallas victory, lasted for four overtime periods and is the eighth longest game in the league's history.|$|E
25|$|Coleman kicked 537 {{goals in}} just 98 appearances, {{at an average}} of 5.48 goals per game. At the time of his retirement, it was the highest goals-per-game average by any player, {{exceeding}} the next-best total of Bob Pratt (4.31 goals per game) by more than a goal. Coleman's feats were even more impressive by virtue {{of the fact that he}} achieved them at a time when the rules of the game were less favourable to full-forwards: between 1925–1939, a free kick was always awarded against the last team to play the ball <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> out of bounds, which resulted in teams of the era adopting a direct game-plan which favoured strong full-forwards, and it was an era which produced many of the league's heaviest goalscorers, including Pratt, Gordon Coventry, Bill Mohr and Ron Todd; but Coleman played after the boundary throw-in had been re-introduced, resulting in more play along the wings and less prominence from full-forwards. As of 2014, Coleman's record has been surpassed by only Peter Hudson (5.64 goals per game).|$|E
