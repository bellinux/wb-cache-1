5|$|Ecuador {{is still}} at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} twentieth century onwards, there has been much {{investigation}} of low-mass, radiative collectors; these have proved to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more successful.|$|E

50|$|For {{municipal}} water supply, {{the share of}} groundwater <b>is</b> <b>much</b> lower and the share of surface water <b>is</b> <b>much</b> greater.

5|$|Horizontal {{machines}} used to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{more common}} than vertical machines; however, today they represent just 10% of all broaching machines purchased. Vertical machines are more popular because they take up less space.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the leper colony on Brei Holm {{there may have been}} another at Hilla Fielle overlooking Hamna Voe. A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> older than the supposed 18th century colony.|$|E

50|$|Males {{are similar}} to Cotana lunulata, but are larger and the outer one-third of the {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> paler and more yellow. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> brighter yellow and all transverse lines are more distinct. Females are also similar to Cotana lunulata, but <b>are</b> <b>much</b> darker and the white patch in the basal one-third of the forewings is reduced to a small dot. The postdiscal bands <b>are</b> <b>much</b> narrower and more cream-coloured.|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} {{sometimes}} found in captivity, and wild-caught individuals are generally nervous {{and prone to}} spitting. Captive-bred animals tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more docile and calm when compared to their wild-caught counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|The coat of a Pomeranian <b>is</b> {{generally}} <b>much</b> denser and thicker. It {{is often}} difficult to see individual hairs. However, an Indian Spitz's coat <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less dense and it <b>is</b> <b>much</b> easier to see the individual hair follicles.|$|R
50|$|Mecocerus wallacei {{exhibits}} a strong sexual dimorphism, as the males <b>are</b> <b>much</b> larger than females and the thread-like antennae <b>are</b> <b>much</b> {{longer than the}} body.|$|R

5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|Although Bellone would {{normally}} <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{faster than the}} large British warship, the light winds and Rattlesnakes determined pursuit prevented the privateer from escaping and at 17:00, Powerful {{was close enough to}} open fire. Despite the uneven nature of the combat, Bellone unexpectedly resisted the British attack for another hour and 45 minutes, causing more damage to Powerful than she received herself. The privateer was later taken into British service as a sixth rate frigate and prize money was paid for the captured vessels, but the action prompted questions in subsequent histories about the lack of efficiency in British gunnery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E
50|$|Acylation <b>is</b> <b>much</b> more {{straightforward}} as {{the resulting}} α-cyanocarbonyl compounds <b>are</b> <b>much</b> more acidic (and less nucleophilic) than corresponding starting materials. Monoacylated products {{can be obtained}} easily.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to Lophostethus dumolinii, but smaller and {{the margin of the}} {{forewings}} <b>is</b> <b>much</b> less crenulated, the ground colour <b>is</b> <b>much</b> darker and more purplish and the stigmata is smaller and more golden.

5|$|At most 600,000 years old, Kīlauea {{is still}} quite young for a Hawaiian volcano; the oldest volcano on the island, the northwestern Kohala, {{experienced}} almost 900,000 years of activity before going extinct. The volcano's foreseeable future activity will likely <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{like it has}} been for the past 50,000 to 100,000 years; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to heighten Kīlauea's summit, build up its rift zones, and fill and refill its summit caldera.|$|E
5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, {{it appears}} {{to belong to a}} stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may <b>be</b> <b>much</b> older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All members of the group are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E

5|$|Book Three: Change {{aired on}} short notice in June 2014 after Spanish-language {{versions}} of some episodes were leaked on the Internet. The season premiered with 1.5 million viewers. After declining TV ratings in the third season, Nickelodeon stopped airing the series on television and shifted its distribution to online outlets, where the show had proven to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more successful.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the civil}} war, Mongalla had {{suffered}} considerable physical neglect and damage, and population loss. In April 2006 the President of Southern Sudan, Salva Kiir Mayardit, named Mongalla {{as one of the}} Nile ports {{to be the first to}} be rehabilitated. He warned that demands for reconstruction spending would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> greater than available funding, so work had to be prioritized.|$|E
