40|$|The {{main purpose}} of asphalt mixture {{production}} is the coating of mineral aggregates with asphalt binder within a reasonable time frame. Coating is required as it affects mixtures workability (e. g., lubricant effect of binder film), as well as durability (e. g., preventing mixtures from moisture damage). However, mixing time needs to be controlled since it greatly influences both plant productivity (i. e., amount of mixture produced per hour) and binder aging, which {{is caused by the}} loss in volatiles due to temperature and air flow during mixing. In light of this, mixing temperature is selected to properly reduce binder?s viscosity below a limit to ensure proper coating in a time frame of 90 seconds. Current viscosity limits used for selecting mixing and compaction temperatures are valid only for unmodified binders, which generally exhibit a linear Newtonian behavior; furthermore, the literature indicates that these limits were introduced solely based on practical considerations without a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical processes driving the production of this material. A guideline for the selection of compaction temperatures for modified binders, which are nowadays very popular, is not available to practitioners. Mixing temperatures calculated based on current recommendations for viscosity limits are often higher than 150 �C and they become even more excessive when modified binders are used. The usage of these temperatures raises concerns in terms of energy cost, sustainability and safety. Thus, transportation agencies and practitioners are currently challenged with the need of reducing the mixing temperatures during production without negatively affecting the level of coating or performance of mixtures. This can only be accomplished by providing a clear understanding of the main factors and variables that affect coating, and by showing the influence of coating on the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture damage. Reducing mixing temperatures will result in increasing viscosity. The effect of increased viscosity on both coating and the adhesive bond between the binder and aggregates has not been properly investigated in the past. In this thesis, effects of coating are considered based on two different points of view: (a) extent of coating, which is defined as the amount of dry aggregates coated by binder after mixing for a given time before compaction; and (b) the quality of coating which is defined as a qualitative description of the adhesive bond between binder and aggregate. Initially a procedure based on aggregates water absorption (ASTM C 127 ? 07) was developed for determining the extent of coating. Results from this procedure showed that the extent of coating is affected by low shear viscosity and asphalt content, but highlighted that the extent of coating is not sufficient for assessing moisture susceptibility of mixtures. It was determined that moisture damage of mixtures is more dependent on the binder-aggregate bond strength rather than the extent of coating. For this reason, a modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> procedure based on the ASTM D 3625 ? 1996 was introduced and developed for evaluating the quality of coating. Results from the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> have shown that the quality of coating is highly affected by low shear viscosity, binder modification, and aggregate type. Furthermore, a time-dependency effect of the quality of coating was observed for certain combinations of asphalt binders and aggregates. The analysis of the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> results, which is based on visual inspection of aggregates surface post boiling, was validated using the acid ? base titration procedure recommended in the UNI EN 12697 - 11 2012 (E). In addition, the Bitumen Bond Strength (BBS) test (AASHTO TP 91 - 12), was included in the experimental study to evaluate if the application/production temperature affects the moisture susceptibility of the inderaggregates systems. Results showed that the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> and the BBS test are correlated. Furthermore, the boiling procedure was validated using the Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) test, (AASHTO T 283). A preliminary correlation between the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> and the ITS showed that the proposed procedure is promising for the evaluation of the quality of coating and {{can be used as a}} surrogate for estimating the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture damage. The ITS results in combination with the analysis from the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> were used to provide preliminary design limits. Results from this thesis show that quantifying the extent of coating is not sufficient for predicting moisture susceptibility. Indeed, the quality of coating needs to be considered when assessing moisture damage of mixtures. Findings from the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> have pointed out that the quality of coating is affected not only by viscosity, but also by binder modification and aggregate type. In summary, the developed modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> can be used as a simple procedure for selecting mixing temperature that will ensure sufficient extent and quality of coating, both of which have significant effect on asphalt-aggregate mixture moisture susceptibility...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringYacoub M. NajjarReliable and {{economical}} design of Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) pavement structural systems relies on various factors, among {{which is the}} proper characterization of the expected permeability response of the concrete mixes. Permeability is a highly important factor which strongly relates the durability of concrete structures and pavement systems to changing environmental conditions. One {{of the most common}} environmental attacks which cause the deterioration of concrete structures is the corrosion of reinforcing steel due to chloride penetration. On an annual basis, corrosion-related structural repairs typically cost millions of dollars. This durability problem has gotten widespread interest in recent years due to its incidence rate and the associated high repair costs. For this reason, material characterization {{is one of the best}} methods to reduce repair costs. To properly characterize the permeability response of PCC pavement structure, the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) generally runs the Rapid Chloride Permeability test to determine the resistance of concrete to penetration of chloride ions as well as the <b>Boil</b> <b>test</b> to determine the percent voids in hardened concrete. Rapid Chloride test typically measures the number of coulombs passing through a concrete sample over a period of six hours at a concrete age of 7, 28, and 56 days. <b>Boil</b> <b>Test</b> measures the volume of permeable pore space of the concrete sample over a period of five hours at a concrete age of 7, 28, and 56 days. In this research, backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) -based and Regression-based permeability response prediction models for Rapid Chloride and Boil tests are developed by using the databases provided by KDOT in order to reduce or eliminate the duration of the testing period. Moreover, another set of ANN- and Regression-based permeability prediction models, based on mix-design parameters, are developed using datasets obtained from the literature. The backpropagation ANN learning technique proved to be an efficient methodology to produce a relatively accurate permeability response prediction models. Comparison of the prediction accuracy of the developed ANN models and regression models proved that ANN models have outperformed their counterpart regression-based models.

30|$|Fiberboards were {{prepared}} from acetylated fibers with various weight gains: 0, 4.7, 9.4, 18.5, and 24.8 weight percent gain (WPG). The effects of low bondability of acetylated fibers on mechanical properties and dimensional changes were determined. The decreased mechanical properties of acetylated fiberboard are mainly due to low bondability. To improve bending strength, high face density is also needed. The thickness swelling according to JIS and the linear expansion under relative humidity changes decreased with increasing WPG. As for accelerated weathering and the outdoor exposure test, the thickness changes in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were {{much higher than}} those in OWPG board and 24.8 WPG board. The high thickness change in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards is due to low bondability. Although 24.8 WPG board also has low bondability, the thickness change of 24.8 WPG board decreased. The high dimensional stability of acetylated fibers, caused by high WPG, probably outweighs the dimensional change caused by low bondability. On the other hand, during the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> the thickness changes in 24.8 WPG board and the 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were higher than those in 0 WPG board. The effect of the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> on the boards is more severe than that seen with the accelerated weathering and outdoor exposure test; therefore, {{the effects of the}} low bondability probably cancel the effects of the high WPG.

Appropriate Energy Saving Technologies (AEST) is a social business enterprise that manufactures and distributes the Makaa charcoal cookstove and a long-time partner of MIT's D-Lab. This work is a collaboration with AEST to improve the performance, usability, and manufacturability of the Makaa stove. A one-day co-design workshop was held at the AEST site in Soroti to engage users, fabricators, and AEST employees in brainstorming and investigating opportunities to improve the design of the Makaa stove. While the designs researched at the workshop primarily addressed concerns with usability and manufacturability, two additional designs were selected to be prototyped and tested using the water <b>boil</b> <b>test</b> (WBT) procedure developed by the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC), which measures the efficiency and emissions of a cookstove. The two prototyped designs used aluminum foil and vermiculite for insulation and were compared to the two Makaa stoves currently in production, the clay and metal grate models. The results from the WBTs were used to calculate the stoves' tier ratings according to the IWA Tiers of Performance, set by the GACC. Detailed techno-economic analyses were also performed in order to calculate the total cost of production {{for each of the four}} stove models. Combining the results from the performance testing with the cost analyses revealed that the most cost-effective design is a combination of the metal grate and vermiculite models. This design maximized performance and usability while also minimizing the time and cost of production. Recommendations were made for further prototyping and testing, and a cost-analysis spreadsheet was made available for future techno-economic analysis. by Lauren E. Bustamante. Thesis: S.

The nucleation sites were 180 μm in diameter and 500 μm deep with a centre-to-centre spacing of 660 μm. Two diametrically opposed windows allowed for illumination and high speed videography of the bubble growth process from the two nucleation sites. For the saturated <b>boiling</b> <b>tests</b> considered here, bubbles only formed at the two artificial nucleation sites allowing their coalescence behaviour to be scrutinized.

Besides, the <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> was correlated highly significantly with SGT (r = 0. 670 **), FE-I (r = 0. 923 **), FE-II (r = 0. 906 **) and FE-III (r = 0. 939 **) in leek seeds. Similarly, BWT showed positive correlation with SGT (r = 0. 568 **), FE-I (r = 0. 844 **), FE-II (r = 0. 933 **) and FE-III (r = 0. 858 **) in onion seeds. In conclusion, the <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> is a new and reliable technique to test seed viability and it has a great potential to test rapidly germination and field emergence of leek and onion seeds at different sowing times...|$|R
40|$|Strand {{substitution}} {{was evaluated}} for {{the core of}} OSB with chips produced by grinding of recycled particleboards and wood waste. All the boards manufactured under laboratory conditions having a share of small chips in the core had high mechanical parameters, thus meeting {{the requirements of the}} standard for OSB/ 3. No significant effect was found of the applied modification of the core on bending strength or modulus of elasticity (MOE) determined for the longer axis. In turn, such properties as modulus of rupture (MOR) and MOE, determined for the shorter axis, as well as internal bond (IB) were rapidly reduced. In the case of boards containing 100 % recycled chips in the core, a reduction was found in values of MOR, MOE, and IB by 45 %, 30 %, and 45 %, respectively. In turn, the application of small chips, which previously had not been resinated, makes it possible to manufacture boards with internal bond lower by only 30 %, even at the 100 % substitution. Application of recycled chips produced by grinding of the P 2 type particleboard did not make it possible to manufacture boards meeting the requirements of the standard after the <b>boiling</b> <b>test,</b> irrespective of the amount of small chips added to the core. Boards containing in their core small chips, which previously had not been resinated, had much better properties in this respect, since only in case of 100 % substitution the manufactured boards exhibited internal bond after the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> lower than the requirements of the standard EN 300...|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{produced}} and characterized pure Ag nanofluids by EEWL. We examined the energy deposition in the wire {{under various conditions}} and focused on controlled particle size and stability. To identify the effects of key parameters in EEWL, we designed the experiments using Minitab and observed the Ag particle size, morphology, and dispersibility in nanofluids. For applications such as cooling system for electronics and nuclear reactors, {{it is important to}} increase the CHF. Thus, to determine potential for increased CHF, we used the pool <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> of the Ag nanofluids. Finally, to decrease the particle size and improve the dispersibility of Ag nanofluids, we optimized the processing parameters for EEWL using a response optimization technique [ROT].|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the variation of milk stability evaluated with ethanol, boiling, and coagulation time tests (CTT) to identify milk components related with stability and verify the correlation between the three methods. Bulk raw milk was collected monthly at 50 dairy farms from January 2007 to October 2009 and physicochemical attributes, somatic cell (SCC), and total bacterial counts (TBC) were determined. Milk samples were classified into low, medium, and high stability to ethanol test when coagulation occurred at 72 °GL, between 74 and 78 °GL, and above 78 °GL, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed considering the effects of year, months, and interaction in a completely randomized design. Principal factor analysis and logistic regression were done. There was an interaction between months and years for stability to the ethanol test and coagulation time. All samples were stable at the <b>boiling</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Boiling</b> <b>test</b> was not related to ethanol and coagulation time tests. Coagulation time was weakly but positively correlated with ethanol test. Broken line analysis revealed that milk stability measured with CTT and ethanol tests decreased sharply when SCC attained 790, 000 or 106 cell/mL of milk, respectively. Milk stability measured with ethanol test decreased when TBC was higher than 250, 000 cfu/mL, while there was no inflexion point between TBC and stability measured with CTT. Milk with high stability presented lower values for acidity, TBC, and SCC but higher values for pH, lactose, protein, and CTT compared with low-stability milk. Due to the execution easiness, single-point cut-off result and low cost, we do not recommend the replacement of ethanol <b>test</b> for <b>boiling</b> or coagulation time test...|$|R
40|$|The sensory {{determination}} of ammonia in raw, steamed and boiled ray wings using a scoring system {{appeared to be}} a valuable method of quality assessment. The borderline of acceptability was reached after 10 (± 1) days in ice. A combination of the steaming and <b>boiling</b> <b>tests</b> (with addition of acetic acid and salt) was useful to confirm definite spoilage or to indicate the approach to the borderline of acceptability. The chemical {{determination of}} ammonia {{appeared to be a}} useful objective method in addition to the organoleptic tests. Thornback ray was borderline at a concentration of 60 – 70 mg N. From the other related parameters determined (urea, pH, redox potential, total bacterial count, a-amino nitrogen) only pH appeared to be of value...|$|R
30|$|After the {{integrity}} of the test loop has been confirmed based on the experimental results of pure PAO fluid, the heat transfer and flow characteristics of ethanol/PAO nanoemulsions with 4 and 8  wt% ethanol were studied following the similar test procedure. A range of heat fluxes from 1.3 to 4.4  kW/m 2 were selected as heat inputs to simulate single-phase and two-phase convective heat transfer conditions. Each test was repeated at least five times, and the relative differences in measured data are less than 5 %. The SANS measurement was performed only to the samples before going through the experiments. However, previous studies on a similar water/PAO system have shown that there are no noticeable structure changes of the nanodroplets before and after pool <b>boiling</b> <b>tests</b> inside an enclosed system [59].|$|R

30|$|The {{adherence}} of sputtered Au layers {{on glass}} substrates used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis is very weak. This is usually compensated using a thin Cr or Ti intermediate layer. In this study, a 10 -nm sputtered Ag layer (instead of usual Cr or Ti layer) {{was used as}} an adhesive intermediate layer between the 40 -nm Au layer and the glass substrate. The effect of successive heat treatment at different temperatures on the Au layer adherence and SPR resonance characteristics has been studied. Pull off tests and stability against treatment in <b>boiling</b> water <b>tests</b> have been used for the assessment of Au layer adherence. Based on SPR analysis and pull off and <b>boiling</b> water <b>tests,</b> it is shown that an optimum annealing temperature of 250 °C exists for which the Au/Ag/glass substrate composite layer possesses a reasonable adherence along SPR sensitivity.|$|R
