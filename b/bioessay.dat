The analysis of cancer progression therefore requires the study of how point mutations and chromosomal mutations accumulate in cellular lineages. The spread of somatic mutations depends on the mutation rate, the number of cell divisions in the history of a cellular lineage, and the nature of competition between different cellular lineages. We consider how various aspects of tissue architecture and cellular competition affect the pace of mutation accumulation. We also discuss the rise and fall of somatic mutation rates during cancer progression. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

40|$|There are {{two phases}} of somatic muscle {{formation}} in Drosophila. During embry-onic development, one phase of myogenesis generates larval muscle elements that mediate the relatively simple behavioural repertoire of the larva. During pupal metamorphosis, a diverse pattern of muscle fibres are assembled, and these facilitate the more elaborate behavioural {{patterns of the}} adult fly. In this review, we discuss {{the current status of}} understanding of the cellular, genetic, and molecular mechanisms of pattern formation during the second phase, imaginal muscle development. We briefly compare aspects of embryonic and adult myogenesis in Drosophila and muscle development in vertebrates and highlight conserved themes and disparities between these diverse myogenic programmes. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

Relatively {{little is known about the}} subsequent activation of intracellular signaling pathways and actin reorganization, and very little is known about how microtubules (MTs) reorganize during growth cone turning. I hypothesize that dynamic MTs are required in order to catalyze the polarized actin assembly necessary for growth cone turning, that MTs and actin filaments promote each other’s assembly through positive feedback, that MT stability is enhanced further through the formation of membrane-associated MT attachment sites, and that these MT stabilization events subsequently accelerate axonal/dendritic shaft formation. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

Via {{a series of}} data-driven discoveries, {{the cutting edge of}} network science has recently progressed from positing that the random graphs of mathematical graph theory might accurately describe real networks to the current viewpoint that networks in nature are highly complex and structured entities. The identification of high order structures in networks unveils insights into their functional organization. Recently, Clauset, Moore, and Newman, introduced a new algorithm that identifies such heterogeneities in complex networks by utilizing the hierarchy that necessarily organizes the many levels of structure. Here, we anchor their algorithm in a general community detection framework and discuss the future of community detection. Comment: 10 pages, 2 figures. to appear in <b>Bioessay...</b>|$|E

Hox genes must be silenced in totipotent embryonic stem cells and, in contrast, rapidly activated during embryogenesis. Here we discuss some recently published articles(1 – 4) that propose a novel mechanism for the induction of Hox gene transcription. These studies report a new family of histone demethy-lases that remove H 3 K 27 me 3 /me 2 repressive marks at Hox promoters during differentiation of stem cells. Though the overall importance of these enzymes for proper embryogenesis was demonstrated, their precise role in Hox gene epigenetic regulation during develop-ment still remains to be firmly established. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E
40|$|The cardiac myocyte is {{the most}} {{physically}} energetic cell in the body, contracting constantly, without tiring, 3 billion times or more in an average human lifespan. By coordinating its beating activity with that of its 3 billion neighbours in the main pump of the human heart, over 7, 000 litres of blood are pumped per day, without conscious effort, along 100, 000 miles of blood vessels. A detailed picture of the membrane organisation of the cardiac muscle cell underpins {{our understanding of how}} the electrical impulse, generated within the heart, stimulates coordinated contraction of the cardiac chambers. This article highlights, with the aid of modern cellular imaging methods, key components of the membrane machinery responsible for coupling electrical excitation and contraction in the cardiomyocyte, focusing on plasma membrane/sarcoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane/plasma membrane junctions. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

Until now, direct evidence that endogenous retinoid signalling acts through a gradient to specify cell fates along the anteroposterior axis has been missing. Two recent studies tested the requirement for retinoid signalling in the developing hindbrain through systematic application of a pan-retinoic acid receptor antagonist. (1, 2) They demonstrate a stage-dependent requirement for increasing retinoid signalling activity along the hindbrain that proceeds from anterior to posterior. Together these findings challenge the concept of a stable gradient of retinoic acid across the hindbrain and warrant a re-interpretation of the pheno-types obtained by genetic and nutritional disruption of retinoid signalling in the amniote embryo. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

40|$|Germ cell {{segregation}} and gamete production are devel-opmental problems that all sexually reproducing species must solve {{in order to}} survive. Many people {{are familiar with the}} complex social structures of some insect spe-cies, where specialised castes of adult insects perform specific tasks, one of which is usually to guard the sexually reproductive queen. The parasitic wasp Copi-dosoma floridanum adds another level of complexity to the caste system: a fertilised egg produces both sterile, short-lived ‘‘soldier’ ’ larvae and ‘‘reproductive’ ’ larvae that complete metamorphosis to produce sexually re-productive adults. How two morphologically and func-tionally distinct larval castes are produced by genetically identical groups of cells developing under the same environmental conditions is a baffling problem. A recent paper suggests that differential germ cell segregation during embryogenesis may be an event both necessary and sufficient for caste determination. (1) <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E
40|$|Summary Vertebrates express {{scores of}} bHLH {{proteins}} during neural development. Earlier studies {{inspired by the}} established role of ‘‘proneural’ ’ genes in fly neurogenesis, {{as well as by}} the vertebrate bHLH myogenic program, focused on the reconstruc-tion of bHLH gene cascades, which are thought to control successive steps leading to neuronal differentiation. Little attention has been paid thus far to the relationship between the diversity of neural bHLH genes and the diversity of neuronal phenotypes. This article reviews recent evidence that, akin to their fly counterparts, vertebrate neural bHLH genes probably confer not only ‘‘generic’’ neuronal properties, but also neuronal type-specific properties, inextricably link-ing neural determination and the specification of neuronal identity. We also speculate on the relations between positional information and gene activity, and on the evolutionary significance of the diversity of bHLH genes. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

In experi-enced hands, this common, inexpensive procedure is very safe, can be pain-free and can be performed at any age. The benefits vastly outweigh risks. The enormous public health benefits include protection from urinary tract infections, sexually transmitted HIV, HPV, syphilis and chancroid, penile and prostate cancer, phimosis, thrush, and inflammatory dermatoses. In women circum-cision of themale partner provides substantial protection from cervical cancer and chlamydia. Circumcision has socio-sexual benefits and reduces sexual problems with age. It has no adverse effect on penile sensitivity, func-tion, or sensation during sexual arousal. Most women prefer the circumcisedpenis for appearance, hygiene and sex. Given the convincing epidemiological evidence and biological support, routine circumcisionshouldbehighly recommended by all health professionals. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

Mole-cular studies and archaeological record are both largely consistent with autochthonous differentiation of the genetic structure of the caste and tribal populations in SouthAsia. High level of endogamy created by numerous social boundaries within and between castes and tribes, along with the influence of several evolutionary forces such as genetic drift, fragmentation and long-term iso-lation,haskept the Indianpopulationsdiverseanddistant from each other as well as from other continental popu-lations.

40|$|The {{change in}} {{shape of the}} C. elegans embryo from an ovoid ball of cells into a worm-shaped larva is driven by three events within {{the cells of the}} {{hypodermis}} (epider-mis) : (1) intercalation of two rows of dorsal cells, (2) enclosure of the ventral surface by hypodermis, and (3) elongation of the embryo. While the behavior of the hypodermal cells involved in each of these processes differs dramatically, it is clear that F-actin and micro-tubules have essential functions in each of these processes, whereas contraction of actomyosin struc-tures appears to be involved specifically in elongation. Molecular analysis of these processes is revealing components specific to C. elegans as well as components found in other systems. Since C. elegans hypodermal cells demonstrate dramatically different behaviors during intercalation, enclosure and elongation, the study of cytoskeletal dynamics in these processes may reveal both unique and conserved activities during distinct epithelial morphogenetic movements. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E
40|$|Coupled {{positive}} and negative feedback circuits form an essential building block of cellular signaling pathways Dongsan Kim, 1 Yung-Keun Kwon, 1, 2 and Kwang-Hyun Cho 1, 2 * Summary Cellular circuits have {{positive and}} negative feedback loops {{that allow them to}} respond properly to noisy external stimuli. It is intriguing that such feedback loops exist in many cases in a particular form of coupled {{positive and negative}} feedback loops with different time delays. As a result of our mathematical simulations and investigations into various experimental evidences, we found that such coupled feedback circuits can rapidly turn on a reaction to a proper stimulus, robustly maintain its status, and immediately turn off the reaction when the stimulus disappears. In other words, coupled feedback loops enable cellular systems to produce perfect re-sponses to noisy stimuli with respect to signal duration and amplitude. This suggests that coupled positive and negative feedback loops form essential signal transduc-tion motifs in cellular signaling systems. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E

40|$|The enzyme-catalyzed {{acetylation}} of the N-terminal tail {{domains of}} core histones provides a rich {{potential source of}} epigenetic information. This may be used both to mediate transient changes in transcription, through modification of promoter-proximal nucleosomes, and for the longer-term maintenance and modulation of patterns of gene expression. The latter may be achieved by setting specific patterns of histone acetylation, perhaps involving acetylation of particular lysine resi-dues, across relatively large chromatin domains. The histone acetylating and deacetylating enzymes (HATs and HDACs, respectively) can be targeted to specific regions of the genome and show varying degrees of substrate specificity, properties {{that are consistent with}} a role in maintaining a dynamic, acetylation-based epigenetic code. The code may be read (ie. exert a functional effect) either through non-histone proteins that bind in an acetylation-dependent manner, or through direct effects on chromatin structure. Recent evidence raises the interesting possibility that an acetylation-based code may operate through both mitosis and meiosis, providing a possible mechanism for germ-line transmission of epigenetic changes. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E
40|$|RNA editing, the post-transcriptional {{alteration}} of a gene-encoded sequence, {{is a widespread}} phenomenon in eukaryotes. As a consequence of RNA editing, functionally distinct proteins can be produced from a single gene. The molecular mechanisms involved in-clude single or multiple base insertions or deletions as well as base substitutions. In mammals, one type of substitutional RNA editing, characterized by site-speci-fic base-modification, was shown to modulate important physiological processes. The underlying reaction me-chanism of substitutional RNA editing involves hydro-lytic deamination of cytosine or adenosine bases to uracil or inosine, respectively. Protein factors have been characterized {{that are able to}} induce RNA editing in vitro. A supergene family of RNA-dependent deami-nases has emerged with the recent addition of adeno-sine deaminases specific for tRNA. Here we review the developments that have substantially increased our understanding of base-modification RNA editing over the past few years, with an emphasis on mechanistic differences, evolutionary aspects and the first insights into the regulation of editing activity. <b>BioEssay...</b>|$|E
