40|$|A {{sensitive}} and stable <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> would provide high resolution gravity measurements from space. The instrument could also provide precision tests of fundamental {{laws of physics}} and be applied to inertial guidance systems of the future. This report describes research on the superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> program at the University of Maryland from July 1980 to July 1985. The report describes the theoretical and experimental work on a prototype superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> The design of an advanced three-axis superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the current <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> {{research}} at Stanford has been to establish the feasibility of using a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> with 1 E accuracy, as the primary sensor in various applications.

40|$|We {{present the}} design, fabrication, and {{characterization}} of a seesaw-lever force-balancing suspension for a silicon gravity-gradient sensor, a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer,</b> that {{is capable of}} operation over a range of gravity from 0 to 1 [*]g. This allows for both air and space deployment after ground validation. An overall rationale for designing a microelectromechanical systems(MEMS) <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> is developed, indicating that a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> based on a torsion-balance, rather than a differential-accelerometer, provides the best approach. The fundamental micromachined element, a seesaw-lever force-balancing suspension, is designed with a low fundamental frequency for in-plane rotation to response gravity gradient but with good rejection of all cross-axis modes. During operation under 1 [*]g, a gravitational force is axially loaded on two straight-beams that perform as a stiff fulcrum for the mass-connection lever without affecting sensitive in-plane rotational sensing. The dynamics of this suspension are analysed by both closed-form and finite element analysis, with good agreement between the two. The suspension has been fabricated using through-wafer deep reactive-ion etching and the dynamics verified both in air and vacuum. The sensitivity of a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> built around this suspension will be dominated by thermal noise, contributing in this case a noise floor of around 10 [*]E/Hz−−−√ 10 [*]E/Hz (1 [*]E[*]=[*] 10 − 9 /s 2) in vacuum. Compared with previous conventional <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers,</b> this suspension allows a gradiometer of performance within an order of magnitude but greatly reduced volume and weight.

Superconductivity and other properties of materials at low temperatures can be used to obtain a sensitive, low-drift gravity gradiometer; by differencing the outputs of accelerometer pairs using superconducting circuits, it is possible to construct a tensor <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> which measures all the in-line and cross components of the tensor simultaneously. Additional superconducting circuits can be provided to determine the linear and angular acceleration vectors.

The superconducting <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> uses sensitive superconducting accelerometers, each of which are composed of a weakly suspended superconducting proof mass, a superconducting magnetic transducer, and a low-noise superconducting magnetometer. The magnetic field produced by the transducer coils is modulated by the motion of the proof mass and detected by the magnetometer.

40|$|The <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> {{is widely}} used in mineral prospecting, {{including}} in the exploration of mineral, oil and gas deposits. The mismatch of accelerometers adversely affects the measuring precision of rotating accelerometer-based <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometers.</b> Several strategies have been investigated to address the imbalance of accelerometers in gradiometers. These strategies, however, complicate gradiometer structures because feedback loops and re-designed accelerometers are needed in these strategies. In this paper, we present a novel matching method, {{which is based on}} a new configuration of accelerometers in a <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer.</b> In the new configuration, an angle was introduced between the measurement direction of the accelerometer and the spin direction. With the introduced angle, accelerometers could measure the centrifugal acceleration generated by the rotating disc. Matching was realized by updating the scale factors of the accelerometers with the help of centrifugal acceleration. Further simulation computations showed that after adopting the new matching method, signal-to-noise ratio improved from − 41 dB to 22 dB. Compared with other matching methods, our method is more flexible and costs less. The matching accuracy of this new method {{is similar to that of}} other methods. Our method provides a new idea for matching methods in <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> measurement...|$|R

To quantify the potential performance for future <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> instruments as an INS aid, extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a hypersonic scramjet cruise missile were performed. The results for the 1000 km range mission indicate that GGI updates significantly improve the navigation accuracy of the autonomous INS. The sensitivities of the system to variations in inertial measurement unit (IMU) quality, gravity field variation, GGI noise, update rate, and type are also investigated along with a baseline INS/Global Positioning System (GPS). Given emerging technologies that have the potential to drastically decrease gradiometer noise levels, a hypothetical future grade <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> aided INS is shown to bound root-mean-square (RMS) position errors at 0. 336 m, velocity errors at 0. 0069 m/s, and attitude errors at 0. 00977 degrees, which is comparable to the nominal INS/GPS system with 10 sec updates. The performance of two subsonic cases is also investigated and produced impressive passive navigation accuracy.

GIZERO {{consists of a}} vacuum capsule released from balloon altitude (40 km) {{which is used to}} shield a payload with an experimental apparatus free falling inside. The expected residual acceleration is 10 ^− 12 g/√Hz for about 20 – 25 seconds (50 – 60 seconds with a propelled capsule). The GIZERO facility provides opportunities for accurate experiments in gravitational physics. Among others, two experiments of our particular interest are: testing and calibration of a high sensitivity <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> and a test of the Equivalence Principle (the gravity level can be reduced down to 10 ^− 15 g/√Hz using cryogenic techniques). It is expected that a triaxial <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> prepared for a future space mission can be tested at the sensitivity level of 10 ^− 2 E/√Hz. The estimated accuracy in testing the Equivalence Principle is 5 x 10 ^− 14 at the liquid nitrogen temperature of 77 K and 5 x 10 ^− 15 at the liquid helium temperature of 4 K.

Utilizing a number of recently devised techniques which rely on certain properties of superconductors, a design for a sensitive yet rugged <b>gravity</b> <b>gradiometer</b> with a high degree of stability and a common-mode rejection ratio greater than 10 to the 9 th is produced. With a base line of 0. 11 m, a sensitivity of 0. 1 Eotvos per sq root Hz is expected in an environment monitored to a level of 0. 01 m/sq sec sq root Hz for linear vibration and 7 x 10 to the - 6 th rad/s sq root Hz for angular vibration. A conventional stabilized platform can be used at this level. The intrinsic noise level, which is two orders of magnitude lower, could be achieved by monitoring the attitude with a superconducting angular accelerometer which is under development.

They are held at right angles to each other by springs. They have heavy masses at the ends of the beams, and the whole assembly spun around the common axle at high speed.
