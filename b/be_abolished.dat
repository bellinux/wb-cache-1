5|$|At {{the end of}} 1905 {{football}} {{looked about}} to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> due {{to all of the}} reoccurring violence during games. Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, and elbows to the face. Almost any violent behavior was allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to <b>be</b> <b>abolished.</b> In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow arrests and detention without trial only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|The capital, Kolkata, was the {{workplace}} of several social reformers, including Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Swami Vivekananda. Their social reforms {{eventually led to}} a cultural atmosphere {{that made it possible}} for practices like sati, dowry, and caste-based discrimination, or untouchability, to <b>be</b> <b>abolished.</b> The region was also home to several religious teachers, such as Chaitanya, Ramakrishna, Prabhupada, and Paramahansa Yogananda.|$|E

5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation {{by the government to}} their benefit.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should <b>be</b> <b>abolished.</b> Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, Goebel was a {{delegate}} to Kentucky's fourth constitutional convention, which produced the current Kentucky Constitution. Despite the high honor of being chosen as {{a delegate}}, Goebel showed {{little interest in}} participating {{in the process of}} creating a new constitution. The convention was in session for 250 days; Goebel was present for just 100 of them. He did, however, successfully secure the inclusion of the Railroad Commission in the new constitution. As a constitutional entity, the Commission could only <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> by an amendment ratified by popular vote. This would effectively protect the Commission from ever being unilaterally dismantled by the General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|It did {{not take}} Louis XVIII long {{to go back on}} one of his many promises. He and his ComptrollerGeneral of Finance Baron Louis were {{determined}} not to let the exchequer fall into deficit (there was a 75million franc debt inherited from Napoleon I), and took fiscal measures to ensure this. Louis XVIII assured the French that the unpopular taxes on tobacco, wine and salt would <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> when he was restored, but he failed to do so, which led to rioting in Bordeaux. Expenditures on the army was slashed in the 1815 budget– in 1814, the military had accounted for 55% of government spending.|$|E
5|$|Labor's leader, Don Dunstan, also {{introduced}} a bill for reform of the Legislative Council, which sought to remove its wage and property based qualifications and instil adult suffrage. Hall himself stated he would approve the bill if it included a clause guaranteeing that the Legislative Council could only <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> through a referendum. Dunstan agreed, but Hall's own party split on the issue. The bill passed the House of Assembly with Labor support, but failed in the Legislative Council where the LCL's rural conservatives dominated its restricted electoral base.|$|E
5|$|The Committee to Review Ministerial Salaries {{recommended}} that pensions for political appointment holders <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> {{in favour of}} Central Provident Fund payments. Appointment holders appointed on and after 21 May 2011 will not receive any pension, while those appointed before that date will only be eligible for pensions accrued up to that date. Such pensions will be paid after they step down or retire from office. If the removal of pensions is taken into account, the Prime Minister's annual salary will be reduced from the 2010 figure by 36%, and that of MR4-grade ministers by 37%.|$|E

5|$|When Singapore {{joined the}} Federation of Malaya in 1963, the Malayan ISA was {{extended}} to Singapore. The Act was retained in Singapore even after its separation from Malaysia in 1965. The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition. In September 2011, {{the debate over whether}} the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia announced that it was considering repealing the ISA. Prime Minister Najib Razak stated that the Act would <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> and replaced by new laws to safeguard peace and order.|$|E
5|$|A naming {{exception}} was Huge Viking, {{which was used}} for a Boeing 747. Huge was the quickest being in Norse mythology, but the name also played on the words English meaning. SAS reuses the names from retired aircraft, except for those of crashed aircraft. Because of oversights, the name Agnar and Rane have however been reused. A similar naming convention, albeit using the full name of kings, was used by Braathens SAFE of Norway and Loftleiðir of Iceland. As Carlzon was opposed to the Viking references, he also proposed that the names <b>be</b> <b>abolished.</b> The executive management reverted its decision following massive protests from within the airline. Female aircraft names were introduced by Scanair in 1980, who gave them to all their Douglas DC-8s. SAS followed suit in 1989, when the entire series of Boeing 767 were named for prominent female Vikings. Scandinavian letters were introduced from the 1990s. SAS Commuter's Norwegian Fokker 50 aircraft were given names for places in Norway, such as Lakselv.|$|E
5|$|As the {{prospect}} of war with Japan became more likely, so also did {{the need to make}} appropriate arrangements for leading the defence of Australia. In 1935, Lavarack had recommended that in the event of war, the Military Board <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> and its powers vested in a Commander-in-chief. In April 1941, the Minister for the Army, Percy Spender, recommended that this now be done, with Sturdee becoming Commander in Chief of the Australian Military Forces. Instead, the government elected to adopt the British system, in which the Military Board (or Army Council as it was called there) continued to operate, with a separate GOC Home Forces. On 5 August 1941, Major General Sir Iven Mackay was appointed to this newly created post. However, the idea of a Commander in Chief did not go away and editorials in the Sunday Telegraph and The Sydney Morning Herald advocated the appointment.|$|E
50|$|The Soviet rule brought {{major changes}} in rural {{municipalities}} as local village councils were created throughout 1945. The parishes <b>were</b> <b>abolished</b> {{with the creation of}} raions in 1950. Naissaar Parish had <b>been</b> <b>abolished</b> and given to the Red Army already in 1940 and Pakri Parish had <b>been</b> <b>abolished</b> and merged with Paldiski in 1947.|$|R
50|$|Serfdom <b>was</b> <b>abolished</b> in 1861, but its {{abolition}} {{was achieved}} on terms not always {{favorable to the}} peasants and served to increase revolutionary pressures. Between 1864 and 1871 serfdom <b>was</b> <b>abolished</b> in Georgia. In Kalmykia serfdom <b>was</b> only <b>abolished</b> in 1892.|$|R

5|$|Caracalla was {{not subject}} to a proper damnatio memoriae after his assassination; while the Senate disliked him, his {{popularity}} with the military prevented Macrinus and the Senate from openly declaring {{him to be a}} hostis. Macrinus, in an effort to placate the Senate, instead ordered the secret removal of statues of Caracalla from public view. After his death, the public made comparisons between him and other condemned emperors and called for the horse race celebrating his birthday to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> and for gold and silver statues dedicated to him to be melted down. These events were, however, limited in scope; most erasures of his name from inscriptions were either accidental or occurred as a result of re-use. Macrinus had Caracalla deified and commemorated on coins as Divus Antoninus. There {{does not appear to have}} been any intentional mutilation of Caracalla in any images that were created during his reign as sole emperor.|$|E
5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> by 2015.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{reorganisation}} {{of public}} transportation by the Labour government of Clement Attlee, the LPTB {{was scheduled to be}} nationalised along with the majority of British railway, bus, road haulage and waterway concerns from 1 January 1948. In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new British Transport Commission which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> and replaced by the London Transport Executive. Lord Latham, a member of the LPTB and the incoming chairman of the new organisation, acted as temporary chairman for the last two months of the LPTB's existence.|$|E
50|$|In August 1927, the uyezds <b>were</b> <b>abolished</b> and, {{effective}} October 1, 1927, Malovishersky District was established, {{with the}} administrative center in Malaya Vishera. Novgorod Governorate <b>was</b> <b>abolished</b> {{as well and}} the district {{became a part of}} Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast.

5|$|Following {{his divorce}} from Rosamunde, Gibbs married {{for a third}} time. He wed Doris Mannix at St Matthew’s Church of England in Bondi on 9 September 1948. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and {{significance}} of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, Gibbs and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Robert Kavanaugh, William McAloney, Dick Richards and Gibbs, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{residents}} of Coney Island protested against paying a {{transfer to the}} bus on Mermaid Avenue (now the B74 bus to Sea Gate), with some saying that the 15-cent fee for transferring should <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> because the bus was essentially an adjunct to the station. In 1979, the City Planning Commission proposed something similar, in that Coney Island residents would get a free transfer between the /B74 bus routes and the subway station. It was noted that the station {{was the only one}} that did not get a free bus transfer after the corresponding subway transfer was discontinued (in sharp contrast to the BMT Culver Line, BMT Myrtle Avenue Line, and IRT Third Avenue Line, which were discontinued but replaced by bus transfers). The free transfers would allow a $200 million apartment complex nearby, funded by the government, to get more residents to move in, as well as diversify Mark Twain Junior High School and attract a stable middle class.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to <b>be</b> <b>abolished</b> – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took the unusual step of saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E
