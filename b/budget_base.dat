A case study was carried out in a company which is active in the production and commercialization of drinks, and which applies the methodology of the OBZ in the development of its budget planning. It can be concluded that the OBZ is not only a tool to reduce costs and to guarantee economies, but a tool of entrepreneurial management whose goal is to provide the development of better practices for the elaboration of the activities, as well as for the optimization of the financial resources...|$|E

The State of the Law School This Strategic Plan {{is written}} in a {{different}} economic climate and is predicated on {{a different set of}} fiscal assumptions than the Strategic Plan submitted three years ago. The 1989 Strategic Plan formulated goals for improving the School of Law based on optimistic assumptions about five percent and ten percent increases in state funding levels. This Plan compels us to set priorities after a five percent budget reduction in FY 92 that is expected to continue to be reflected in the <b>budget</b> <b>base</b> for future years. The 1989 Strategic Plan, as this one must be, was premised on a recognition of the significant progress made by the School of Law over the past twenty-five years in attracting a first-rate faculty and talented students and in creating an academic program of real excellence. Progress toward goals set in the 1989 Strategic Plan has been made despite an essentially flat state funding level. In fact, after the five percent budget reduction, state funding for the School of Law today is one percent less in inflation-adjusted dollars than seven years ago...|$|E
40|$|The Scotland Bill {{contains}} proposals {{based on}} the Calman Report to remedy the major financial weakness of the 1997 devolution settlement – namely its limited tax-raising powers. The new funding model will combine Block Grant with new tax revenues from a Scottish Income Tax, a Scottish Land Transaction Tax and a Scottish Landfill Tax. However, it has been heavily criticised by the Scottish Government for having a "long-term deflationary bias". This is a strong attack on a model intended to maintain stability and promote accountability in devolution finance. The current approach {{is embedded in the}} UK fiscal framework, in which the UK Government has responsibility for the planning and control of the public finances, and resource allocation to UK Departments and Devolved Administrations. The Scottish Budget therefore benefits from "an automatic macroeconomic stabilisation level and a public expenditure per capita substantially above the UK average". The UK Budget process provides a high degree of stability. It operates through incremental change, in which the major part of the new budget is the existing baseline, and decisions are made around the margins of this <b>budget</b> <b>base.</b> In the case of the Scottish Budget, incremental adjustments are made through the Barnett Formula which delivers the same per capita increase/decrease as comparable UK programmes, and has delivered "stability and predictability" since devolution...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of empirical results of a questionnaire survey conducted with thirty Cambodian development-oriented NGOs engaging in diverse program activities, this paper identifies that success and effectiveness of grassroots projects of Cambodian development-oriented NGOs essentially relies on adequate financial resources and competent human resources, plus strong organizational leadership and networking with other NGOs. Moreover, organizations that concentrate on {{a small number of}} program areas and projects prove to be effective and capacitated. These findings indicate that Cambodian development-oriented NGOs place a heavy emphasis on financial and human resources, leadership and networking rather than on other components which also enumerate project success（i. e. organizational structure, commitment of project staff, and other integral elements of external environment）. However, a review of the weakest determinants of project success and capacity indicates there are the least prioritized areas for improvement, mirroring the typical organizational limitations of Cambodian development-oriented NGOs: strong male domination, weak knowledge and application of gender and participation concepts and analysis, imprecise organizational philosophy, and leader-driven and hierarchical management. The analysis additionally unveils that to increase grassroots project success, Cambodian development NGOs need to improve not only the <b>budget</b> <b>base</b> and human capacities but organizational structure（i. e. an organizational vision, mission and strategies; gender allocation in staffing; and decision-making processes）and beneficiary involvement as well. In this sense, it is emphasized that the most-needed-to-improve capacities for Cambodian development-oriented NGOs are in the area of eradicating these weak aspects of organizational characteristics. The paper therefore concludes that Cambodian NGOs ’ capacity-building must be based on development of their organizations, in addition to two fundamental conditions for their capacity-building: financial and human resource improvements...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{primary care}} {{physicians}} are being given <b>budgets</b> <b>based</b> on capitation formulae {{in the belief that}} such budgets will be fairer than <b>budgets</b> <b>based</b> on the historical utilization of funds. A second reason for giving {{primary care physicians}} <b>budgets</b> <b>based</b> on capitation formulae is that governments hope this will lead to beneficial changes in the behavior of physicians, for example, leading to healthcare resources being used more efficiently and appropriately. Ultimately capitation formulae are expected to produce financial benefits that can be reinvested in better clinical services for patients. In this paper these three key objectives are discussed using examples where capitation formulae have been used. There is limited evidence of the benefits of using capitation formulae but this evidence mainly comes from observational studies that are prone to bias and confounding. A major deficiency with the current capitation formulae used to allocate budgets to primary care physicians in England is that they generally only contain weightings for age, sex, and one or more ecological measures of need. Risk adjustment models have been used in the US but these models can explain only a small proportion of the variation in healthcare costs. At present in the UK it is uncertain whether capitation-based budgets and the enforced collaborative working arrangements for general practitioners will lead to a more efficient and equitable National Health Service. Continued evaluation of how capitation formulae are developed, the methods to adequately adjust for clinical risk, and how capitation formulae change clinical practice are required.
