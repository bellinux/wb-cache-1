The study found that the majority of respondents were unwilling to pay the actual price premium of 27% for fair trade coffee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of the social web, {{engagement}} means that customers and stakeholders, such as consumer advocacy groups and groups that criticize companies (e.g., lobby groups or advocacy organizations) are active participants rather than passive viewers. Social media use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services or business practices, or a government's actioins. Each participating customer or non-customer (or citizen) who is participating online via social media becomes part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort), as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers and potential consumers (or citizens) to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing. With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services, which can eventually be translated into <b>buying</b> <b>behavior</b> (or voting or donating behavior in a political context). New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.|$|E

This article also shows conceptual and empirical evidence that there is some support for the moderating role of normative evaluations {{in the relationship between}} buying impulsiveness and impulse <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Significance occurs when consumers believe that act on impulse is suitable.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The current {{scenario}} of retailing {{is characterized by}} huge cut throat competition and almost undifferentiated merchandise on sales. Today retailers are utilizing visual merchandising to differentiate their offerings from others‘ {{as well as to}} improve the visibility and desirability of products. Too many researches have been performed for defining and measuring the concept. The various factors which affect impulse buying have not been determined much. The purpose of this research is {{to examine the relationship between}} consumer impulse <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors</b> and visual merchandising. Efforts have also been employed to understand the visual merchandising technique that influences the consumers at most. This study also intends to provide information on why visual merchandising should be considered an important component of a strategic marketing plan in support of sales increase and positive store/company image. The finding of the current study reveals that there is a very strong association between consumer impulse <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors</b> and two types of visual merchandising practices: in store form/mannequin display and promotional signage. This study also provides insights to retailers about types of visual merchandising that can influence consumers‘ impulse <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors...</b>|$|R

Particularly blue, a cool color, was rated as more favorable and produced higher purchasing intentions than orange, a warm color. However, all negative effects to orange were neutralized when orange store color was paired with soft lighting. This shows that store color and lighting actually interact.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to compare and contrast the fashion attitudes and <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors</b> of college students at a Midwestern university in the United States and at a metropolitan university in China toward apparel products, and to clarify the {{factors that contribute to}} differences and similarities among the two markets. Data were obtained from 317 American and Chinese college students with an age range of 18 to 24 years. The consumer decision-making characteristics related to fashion attitudes were supported by the buying behavioral results in this study. Although similarities overweighed differences overall, several subtle differences were identified in buying characteristics by country. The study confirmed that globalization and cultural background factors including demographics and psychographics have an impact on characterizing fashion attitudes and <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors</b> between American and Chinese college student consumers. Implications of the findings suggest to marketers of U.

This current research examines the interaction of shopping context (online or offline) in relation to impulsive and compulsive <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors.</b> We find evidence that compulsive buying tendency is positively associated with online shopping, while impulse buying tendency is positively associated with offline shopping. The implications of this research suggest that purchasing as a result of compulsive and impulsive buying tendencies vary {{as a result of the}} shopping context which includes physical proximity to product and store atmospherics.

40|$|The {{credibility}} and consistency of brands are central elements in {{its position in}} the minds of con	sumers, reducing the uncertainty linked to the buying processes, building associations and solidifying relationships of trust, repeated purchases and brand equity. Retailers started to sell their own brands – Private labels – positioned at low-end segments, based on low price and low quality. Actually we observe the coexistence of PLs with different qualitative levels, based on branding strategies that may include umbrella and/or independent names: private labels are a central strategic issue for all major food retailers. These labels may contribute to increase retailer’s differentiation, exclusivity, associations, loyalty, and, as a consequence, retailer brand equity. Brand equity results from the brand-market interaction, reflected in consumer’s perceptions, preferences and <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors,</b> built from all interactions developed between the consumer and the brand. Recent research tried to conceptualize the brand equity concept to retailers, building and testing “store equity” metrics, has the differential effect of the knowledge about retailers in consumers <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Two of the most representative scales about brand equity in retail industry were developed by Arnett, Laverie & Meieres and Pappu & Questerb.

Although a strong correlation exists between impulsive and compulsive <b>buying</b> <b>behaviors</b> (Shahjehan et al. 2012), compulsive buying encompasses an “inability to control the urge” (Faber et al. 1995, p. 297) and “leads to extreme negative circumstances” (Ridgway et al. 2006, p. 131). On the other hand, impulsive buying occurs [...] "when a consumer experiences a sudden, often powerful and persistent urge to buy something immediately. The impulse to buy is hedonically complex and may stimulate emotional conflict; also, impulse buying is prone to occur with diminished regard for its consequences" [...] (Rook, 1987, p. 191).|$|R
