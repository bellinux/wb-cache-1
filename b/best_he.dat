5|$|Before Ladas ran as a three-year-old, Mat Dawson, who {{had been}} {{training}} horses, including more than twenty classic winners since the 1850s, {{was reported to have}} called Ladas the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever trained. Later that season he ranked him second, slightly behind St. Simon. Henry Chaplin, the owner of Hermit, called Ladas the finest horse he had seen.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{had shown}} great {{ability as a}} {{collector}} and had done the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could with the reference books he had on ship. It was now the province of recognised expert specialists to establish which specimens were unknown, and make their considered taxonomic decisions on defining and naming new species.|$|E
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said his lap was likely the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever driven at the circuit.|$|E

5|$|On the {{one hand}} he must not enforce {{whatever}} he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.|$|E
5|$|Sherman's {{greatest}} {{contribution to}} the war, the strategy of total warfare—endorsed by General Grant and President Lincoln—has {{been the subject of}} controversy. Sherman himself downplayed his role in conducting total war, often saying that he was simply carrying out orders as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could in order to fulfill his part of Grant's master plan for ending the war.|$|E
5|$|When the ice {{finally brought}} the camp {{to the edge}} of the pack ice, Shackleton decided that the three boats, the James Caird, Stancomb Wills, and Dudley Docker, should make {{initially}} for Elephant Island. McNish had prepared the boats as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could for a long journey in the open ocean, building up their sides to give them a higher clearance from the water.|$|E

5|$|After {{a one-day}} tournament in South Africa, West Indies {{returned}} home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2–0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be {{fifth in the}} team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that {{he was suffering from}} fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his <b>best,</b> <b>he</b> continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.|$|E
5|$|Alexander had no {{experience}} in affairs of state. However, {{he was determined to}} make the best of a difficult situation and represent his father as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. Adopting an air of cool indifference to the government, he rarely made the effort to read official documents before he rubber-stamped them. His functions were limited, and amounted to visiting the Macedonian front to support the morale of the Greek and Allied troops. Since Venizelos's return to power, Athens was at war with the Central Powers, and Greek soldiers battled those of Bulgaria in the north.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and {{the ebb and flow}} of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

5|$|In late 1970, Vicki Cole {{indicated}} {{in an interview}} Nixon was doing the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. During the 1972 campaign, Cole served as Ohio chair of a future voters organization for the Nixon campaign. She then left politics, devoting her spare time to training and showing horses. In 1974, Cole {{declined to comment on}} the resignation of President Nixon in the wake of the Watergate scandal, but stated in 1977 that she felt sympathy for him, though she believed his resignation was necessary.|$|E
5|$|In the First Test, England {{amassed a}} big first innings score and looked likely to win, but Stan McCabe made 232 for Australia, a {{performance}} Bradman rated as the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had ever seen. With Australia forced to follow-on, Bradman fought hard to ensure McCabe's effort {{was not in}} vain, and he secured the draw with 144 not out. It was the slowest Test hundred of his career and he played a similar innings of 102 not {{out in the next}} Test as Australia struggled to another draw. Rain completely washed out the Third Test at Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began {{to go out into the}} countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E

5000|$|In late 2006 {{interviews}} {{to promote the}} Stop the Clocks album, Noel {{was asked about the}} song repeatedly and that he'd said it was his best song ever - comments that he attempted to dampen. In an interview for The Sun, the band were asked about the song. Noel replied by saying, [...] "Every time I write a new song I say it's the best ever! But it's not the best thing I've ever written. There are about ten different versions and I can't decide on which one. It's a good song, the lyrics are great." [...] Liam said, [...] "I don't think it's the <b>best</b> <b>he's</b> written — it's a tune but not his <b>best.</b> <b>He's</b> done about four versions but he's not happy with it so it's a bit of a nightmare." [...] Andy Bell, however, called it [...] "amazing".|$|R
5|$|It {{was four}} years before Selänne {{returned}} to international play; he appeared in the 1996 World Championship and the 1996 World Cup of Hockey and averaged over one point per game in both tournaments as Finland finished fifth each time. At the 1998 Winter Olympics, Selänne finished with ten points in five games. He was the tournament's leading scorer on a Finnish team that he described in 2003 as the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> ever played on and {{the best in the}} tournament, but lost the semifinal, 7–4 to Russia. He suffered an abdominal muscle injury that prevented him from playing in the third place game, which Finland won 3–2 over Canada; Selänne and his teammates ended the tournament as the bronze medal winners.|$|E

While at the plantation, Tom meets Cassy, another of Legree's slaves. Cassy was previously {{separated from her}} son and daughter when they were sold; unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold, she killed her third child.|$|E

His efforts helped Vancouver to a second consecutive Presidents' Trophy. Individually, he ranked 10th in Norris Trophy balloting with two second-place votes. In the 2012 playoffs, Hamhuis recorded three assists over five games as the Canucks were upset by the Los Angeles Kings in the first round.|$|E

5|$|The 1939–40 {{season was}} Bradman's most {{productive}} ever for SA: 1,448runs {{at an average}} of 144.8. He made three double centuries, including 251 not out against NSW, the innings that he rated the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> ever played in the Sheffield Shield, as he tamed Bill O'Reilly {{at the height of his}} form. However, it was the end of an era. The outbreak of World War Two led to the indefinite postponement of all cricket tours, and the suspension of the Sheffield Shield competition.|$|E
5|$|These games {{raised the}} profile of {{paraplegic}} (spinal cord and polio) athletes in Australia, particularly Western Australia. The spectator attendance amazed leading officials such as Dr Ludwig Guttmann, {{the founder of the}} Stoke Mandeville Games. He commented that the attendance was the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> had seen at any paraplegic sports event in the world. The Games highlighted the versatility of the athletes with many winning medals in different sports. It was noted that generally the standard of performance was below that of the Stoke Mandeville Games; however there were several outstanding performers including Vic Renalson, Bill Mather-Brown, Lorraine Dodd, M. Bazeley, Lynne Gilchrist and R. Scott who broke records in their events. A film of the Games was made.|$|E
5|$|By 02:15 on 30 April one CH-46 and one CH-53 were {{landing at}} the Embassy every 10 minutes. At this time, the Embassy {{indicated}} that another 19 lifts would complete the evacuation. At that time Major Kean {{estimated that there}} were still some 850 non-American evacuees and 225 Americans (including the Marines), and Ambassador Martin told Major Kean to do the <b>best</b> <b>he</b> could. At 03:00 Ambassador Martin ordered Major Kean to move all the remaining evacuees {{into the parking lot}} LZ which was the Marines' final perimeter. At 03:27 President Gerald Ford ordered that no more than 19 additional lifts would be allowed to complete the evacuation. At 04:30 with the 19 lift limit already exceeded, Major Kean went to the rooftop LZ and spoke over a helicopter radio with General Carey who advised that President Ford had ordered that the airlift be limited to US personnel. Major Kean was then ordered to withdraw his men into the Chancery building and withdraw to the rooftop LZ for evacuation.|$|E
