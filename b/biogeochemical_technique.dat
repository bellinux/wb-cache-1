40|$|A {{broad range}} of <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> {{encompassing}} {{a wide array of}} disciplines is successfully being used to address key questions in archaeological research, including chronology, migration, trade, palaeopathology and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions. The aim of the session was to focus particularly on the developments in palaeodietary studies, which inform about population dynamics and socio-cultural characteristics of different communities over space and time. <b>Biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> in particular have shown a remarkable adeptness at acquiring data from a variety of archaeological substrates, such as ceramics, lithics, textiles, sediments, plant remains, and human and animal tissues, including dental calculus. These techniques allow an intensive exploitation of archaeological material, especially organics, which are often preserved in small quantities and would otherwise not have been considered viable for analysis. The success of this approach is attested by the wide range of publications detailing the development and application of novel techniques, targeted towards answering fundamental archaeological questions. This was also reflected in the {{broad range of}} analytical methodologies presented during the session, which comprised bulk light and heavy stable isotope analysis that allows {{a better understanding of the}} composition of ancient diets, characterization of foodstuffs absorbed within ceramic vessels using lipid residue analysis, identification of protein sequences informing on dietary deficiencies, studies on microbial communities associated with the production of specific food types, and microscopic techniques used on teeth and dental calculus to recover palaeodietary information...|$|R

Determining the diets of long-extinct hominins, however, is a considerable challenge. Although archaeological evidence forms a pillar of our understand-ing of diet and subsistence in the more recent past, for early hominins, the most direct evidence {{is to be found}} inthe fossils themselves. Here we review the suite of emerging biochemical paleodietary tools based on stable isotopeand trace element archives within fossil calcified tissues. We critically assess their contribution to advancing our understanding of australopith, early Homo, and Neander-thal diets within the broader context of non-biogeochemical techniques for dietary reconstruction, such as mor-phology and dental microwear analysis. The most signifi-cant outcomes to date are the demonstration of hightrophic-level diets among Neanderthals and Late Pleistocene modern humans in Glacial Europe, and the persis-tent inclusion of C 4 grass-related foods in the diets of Plio¿Pleistocene hominins in South Africa. Such studies clearly show the promise of <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> for testing hypotheses about the diets of early hominins.

40|$|Widespread {{ecological}} reorganizations {{and increases}} in organic carbon (OC) in lakes across the Northern Hemisphere have raised concerns {{about the impact of}} the ongoing climate warming on aquatic ecosystems and carbon cycling. We employed diverse <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> on a highresolution sediment record from a subarctic lake in northern Finland (70 °N) to examine the direction, magnitude and mechanism of change in aquatic carbon pools prior to and under the anthropogenic warming. Coupled variation in the elemental and isotopic composition of the sediment and a proxybased summer air temperature reconstruction tracked changes in aquatic production, depicting a decline during a cool climate interval between ~ 1700 – 1900 C. E. and a subsequent increase over the 20 th century. OC accumulation rates displayed similar coeval variation with temperature, mirroring both changes in aquatic production and terrestrial carbon export. Increase in sediment organic content over the 20 th century together with high inferred aquatic UV exposure imply that the 20 th century increase in OC accumulation is primarily connected to elevated lake production rather than terrestrial inputs. The changes in the supply of autochthonous energy sources were further reflected higher up the benthic food web, as evidenced by biotic stable isotopic fingerprints...|$|R

Surface sediment was first sampled at different periods {{of the year to}} assess the importance of the biological compartment (particularly metazoan meiofauna) and its relation to seasonally varying particulate matter input to the sea floor (estimated by measuring surface sediment particle size and porosity, as well as chloroplastic pigments, organic carbon, nitrogen and calcium carbonate contents).

40|$|Water {{pollution}} problems, due {{to industrial}} effluents in aquatic environments (lakes, rivers, estuaries & coastal waters), are increasing {{day by day}} as industrial effluent waste is degrading ecosystem, global water cycle and environment. Applications of biological agents (organisms or their components), along with physical, chemical & engineering processes to maintain, protect and restore the environment are involved in Environmental Biotechnology (EB). Analytical analysis and tests like biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and total solids (TS) etc. are required to assess the pollution load & strength of waste to be treated in most efficient manner. Biological treatment, bioremediation and natural attenuation have been a rapidly growing area of science over the past decade. Natural attenuation is viewed as the best solution for cleaning up many waste sites and will save {{billions of dollars in}} cleanup costs. The biotreatment, bioremediation and Natural Attenuation area have both basic research and field application foci for the EB. The field application foci are co-metabolic <b>techniques,</b> <b>biogeochemical</b> assessment <b>techniques,</b> and modeling of attenuation and environmental fate. There is further scope for research for modification and applications in physical and chemical engineering processes (like creation of more channels for treatment of effluent wastes, increase in retention time of effluent during various stages so that more biodegradation & bioremediation can be achieved) and applications of genetically improved better strains of microbes to control effluent pollution more efficiently...|$|R

The area of principal study falls between Latitude 20 ° 30 'N, 21 ° 00 'S and Longitude 22 ° 10 'W, 23 ° 10 'E. The {{study in the}} Ngwako pan area was concentrated {{in the vicinity of}} known copper mineralization in Ghanzi series rocks to the north east of older Kgwebe series porphyries, sandstones and diabases. The results of geobotanical, geochemical and bio-geochemical investigations demonstrated the applicability of these methods to prospecting here. A close study of plant species distribution showed that Ecbolium lugardae distribution outlines an area within which a soil copper anomaly exists. These geobotanical studies also revealed a close relationship between high copper contents in plant tissue and soil, and the shrubs Anticharis linearis, {{and to a lesser extent}} Abutilon fruticosum. The savanna vegetation of the area comprises a mosaic of vegetation associations, varying in structure and. life form with prevailing climatic and edaphic conditions and with the residual influences of geo-morphology. Distinctive vegetation associations are shown to distinguish various lithological units. Biogeochemical studies showed a close correlation of high copper values in the soil with high copper content in the plant tissue. A correlation more easily recognised if the copper content in the plant tissue is expressed as number of standard deviations from the mean p. p. m. dry weight. The biogeochemistry also indicated an area of anomalous copper values in plant tissue outside the geochemical anomaly, and which may be reflecting deeper seated mineralization. The potential use of geobotanical and <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> in mineral exploration are pointed out. Geochemical studies showed a dispersion of anomalously high copper values to surface through more than three metres of calcrete overlying minor copper mineralization. The best contrast of anomalous to threshold values was found in the - 30 + 60 mesh fraction and in the - 120 and finer mesh fractions. The highest absolute contrast was seen in the 270 mesh fraction, the finest fraction analysed. In the Mawani area a search for kimberlite pipes proved unsuccessful. Distinctive vegetation associations are recognised over the different lithological and pedological units. <p...|$|R

The application of different isotope systems has allowed archaeologists to interpret ancient diet, migration and pollution. Although well established in archaeology, biogeochemical interpretations are burdened with questions not only as to the methodology employed but also whether the data presents a consistent picture of past human activity. The use of biographically identifiable individuals offers {{a means by which}} the isotope systems may be tested against extent documentary evidence. A sample of forty-five individuals, almost half of which were named individuals, were obtained from the sites of Holy Trinity (Coventry) and St. Luke's (Old Street, Chelsea) and the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, strontium and lead analysed. The biographies ofthe named individuals were reconstructed through analysis ofextant historical documentation and' used to provide a framework of interpretation for the biogeochemical teclmiques applied. Comparisons are made between the two sites in relation to the <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> employed, biographical reconstruction and osteoarchaeological evidence for disease, migration and diet to address methodological issues and broader questions on 'i,ndustrialisation' during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries}}. The osteoarchaeological evidence suggests separation of the two groups into discrete' populations, one that is characterised by occupationally-derived osteoarthropathies (Coventry), and the second, Chelsea, which has an absence of these pathologies. This supports the historical character of the t cities: Coventry as an industrial city in contrast to Chelsea, a 'village of palaces' or pleasure resort. Biogeochemically, carbon and nitrogen isotopes revealed a picture of status-based access to protein resources in a diet that is particularly dominated by freshwater fish, terrestrial omnivores such as pig, or a combination of the two. There is, however, little evidence for a difference in access to such resources between the sexes. Likewise, strontium and oxygen isotopes are capable of differentiating between the two populations and therefore in identifying local and migrant individuals, though limitations in the sample prevent the full utilisation of this data. In one case (Milborough Maxwell) the isotopic techniques able to reveal trans-Atlantic migration between England and the Caribbean. Analysis of lead isotopes of the two populations indicates that while there is little to differentiate the two sites, heavy metal exposure is greater for the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than for previous periods.

40|$|Stratiform copper {{mineralization}} {{was discovered}} in the Witvlei Area of South West Africa, within the Precambrian meta-sedimentary Tsumis Formation. The region has a semi-arid climate and the vegetation is characterised by a low tree and shrub savanna. On a regional scale the classification and species composition of the vegetation {{is related to the}} depth and nature of the overburden. The three environments of near surface bedrock, sand covered and calcrete covered are recognised. Geobotanical, biogeochenical and geochemical studies were carried out in areas of known mineralization in the various environments to determine the most effective use of these techniques in an integrated exploration program. In the selected areas the geology and soil profiles are recorded from trench sections and wagon drilling, and the copper content of mineralized bedrock and soils determined. The distribution of plant species is recorded along continuous belt transects parallel to the trench sections so that a direct comparison of the geology, geochemistry and geobotany can be made. Geological and geobotanical mapping and geochemical soil surveys were extended over the areas of interest. Plant samples of leaves, twigs and grasses were collected from the more common species along the transects for copper analyses. Investigation of the rooting habits and seasonal variation in copper content of selected tree and shrub species was also made. In areas of near surface bedrock the horizons of copper mineralization are most clearly defined by anomalous soil values in the range 200 [...] 500 ppm., for the minus 80 mesh, and an anomalous vegetation zone dominated by the species Helichrysum leptolepis and Fimbristylis exilis, with the associated grass species Aristida congesta, Eragrostis denudata and Anthephora pubescence. Trees and shrubs and the common grass species of the area, Stipagrostis uniplumis, do not occur within this anomalous vegetation zone. Leaf and twig samples from several species of trees and shrubs show a high copper content in areas of mineralization. The species Grewia flava and Phaeoptilon spinosum proved the most successful in the detection of biogeochemical anomalies because of their more regular distribution and more consistent values. Areas suitable for detailed orientation studies could not be located in the regions of deeper overburden of sand and calcrete. No geobotanical indicators of mineralization were found in these areas and the use of <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> is very much restricted by the sporadic distribution of the deeper rooted species. <p...|$|R
40|$|Marine primary {{producers}} play {{an important}} role in controlling the atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis and export of organic matter into the deep ocean. In this thesis I used two <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> based on O 2 /Ar ratios and O 2 isotopologues to measure net community production (N) and gross oxygen production (G) in two different areas relevant for the marine C cycle: the South Atlantic subtropical gyre and the North Atlantic during a spring bloom. The former despite small rates of production it is relevant for the global marine C cycle due to the large area it covers; in addition the study of this gyre may contribute to clarify the ongoing debate on whether subtropical gyres are net autotrophic or heterotrophic. The North Atlantic is a main component of the global C production because of the large the amount of C that is fixed during the spring bloom. N was estimated from continuous measurements of O 2 /Ar ratios with a Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometer and G from discrete samples both in the USW of RSS James Cook (South Atlantic) and R/V Knorr (North Atlantic). Discrete samples were processed in a newly built gas extraction line and analyze in an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer at UEA. The gas extraction line was built for the separation of O 2 and Ar from N 2 without isotopic fractionation. This thesis shows that the South Atlantic Gyre produced O 2 at a rate of 10 ± 3 mmol m- 2 d- 1 in March/April 2009, thus was net autotrophic. Interestingly G (177 ± 96 mmol m- 2 d- 1) was much higher than previous estimates. This difference could be due to other processes that might fractionate the O 2 without fixing any carbon such as the Mehler reaction. Measurements of N made in the North Atlantic during a spring bloom in May 2008 showed the highly variable and heterogeneous nature of the area. Within the bloom N had an average value of 67 mmol m- 2 d- 1 with N increasing from 60 to 170 mmol m- 2 d- 1, followed by a short period of net heterotrophy and finishing at 5 mmol m- 2 d- 1. These changes were associated with changes in the species composition, with diatoms dominating first followed by the increase of nanophytoplankton. These techniques show O 2 /Ar and O 2 isotopologues to be useful and accurate proxies for production with the potential for complete automation of O 2 /Ar measurements...|$|R
40|$|Little Penguins (Eudyptula minor) are the {{smallest}} penguin in the world. They have a distribution ranging from south-western Australia, through to New Zealand and the Chatham Islands. Some populations in Australia and the South Island of New Zealand {{have been the}} subject of considerable research, but there has been less undertaken on populations in the northern half of New Zealand. The Department of Conservation however, are concerned about their status and have list the northern populations as ‘At Risk – Declining’ in the New Zealand Thread Classification System. As part of a new longitudinal study on Little Penguins (LP) resident on Tiritiri Matangi Island, Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand this study focussed on their foraging behaviour and breeding success over 2010 and 2011. Two new <b>biogeochemical</b> <b>techniques</b> were used in this study to examine LP diet from tissue samples. Stable isotope analysis of LP blood, feathers and potential prey species established the trophic level of the LP (calibrated from a captive feeding trial) and was able to determine both temporal and spatial shifts in trophic level over a 12 month period. These shifts may indicate changes in prey type or abundance, however more research is required to determine this. Fatty acid signature analysis of potential prey and LP adipose found similarities that suggest the prey types were likely included in the LP diet, but sample sizes were small and again further research is required. Abundance of potential prey species within the local Hauraki Gulf region were extrapolated from commercial catches of bait fish statistics and foraging ranges from were proxied from previous studies. It was determined that commercial fishing is unlikely to impact the LP at this time. A third emerging technology, GPS tracking dataloggers, was proposed to track the penguins across the breeding and non-breeding seasons to determine where they foraged, how far they ranged and how this changed seasonally. Unfortunately, equipment failures resulted in no tracks being recorded. Breeding success recorded for 5 years was extremely variable however, for one year at least, it was apparent that a significant absence of preferred prey may be linked to a devastatingly poor year for rearing chicks. Top predators such as seabirds, including penguins, are a model bioindicator for the health of their local marine environment i. e. a seabird population that breeds well and is in good body condition likely indicates there is abundant food and clean water. Conversely a sea bird population that is declining in size or experiences poor recruitment, may be an indication that prey is absent or that waters are polluted. With the local North Island LP populations potentially already in decline, it is important to continue to monitor aspects of their breeding and foraging in the coming years – not only for the benefit of the penguins, but for the wider conservation of the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park...|$|R

40|$|Efficient {{exploration}} for new Au deposits {{is increasingly}} important as existing deposits become depleted. This is particularly relevant in Australia, where exploration {{can be difficult}} because of a thick regolith cover. New and effective methods of exploration need to be developed, and possibilities lie in geomicrobiological methods. For instance, Bacillus cereus, a common soil bacterium, {{has been shown to}} act as a biogeochemical indicator for concealed mineralisations, including vein-type Au deposits. We report the results of the first Australian case study of the association of B. cereus and Au at the Tomakin Park Gold Mine in southeastern New South Wales. Soil samples from the Ah horizon were analysed for B. cereus spores and 56 major and trace elements. The results show enrichment of Au, As, B. cereus spores and, to a lesser extent, Sb, Bi and Pb {{over the top of the}} Au deposit. Gold concentrations over the mineralisation range from 100 ppb to 1. 1 ppm compared to a background of 2 ppb and As concentrations are enriched to 100 ppm from a background of 5 ppm. B. cereus spore counts were up to 10 times higher in soils with elevated concentrations of Au. Factor analysis indicates four main associations: TiO 2 +lanthanides+actinides; CaO+MgO+Cs+Be+Ba(+Ga+Pb+Rb); B. cereus+Au+As+Sb+Bi(+Pb); Fe 2 O 3 +MnO+Co+Ni+Cu+Mo. Selective sequential leaching was used to study the fractionation of Au and As in soils, other regolith materials and Au-bearing vein quartz to infer their mobility and bioavailability. In unweathered quartz vein material, the majority of the Au was extracted only in the strongest, final step, with aqua regia. However, in soils from the Ah horizon, 50 % of the Au was present in the water-, ammonium acetate- and sodium pyrophosphate- and hydroxylamine hydrochloride-extractable fractions. In contrast, As displays little change in fractionation with an increasing degree of weathering, and is predominantly associated with the operationally defined Mn- and Fe-oxides and oxyhydroxides. These results indicate that: (i) Au is mobilised during the weathering of the host rock; (ii) Au is bioavailable in these soils; and (iii) the increase in B. cereus spores is likely to be linked to elevated concentrations of bioavailable Au in these soils. The results indicate also that an effective <b>biogeochemical</b> exploration <b>technique</b> may be developed, where B. cereus spore counts are measured in the field and used as a pre-screening method to target areas useful for further sampling and complete geochemical analysis...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} has {{accelerated}} {{the pace of}} glacial retreat in high-latitude and high-elevation environments, exposing lands that remain devoid of vegetation for many years. The exposure of ‘new’ soil is particularly apparent at high elevations (5000 metres above sea level) in the Peruvian Andes, where extreme environmental conditions hinder plant colonization. Nonetheless, these seemingly barren soils contain a diverse microbial community; yet the biogeochemical role of micro-organisms at these extreme elevations remains unknown. Using <b>biogeochemical</b> and molecular <b>techniques,</b> we investigated the biological community structure and ecosystem functioning of the pre-plant stages of primary succession in soils along a high-Andean chronosequence. We found that recently glaciated soils were colonized by a diverse community of cyanobacteria during the first 4 – 5 years following glacial retreat. This significant increase in cyanobacterial diversity corresponded with equally dramatic increases in soil stability, heterotrophic microbial biomass, soil enzyme activity and the presence and abundance of photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments. Furthermore, we found that soil nitrogen-fixation rates increased almost two orders of magnitude during the first 4 – 5 years of succession, many years before the establishment of mosses, lichens or vascular plants. Carbon analyses (pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy) of soil organic matter suggested that soil carbon along the chronosequence was of microbial origin. This indicates that inputs of nutrients and organic matter during early ecosystem development at these sites are dominated by microbial carbon and nitrogen fixation. Overall, our results indicate that photosynthetic and nitrogen-fixing bacteria play important roles in acquiring nutrients and facilitating ecological succession in soils near {{some of the highest}} elevation receding glaciers on the Earth...|$|R
40|$|The {{global climate}} is {{predicted}} to become significantly warmer over the next century. This will affect ecosystem processes and the functioning of semi natural and natural ecosystems {{in many parts of}} the world. However, as various ecosystem processes may be affected to a different extent, balances between different ecosystem processes as well as between different ecosystems may shift and lead to major unpredicted changes. In this study four European shrubland ecosystems along a north¿south temperature gradient were experimentally warmed by a novel nighttime warming <b>technique.</b> <b>Biogeochemical</b> cycling of both carbon and nitrogen was affected at the colder sites with increased carbon uptake for plant growth as well as increased carbon loss through soil respiration. Carbon uptake by plant growth was more sensitive to warming than expected from the temperature response across the sites while carbon loss through soil respiration reacted to warming in agreement with the overall Q 10 and response functions to temperature across the sites. Opposite to carbon, the nitrogen mineralization was relatively insensitive to the temperature increase and was mainly affected by changes in soil moisture. The results suggest that C and N cycles respond asymmetrically to warming, which may lead to progressive nitrogen limitation and thereby acclimation in plant production. This further suggests that in many temperate zones nitrogen deposition has to be accounted for, not only with respect to the impact on water quality through increased nitrogen leaching where N deposition is high, but also in predictions of carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems under future climatic conditions. Finally the results indicate that on the short term the above-ground processes are more sensitive to temperature changes than the below ground processe...|$|R

Understanding its response to disturbances could inform habitat restoration, but many environmental impacts predate monitoring programs (< 50 years). 2. This research explores the palaeoecological potential of Posidonia mats to reconstruct six thousand years of environmental change that could have affected Posidonia meadows and, in turn, left an imprint on the mats. 3. Palynological, microcharcoal, magnetic susceptibility and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP) analyses on Posidonia mats enabled us to detect climate- and humaninduced environmental processes impacting on the seagrass during the Late Holocene. 4. The pollen and microcharcoal records reconstructed anthropogenic disturbances attributed to agriculture. The record of GRSP shows that agrarian activities affected continental soil quality.

Posidonia oceanica forms {{extensive}} peat-like deposits (mats) in Mediterranean coastal waters, {{which have}} a potential as carbon sinks and archives of environmental change. Nonetheless, the organic chemistry of both P. oceanica plant materials, {{as well as the}} environmental and diagenetic effects on the composition of its detritus, is poorly understood. We analyzed plant organs of P. oceanica and the coarse organic matter from a mat core spanning 750 yrs using pyrolysis techniques (PY-GC-MS and THM-GC-MS) to improve our understanding of their molecular properties and their preservation upon mat development. It appeared that leaf sheaths, roots and the outer parts of rhizomes were composed predominantly of phenolic constituents based on p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HBA), which is atypical for vascular plants, in addition to carbohydrates and lignin. The inner rhizome and leaf blades had a different composition, with predominance of carbohydrates. The seagrass detritus in the mat was composed mainly of p-HBA phenolic material and carbohydrates, confirming earlier studies showing that the coarse detritus in the mat originates largely from Posidonia sheath, root and rhizome debris. The intermolecular arrangement of the p-HBA remains unclear, as they seem to correspond to ester-bound phenols yet their persistence in the mat attributes them a refractory nature. Variations in molecular composition within the mat are probably associated with diagenetic alteration of P. oceanica detritus, such as the decomposition of minor amounts of fatty acids, chlorophyll and syringyl lignin, and selective preservation of p-HBA relative to carbohydrates.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted {{the importance of}} rivers in the global carbon cycle. Rivers transport considerable amounts of sediment and carbon (C) to the ocean and act as a major conduit between the continental and oceanic component of C cycle. However, a large fraction of the C in the fluvial system does not reach the ocean, either due to mineralization during transport or storage in transitory stores within the fluvial network. Our {{understanding of the role}} of these transitory stores under the different climatic regions remains limited. This research focuses on the temporal significance of a tropical floodplain (as transitory C store) and its role in the river C and sediment fluxes. The study is based in the Tana River, Kenya a tropical lowland semi-arid floodplain. Our research area was in the Garissa-Garsen (GSA-GSN) reach of the floodplain ~ 380 km river length and ~ 1, 000 km 2. We have used a unique combination of advanced <b>biogeochemical</b> and geophysical <b>techniques</b> to characterize the interaction between the floodplain and the main river, quantifying the fluxes of C and sediments transported in the river and deposited within the Tana River floodplain and analysing the temporal significance of Tana River floodplains as a C sink. During flood events, a significant amount of sediment is deposited within the GSA-GSN reach. Based on a combination of fallout radionuclide activities, we recorded a 50 yr mean sedimentation rates of 1. 15 - 1. 21 g cm- 2 yr- 1 and a 100 yr mean of 1. 01 g cm- 2 yr- 1 (using 137 Cs and 210 Pbex, respectively). Event-based sediment deposition rates averaged between 2 - 15 mm vertical accretion, corresponding to an average of 0. 58 ± 0. 42 g cm- 2 (dry weight). Overbank flooding is common with a 73 yr flooding frequency of 1. 05 flood yr- 1 and an average of 1 - 2 Mt (15 - 30 %) of the river sediment load being deposited in the GSA-GSN floodplain reach. Substantial amounts of organic carbon (OC) are deposited with this enormous amount of sediment. However, the deposited sediments are carbon poor at ~ 1. 5 % OC and the floodplain vegetation plays a big role in enrichment with additional OC inputs to levels above 3 % OC at the (sub) surface layers. Sediment cores at floodplain locations therefore show relatively high OC concentrations (3 - 12 % OC) in the (sub) surface layers, however, due to high mineralization rates, a sharp decrease of OC with depth is observed to less than 1 % OC below ca. 60 cm depth. Acknowledging that OC source is an important consideration in OC preservation, we investigated OC sources and storage with depth within the floodplain using d 13 C-OC as a proxy. Local disturbance by clearing of vegetation and subsistence agriculture caused homogenization of the d 13 C-OC depth profile, while fresh biomass inputs from the undisturbed floodplain locations appeared to accelerate mineralization of riverine sediment derived OC. Our data shows that despite the strong variability in 13 C enrichment in deep layers at some sites, the OC in sediment deposits show no evidence of major shift in the dominant vegetation in the catchment. The post depositional dynamics of OC were dominated by a combination of isotope mixing, selective mineralization and kinetic fractionation upon OC mineralization making it difficult to constrain the principal mechanism responsible for the observed pattern in d 13 C-OC. Due to this intricate mechanism, it was difficult to properly model mineralization of below ground OC using the Introductory Carbon Balance Depth Explicit Model (ICBM-DE), a simplified two pool SOC mineralization model. Finally when we made a budget of the fluxes both within the river and the floodplain, we found that during flooding, an intensive selective deposition in the different geomorphological featured within the floodplain occurred. This led to changes in grain size as different particle sizes were either remobilized or preferentially deposited in certain floodplain location. The sorting is also evidenced by high fluxes of fine grain size at both the upstream and downstream locations {{and at the same time}} deposition of fine materials within the floodplain. Remobilization of sediment mainly through bank incision and meander migrations was a major floodplain process. While about 6. 7 Mt yr- 1 sediment and 104 GgC yr- 1 enters the floodplain at Garissa, 5. 19 Mt yr- 1 of sediment equivalent to 36 GgC yr- 1 is mobilized and added to this pool annually through river incisions. Consequently, the majority of this sediment and C is lost, the main mechanisms include within river deposition (6. 57 Mt yr- 1 sediment or 66 GgC yr- 1), overbank floodplain deposition (38 GgC yr- 1, 2. 45 Mt yr- 1 or 27 % of total sediment fluxes) and the rest is discharged as fluxes downstream of the floodplain in Garsen (34 GgC yr- 1, 2. 6 Mt yr- 1, 24 % of total sediment fluxes). Due to the intensive selective deposition and sorting of different grain sizes, the downstream riverine fluxes of suspended matter and particulate organic carbon pools are strongly influenced by these processes. status: publishe...|$|R
