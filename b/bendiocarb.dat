40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles gambiae, {{the main}} malaria vector in Benin has {{developed}} {{high level of}} resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (<b>bendiocarb)</b> and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s. s. Methods Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (<b>bendiocarb)</b> and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, exophily, blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts. Results Deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and <b>bendiocarb</b> treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p An. gambiae (in the first month) and 77. 8 % (in the fourth month). <b>Bendiocarb</b> and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin mortality rates ranged from 97. 9 to 100 % the first month and 77. 7 - 88 % the third month respectively. Conclusion After four months, fenitrothion, <b>bendiocarb</b> and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin performed effectively against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles. These results showed that <b>bendiocarb</b> could be recommended as an effective insecticide for use in IRS operations in Benin, particularly as the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin does not have WHOPES authorization and complaints were mentioned by the sleepers about the safety and smell of fenitrothion. </p...|$|E

40|$|Malaria control {{relies heavily}} on {{pyrethroid}} insecticides, to which susceptibility is declining in Anopheles mosquitoes. To combat pyrethroid resistance, application of alternative insecticides is advocated for indoor residual spraying (IRS), and carbamates are increasingly important. Emergence of a very strong carbamate resistance phenotype in Anopheles gambiae from Tiassalé, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, is therefore a potentially major operational challenge, particularly because these malaria vectors now exhibit resistance to multiple insecticide classes. We investigated the genetic basis {{of resistance to the}} most commonly-applied carbamate, <b>bendiocarb,</b> in An. gambiae from Tiassalé. Geographically-replicated whole genome microarray experiments identified elevated P 450 enzyme expression as associated with <b>bendiocarb</b> resistance, most notably genes from the CYP 6 subfamily. P 450 s were further implicated in resistance phenotypes by induction of significantly elevated mortality to <b>bendiocarb</b> by the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which also enhanced the action of pyrethroids and an organophosphate. CYP 6 P 3 and especially CYP 6 M 2 produced <b>bendiocarb</b> resistance via transgenic expression in Drosophila in addition to pyrethroid resistance for both genes, and DDT resistance for CYP 6 M 2 expression. CYP 6 M 2 can thus cause resistance to three distinct classes of insecticide although the biochemical mechanism for carbamates is unclear because, in contrast to CYP 6 P 3, recombinant CYP 6 M 2 did not metabolise <b>bendiocarb</b> in vitro. Strongly <b>bendiocarb</b> resistant mosquitoes also displayed elevated expression of the acetylcholinesterase ACE- 1 gene, arising at least in part from gene duplication, which confers a survival advantage to carriers of additional copies of resistant ACE- 1 G 119 S alleles. Our results are alarming for vector-based malaria control. Extreme carbamate resistance in Tiassalé An. gambiae results from coupling of over-expressed target site allelic variants with heightened CYP 6 P 450 expression, which also provides resistance across contrasting insecticides. Mosquito populations displaying such a diverse basis of extreme and cross-resistance are likely to be unresponsive to standard insecticide resistance management practices...|$|E

The quality of spraying varied across different wall substrates in both districts. Evaluation of <b>bendiocarb</b> decay showed that the proportion of houses with recommended concentration declined from 96. 9 %, 93. 5 % and 76. 2 % at months one, two, and three post IRS, respectively (p-trend = 0. 03).

40|$|<b>Bendiocarb</b> was {{introduced}} {{for the first}} time for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) in Tanzania in 2012 as part of the interim national insecticide resistance management plan. This move followed reports of increasingly alarming levels of pyrethroid resistance across the country. This study used the insecticide quantification kit (IQK) to investigate the intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, and decay rate of <b>bendiocarb</b> on different wall surfaces in Kagera region.; To assess intra-operational IRS coverage and quality of spraying, 104 houses were randomly selected out of 161, 414 sprayed houses. A total of 509 samples (218 in Muleba and 291 in Karagwe) were obtained by scraping the insecticide samples from wall surfaces. To investigate decay rate, 66 houses (36 in Muleba and 30 in Karagwe) were selected and samples were collected monthly for a period of five months. Laboratory testing of insecticide concentration was done using IQK(TM) [Innovative Vector Control Consortium].; Of the 509 samples, 89. 5 % met the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended concentration (between 100 - 400  mg/m(2)) for IRS target dosage. The proportion of samples meeting WHO standards varied between Karagwe (84. 3 %) and Muleba (96. 3 %) (p[*]>[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Anopheles gambiae, {{the main}} malaria vector in Benin has {{developed}} {{high level of}} resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, which is a serious concern to the future use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal {{of this study was}} to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (<b>bendiocarb)</b> and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s. s. Methods: Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (<b>bendiocarb)</b> and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos + a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, exophily, blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts. Results: Deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and <b>bendiocarb</b> treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p < 0. 05) compared to untreated huts. Blood feeding rates in huts treated with fenitrothion and the mixtur...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{pollution}} by insecticides {{is one of}} {{the most}} important problems in the world. Some of the pesticides were found to exert carcinogenic, teratogenic and/or mutagenic effects even following normal agricultural use (U. S. Geological Survey, 1997). On the other hand residues from insecticides, herbicides and insect growth hormones are known to represent the most common food contaminants particularly in developing countries. Thus the wide spread use of insecticides in agriculture stimulated our interest for studying their possible toxic effect(s) in man and animals. The aim of the present work was to study the effect of short term (for 2 weeks) oral daily feeding with diet containing 10 times the human maximum acceptable daily intake (a concentration that may be faced by human) of either permethrin, pirimiphos-methyl or <b>bendiocarb</b> on osmotic fragility of rat erythrocytes. Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into four groups, each consists of 10 animals. Animals of each group were fed either normal diet (control group), permethrin (21. 7 ppm), pirimiphos-methyl (4. 4 ppm) or <b>bendiocarb</b> (2. 0 ppm) for 2 weeks. Twenty four hours later, blood samples were withdrawn and osmotic fragility was determined. The obtained results indicated that permethrin, pirimiphos-methyl and <b>bendiocarb</b> increase the osmotic fragility...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use of insecticides {{in agriculture}} and in public health calls for greater attention for studying their possible toxic effect (s) on man and animals. Acute toxic effects have been relatively well known whereas chronic effects require further studies. The aim of the present work was, therefore, to study the histopathological changes in testes, liver and kidney of rats due to 30 days feeding on diet containing permethrin, pirimiphos methyl and <b>bendiocarb.</b> The dose used for each insecticide represented a concentration that equals ten times the acceptable human daily intake. These doses are far below the LD 50, but represent possible exposure doses. Forty male Sprague- Dawley rats were divided into 4 equal groups. Animals of each group were fed either by normal diet, or diet mixed with permethrin (21. 739 ppm), pirimiphos methyl (4. 350 ppm) or <b>bendiocarb</b> (2 ppm) for 30 days. Histological sections of testes, liver and kidneys were examined and histopathological changes and quantitative estimates were recorded. Incidence of spermatogenic suppression, Leydig cell atrophy and vacuolation of Sertoli cells were most prominent in testicular sections from primiphos methyl treated animal testis than in animals of the other groups. Peremethrin feeding resulted in the least deteriorative changes. In sections of liver, dilatation and congestion of blood sinusoids was most evident in the group treated with primiphos methyl and to less extent in those treated with <b>bendiocarb.</b> Swollen hepatocytes with pyknotic nuclei and incidence of apoptosis were also recorded. In kidney sections, vacuolar degeneration, tubular and capsular dilatation, and glomerular congestion were observed especially in primiphos methyl treated rats. In conclusion, the obtained changes were of different severity as a response of exposure to permethrin, pirimiphos methyl or <b>bendiocarb</b> at the same equivelant of human acceptable daily intake...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The dual {{problems}} of rising insecticide {{resistance in the}} malaria vectors and increasing human malaria cases since 2001 in southern Mozambique are cause for serious concern. The selection of insecticides for use in indoor residual spraying (IRS) programmes is highly dependent {{on the extent to}} which local mosquitoes are susceptible to the approved classes of insecticides. The insecticide resistance status and role in malaria transmission of Anopheles funestus was evaluated at the Maragra Sugar Estate in southern Mozambique where an IRS vector control programme has been in operation for seven years using the carbamate insecticide <b>bendiocarb.</b> Results No Anopheles species were captured inside the sugar estate control area. Anopheles funestus group captured outside of the estate represented 90 % (n = 475) of the total collections. Of the specimens identified to species by PCR (n = 167), 95 % were An. funestus s. s. One An. rivulorum was identified and seven specimens did not amplify. The Anopheles gambiae complex was less abundant (n = 53) and of those identified (n = 33) 76 % were An. arabiensis and 24 % An. merus. Insecticide susceptibility tests showed that wild-caught and F- 1 family An. funestus were resistant to deltamethrin (32. 5 % mortality) and lambda-cyhalothrin (14. 6 % mortality), less so to <b>bendiocarb</b> (71. 5 % mortality) and fully susceptible to both malathion and DDT (100 %). <b>Bendiocarb</b> and pyrethroid resistance was nullified using 4 % piperonyl butoxide (Pbo), strongly suggesting that both are mediated by P 450 monooxygenase detoxification. ELISA tests of An. funestus for Plasmodium falciparum, gave a sporozoite rate of 6. 02 % (n = 166). One unidentified member of the An. gambiae complex tested positive for P. falciparum sporozoites. Conclusion Anopheles funestus was found to be the most abundant and principle vector of malaria in this area, with members of the An. gambiae complex being secondary vectors. Despite the continual use of <b>bendiocarb</b> within the estate for seven years and the level of An. funestus resistance to this insecticide, the IVC programme is still effective against this and other Anopheles in that no vectors were found inside the control area. However, the Mozambique National Malaria Control Programme ceased the use of DDT and <b>bendiocarb</b> in this area of its operations in 2009, and replaced these insecticides with a pyrethroid which will increase insecticide resistance selection pressure and impact on control programmes such as the Maragra IVC. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{population}} of Anopheles arabiensis, a major malaria vector in South Africa, was collected during 2005 from inside sprayed houses in Mamfene, northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, using window exit traps. None of these specimens (n = 300 females) {{was found to}} be infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Insecticide susceptibility assays on 2 – 3 day old F 1 progeny usingWHOsusceptibility kits revealed 100 % susceptibility to <b>bendiocarb,</b> resistance to deltamethrin (95. 91 %) was suspected, while resistance to permethrin (78. 05 %) was confirmed. The knockdown resistant (kdr) genotype was not found in the surviving mosquitoes. Biochemical analysis using enzyme assays showed elevated levels of monooxygenase that correlated with the permethrin bioassay data. While elevated levels of non-specific esterase were found in some families (11 / 12 for α- and 6 / 12 for β-esterases), the data did not show any correlation with the permethrin bioassay. Analysis of permethrin and <b>bendiocarb</b> tolerant lines, selected in the laboratory to characterise biochemical resistance profiles, showed increased levels of non-specific esterase and monooxygenase activity {{in the case of the}} permethrin-selected cohorts, and elevated glutathione S-transferases and general esterases in that of the bendiocarb-selected line. Synergist assays, using piperonyl butoxide, confirmed the involvement of monooxygenase and glutathione S-transferase in pyrethroid and <b>bendiocarb</b> resistance. This study underlines the importance of routine surveillance for insecticide susceptibility in wild anopheline populations...|$|E
