40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{trials were}} aimed to {{evaluate}} beef tallow in diets {{with and without}} emulsifier on performance of pigs at growing-finishing phases. In the first trial, 15 barrows (22. 03 ± 0. 62 kg) were distributed among three treatments: reference diet; test diet 1 (5 % <b>beef</b> tallow) <b>and</b> test diet 2 (10 % beef tallow). Beef tallow presented average value of 7130. 97 kcal ME/kg. For the performance trail, 30 barrows (24. 85 ± 1. 18 kg) were distributed among five treatments: T 1 - diet with soybean oil and 3230 kcal ME /kg; T 2 - diet with <b>beef</b> tallow <b>and</b> 3230 kcal ME/kg; T 3 - diet with <b>beef</b> tallow <b>and</b> 3080 kcal ME/kg; T 4 - diet with beef tallow, 3080 kcal/kg and 0. 1 % emulsifier; T 5 - diet with beef tallow, 2930 kcal ME/kg and 0. 1 % emulsifier. Feed conversion was worse in animals fed diet with 3080 kcal ME/kg containing <b>beef</b> tallow <b>and</b> with 2930 kcal ME/kg with <b>beef</b> tallow <b>and</b> emulsifier.

The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831.
