5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
5|$|The French {{defeat at}} Sedan left the Allied Army Groups in Belgium with sparse flank protection. The German attack, {{especially}} the breakout from the bridgeheads at Sedan, was {{so fast that}} there were hardly any major combats. Many French soldiers were in such shock that they were taken prisoner before they could offer resistance, which also explains the low casualty rates for both sides. The two assault engineer battalions under Korthals achieved the most important success. <b>By</b> <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> bunkers in the Bellevue sector, they made the breakthroughs of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions possible. This was achieved without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{was sworn}} in as the Masten District City Councilman on January 4, 2001 after being {{appointed}} by the Democratic Committee. His east side district included 27% of Buffalo's African American population. The Buffalo City Council had a brief African-American majority during Thompson's appointed half term that ended following the subsequent elections in September and November 2001. After African-Americans lost their majority the council voted along racial lines by a 76 margin to shrink the common council from thirteen to nine members <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> four at-large positions (three of which were held by African-Americans). The city voters endorsed the proposal by a 35,84919,036 margin which largely went along racial lines. Thompson retained his council position in the 2001, 2003 and 2005 elections. Thompson served as a John Edwards delegate at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Chinese plan {{to capture}} Seoul, the PVA 42nd and the 66th Corps were tasked with {{protecting}} the Chinese left flank <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> ROK 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions, while cutting the road between Chuncheon and Seoul. Following instructions, the two Chinese corps struck quickly after midnight on New Year's Eve. The PVA 124th Division first penetrated the flanks of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division, then blocked the division's withdrawal route. The trapped ROK 17th and 32nd Regiments of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division were then forced to retreat in disarray. With the PVA 66th Corps pressuring the ROK 5th Infantry Division's front, the PVA 124th Division then advanced eastward in the South Korean rear and blocked the ROK 5th Infantry Division's retreat route as well. The maneuver soon left the ROK 36th Regiment of the ROK 5th Infantry Division surrounded by Chinese, and the ROK 36th Regiment had to escape by infiltrating the Chinese lines using mountain trails. By January 1, the ROK III Corps was in full retreat, while the corps' headquarters had lost contact with the 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions. Responding to the crisis on the central front, the ROK III Corps sector's defense was handed over the US X Corps.|$|E

5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times <b>by</b> <b>eliminating</b> <b>the</b> signal time allocated to split phasingâ€”a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease blind spots and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
