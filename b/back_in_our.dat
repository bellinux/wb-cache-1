500|$|New York's win {{clinched}} the team's fifth postseason berth in franchise history, their first since losing in the 1988 National League Championship Series. The playoff berth made the Mets the second team in MLB history {{to make the}} playoffs after being two games back of the leader with three games left to play in the season. The Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLDS in four games. This win advanced the Mets to the NLCS where they were defeated by the Atlanta Braves in six games. After the defeat, Mets General Manager Steve Phillips summed up the harrowing weeks the team had been through saying that [...] "we had destiny in our own hands, we lost destiny, we got it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own hands...We didn't choke.

Further, {{he is very}} often a reject (from the offense) or the runt of the litter. Nobody wants him, and he is hungry. We had three walk-ons, four QBs, and three running <b>backs</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> original Junkyard Dog starting cast, which averaged 208 pounds across the front. In short, a Junkyard Dog is one who must stretch and strain all of his potential just to survive. Then he can think about being good." ...|$|R

500|$|Although a {{prototype}} cartridge of the English NES Final Fantasy II was produced, the project was, by Moriyama's own admission, {{still far from}} complete; [...] "We had so very limited memory capacity we could use for each game, and it was never really [...] "translating" [...] but chopping up the information and cramming them <b>back</b> <b>in...</b> <b>our</b> boss had no understanding in putting in extra work for the English version at that time." [...] In 2003, when the game was finally released to English-speaking audiences as part of Final Fantasy Origins, it was released with new graphics, music, and a brand new translation {{under the supervision of}} Akira Kashiwagi. A fan translation of the original game was also created prior to the release of Origins, and makes use of an original translation as the existence of the prototype cartridge was not common knowledge at the time.|$|E
500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> home studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. Our hope is to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately. I found the verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E
500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the pay-per-view, WWE {{announced}} on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing [...] "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston Coliseum and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011, in which {{he referred to the}} idea as one in which [...] "Heyman saw something in [...] that nobody else wanted to admit." [...] In an early 2008 interview with The Sun, Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon nixed the idea, but Big Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to [...] "make" [...] a rising star like Punk. He also stated that he kept going to McMahon {{on the night of the}} pay-per-view to say that [...] "The people are going to throw this <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> face". Upset at how the event turned out, Tommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both asked after the event to be released from their contracts. Both requests were refused by McMahon and WWE's Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis.|$|E

The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> past as we would like to think.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess whether}} lumbar corsets are being {{effectively}} prescribed to control lower <b>back</b> pain <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study group. Methods: A postal questionnaire {{was sent to}} 130 consecutive patients who were prescribed lumbar corsets for control of <b>back</b> pain <b>in</b> a 2 -year period; 102 (78 %) patients responded. The Greenough and Fraser and visual analogue scoring systems {{were used to assess}} the physical and functional improvement of back pain. Results: Of the 102 patients who responded, 64 were females (62. 7 %), and 76 (74. 5 %) patients had worn the lumbar corset for more than 1 year’s duration. Ninety (88 %) patients normally wore the corset all day or most part of the day. There were improvements <b>in</b> the total <b>back</b> pain outcome scores before versus after wearing the lumbar corset: Greenough and Fraser mean 30. 02 up from 20. 07 (p< 0. 0001); and visual analogue mean pain score down to 4. 90 from 8. 30 (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: We conclude that lumbar corsets are being effectively prescribed and that there is good compliance and control of <b>back</b> pain <b>in</b> <b>our</b> study group...|$|R
