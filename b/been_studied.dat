5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of the incoming light. This makes the moth's overall colour polarization-dependent. Many insects can detect polarization of light, so it has been proposed that this feature may be used as a visual signal between moths. This has not yet <b>been</b> <b>studied,</b> however.|$|E
