5|$|Bernsten said audiences {{contemporaneous}} {{with the}} first season of Saturday Night Live were not ready for such characters. He said The Land of Gorch characters behaved so uncannily that audiences did not relate to them {{because they did not}} foresee hideous puppets <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> such a mature manner. Bernsten said this was the reason the characters' pithy one-liner jokes succeeded.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E

25|$|The story also {{speaks of}} mob {{psychology}} {{and the idea}} that people can abandon reason and act cruelly if {{they are part of a}} large group of people <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> the same manner. The idyllic setting of the story also demonstrates that violence and evil can take place anywhere and in any context. This also shows how people can turn on each other so easily.|$|E
25|$|On 31 January 2009, {{fractures}} {{within the}} Election Commission {{came to the}} fore when Gopalaswami recommended to President Pratibha Patil that Election Commissioner Navin Chawla be sacked for <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a partisan manner. This recommendation in itself was controversial, as it was unclear if a CEC had the legal and constitutional right to provide such a unilateral recommendation. Chawla refused to resign as he was expected to take over the post of Chief Election Commissioner a few months later.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} have criticized GERB for piling on {{the pressure on}} the government by <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a fashion that was contrary to the underlying tenets of Parliamentarism due to on occasions refusing to register or participate in Parliamentary sessions and thus impeding the work of the National Assembly. GERB brought forward a no-confidence motion against the government on 25 September 2013, but it could not be debated in the National Parliament, as its party representatives excused themselves from the proceedings.|$|E

50|$|Behavioralism studies how {{individuals}} <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> group positions realistically rather than {{how they should}} behave. For example, {{a study of the}} United States Congress might include a consideration of how members of Congress <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> their positions.

25|$|To {{those who}} believe that {{consciousness}} entails something more than <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> all ways conscious, Dennett's view is seen as eliminativist, since it denies the existence of qualia and the possibility of philosophical zombies. However, Dennett is not denying the existence of the mind or of consciousness, only what he considers a naive view of them. The point of contention is whether Dennett's own definitions are indeed more accurate, whether what we think of when we speak of perceptions and consciousness can be understood in terms of nothing more than their effect on behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Attitudes to German rule {{changed as}} the Occupation went on. At first, the Germans {{followed}} {{a policy of}} presenting a non-threatening presence to the resident population for its propaganda value ahead of an eventual invasion and occupation of the United Kingdom. Many Islanders were willing {{to go along with}} the necessities of Occupation as long as they felt the Germans were <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a correct and legal way. Two events particularly jolted many Islanders out of this passive attitude: the confiscation of radios, and the deportation of large sections of the populations.|$|E
25|$|He {{remained}} an active Barrister, often appearing for the defence {{in criminal cases}} while serving as a Member of Parliament. He specialised in criminal justice issues in Parliament and In May 1957 he took up {{the case of a}} life sentence prisoner who was allowed to attend the funeral of a close relation but chose not to out of fear of the press; Keegan urged Home Secretary R.A. Butler to prevent the press from <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> this way. Keegan also spoke to oppose restrictions on Commonwealth immigration in principle.|$|E
50|$|Serpentinitization {{of a mass}} of {{peridotite}} usually destroys {{all previous}} textural evidence because the serpentine minerals are weak and <b>behave</b> <b>in</b> a very ductile fashion.

That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> that manner… Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.|$|E

According their customs every seventh day is a holiday, on which no trade and no cash transactions are done, whereas when they drink alcohol, they are <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a ridiculous and undisciplined way during the whole day.|$|E
25|$|These form an {{organizing}} principle and unifying theme for Asimov's robotic-based fiction, appearing in his Robot series, the stories linked to it, and his Lucky Starr series of young-adult fiction. The Laws {{are incorporated into}} {{almost all of the}} positronic robots appearing in his fiction, and cannot be bypassed, being intended as a safety feature. Many of Asimov's robot-focused stories involve robots <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> unusual and counter-intuitive ways as an unintended consequence of how the robot applies the Three Laws to the situation in which it finds itself. Other authors working in Asimov's fictional universe have adopted them and references, often parodic, appear throughout science fiction as well as in other genres.|$|E

25|$|Saigō did insist, however, that Japan {{should go}} to war with Korea in the Seikanron debate of 1873 due to Korea's refusal to {{recognize}} the legitimacy of the Emperor Meiji as head of state of the Empire of Japan, and insulting treatment meted out to Japanese envoys attempting to establish trade and diplomatic relations. At one point, he offered to visit Korea in person and to provoke a casus belli by <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> such an insulting manner that the Koreans would be forced to kill him. However, the other Japanese leaders strongly opposed these plans, partly from budgetary considerations, and partly from realization of the weakness of Japan compared with the western countries from what they had witnessed during the Iwakura Mission. Saigō resigned from all of his government positions in protest and returned to his hometown of Kagoshima.|$|E
25|$|Result: Both teams {{wanted a}} {{designer}} shopping trolley, but Kinetic won it after Lewis unwittingly sabotaged Atomic's pitch by asking irrelevant questions and <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> an unprofessional manner. Kinetic therefore got the trolley and a handheld vacuum cleaner, while Atomic chose a pie making machine and a bird {{house with a}} built-in camera (Harry M. and Hayley wanted an inflatable support pillow, but Haya ignored them). Both teams struggled to sell {{in the first half}} of the day, and had to resort to cutting prices as the day went on. The standout performers were Harry H. and Lizzie on Kinetic, who overcame their lack of a discount with very effective product demonstrations of the vacuum cleaner, and Harry M. on Atomic, who single-handedly made almost half of his team's revenue by selling five bird boxes at the end of the day. Kinetic won out with a profit of £1,138.77, largely due to Harry H. and Lizzie's work with the vacuum cleaners, while Atomic suffered their fourth successive defeat, raising just £847.42.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{identity}} is one's personal experience of one's own gender. Gender identity can correlate with assigned sex at birth, or can differ from it completely. All societies {{have a set}} of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's social identity in relation to other members of society. In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females, a gender binary to which most people adhere and which includes expectations of masculinity and femininity in all aspects of sex and gender: biological sex, gender identity, and gender expression. In all societies, some individuals do not identify with some (or all) of the aspects of gender that are assigned to their biological sex; In some cases, a person's gender {{identity is}} inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics (genitals and secondary sex characteristics), resulting in individuals dressing and/or <b>behaving</b> <b>in</b> a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms. These gender expressions may be described as gender variant, transgender, or genderqueer (there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity), and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria (traditionally called Gender Identity Disorder or GID). Transgender individuals are greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before, during, and after their transition.|$|E
