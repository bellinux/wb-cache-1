40|$|Abstract—The {{nature of}} the Blogosphere determines that the {{majority}} of bloggers are only connected with a small number of fellow bloggers, and similar bloggers can be largely disconnected from each other. Aggregating them allows for cost-effective personalized services, targeted marketing, and exploration of new business opportunities. As most bloggers have {{only a small number of}} adjacent bloggers, the problem of aggregating similar bloggers presents challenges that demand novel algorithms of connecting the non-adjacent due to the fragmented distributions of bloggers. In this work, we define the problem, delineate its challenges, and present an approach that uses innovative ways to employ contextual information and collective wisdom to aggregate similar bloggers. A real-world <b>blog</b> <b>directory</b> is used for experiments. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, report findings, and discuss related issues and future work. I...|$|E

It also allows a brief comparison of recorded visits between Blog and display the PageRank of each blog. In addition, it generates a ranking of registered blogs, which by a methodology explained in the content of this article, lets you know those blogs that have had greater acceptance since its registration. This Directory was implemented using tools and services available on the Web such as Google Visualization API, PageRank, Javascript GeoIP web service, among others...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} formality and contextuality in weblogs. It investigates the main formality and contextuality features principally focusing on the F-score proposed by Heylighen and Dewale (1999). The primary material comes from the online <b>blog</b> <b>directory</b> Technorati and from Blogeries. com. The method was a corpus analysis using the concordance software Wordsmith in order to carry out a linguistic analysis of the data. The main findings confirm previous findings that blogs are mainly separated into thematic and Personal blogs. In addition, the more focused the author on imparting information, the higher the F-score and consequently the lower the contextuality of the text. Authors who focused on their personal lives produced more contextual texts with lower F-scores. The study suggests that whilst the F-score is a good indicator of formality, it should not be considered an absolute indication of formality in the traditional sense, rather it should be seen as an indication of a text’s contextuality and be used as a basis from which further investigation can be developed...|$|E

40|$|Blogs {{have become}} an {{important}} medium for people to express opinions and share information on the web. Predicting the interests of bloggers can be beneficial for information retrieval and knowledge discovery in the blogosphere. In this paper, we propose a two-layer classification model to categorize the interests of bloggers based {{on a set of}} short snippets collected from their blog posts. Experiments were conducted on a list of bloggers collected from <b>blog</b> <b>directories,</b> with their snippets collected from Google Blog Search. The results show that the proposed method is robust to errors in the lower level and achieve satisfactory performance in categorizing blogger’s interests...|$|R
40|$|Blogs are {{difficult}} to categorize by humans and machines alike, because they are written in a capricious style. In {{the early days of}} web, directories maintain by humans could not keep up millions the websites; likewise, <b>blog</b> <b>directories</b> cannot keep up with the explosive growth of the blogsphere. This paper investigates the efficacy of using machine learning to categorize blogs. We design a text classification experiment to categorize one hundred and twenty blogs into four topics: personal diary, news, political, and sports. The baseline feature is unigrams weighed by TF-IDF, which yielded 84 % accuracy. We analyze the corpus, features, and result data. Our analysis leads us to believe that blog taxonomies need to support polyhierarchy—a given blog may be correctly classified under more than one category...|$|R
40|$|Blog {{classification}} is {{the system}} of classifying blogs based on pre-defined categories. This area is addressed by considering the textual content, or the surrounding features of the blogs. This thesis focuses on the textual content of the blogs which uses the blog title and posts for classification. These blogs are categorised and maintained as a <b>blog</b> <b>directory</b> that serves {{the demands of the}} users searching information online. Such online blog directories use human indexers to categorize blog pages. Manual classifications of blogs are tends to be labour intensive and time consuming. In related fields such as text mining and web mining, various classification methods such as supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods were proposed. These studies have used Bag-of-Words representation of text documents, and indexes using term weighting scheme which does not capture the semantic relatedness. In this thesis, we devise a novel framework for automatic topic based blog classification, denoted as Terms-to-Concepts-to-Category framework. Our framework utilizes Wikipedia’s categorical index for blog classification task. Wikipedia article titles are treated as concepts, and are used for terms to concept substitution to compute a weighted-semantic path connecting concepts to their main category. The n-gram based concept extraction technique is then used to extract concepts from the titles and posts from blogs. Our study improves upon previous studies, by using concept based representation and concept weighting scheme that embeds semantic information for blog classification. We also propose clustering of blogs as an improvement to the Terms-to-Concepts-to-Category framework and show that clustering can improve the accuracy of blog classification by enhancing our framework with two clustering approaches: coarse clustering and fine clustering. The first approach is achieved by using tripartite spectral graph which uses three vertexes: Document context similarity, concept similarity and content similarity to categorize blog posts. In the second approach, to achieve better classification and cluster multi categories, we enhance our framework using fuzzy c-means clustering and fuzzy similarity. Experimental results show that our framework produces better accuracy in classifying multiple categories than the existing tripartite and Fuzzy c-means clustering techniques...|$|E

40|$|Blogspace {{is one of}} {{the most}} dynamic areas of today’s Internet, and it is {{increasingly}} recognised that blogs are much more than “meaningless chatter”. Many syntax-based approaches exist to analyse the text and the net-work structure between blogs. While this is very helpful for purposes such as the detection of discussion bursts concerning uniquely-named topics (e. g., a book, prod-uct, or person), it is insufficient for understanding blogs discussing new phenomena in different wordings, or for finding and explaining relationships between new dis-course topics or the context of a new topic in a larger domain of discourse. In this paper, we propose two methods for semantics-enhanced blogs analysis that al-low the analyst to integrate domain-specific as well as general background knowledge. The methods rely on the Term Extractor for identifying keyphrases (Navigli & Velardi, 2004), SSI (Structural Semantic Intercon-nections) for disambiguating terms (Navigli & Velardi, 2005), and the taxonomy of domain labels by (Magnini & Cavaglià, 2000). Applications include topic detection and grouping, the proposal of blog tags and the forming of <b>blog</b> <b>directories,</b> and <b>blog</b> recommender systems. To illustrate the usefulness of our approach, we present a detailed experimental analysis of a sample of four sets of blogs with different thematic foci (food, health, law, and weblogs about blogging) ...|$|R
40|$|Formal geoscience {{education}} in Puerto Rico has traditionally relied upon {{the use of}} textbook and curricular materials translated from the English language and focused on geoenvironmental and cultural contexts foreign to the Caribbean. Informal geoscience education for the Spanish-speaking general public is also mostly translated from English and scarcely found in traditional (e. g. newspapers) and newer media outlets (e. g. news websites and opinion or journalistic-style blogs). The lack of culturally-relevant and contextual geoscience information {{available to the public}} led us to develop a geoscience dissemination blog aimed to provide reliable, research-based, geoscience information to a Spanish-speaking audience. This blog, called Ciencias Terrestres, GeologÃ­a y Puerto Rico (CTGP; [URL] is not based on the authors opinions or the publication of science news posted elsewhere. The articles in CTGP are: an original contribution of the authors, written in Spanish, focused on an audience that understands concepts at the middle school introductory college level, supported by primary and secondary science literature, and pertinent to the circum-Caribbean region. The blog is disseminated through social media sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, and online science communities (e. g. CienciaPR) and news outlets. The blog is also listed in several educational websites, and in Puerto Rican and international <b>blog</b> <b>directories.</b> <b>Blog</b> statistics show that more than 35, 000 people, from over 65 countries, have accessed articles in 19 months. The most popular topics are ocean currents, geohazards, and the nature of geoscience. A recent audience survey show that readers are interested in enhancing their general understanding of geoscience concepts, searching for information to work on secondary school projects, and learning about the geology of their country. These results suggest that the blogs audience finds meaning in accessing the site. Results also encourage us to further our contributions, develop partnerships with future collaborators that may diversify the perspectives and articles published, and develop new assessments to understand and serve our audience. Our paper explains the CTGP model and discusses the challenges and future directions of geoscience blogging...|$|R
