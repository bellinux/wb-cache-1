5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} treated to prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> on the project was prized by many workers. As soon as the haul road, later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the haul road.|$|E

25|$|According to Dan Gill, {{geological}} {{investigations in}} the early 1990s confirmed earlier observations that the 114m (375ft) high assault ramp consisted mostly of a natural spur of bedrock. The ramp was complete {{in the spring of}} 73, after probably two to three months of siege, allowing the Romans to finally breach the wall of the fortress with a battering ram on April 16. The Romans employed the X Legion and a number of auxiliary units and Jewish prisoners of war, totaling some 15,000 (of whom an estimated 8,000 to 9,000 were fighting men), in crushing Jewish resistance at Masada. A giant siege tower with a battering ram was constructed and moved laboriously up the completed ramp. The walls of the fortress were breached in 73 CE. According to Josephus, when Roman troops entered the fortress, they discovered that its defendants had set all the buildings <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> storerooms ablaze and committed mass suicide or killed each other, 960 men, women, and children in total. Josephus wrote of two stirring speeches that the Sicari leader had made to convince his men to kill themselves. Only two women and five children were found alive.|$|E

500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>food,</b> conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of value, based on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E

However, the mouse design {{was one of several}} designs rejected for use in the series as the choices were narrowed down. Once the main Mew Mew designs were finalized, Ikumi named them after various foods: Ichigo (Strawberry), Minto (Mint), Retasu (Lettuce), Bu-Ling (Pudding), and Zakuro (Pomegranate). During one of the project meetings, an unnamed editor remarked that the names might be hard to remember and suggested naming the characters after various colors instead, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> names were kept. Although Ikumi initially suggested calling Ichigo's main attack [...] "Strawberry Bell Bell" [...] as a joke, the editorial team thought it was funny and kept the name. Ikumi noted that future attack names were decided by which sounded funniest. The only character from Ikumi's Tokyo Black Cat Girl to retain his original name and general appearance was Masha, but his gender was changed to female in Tokyo Mew Mew.|$|E

But by the time Mulian locates his mother she has been nailed down with forty-nine iron spikes.

60|$|The food {{question}} is intimately {{bound up with}} the question of industry.

For example, in Petrograd many workers have allotments and often work in them for eight hours after an eight hours' day in their regular employment. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>food</b> produced in the allotments is taken for general consumption, not left to each individual producer.
