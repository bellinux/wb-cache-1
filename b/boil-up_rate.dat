40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility {{requested}} that the Immobilization Technology Section compare the relative foaming tendencies of sludge simulant during simulated Chemical Processing Cell operations (HLW-DWPF-TTR- 99 - 0012). Dow Corning 544 antifoam, currently used in DWPF, was compared to a new antifoam formulation developed at the Illinois Institute of Technology. A task plan was written and approved. The task plan deliverables included a recommendation on the choice of antifoam, {{an evaluation of the}} influence of solids concentration on foaming, an evaluation on the effect of <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate</b> on foaming, an estimate of the mass of steam stripped to remove 90 percent of the mercury, and a determination of the fate of mercury. Additional parameters to be investigated during experimentation included the maximum foam height observed, hydrogen generation rates, and nitrite destruction rates...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid, being {{virtually}} a non-boiling compound, {{is difficult to}} separate from its aqueous solution by conventional methods such as distillation. It is necessary to convert it to the relatively volatile ester and {{the separation of the}} ester, followed by hydrolysis, is recommended as an appropriate method of recovery. In the present work, we explore and investigate a novel reactive distillation strategy to perform esterification, distillation and hydrolysis in a single unit. The experiments were performed in a batch reactive distillation set-up and the results have been explained {{with the help of an}} appropriate model. An unsteady state mathematical model based on an equilibrium stage concept was developed for batch reactive distillation. A pseudo-homogeneous model was used for the determination of reaction kinetics. The effect of operating parameters such as feed concentration, mole ratio, catalyst loading, <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate,</b> etc. on the recovery of lactic acid was studied with the help of simulation and experimental results. The feasibility issue of reactive distillation has been discussed based on the results obtained. (c) 2006 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{esterification}} {{reaction of}} acetic acid with n-butanol {{in a continuous}} catalytic distillation system has been studied. The products of esterification reactions viz, water and butyl acetates are separated by distillation {{during the course of}} the reaction, to overcome the equilibrium limitations. A 3 -m-tall column with reactive and nonreactive zones, packed with a commercial catalytic packing (KATAPAK-S) and noncatalytic wire gauze packing, was used for this purpose. For a feed concentration corresponding to that obtained in a one-stage continuously stirred tank reactor at reaction equilibrium, conversion of ~ 100 % was realized, with selectivity on the order of 99 %. Interestingly, in most of the experiments, the bottom stream contained butyl acetate that was almost free of acetic acid. The influence of various operating parameters, such as feed flow rate, feed composition, feed location, and <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate,</b> on the conversion, selectivity, and separation was studied. A dynamic equilibrium stage model was developed and solved to predict the transient and steady-state results. Reasonably good agreement between the experimental and simulation results was realized.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 One of the {{alternative}} energy-saving methods in a conventional distillation process {{is the use of}} side (intermediate) reboiler and/or condenser for a portion of the overall heat load. A nonlinear differential equations model was developed to describe the dynamics of a typical binary distillation process with and without the side heat exchangers. Conventional column dynamics can be represented by 2 x 2 transfer matrices, whereas for a column with side heat exchangers the open-loop and closed-loop dynamics can be expressed in terms of 4 x 4 transfer matrices. Analysis indicates that decoupling and feedforward control policies may be hard to implement, due to the increased dimensionality. However, simplifications obtained through the selective pairing of the control variables provide the familiar 2 x 2 matrix treatment. Classical control policy was extended to design different control strategies (feedback and feedback/feedforward) for a column with side heat exchangers. Simulation studies reveal that the control response is better {{in the case of the}} modified column. When the side heat exchanger duties were used as feedforward variables with reflux and main <b>boil-up</b> <b>rates</b> as feedback variables, little improvement was observed as compared to the feedback control alone. On the other hand, use of side heat exchanger duties as feedback variables with reflux and main <b>boil-up</b> <b>rates</b> as feedforward variables resulted in unstable operation of the column...|$|R
40|$|Sludge {{samples from}} the DWPF Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) heating coil frame and coil surface were {{characterized}} to identify differences that might help identify heat transfer fouling materials. The SME steam coils have seen increased fouling leading to lower <b>boil-up</b> <b>rates.</b> Samples of the sludge {{were taken from the}} coil frame somewhat distant from the coil (bulk tank material) and from the coil surface (coil surface sample). The results of the analysis indicate the composition of the two SME samples are very similar with the exception that the coil surface sample shows {approx} 5 - 10 X higher mercury concentration than the bulk tank sample. Elemental analyses and x-ray diffraction results did not indicate notable differences between the two samples. The ICP-MS and Cs- 137 data indicate no significant differences in the radionuclide composition of the two SME samples. Semi-volatile organic analysis revealed numerous organic molecules, these likely result from antifoaming additives. The compositions of the two SME samples also match well with the analyzed composition of the SME batch with the exception of significantly higher silicon, lithium, and boron content in the batch sample indicating the coil samples are deficient in frit relative to the SME batch composition...|$|R
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) will {{transition}} from Sludge Batch 4 (SB 4) processing to Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) processing in early fiscal year 2009. Tests were conducted using non-radioactive simulants {{of the expected}} SB 5 composition to determine the impact of varying the acid stoichiometry during the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) processes. The work was conducted to meet the Technical Task Request (TTR) HLW/DWPF/TTR- 2007 - 0007, Rev. 1 and followed the guidelines of a Task Technical and Quality Assurance Plan (TT&QAP). The flowsheet studies {{are performed to evaluate}} the potential chemical processing issues, hydrogen generation rates, and process slurry rheological properties as a function of acid stoichiometry. Initial SB 5 flowsheet studies were conducted to guide decisions during the sludge batch preparation process. These studies were conducted with the estimated SB 5 composition {{at the time of the}} study. The composition has changed slightly since these studies were completed due to changes in the washing plan to prepare SB 5 and the estimated SB 4 heel mass. Nine DWPF process simulations were completed in 4 -L laboratory-scale equipment using both a batch simulant (Tank 51 simulant after washing is complete) and a blend simulant (Tank 40 simulant after Tank 51 transfer is complete). Each simulant had a set of four SRAT and SME simulations at varying acid stoichiometry levels (115 %, 130 %, 145 % and 160 %). One additional run was made using blend simulant at 130 % acid that included additions of the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) waste prior to acid addition and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) Unit (MCU) waste following SRAT dewatering. There are several parameters that are noteworthy concerning SB 5 sludge: (1) This is the first batch DWPF will be processing that contains sludge that has had a significant fraction of aluminum removed through aluminum dissolution. (2) The sludge is high in mercury. (3) The sludge is high in noble metals. (4) The sludge is high in U and Pu [...] components that are not added in sludge simulants. Two SB 5 processing issues were noted during testing. First, high hydrogen generation rates were measured during experiments with both the blend and batch simulant at high acid stoichiometry. Also, the reflux time was extended due to the high mercury concentration in both the batch and blend simulant. Adding ARP will extend processing times in DWPF. The ARP caustic boil took approximately six hours. The boiling time during the experiment with added MCU was 14 hours at the maximum DWPF steam flux rate. This is comparable to the DWPF processing time for dewatering plus reflux without MCU at a 5000 lbs/hr <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate,</b> but would require significantly more time at boiling at 2000 - 2500 lbs/hr <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate.</b> The addition of ARP and MCU did not cause any other processing issues, since foaming, rheology and hydrogen generation were less of an issue while processing with ARP/MCU...|$|E
40|$|Qualification {{simulant}} {{testing was}} completed to determine appropriate processing conditions and assumptions for the Sludge Batch 6 (SB 6) Shielded Cells {{demonstration of the}} DWPF flowsheet using the qualification sample from Tank 51 for SB 6 after SRNL washing. It was found that an acid addition window of 105 - 139 % of the DWPF acid equation (100 - 133 % of the Koopman minimum acid equation) gave acceptable Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) results for nitrite destruction and hydrogen generation. Hydrogen generation occurred continuously after acid addition {{in three of the}} four tests. The three runs at 117 %, 133 %, and 150 % stoichiometry (Koopman) were all still producing around 0. 1 lb hydrogen/hr at DWPF scale after 42 hours of boiling in the SRAT. The 150 % acid run reached 110 % of the DWPF SRAT limit of 0. 65 lb H{sub 2 }/hr, and the 133 % acid run reached 75 % of the DWPF SME limit of 0. 223 lb H{sub 2 }/hr. Conversely, nitrous oxide generation was subdued compared to previous sludge batches, staying below 25 lb/hr in all four tests or about a fourth as much as in comparable SB 4 testing. Two other processing issues were noted. First, incomplete mercury suspension impacted mercury stripping from the SRAT slurry. This led to higher SRAT product mercury concentrations than targeted (> 0. 45 wt% in the total solids). Associated with this issue was a general difficulty in quantifying the mass of mercury in the SRAT vessel as a function of time, especially as acid stoichiometry increased. About ten times more mercury was found after drying the 150 % acid SME product to powder than was indicated by the SME product sample results. Significantly more mercury was also found in the 133 % acid SME product samples than was found during the SRAT cycle sampling. It appears that mercury is segregating from the bulk slurry in the SRAT vessel, as mercury amalgam deposits for example, and is not being resuspended by the agitators. The second processing issue was significant ammonium ion formation as the acid stoichiometry was increased due to the high noble metal-high mercury feed conditions. Ammonium ion was found partitioned between the SRAT product slurry and the condensate from the lab-scale off-gas chiller downstream of the SRAT condenser. The ammonium ion was produced from nitrate ion by formic acid. Formate losses increased with increasing acid stoichiometry reaching 40 % at the highest stoichiometry tested. About a third of the formate loss at higher acid stoichiometries appeared to be due to ammonia formation. The full extent of ammonia formation was not determined in these tests, since uncondensed ammonia vapor was not quantified; but total formation was bounded by the combined loss of nitrite and nitrate. Nitrate losses during ammonia formation led to nitrite-to-nitrate conversion values that were negative in three of the four tests. The negative results were an artifact of the calculation that assumes negligible SRAT nitrate losses. The sample data after acid addition indicated that some of the initial nitrite was converted to nitrate, so the amount of nitrate destroyed included nitrite converted to nitrate plus some of the added nitrate from the sludge and nitric acid. It is recommended that DWPF investigate the impact of SME product ammonium salts on melter performance (hydrogen, redox). It was recommended that the SB 6 Shielded Cells qualification run be performed at 115 % acid stoichiometry and allow about 35 hours of boiling for mercury stripping at the equivalent of a 5, 000 lb/hr <b>boil-up</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E
