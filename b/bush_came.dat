5|$|Bush {{was born}} in Bexleyheath, Kent, (now part of the London Borough of Bexley) to English medical doctor Robert Bush (1920–2008) and Hannah Daly (1918–1992; from County Waterford, Ireland). She was raised as a Roman Catholic in their {{farmhouse}} in East Wickham, an urban village in the neighbouring town of Welling, with her older brothers, John and Paddy. <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers {{were involved in the}} local folk music scene.|$|E
25|$|After the {{terrorist}} attacks of 9/11, President <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> to rely on Khalilzad's Afghanistan expertise. Khalilzad was involved {{in the early stages of}} planning to overthrow the Taliban and on December 31, 2001 was selected as Bush's Special Presidential Envoy for Afghanistan. He served in that position until November 2003, when he was appointed to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{disclosed}} she {{was suffering}} from an overactive thyroid ailment known as Graves' disease when she lived at the White House. George H.W. <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> down with the same malady not long after his wife. It is rare for two biologically unrelated people in the same household to develop Graves disease within two years of each other. The Bush dog, Millie, came down with Graves' disease, too, although {{there are reports that}} she had a different auto-immune disease, lupus.|$|E

500|$|Joanna Bullivant, {{writing in}} Music and Letters, {{maintains}} {{that in his}} music Bush subordinated all ideas of personal expression to the ideology of Marxism. The critic Hugo Cole thought that, as a composer, <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> close to Paul Hindemith's ideal: [...] "one for whom music is felt as a moral and social force, and only incidentally {{as a means of}} personal expression". [...] The composer Wilfrid Mellers credits Bush with more than ideological correctness; while remaining faithful to his creed even when it was entirely out of fashion, he [...] "attempt to re-establish an English tradition meaningful to his country's past, present and future". [...] Hall describes Bush as [...] "a key figure in the democratisation of art in Britain, achieving far more in this regard than his pedagogic, utopian patrons and peers, the labour romantics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{called the}} deal a [...] "major victory for America's families." [...] The NRA and other gun rights groups heavily criticized the {{settlement}} calling Smith & Wesson's actions [...] "a sell-out", with the NRA calling the agreement [...] ""tantamount to back door blackmail". Smith & Wesson's ownership changed in 2001 and the agreement fell apart after George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> to office and supported lawsuit protection for gun manufactures. However, Smith & Wesson continues to sell guns with internal locks.|$|E
2500|$|Leading {{the offense}} {{during the month}} of April was Mike Cameron, who led the team with a [...]333 batting average and tied for the team lead in home runs with 5. Ryan Braun and Rickie Weeks also hit 5 home runs in April. The month's best {{starting}} pitcher was newly acquired Braden Looper, who went 2–0 with a 2.45 ERA in April. Dave <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> within five outs of a no-hitter in a 6–1 win over Philadelphia on April 23.|$|E

60|$|From {{over the}} <b>bushes</b> <b>came</b> a huge fire-ball, blazing brightly. It struck the thatch {{of the cottage}} {{close to the edge}} of the roof, and before it fell to the ground had set fire to the abode, which began to burn as though no shower had wet it for a month.|$|R
2500|$|... "These [...] zones {{routinely}} {{succeed in}} keeping protesters out of presidential sight {{and outside the}} view of media covering the event. When <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> to the Pittsburgh area on Labor Day 2002, 65-year-old retired steel worker Bill Neel was there to greet him with a sign proclaiming, 'The Bush family must surely love the poor, they made so many of us.' The local police, at the Secret Service's behest, set up a 'designated free-speech zone' on a baseball field surrounded by a chain-link fence {{a third of a}} mile from the location of Bush's speech. The police cleared the path of the motorcade of all critical signs, though folks with pro-Bush signs were permitted to line the president's path. Neel refused to go to the designated area and was arrested for disorderly conduct. Police detective John Ianachione testified that the Secret Service told local police to confine 'people that were there making a statement pretty much against the president and his views.'" [...] District justice Shirley Trkula threw out the charges, stating that [...] "I believe this is America. Whatever happened to 'I don't agree with you, but I'll defend to the death your right to say it'?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Bush, the Vice President of the United States from 1981 to 1989, began {{planning}} a presidential run {{as early as}} 1985, and he entered the Republican primary in October 1987. His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, U.S. Representative Jack Kemp of New York, former Governor Pete DuPont of Delaware, and conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson. Though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, <b>Bush</b> <b>came</b> in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson. Much as Reagan did in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary. With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser; he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had {{anything to say to}} Bush, Dole said, in response to the ads, [...] "yeah, stop lying about my record" [...] in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well. Once the multiple-state primaries such as Super Tuesday began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his. Bush chose little-known U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. Despite the popularity of President Ronald Reagan popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, then Governor of Massachusetts, in most polls for much of 1988.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, {{there are}} no roses here!' cried Gerda,, and she hunted amongst all the flowers, but not one was to be found. Then she sat down and cried, but her tears fell just on the spot where a rose bush had sunk, and when her warm tears watered the earth, the <b>bush</b> <b>came</b> up in full bloom {{just as it had}} been before. Gerda kissed the roses and thought of the lovely roses at home, and with them came the thought of little Kay.|$|E

5000|$|In another episode, [...] "Tapping a Hero", <b>Bush</b> <b>comes</b> into {{possession}} of a mogwai and proceeds to do everything he was instructed not {{to do with it}} (i.e. get it wet, feed it past midnight, etc.). Eventually, one of the clones gets a hold of the nuclear launch codes, and destroys the world.|$|R

60|$|Black Polly {{required}} neither spur nor whip. She possessed that charmingly sensitive spirit {{which seems}} to receive an electric shock from its rider's lightest chirp. She was what you may call an anxiously willing steed, yet possessed such a tender mouth {{that she could be}} pulled up as easily as she could be made to go. A mere child could have ridden her, and Dick found in a few minutes that a slight check was necessary to prevent her scouring over the plains at racing speed. He restrained her, therefore, to a grand canter, with many a stride and bound interspersed, when {{such a thing as a}} rut or a little <b>bush</b> <b>came</b> in her way.|$|E
60|$|The {{fire had}} indeed grown very much fiercer upon the side which was defended by De Catinat, {{and it was}} plain that the main force of the Iroquois were {{gathered}} at that point. From every log, and trunk, and cleft, and <b>bush</b> <b>came</b> the red flash with the gray halo, and the bullets sang in a continuous stream through the loop-holes. Amos had whittled a little hole for himself about a foot above the ground, and lay upon his face loading and firing in his own quiet methodical fashion. Beside him stood Ephraim Savage, his mouth set grimly, his eyes flashing from under his down-drawn brows, and his whole soul absorbed in the smiting of the Amalekites. His hat was gone, his grizzled hair flying in the breeze, great splotches of powder mottled his mahogany face, and a weal across his right cheek showed where an Indian bullet had grazed him. De Catinat was bearing himself like an experienced soldier, {{walking up and down}} among his men with short words of praise or of precept, those fire-words rough and blunt which bring a glow to the heart and a flush to the cheek. Seven of his men were down, but as the attack grew fiercer upon his side it slackened upon the others, and the seigneur with his son and Du Lhut brought ten men to reinforce them. De la Noue was holding out his snuff-box to De Catinat when a shrill scream from behind them made them both look round. Onega, the Indian wife, was wringing her hands over the body of her son. A glance showed that the bullet had pierced his heart and that he was dead.|$|E

His rest had given him new strength, but still he was very, very tired and swimming was hard work.|$|R

50|$|De Roche later {{expressed}} some {{dissatisfaction with}} the film:Unfortunately, the <b>bush</b> <b>comes</b> across as a threat too early; it should have emerged as a threat only after the audience had sympathized with the animals.

This way, it wouldn’t have had to sympathize with them, and could have concerned itself solely with when this was going to happen. Such is the essence of suspense.|$|R
