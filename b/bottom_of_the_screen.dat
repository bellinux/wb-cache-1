5|$|Space Invaders is a {{two-dimensional}} fixed shooter {{game in which}} the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat five rows of eleven aliens—some versions feature different numbers—that move horizontally {{back and forth across}} the screen as they advance toward the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The player defeats an alien, and earns points, by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating the aliens brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue without end.|$|E

5|$|Screenshots of Zelda: Gaiden {{released}} in August 1999 show unmistakable {{elements of the}} final version of Majora's Mask, such as the large clock that dominates the center of Clock Town, the timer at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> and the Goron Mask. Story and gameplay details revealed later that month show that the story concept as well as the use of transformation masks were already in place.|$|E
5|$|During combat, {{the player}} can circle the enemy to expose weak points and escape {{dangerous}} positions. Changing position temporarily stops the gauges charging. Likewise, enemies may change position {{to force the}} dragon into vulnerable areas; a radar at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> indicates safe, neutral and dangerous areas, with {{the front and rear}} areas typically posing the most danger. Weak points can sometimes only be attacked from dangerous areas, and enemies' attack patterns often change mid-battle, forcing the player to adapt.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay {{is similar to that of}} the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge on the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

5|$|Upon death, the Slugcat {{returns to}} the last {{hibernation}} save point and loses any map progress made since. The player also loses a karma point, which are indicated at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> The player needs to meet a karmic threshold to reach specific areas of the game. Karma is restored upon reaching a new hibernation area, and the player can shield their current karma level by eating a yellow flower. The flower appears {{at the start of}} each area and is re-planted wherever the Slugcat dies.|$|E
5|$|By {{gathering}} clues and {{manipulating the}} environment, the player solves thematically linked puzzles. For example, the book leading to Voltaic is accessed by aligning beams of light across a canyon; the Age itself contains similar energy-based puzzles. Edanna's plant-filled puzzles require {{manipulation of the}} Age's ecosystem. Puzzles often involve observing interactions between elements of the environment, then adjusting the links between them. The player can also pick up and view journals or pages written by game characters which reveal back-story and give hints to solving puzzles. Cursor Mode allows the player to select items from a personal inventory at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Players {{navigate}} the knight {{to collide with}} enemies. The elevation of an enemy {{in relation to the}} player's knight determines the outcome of the collision. If the protagonist is higher than the enemy, the villain is defeated and vice versa. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other. A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls toward the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> which a player can collect for points. An egg that sits on a platform long enough will hatch into a new knight; if the player does not pick him up, he will gain a new mount and must be defeated again.|$|E

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in November 1974. In the game, ducks fly {{one at a}} time across the screen, and the player shoots at them using a light gun attached to the game cabinet. The player gets three shots per duck; ducks change direction away from missed shots and fall to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> when hit. A screen overlay adds images of reeds and a tree branch, and an image of a duck is added to a row {{at the top of the}} screen whenever a duck is hit. Games continue until a time limit, set by the machine operator, is reached.|$|E
5|$|Rotating the map using {{a compass}} is {{essential}} for ensuring an army moves in the desired direction. The order of a moving unit will not be carried out until the unit has reached its destination or {{if they have been}} killed before arriving there. Each order carried out is announced through the game's command box, which is situated at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Actions such as battles and unit losses are also announced. In order to attack the enemy from a distance, the player is able to order a unit to commence shelling, which will neutralise an enemy unit if successful. The game features no sound.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released on July 16, 1973. It {{was the second}} game by the company after Pong (1972), which {{marked the beginning of}} the commercial video game industry. In the game, two players each control a rocket ship, with the goal of being the first to move their ship from the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to the top. Along the way are asteroids, which the players must avoid. Space Race was the first racing arcade video game and the first game with a goal of crossing the screen while avoiding obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Super Swap is an arcade puzzle {{game with}} {{elements}} of a match-3 genre. Blocks fall from <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> touch <b>screen,</b> one by one. A player has to use a stylus to click on blocks and to drag them in one of 4 directions. Dragging enables the player to swap blocks and as the result to remove pieces off the board by making 3-in-a row or more matches. Combos can be only achieved in a horizontal or vertical row. Objects can be swapped even while they're still falling. If blocks pile above <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>screen,</b> it is game over.|$|R

5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{occurs in}} real-time, and the player {{character}} may use both melee and ranged weapons. The player attacks by holding the cursor over the game screen and clicking, depressing the button longer to inflict greater damage. Some weapons allow for {{different types of}} attacks depending on where the cursor is held; for example, clicking near the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> {{may result in a}} jab, while clicking in the middle produces a slash. Simulated dice rolls occur behind the scenes to determine weapon accuracy. Enemies sometimes try to escape when near death, and the game's stealth mechanics may occasionally be used to avoid combat altogether. The player may cast spells by selecting an appropriate combination of runestones. Like mantras, runestones must be found in the game world before use. There are over forty spells, some undocumented; their effects range from causing earthquakes to allowing the player character to fly.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{takes place}} in real-time. Located at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, {{allowing}} that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level {{to a maximum of}} eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in dungeons or earned by defeating certain bosses. The player takes each Orb to a blacksmith, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Sora battles Sephiroth in Radiant Garden. The player {{uses the}} game menu at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to control Sora's actions and can monitor Sora's HP and MP gauges {{on the bottom}} right.|$|R
50|$|Pinball is a {{game where}} the player {{controls}} <b>the</b> paddles <b>of</b> a virtual pinball machine. The game has two <b>screens</b> to represent <b>the</b> traditional pinball table and one for a bonus mode. Play begins when the player launches a ball with the plunger from <b>the</b> first screen—the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pinball table—through <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to <b>the</b> second <b>screen.</b> Play will move to <b>the</b> first <b>screen</b> if <b>the</b> ball falls through <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top <b>screen</b> and will return to <b>the</b> top <b>screen</b> if <b>the</b> ball is hit back through the space at <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first <b>screen.</b> <b>The</b> player controls the flippers on either <b>screen</b> to deflect <b>the</b> ball {{to keep it from}} falling off <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>screen.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Turkey, screen graphics, bugs, or DOGs {{are known}} as screen badges. On analogue/digital television, screen badges were {{introduced}} to One on January 1, 2000. By <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 2000, all television channels at <b>the</b> time had <b>screen</b> badges usually located in the top right hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> Though on January 1, 2010, One got a new theme package and <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> badge was moved down to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> right hand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> All channels' screen badges were on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> 2010.|$|R
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed {{from the perspective of}} the player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A heads-up display at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using wall-mounted charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E
5|$|Most Tales {{games have}} skits, side conversations between {{different}} characters {{that can be}} both dramatic and comedic in nature. They are commonly portrayed as character portraits or profiles, with text along the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> They were first introduced in Tales of Destiny, though the majority were cut from the English release. In the original English GameCube release of Symphonia, the voice track for the skits was removed, but for its HD re-release, the Japanese voice track, and consequently the skit voice tracks, were included. The first English release to include fully voiced skits was Vesperia: they had been planned for Abyss, but were cut due to space issues. Another recurring feature is the Cooking system, where characters learn and prepare dishes to restore health and forms of experience points.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} have different capabilities. Both {{are capable of}} using weapons and magic, but the hero is stronger with melee weapons and the heroine is stronger with ranged magical attacks. Weapons have three attributes: slash, jab, and bash; and different attributes cause more or less damage to different enemies. Magical spells can cause damage or defend the protagonists, and {{are affected by the}} weapon the character is holding. Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> is an overdrive gauge that increases by one point at each hit given to an enemy. When that gauge is full, the player can release a powerful attack that will deplete the gauge completely if the attack lands. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion.|$|E
