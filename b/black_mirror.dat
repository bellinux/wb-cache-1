25|$|As stibine (SbH3) is {{very similar}} to arsine (AsH3), it is also {{detected}} by the Marsh test. This sensitive test detects arsine generated in the presence of arsenic. This procedure, developed around 1836 by James Marsh, is based upon treating a sample with arsenic-free zinc and dilute sulfuric acid: if the sample contains arsenic, gaseous arsine will form. The gas is swept into a glass tube and decomposed by means of heating around 250–300°C. The presence of arsenic is indicated by formation of a deposit in the heated part of the equipment. The formation of a <b>black</b> <b>mirror</b> deposit in the cool part of the equipment indicates the presence of antimony.|$|E

500|$|It is {{considered}} to have [...] "one of the most shocking twists on Black Mirror", as Jenelle Riley of Variety puts it, some time before the third series started. Writing before the third series, Margaret Lyons of The New York Times said it is [...] "the most outright disturbing" [...] episode of <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror.</b> Right after it aired, Cocks deemed it [...] "the single darkest episode of <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror</b> so far" [...] and considered its twist to be [...] "nothing short of genius". Sims stated that it [...] "is, by a significant margin, the most disturbing episode <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror</b> has produced". Although he praised the twist as [...] "a smart one, brilliantly concealed and smartly revealed," [...] he criticized it because [...] "once the point is made, it is made over and over again." [...] Lambie praised its [...] "fearsome pace" [...] and highlighted [...] "its subtle approach", with sparse dialogue, that gives [...] "the events and performances greater impact". He concluded: [...] "its horror-infused drama leaves us unsure whom we can trust or what will happen next, and its last act is truly gut-wrenching". Monahan wrote that the twist was unpredictable and the episode [...] "was an exciting and efficient piece of narrative rug-pulling".|$|E

This cut in equipment was rumored to be a countermeasure to offset the price increase of offering an iPod plug-in for the stereo system. Because of the <b>black</b> <b>mirrors</b> and wheel covers, the additional cost of the iPod adapter was negated, leaving the base price of the vehicle unchanged.|$|R
500|$|The game's plot twist, {{where the}} player discovers that the player-character Jack has been coerced into events by the trigger phrase, [...] "Would you kindly...", is {{considered}} one of the strongest narrative elements of recent games, in part that it subverted the expectation that the player has control and influence on the game. [...] The phrase was used in homage to BioShock in the video game-centric episode, [...] "Playtest", of <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror,</b> purposely included by its director Dan Trachtenberg.|$|E
500|$|... "White Bear" [...] is {{the second}} episode of the second series of the British science fiction {{anthology}} series <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror.</b> It was written by the series creator and showrunner Charlie Brooker and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria (Lenora Crichlow), a woman who does not remember who she is and wakes up {{in a place where}} almost everybody is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people (Michael Smiley and Tuppence Middleton), she must stop the [...] "White Bear" [...] transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers.|$|E
500|$|The Twilight Zone {{has been}} seen as an {{influence}} by some reviewers. Jeffery commented that its [...] "roots" [...] on it [...] "have never been more visible", while Sims affirmed it is [...] "the most Twilight Zone-y episode of the show", and James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly said it could even have been an episode of the show. Lyndsey Weber of Vulture made a [...] "post-viewing guide" [...] to <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror,</b> where she included The Twilight Zone episode [...] "Five Characters in Search of an Exit" [...] as [...] "bonus watching" [...] to [...] "White Bear".|$|E
50|$|At {{higher levels}} of competition, for many years the main {{objectives}} of opening play were to obtain the better position when playing as White and to equalize when playing as Black.

[...] Zach Blumenfeld of Paste Magazine gave Islands a slightly more mixed, albeit still positive, review.

500|$|In Grant Morrison's Batman: The Return (2010), an {{installment}} of the limited series [...] (2010), Batman enlists Oracle to help him run Batman Incorporated, a new global team of Batmen. He tasks her with helping him fight crime on a virtual front, and shows her a new modified Batgirl design that acts as her virtual avatar. Oracle is later shown directing Cassandra Cain, now known as Blackbat, on a mission in Hong Kong, where she captures some heroin smugglers for Batman. In Scott Snyder's <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror</b> storyline, Barbara Gordon is kidnapped by her brother, James Gordon Jr., who had returned to Gotham after a lengthy absence to become a serial killer. He stabs her in both of her legs, positioning the knives so that if she removes them, she will bleed to death. As she slowly bleeds, {{she is able to}} use her wits to distract him long enough for Batman and Commissioner Gordon to arrive and defeat her brother.|$|E
500|$|In South African {{newspaper}} The Star, {{the episode}} {{was identified as}} the most cynical of the first series. For the reviewer, it [...] "parades before us the depravity to which the human animal will stoop, and explores how agendas can be furthered under the noble cover of altruism". David Upton, writing for PopMatters, called it [...] "easily the most acerbic and most overtly comic" [...] episode of the series. He listed three reasons that the episode does not seem like something produced by Pemberton and Shearsmith: its avoidance of the horrific; {{the fact that it}} does not star Shearsmith; and its direct focus on celebrity culture, which Upton considers a modern phenomenon. Instead, he suggested that it feels closer to a story from Charlie Brooker's anthology programme <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror.</b> The focus of [...] "Last Gasp" [...] on comedy to the exclusion of horror, for Upton, leaves it [...] "stranded" [...] when compared to the other episodes.|$|E

5000|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a B+ rating, complimenting <b>Black</b> <b>Mirrors</b> [...] "willingness to force moral {{questions}} that make everyone feel awful", {{and saying that}} the episode was [...] "never boring, but ... not all that engaging, either". Adam Chitwood of Collider stated that although it wasn't a [...] "bad episode", it was a [...] "frustratingly tense one ... and a bit too long and {{has one of the}} darkest throughlines of the season".|$|R
50|$|A twist {{is added}} {{at the end}} of the play; the Actor asks Kipps about the actress playing the Woman in <b>Black.</b> <b>Mirroring</b> the earlier scene with Mr Jerome, Kipps, terrified, denies that anyone else had been in the theatre, {{implying}} that the real Woman in Black had been present. The play ends with the rhythmic knocking of the rocking chair as the lights fade to black. An image of the face of the Woman in Black lingers behind the gauze for a few seconds.|$|R
500|$|At {{the time}} of Inside No. 9 production, the {{anthology}} series was a rare genre for British television programmes. Previous horror anthologies include Tales of the Unexpected, The Twilight Zone and Alfred Hitchcock Presents; while these would sometimes use comedic elements, they are more prominent in Inside No. 9. Murder Most Horrid followed a similar format, but was far more comedic than horrific. Other anthology-like series on British television include Seven of One and Comedy Playhouse, though these programmes lacked horror elements, and, unlike Inside No. 9, served as pilots for potential series. However, the British anthology show <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror,</b> which also features elements of comedy and horror, was very popular around {{the time of}} Inside No. 9. For Pemberton, the 1970s and 1980s were [...] "full of" [...] anthology shows; other examples included Play for Today, Beasts and Armchair Thriller. More recently, anthologies have become less popular with television executives, but the writers hope that {{they may be able to}} contribute to a [...] "renaissance" [...] for the genre. According to journalist and broadcaster Mark Lawson, this is because anthologies can fail to motivate viewers to stay with a series, and, further, new sets and casts must be paid for each episode, meaning that a six-part anthology series will generally be more expensive than a six-part series in a more standard format. For Lawson, Inside No. 9 was able to overcome these problems through the [...] "pleasing coherence" [...] offered by the fact each episode was set in a number 9, and [...] "the wit and inventiveness" [...] of the opening episodes, which could sufficiently engage viewers. Pemberton and Shearsmith had originally considered alternative ways to link the stories, such as all the settings having a shared post man, but then decided that such a strong relationship between stories was not needed.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the episode. Jane Simon of Daily Mirror said that [...] "White Bear" [...] lacked the [...] "instant emotional tug" [...] of the series opener. She commented that, {{a third of the}} way through the episode, she had lost hope that it would conclude effectively, [...] " [...] the acting was unbelievable, the script was riddled with horror-film cliches, the violence was a bit over the top [...] ", but that by the end she was positively surprised. Joyner praised it as [...] "stylistically ... breath-taking" [...] with [...] "intense action", but felt [...] "the themes come across as particularly flat" [...] and [...] "hardly original". He was disappointed until the twist, and concludes that Brooker has [...] "crafted an hour of television more bold and daring than I've seen in a long time". Jeffery said [...] "this is <b>Black</b> <b>Mirror</b> as full-blooded horror" [...] and that it never gets boring, while criticized the characters and the final sequence as [...] "a little overlong and obvious". TheWrap staff was divided; while some found it has a good social critique, others considered it to be [...] "least effective when it goes for horror". Although Parker compared the first 45 minutes to [...] "a low-budget, low-quality version of 28 Days Later", full of [...] "horror movie clichés", he realised that was [...] "the whole point". He was positive to its societal criticism and wrote: [...] "So the reason it all felt like a rubbish horror movie for 45 minutes is because that's what it was, just with a real person in the centre of it." [...] It was ranked eleventh out of the thirteen episodes by Charles Bramesco of Vulture, who said its message is [...] "lost beneath a simplistic twist that pulls a switcheroo and [...] fails to do much else".|$|E
