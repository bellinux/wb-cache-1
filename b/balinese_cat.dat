50|$|From {{among the}} above cats noted, {{the most popular}} cat breeds to be renowned for their hypoallergenic quality is the Siberian and <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> breed. These cats have been noted to produce much lesser amounts of the protein allergens in {{comparison}} to regular domestic household cats, and other cat breeds. Cats that have some <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> lineage or ancestry might have a probability of producing few amounts of the protein allergens, some cat breeds that might have some <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> lineage include the Oriental Shorthair, Oriental Longhair, and some Siamese cats.|$|E

50|$|The common theory {{among these}} two hypoallergenic, medium to {{long-haired}} cat breeds {{is that their}} long-haired gene is associated with producing lesser amounts of the allergens. This {{may be the case}} as the <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat,</b> a medium to long-haired cat breed; also referred to as the Long-haired Siamese cat is regarded as hypoallergenic, where as the Siamese cat, a short-haired cat breed is not. Some Siamese cats might possess hypoallergenic qualities if they have proven <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> ancestry, they are often referred to as short-haired Balinese cats. This might provide some evidence that the long-haired genes or traits within this cat breed have resulted in a cat that can genetically produce less amounts of the cat allergens.|$|E
50|$|A hypoallergenic cat is a {{cat that}} {{is less likely to}} provoke, or produce an {{allergic}} reaction in humans. Although the topic is controversial, owners' experience and recent clinical studies suggest that Siberian cats, Devon Rex and Cornish Rex <b>cats,</b> Abyssinian <b>cats,</b> <b>Balinese</b> <b>cats,</b> and several other breeds, especially females, are likely to have low levels of Fel d 1, the main allergenic protein.|$|R
50|$|Like all cats {{with the}} point pattern, Balinese kittens are born pure cream or white and {{gradually}} develop visible points in colder parts of their body — the face, ears, paws and tail. Their color is identifiable {{by the time they}} are four weeks old. Some cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult <b>Balinese</b> <b>cats</b> living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates.|$|R
50|$|In 1982, the {{association}} recognised the Somali cat, {{as well as}} the lilac and chocolate colours of the Persian cat. In 1984, the AFC adopted the standards set by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFé). The <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> was recognised in 1985. In 1986, the ACF began to distance itself from the FIFé, and would not return until 1988. 1986 also saw an important modification in the Exotic Shorthair standard.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Cat Fanciers' Association, {{the term}} [...] "Javanese" [...] is {{classified}} {{to distinguish the}} traditional colors of the <b>Balinese</b> <b>cat</b> from the tabby or [...] "lynx point", red, and tortie point colors. Javanese cats are synonymous with color point long-hair cats, which are Balinese cats with other colors rather than the traditional colors. Though some breeders consider the Oriental breed synonymous to the Balinese breed, {{they are not the}} same breed due to being classified as another breed and standard. The primary reason for this classification has been due to the goal of keeping Siamese and Balinese lines pure or distinguished.|$|E

Advanced imaging and immunohistochemical studies helped in obtaining the diagnosis. Because of advanced unresectable disease and ensuing poor quality of life, the cat was euthanized...|$|E
