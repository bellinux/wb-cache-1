30|$|The principal’s {{expected}} utilities with a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> {{are increasing}} in the earnings potential x_H. The relative attractiveness of a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is {{captured by the}} cut-off level β ^c. For an importance of coordination below this threshold, the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> yields a higher expected utility for the principal than a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> For an importance of coordination above the threshold β ^c, the opposite is true. When the earnings potential x_H increases, the principal’s expected utilities with a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> also increase. The increase is higher with a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> than with a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> because of imperfect coordination with a top-down budget. Therefore, the cut-off level β ^c is smaller for a higher earnings potential x_H. The range for which a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is implemented, i.e., [0,β ^c), becomes smaller when the earnings potential increases. As a consequence, {{an increase in the}} earnings potential reduces the potential use of a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This is stated in Corollary 3 and displayed in Fig. 3.|$|R
30|$|When a {{top-down}} <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is in place, {{the agents}} are not induced to provide truthful reports. Therefore, the agents only receive incentives for providing high productive effort. The resulting rent is positive, i.e., each agent’s expected utility exceeds his reservation utility of zero (Proposition 1). In {{the case of}} a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agents obtain additional rents, because the principal provides adapted compensation payments that induce the agents to truthfully report their private decision-relevant information. Consequently, if the agents designed the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> in date 0, they would implement a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and obtain higher positive rents. This insight conforms with empirical findings. Practitioners would like to use more participation in the budgeting system (Libby and Lindsay 2010). Heinle et al. (2014) also illustrate that agents prefer a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The intuition is similar. With a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agent controls the reporting and the productive effort supply. In a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agent only controls the productive effort supply and the principal controls the reporting. Thus, in Heinle et al. (2014), the agent receives less rents with top-down budgets than under a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In the present paper, the agents also control the effort supply and the reporting when a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is implemented. However, for a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the control over reporting is completely set mute. This means, neither the agents nor the principal controls the reporting. The findings of Corollary  4 correspond to the results of Heinle et al. (2014), i.e., the agents obtain more rents with a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> compared to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|The model shows that, in {{the case}} of a low {{importance}} of coordination, the loss from imperfect coordination in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is outweighed by the additional costs for inducing truth-telling in a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> That is, the company prefers to implement a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and to keep the managers uninformed. For a high importance of coordination, the use of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is optimal. The results illustrate that the company might prefer to use a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> instead of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> However, this is not true for the managers of the divisions. The managers receive higher positive expected rents with participation than they receive with top-down budgets.

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature in three ways. First, it complements the insights generated by the analytical literature on managers’ participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Given a budget-based bonus scheme, Magee (1980) establishes that a manager’s participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is detrimental for the company, because the manager maximally misreports. Baiman and Evans III (1983) highlight that the company prefers the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> only when the manager is induced to report the private decision-relevant information truthfully. Contrary to Magee (1980) and Baiman and Evans III (1983), the present paper illustrates that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred by the company due to lower incentive costs, although the managers report truthfully in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Penno (1990) finds that the company solely prefers a manager’s participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when the compensation contract can be based on the reported private information. Despite basing the compensation contract on the reported private information in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the present paper shows that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is preferred for a low importance of coordinating the divisions’ interdependence. Kirby et al. (1991) study participation in a setting where the manager is induced to set unbiased hurdles by a compensation scheme belonging to a class of budget-based performance evaluation schemes. Participation can reduce the manager’s informational rents and, therefore, be preferred by the company. The present paper’s finding complements this result by highlighting that the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> might be preferred because of lower informational rents. Heinle et al. (2014) illustrate that the company prefers a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> whenever the level of information asymmetry between the manager and her superior is small. The present paper adds to this finding by showing the impact of the importance of coordinating the divisions’ operations on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

30|$|In practice, {{the design}} of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> among {{companies}} is not homogeneous (Shastri and Stout 2008). Companies can choose from a broad spectrum of design possibilities for the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The two generic design possibilities, top-down and participative, represent the two ends of this spectrum. Lately, the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and the associated reporting behavior of managers has attracted considerable attention by experimental research (see Shields and Young 1993; Evans III et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006; Matuszewski 2010; Rankin et al. 2008; Altenburger 2017). A significant part of this research has focused on the consequences of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not its antecedents (a comprehensive literature review is provided by Shields and Shields 1998). However, the reasons for the use of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> have often been neglected. This paper studies the role of participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> if company’s divisions are confronted with interdependence. In particular, the company’s preference for implementing a top-down or a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is examined.|$|R
30|$|This article {{studies the}} role of {{participation}} in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> when the company has to coordinate two interdependent divisions. The focus lies on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> (top-down vs. participative budgets) and the underlying supply of information. This is studied in a principal agent model where two divisions (agents) jointly generate earnings. With the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the company (principal) implements an information system that provides the division managers with private information. Two economic effects occur. First, the company can benefit from the division managers’ private information by perfectly coordinating the divisions’ operations. Second, the company has to induce the managers to provide productive effort and with participation, to additionally report truthfully. Thus, the company incurs incentive costs. The two considered <b>budgeting</b> <b>processes</b> trade off these effects diametrically. For a low importance of coordination, the company prefers the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and not installing an information system that allows the managers to obtain private information. Otherwise, the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is used. In contrast to the company, managers always prefer the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, the model predicts that a higher earnings potential increases the attractiveness of participative budgets.|$|R
30|$|At the {{beginning}} of the period, the principal designs the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The principal has two options for the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> She can either implement a top-down (TB) or a participative (PB) <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> With a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> in place, the agents obtain private information and the principal asks the agents to report on their private information. She cannot observe whether the reports are truthful or not. The report of agent i on his private information is denoted by r_i and can either be η _L or η _H. When the principal implements a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the agents neither obtain private information nor are asked to send a report. This means, whereas, in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the principal implements an information system that privately informs the agents about their divisions’ market fit, no information system is installed in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The information system can, for example, regard market research, target costing, or value engineering which is relevant for the divisions’ operations. Because specific expertise is needed for interpreting the provided information each agent can solely observe her division’s information. Installation costs of the information system are not explicitly modeled. 1 However, the implicit assumption is made that the principal does not install a costly information system in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> because the information cannot be elicited and, thus, not used by the principal. The assumption that the agents do not obtain private information in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is critically reflected in Sect. 6.|$|R

30|$|For a low {{importance}} of coordination, the company prefers {{to use a}} top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> instead of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> In {{the case of a}} low {{importance of}} coordination, the coordination benefits are small.

Thus, for a high importance of coordination, the coordination benefits outweigh the additional incentive costs. Then, the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is preferred by the company. Hence, the managing owner affects the company’s profitability through the choice of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|A {{raise in}} the {{earnings}} potential intensifies {{the effect of}} coordination on the expected earnings. Thus, the negative effect of an imperfect coordination by the managing owner increases. Imperfect coordination only occurs in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The incentive costs with both a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> are unaffected {{by an increase in}} the earning potential. In sum, the economic effect of coordination becomes stronger, whereas the incentive costs are unaffected. Therefore, an increase in the earnings potential makes the use of a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> more attractive relative to the use of a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|Proposition 3 {{states the}} main {{result of this}} paper. The {{principal}} faces a trade-off between additional incentive costs and coordination benefits. For both the top-down and the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the principal incurs incentive costs for inducing high productive effort supply. The additional incentive costs ensure that the agents report truthfully with participative budgets. With truthful reports about their private decision-relevant information, the principal can perfectly coordinate the agents’ operations. Imperfect coordination results in reduced expected earnings. Under a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the principal incurs the additional incentive costs and benefits from perfect coordination. With top-down budgets, the principal {{does not need to}} provide additional incentives. Thus, she saves on the additional incentive costs. However, the principal suffers from reduced expected earnings because of imperfect coordination. In a situation of a low importance of coordination β, the principal prefers to use a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Thus, a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> can be optimal for the principal. For a high importance of coordination, the principal uses a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Then, a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is never optimal for the principal. This finding is aligned with the empirical findings of Shields and Shields (1998). They illustrate that coordinating interdependence {{is one of the most}} important reasons for the participation of managers in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> The model predicts that the principal prefers to use a participative compared to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions.|$|R

However, Congress is the body required by law to pass appropriations annually and to submit funding bills passed by both houses to the President for signature. Congressional decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the federal <b>budget</b> <b>process.</b> Budget committees set spending limits for the House and Senate committees and for Appropriations subcommittees, which then approve individual appropriations bills to allocate funding to various federal programs.|$|E

30|$|The {{relative}} {{attractiveness of}} a top-down and a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> {{is affected by}} the earnings potential. An increase in the earning potential enhances the use of a participative compared to a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|Second, {{this paper}} {{adds to the}} {{analytical}} literature on choosing an information system and the manager’s participation in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Christensen (1982) provides an example in which the company is better off when a risk-averse manager neither obtains private decision-relevant information nor participates in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> compared to obtaining the information and participating in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This {{is in line with}} the present paper’s findings. While Christensen ’s finding stems from a shift in the trade-off of risk sharing and inducing effort, the present paper illustrates the impact of the importance of coordination on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Penno (1984) highlights that enabling a manager to obtain private decision-relevant information is beneficial for the company when the company can design the information system’s characteristics. This result holds whether the manager participates in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> or not. In the present paper, the company cannot choose the information system’s characteristics. Thus, in line with Penno (1984), the company does not want the managers to obtain private information in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 6. In addition, the present paper shows that participation is preferred for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions’ operations, although the managers are informed in the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Given a participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> Rajan and Saouma (2006) examine the merits of different levels of information asymmetry between the company and the manager ranging from perfectly informative, to somewhat informative, to not informative at all. They find that the company prefers an uninformed manager when the possible levels of the manager’s productivity are similar. Otherwise, a fully informed manager is preferred. The uninformed manager’s report does not convey any information, and therefore, this setting is comparable to the present paper’s top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> This means that Rajan and Saouma (2006) show that the similarity of the productivity levels determine whether the manager participates in the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b> Holding the productivity levels’ similarity constant, the present paper depicts the effect of the importance of coordination on the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{model design}} {{is subject to}} a couple of limitations. First, the {{assumption}} is invoked that, in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the managers do not obtain private information. For example, this information can stem from market research, target costing, or value engineering and the managers’ expertise is needed to interpret the provided information. Throughout this paper, the company decides not to implement the information system like market research, target costing, or value engineering when the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is implemented. This means, the company does not enable the managers to obtain the information needed for coordination. If the managers also obtained the private information in the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process,</b> the company would need to provide higher expected compensation to induce high effort supply. With private information, the managers know exactly how high effort affects the probability to obtain high earnings. Without private information, the managers know this only in expectation. Thus, more compensation is needed when the managers are informed. Due to the revelation principle, the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> never becomes strictly optimal when the managers are informed. However, as the compensation costs with a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> are smaller when the managers do not obtain the private information, the company does not want the managers to be informed. Hence, the company does not want the managers to obtain private information in a top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and the information system is not installed. The advantage of this assumption is that it enables the model to establish a strict preference of the top-down <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> for a low importance of coordination. This is in line with the empirical finding that both top-down and participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>processes</b> are implemented in practice (Shastri and Stout 2008). Next to this advantage, the assumption also bears a drawback. The <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> is connected to a specific information setup which is an exogenous restriction on the company’s design of the information system. However, as outlined above, when the company chooses the design of the <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> and the information setup, it either chooses the top-down or the participative <b>budgeting</b> <b>process</b> as studied in the present paper.|$|R
