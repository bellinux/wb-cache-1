25|$|We Negroes {{shall never}} become {{enemies of the}} White People: We are all Americans; But America {{was born in the}} {{struggle}} for Freedom from Tyranny and Oppression. We shall never bomb any homes or lynch any persons; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must,</b> because of History and the future, march to Complete Freedom — with unbowed heads, praying hearts, and an unyielding determination. And we seek Guidance from our Heavenly Father; and from all men, Goodwill and understanding.|$|E
25|$|When {{you look}} at the inhumane {{treatment}} of Jews, not only in Germany but occupied countries as well, you start worrying that such a demand might also be put on us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> clearly refuse such this due to their protection under the Danish constitution. I stated that I could not meet such a demand towards Danish citizens. If such a demand is made, we would best meet it by all wearing the Star of David.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} heightened sense of uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E

25|$|Finding {{historical}} {{sources for}} The Mercenary War {{suffers from the}} same problem as any history of Carthage: Few primary sources of Carthaginian history exist, except as fragments in translation quoted by Roman and Greek historians. The main extant account of the Mercenary War is that of Polybius, a Greek historian writing many years after the events portrayed here. While {{it is likely that}} he based much of his account on now-lost works of prior Greek and Roman historians, it is unlikely that they had an unbiased view of Carthage and its history. When reading such history it is wise to take this into account. We have the best historical reconstruction that we can derive, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> also remember that its balance and objectivity is in question.|$|E
500|$|Biographer William Taubman {{suggested}} that because Khrushchev was again unsuccessfully denounced while in Kiev, {{he must have}} known that some of the denunciations were not true and that innocent people were suffering. In 1939, Khrushchev addressed the Fourteenth Ukrainian Party Congress, saying [...] "Comrades, we must unmask and relentlessly destroy all enemies of the people. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not allow a single honest Bolshevik to be harmed. We must conduct a struggle against slanderers." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} set in the mid-1950s, shortly after Bergman's award win at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival for Smiles of a Summer Night. After his return to Stockholm, Bergman feels {{compelled}} to go to a cinema and watch a Hollywood blockbuster movie. As he exits the cinema, he inexplicably finds himself transported to Hollywood, where a limo driver is waiting to take him to a film studio. The studio's executives, who give Bergman a lavish welcome, are desperate to entice him to stay in Hollywood and make movies for them, the American way: [...] "We're not hicks, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> deliver kicks." ...|$|E

500|$|The chance {{expected}} by Saavedra came in May 1810, when two British ships came {{with news of}} the peninsular war. The previous January Seville was invaded, the Junta of Seville ceased working, and some members took refuge at Cadiz and Leon, the last undefeated Spanish provinces. The complete Spanish defeat seemed imminent. The viceroy tried to conceal the information by seizing all newspapers, {{but some of them}} were leaked into the possession of the revolutionaries. Colonel Viamonte called Saavedra and informed him of the news, requesting once again his military support. Saavedra agreed {{that it was a good}} context to proceed, and gave his famous answer: [...] "Gentlemen: now I say it is not only time, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> not waste a single hour." ...|$|E
500|$|Not all Rise Against songs discuss {{controversial}} topics. More {{personal stories}} about broken relationships and forgiveness are common lyrical themes, {{as is the}} concept of self-reflection. The Unraveling is an early example of this style of songwriting, as the majority of the album's songs focus on friendships and memories. It was not until Revolutions per Minute that McIlrath began to incorporate social issues into their music. Despite the grim subject matter, Rise Against songs are often hopeful in nature, a decision the band conscientiously made from the very beginning. Will Rausch of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Unlike typical emo rants filled with despondency and arm chair philosophy, [...] songs deal with the reality that life sucks, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> move on." ...|$|E
500|$|George Rousseau, similarly, {{cites the}} {{pamphlet}} {{as part of}} a body of 1740s [...] "sodomy" [...] literature so wide-ranging as to suggest that the term's meaning might have been mutable, broad, and vague. He argues specifically that, in the 1740s, the term had a strong connotation of an imported vice; it was often used in the 1740s to connote suspicion against foreigners. The pamphlet's text, on page 50, includes the strident claim [...] "Damn'd Fashion! Imported from Italy amid'st a Train of other unnatural Vices. Have we not Sins enough of our own, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> eke 'em out with those of Foreign Nations, to fill up the Cup of our Abominations, and make us yet more ripe for Divine Vengeance?" [...] The plausibility of the theory that [...] "sodomy", however understood, was particularly prevalent in Italy is difficult to assess, though Trevor Dean notes that, earlier, seventeenth-century Italy had undergone increasingly vigorous efforts to monitor and regulate sexual activity.|$|E

500|$|Kunzang Choden {{also made}} her Olympic debut at the 2012 games. She {{qualified}} for the 10 metre air rifle event after receiving a wild card from the Tripartite Commission. Before the games Choden said that, [...] "Bhutan is just a small country of just 700,000. There {{is a lot of}} pressure on us <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> be realistic about our chances. We just want to do well." [...] Choden spent time in Germany and Bangladesh preparing for the games. On July 28 Choden competed in the qualification round of her event. She finished 56th out of 56 athletes with a score of 381 points. She scored 18 points less the two equal highest scoring athlete, Sylwia Bogacka of Poland and Yi Siling of China. Choden scored 16 points less than Czech Kateřina Emmons who was the lowest scoring qualifier for the final and therefore her competition ended at the qualifying round. In an interview with Reuters after the games Choden said: [...] "I really enjoyed it. Now we can see how hard we need to work to be really good." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." [...] In one interview following the race, Čavić said [...] "I am completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed that he expects that [...] "people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If we got to do this again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.|$|E
500|$|Louis Dow {{had died}} in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' {{marriage}} then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former law clerks have provided intimate details of Hand's character {{during the last decade}} of his life. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices {{at the end of each}} day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, [...] "This is the most miserable of cases, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." [...] Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a [...] "melancholic, a failure [...] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".|$|E

In 1974, she founded Lyric Opera's ballet school, where she taught the Balanchine technique. Explaining her teaching philosophy she wrote [...] "New ideas are essential, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> retain respect for the art of ballet–and that means the artist too–or else {{it is no longer}} an art form." ...|$|E
2500|$|At first, the Soviets {{concealed}} {{their role}} in other Eastern Bloc politics, with the transformation appearing as a modification of western [...] "bourgeois democracy". As a young communist was told in East Germany: [...] "it's got to look democratic, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> have everything in our control." [...] Stalin felt that socioeconomic transformation was indispensable to establish Soviet control, reflecting the Marxist-Leninist view that material bases, {{the distribution of the}} means of production, shaped social and political relations.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a similar}} joint {{symposium}} {{held at the}} American Embassy in May 2009, embassy officials from Canada, France, the UK, and the US issued a joint statement calling on Japan to sign the Hague Convention. Following the Christopher Savoie incident (see [...] "Specific Cases"), a near identical statement was reissued in October 2009 with additional support from Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Spain. In a 2009 statement, Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada said that Japan was considering being a signatory, stating that [...] "we are approaching the matter with an open mind, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>must</b> also take public opinion into account." ...|$|E
