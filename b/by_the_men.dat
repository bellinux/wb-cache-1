5|$|Talking of {{the people}} who lived above the falls, Tuckey said that fowls, eggs, manioc and fruits were the {{property}} of women. The items were never dealt with <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> without a discussion with their wives. Beads were given as presents from the men.|$|E
5|$|Dismantling {{the sets}} cost $125,000. Almost all the filmmaking {{equipment}} {{was turned over}} to the Italian government, which sold and exported it. MGM turned title to the artificial lake over to Cinecittà. MGM retained control over the costumes and the artificial lake background, which went back to the United States. The chariots were also returned to the U.S., where they were used as promotional props. The life-size galleys and pirate ships were dismantled to prevent them from being used by competing studios. Some of the horses were adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who trained them, while others were sold. Many of the camels, donkeys, and other exotic animals were sold to circuses and zoos in Europe.|$|E
5|$|From the Second Age on, Quenya {{was also}} used ceremonially <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Men</b> of Númenór and their {{descendants}} in Gondor and Arnor for the official names of kings and queens; this practice was resumed by Aragorn {{when he took the}} crown as Elessar Telcontar. Quenya in the Third Age had almost the same status as the Latin language had in medieval Europe, and was called Elven-latin by Tolkien.|$|E

Hentoff co-founded The Jazz Review in 1958, {{a magazine that}} he co-edited with Martin Williams until 1961. He also served as the A director of the short-lived jazz label Candid Records in 1960, which released albums by Charles Mingus, Cecil Taylor and Max Roach, among others.|$|E
5|$|In Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, Albert Hosteen (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) and {{his family}} are beaten <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Men</b> in Black as they search for the {{whereabouts}} of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is pursued by a black helicopter before soldiers retrieve her printed copies of Albert's translations of the digital tape. Scully denies having the original tape, saying it is in Mulder's possession. Upon returning to Washington, the FBI puts Scully on mandatory leave and forces her to turn in her badge and gun. Upon entering Mulder's office, she finds the tape missing.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{remains the}} most senior Canadian officer ever to die in combat and was unfortunate to be killed at the opening {{engagement}} of the largest battle of his career, when he was trapped by shellfire during a front line reconnaissance and overrun during the subsequent German attack.

5|$|Opus Dei's highest {{assembled}} {{bodies are}} the General Congresses, {{which are usually}} convened once every eight years. There are separate congresses {{for the men and}} women's branch of Opus Dei. The General Congresses are made up of members appointed by the Prelate, and are responsible for advising him about the prelature's future. The men's General Congress also elects the Prelate from a list of candidates chosen by their female counterparts. After the death of a Prelate, a special elective General Congress is convened. The women nominate their preferred candidates for the prelate and is voted upon <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> to become the next Prelate—an appointment that must be confirmed by the Pope.|$|E
5|$|Prior to World War II, {{traditional}} Hispanic {{cultural values}} expected {{women to be}} homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} Hispanic women joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, women such as Corporal Maria (Torres) Maes could attend to certain administrative duties left open <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> who were reassigned to combat zones. After completing boot camp at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, she was sent to Quartermaster School and assigned to the Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|South of the pike, Archer's {{men were}} expecting an easy fight against {{dismounted}} cavalrymen and were astonished {{to recognize the}} black Hardee hats worn <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, {{had a reputation as}} fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.|$|E

5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury is the primate of the Church of England and the {{worldwide}} Anglican Communion {{owing to the}} importance of St Augustine, who served as the apostle to the pagan Kingdom of Kent {{around the turn of the}} 7th century. The city's cathedral became a major focus of pilgrimage following the 1170 martyrdom of Thomas Becket, although it had already been a well-trodden pilgrim destination since the murder of St Alphege <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of King Canute in 1012. A journey of pilgrims to Becket's shrine served as the frame for Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century classic The Canterbury Tales.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Battleship Division Nine's {{time with}} the Grand Fleet, combating boredom was a {{constant}} difficulty. Located at the northeastern tip of Scotland, the islands surrounding Scapa Flow {{were little more than}} barren, cold, windswept specks of land devoid of the trappings of civilization. Due to the efforts of the officers to keep their men entertained, however, morale remained high throughout the war. The British worked hard to turn the anchorage into a more inviting place. Central to these efforts were sporting events. The Fleet held numerous inter-ship competitions, including soccer, rugby, rowing, track, and boxing, which were followed with intense interest <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the respective ships.|$|E

5|$|Al-Tabari {{states that}} al-Mu'tasim fell ill on 21 October 841. His regular doctor, Salmawayh ibn Bunan, whom the Caliph had trusted implicitly, had died the {{previous}} year and the new physician Yahya ibn Masawayh did not follow the normal treatment of cupping and purging, which according to Hunayn ibn Ishaq worsened the caliph's illness and brought about his death on 5 January 842, after a reign of eight years, eight months and two days according to the Islamic calendar. He {{was buried in the}} Jawsaq al-Khaqani palace in Samarra. The succession of his son, al-Wathiq, was unopposed. Al-Wathiq's reign, through unremarkable, was essentially a continuation of al-Mu'tasim's own, as the government continued to be led <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> al-Mu'tasim had raised to power: the Turks Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas, the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, and the chief qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad.|$|E
5|$|Any {{pretense of}} cordiality between Cope and Marsh ended in 1872, and by spring 1873 open hostility ensued. At the same time, Leidy, Cope and Marsh were making great discoveries of ancient {{reptiles}} and mammals in the Western bone beds. The paleontologists {{had a habit}} of making hasty telegrams eastward describing their finds, only publishing fuller accounts after returning from trips. Among the new specimens described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were Uintatherium, Loxolophodon, Eobasileus, Dinoceras, and Tinoceras. The problem was that many of these finds were not uniquely different from each other; in fact, Cope and Marsh knew that some of the fossils they were collecting had already been found by the others. As it turned out, many of Marsh's names were valid, while none of Cope's were. Marsh also placed the new species into a new order of mammals, Cinocerea. Cope was humiliated and powerless to stop his rival's changes. Instead, he published a broad analytical study where he proposed a new plan of classification for the Eocene mammals, in which he discarded Marsh's genera in favor of his own. Marsh remained steadfast and continued to claim that all of Cope's names for Dinocerata were incorrect.|$|E

5|$|Following {{reports of}} {{disciplinary}} problems, VI Corps ordered an investigation, {{which took place}} over four days while elements of the battalion were still engaged at Rittershoffen. It recommended that the battalion be withdrawn and retrained before returning to combat under a new commander, while Major-General Edward H. Brooks, the corps commander, instead recommended that the battalion be entirely disbanded and its men distributed to other units. General Alexander Patch, commanding Seventh Army, agreed with Brooks, suggesting that a new tank destroyer battalion be formed from the men of service units, themselves replaced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of the 827th. This was contentious, however; the number and status of segregated combat units {{was a matter of}} intense political debate, and converting a black combat unit to a service one, in favor of white troops, was likely controversial.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{forces from}} the Carmeli Brigade first {{captured}} al-Birwa and positions overlooking it on 11 June 1948 as part of Operation Ben-Ami, a day before the first truce of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. During the fighting, 45 elderly residents hid in the church with the priest. The defenders of the village surrendered after losing men and running out of ammunition. The residents took refuge in nearby villages for thirteen days. Nevertheless, clashes continued during the truce. According to local militiamen from al-Birwa, 96 men from the village armed with rifles, and {{an equal number of}} men armed with non-firearms and unarmed women assembled near {{the front lines of the}} Arab Liberation Army (ALA). The rifle-armed force charged first across the front lines, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> armed with axes, shovels, and sticks, and then the women who carried water to assist the wounded. Al-Birwa's ad-hoc militia took the small force of Haganah soldiers (who became part of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May) by surprise and forced them back a kilometer west of al-Birwa. Afterward, al-Birwa's residents harvested their crops. They remained in the village until 24 June, when ALA commanders suggested that they join their families in the nearby villages. The militiamen claimed that the ALA stood by during the clashes because they did not receive orders from their superiors.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots.|$|E
