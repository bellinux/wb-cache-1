5|$|Before these discoveries, {{a theory}} existed that a Midcontinental seaway {{separated}} {{what is now}} Texas and Oklahoma from more western lands during the Early Permian, isolating Dimetrodon to a small region of North America while a smaller sphenacodontid called Sphenacodon dominated the western area. While this seaway probably did exist, the discovery of fossils outside Texas and Oklahoma show that its extent was limited {{and that it was}} not an effective <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distribution of Dimetrodon.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is <b>to</b> {{identify}} <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of new technology in rural settings. Specifically, this paper focuses on identifying and overcoming <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of a medication error reporting system in eight rural hospitals. Prior research has generally focused on <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of new technology in urban areas, medical centers, or large hospitals. The literature has identified six primary <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of new technology: cost, legality, time, fear, usefulness, and complexity. Although our research recognizes these same barriers, the means through which these barriers may be mitigated are different in rural settings. Our research identified three additional <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> adoption of new technology that may be specific to rural areas: personnel, physical space, and Internet access. Our outcome variable, in order to demonstrate our success, is the number of reported medication errors...|$|R

This methodology includes seven steps such as selecting the group and place, recording the barriers during the visit and evaluating <b>the</b> recorded <b>barriers.</b> According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>barrier</b> hunting with a blind student at METU Science and Technology Museum, barriers are categorized in six dimensions; access <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area, access <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> material, access <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> information, safety <b>barriers</b> around the area, safety barriers around the material, and validity problems about the information.

5|$|The {{formation}} {{that makes}} up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi-welded tuff. The tuff surround the burial sites is expected to protect human health as it provides a natural <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radiation. It lies along the transition between the Mojave and the Great Basin Deserts.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{of genetic}} {{diversity}} within individual populations of B.cuneata are unusually high {{for a rare}} and endangered species, but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the Salt River, an ephemeral saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both B.cuneata and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions as a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to diverge through genetic drift. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested {{on both sides of}} the river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate. More recently, however, a model-based risk analysis found that the population size required to reduce extinction risk to acceptable levels is more than ten times the current population size. This leads to the conclusion that all populations, and all available habitat, should be protected.|$|E
5|$|Males’ {{differential}} {{recognition of}} local and nonlocal songs has been studied in two populations: one in the northern United States (New Hampshire) {{and the other in}} the southern United States (North Carolina). An asymmetry of response has been found between the two populations. The northern black-throated blue warbler responds strongly to local songs but relatively weakly to the song of southern warblers. In contrast, a warbler from the south responds equally to songs from both the north and the south. A potential explanation of this asymmetry is the difference in female preference between the northern and southern black-throated blue warblers. Females from the north are less likely to mate with a “heterospecific” male from the south; therefore it is not necessary for a northern male to respond strongly to the song of a southern challenger. It is possible that a barrier to gene flow from south to north exists while a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reverse does not. Therefore, female choice of male songs is likely {{to play a role in}} gene flow and reproductive isolation, which may eventually lead to diversification.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflicts}} with Pyrrhus {{would have a}} great effect on Rome. It had shown that it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia. Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula, and with a proven international military reputation, Rome now began to look to expand from the Italian mainland. Since the Alps formed a natural <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, and Rome was none too keen to meet the fierce Gauls in battle once more, the city's gaze turned to Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with its former ally Carthage.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of early human activity in the Birmingham area dating back 10,000 years, with stone age artefacts suggesting seasonal settlements, overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling. The many burnt mounds that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the bronze age, when a substantial but short-lived influx of population occurred between 1700BC and 1000BC, possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area. During the 1st-century Roman conquest of Britain, the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> advancing Roman legions, who built the large Metchley Fort {{in the area of}} modern-day Edgbaston in AD48, and made it the focus of a network of Roman roads.|$|E
