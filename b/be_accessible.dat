Some venues also contained additional accessible seating areas during the Paralympics.|$|E

5|$|Casinos, {{and vendors}} serving, selling or storing {{alcoholic}} beverages for a casino, {{are required to}} obtain a casino hotel alcoholic beverage (CHAB) license from the Division of Gaming Enforcement. CHAB licenses must be renewed every five years. New Jersey's casino alcohol regulations are divided into five different regions of activity: (a) the casino floor (includes simulcasting facilities); (b) the hotel (includes restaurants and meeting rooms); (c) package goods; (d) room service; and (e) storage. Alcohol sold or given away on the casino floor and in hotel areas must be in an open container for immediate consumption, whereas alcohol sold in a package goods area must be sealed. Alcoholic beverages brought to a patron as a room service may be open or closed, whereas storage areas must not <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> to the public.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May {{the broken}} {{remains of the}} two bower anchors, which were {{threatening}} to capsize the ship, were hauled in. During the following days the pack ice thickened, and in increasingly turbulent weather the boilers were closed down, since attempting to manoeuvre under power in these conditions would merely waste coal. Replenishing the ship's supply of fresh water was a further difficulty. A large iceberg was in view, but too far away in the prevailing weather conditions to <b>be</b> <b>accessible,</b> so to obtain drinking water the crew had to gather snow. Food was less of a problem; {{they were able to}} augment Aurora's food supplies from the penguins and seals that gathered around the ship. To boost morale the crew were given a ration of rum to celebrate Empire Day on 24 May.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which was accomplished by creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E

5|$|The {{database}} {{was expected}} to cost £224m to set up, spread over three years beginning December 2005 (therefore costing £81m {{a year for the}} first three years), and £41m a year thereafter. The database, which would be operating in 150 local authorities and would <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> by at least 330,000 users, {{was expected to}} be fully operational by the end of 2008; however, following the 2007 UK child benefit data scandal, the deadline was pushed back for five months to allow a security review prior to implementation. Training for the workers had been planned begin in spring 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} team {{hoped the}} new title {{would appeal to}} both newcomers and fans of the series, <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> and introduce the franchise to a broader audience. They assumed most players would not have played the original Syndicate games. The team also considered {{that because of the}} change in audience tastes and the introduction of new video game platforms, altering the game's perspective to first-person was a correct decision. Turning it into a first-person game was the first design choice made by the team, who hoped allowing players to view from the agent's perspective directly would make the game more immersive for players.|$|E
5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly even if they are not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E

5|$|While wintering, {{bald eagles}} {{tend to be}} less habitat and {{disturbance}} sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not <b>be</b> <b>accessible.</b> Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as prairies, meadows or tundra, or open forests with regular carrion access.|$|E
5|$|The Idolmaster series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami {{attributed the}} development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons. Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise, he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series' albums but not in its video games to <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> in that form. He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that, while maintaining a producer's viewpoint, has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays. He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires, and this led to {{the development of}} Shiny Festa. The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) as he felt it was simple to play on. At the same time, the team also wanted to create scenes where the series' thirteen idols would be able to appear together, and chose to use pre-rendered videos to make this possible. Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background.|$|E
5|$|The emperor was the {{ultimate}} authority in policy- and decision-making, {{but in the early}} Principate he was expected to <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> to individuals from all walks of life, and to deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the unofficial influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor's council (consilium) became subject to official appointment for the sake of greater transparency. Though the senate took a lead in policy discussions {{until the end of the}} Antonine dynasty, equestrians played an increasingly important role in the consilium. The women of the emperor's family often intervened directly in his decisions. Plotina exercised influence on both her husband Trajan and his successor Hadrian. Her influence was advertised by having her letters on official matters published, as a sign that the emperor was reasonable in his exercise of authority and listened to his people.|$|E

5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> to all players.|$|E
5|$|There is the {{tradition}} of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother {{is the head of}} the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to <b>be</b> <b>accessible</b> and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it.|$|E
