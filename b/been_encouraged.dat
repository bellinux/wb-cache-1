The value of batik exports, meanwhile, increased from $14.3 million in 2006 to $22.3 million in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Grameen Bank is {{best known}} for its system of {{solidarity}} lending. The Bank also incorporates a set of values embodied in Bangladesh by the Sixteen Decisions. At every branch of Grameen Bank, the borrowers recite these Decisions and vow to follow them. As a result of the Sixteen Decisions, Grameen borrowers have <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> to adopt positive social habits. One such habit includes educating children by sending them to school. Since the Grameen Bank embraced the Sixteen Decisions, almost all Grameen borrowers have their school-age children enrolled in regular classes. This in turn helps bring about social change, and educate the next generation.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of these restrictions were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, which require electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E
5|$|A rarely {{enforced}} 1958 law— {{known as}} Decree Number 10— was invoked in May 1963 to prohibit {{the display of}} religious flags. This disallowed the flying of the Buddhist flag on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. The application of the law caused indignation among Buddhists {{on the eve of}} the most important religious festival of the year, as a week earlier Catholics had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> to display Vatican flags at a government-sponsored celebration for Diem's brother, Archbishop Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục, the most senior Catholic cleric in the country. On 8 May in Huế, a crowd of Buddhists protested against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The police and army broke up the demonstration by firing guns at and throwing grenades into the gathering, leaving nine people dead.|$|E
5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.|$|E

5|$|Governor of North Carolina Pat McCrory {{declared}} a state of emergency for 25counties in advance of the hurricane's arrival. Fourteen shelters were opened, and the deteriorating North Carolina Highway12 Bonner Bridge was closed as a precaution. Mandatory evacuations were declared for Hatteras Island and Richland Township in Beaufort County while voluntary evacuations were announced for Ocracoke Island, Aurora, Pamlico Beach, and Belhaven. Approximately 4,300individuals fled from Ocracoke Island via ferry despite only being under a voluntary evacuation, and while a mandatory evacuation had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Hyde County's emergency management director, other officials turned down the request. Tornado watches were issued for 10North Carolina counties. In preparation for the possibility that Arthur's storm surge would make North Carolina Highway12 and Hatteras Island inaccessible, local officials deployed heavy equipment capable of removing sand and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Hergé sought work {{elsewhere}} too, creating The Lovable Mr. Mops cartoon for the Bon Marché department store, and The Adventures of Tim the Squirrel Out West for {{the rival}} L'Innovation department store. On 20 July 1932 he married Germaine Kieckens, who was Wallez's secretary; although {{neither of them}} were entirely happy with the union, they had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> {{to do so by}} Wallez, who demanded that all his staff married and who personally carried out the wedding ceremony at the Saint-Roch Church in Laeken. Spending their honeymoon in Vianden, Luxembourg, the couple moved into an apartment in the rue Knapen, Schaerbeek. After Wallez was removed from the paper's editorship in August 1933 following a scandal, Hergé became despondent; in March 1934 he tried to resign, but was encouraged to stay after his monthly salary was increased from 2000 to 3000 francs and his workload was reduced, with Jamin taking responsibility for the day-to-day running of Le Petit Vingtième.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, Chetniks from Montenegro and Sandžak met at {{a conference}} in the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje. The conference was {{dominated}} by Montenegrin Serb Chetnik commander Major Pavle Đurišić and its resolutions expressed extremism and intolerance, as well as an agenda which focused on restoring the pre-war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship. It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia's neighbors. At this conference, Mihailović was represented by his chief of staff, Major Zaharije Ostojić, who had previously <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the late}} Welsh singer, scholar and writer Meredydd Evans {{proposed}} that Wales should {{have its own}} entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 1969, Cân i Gymru was launched by BBC Cymru Wales as a selection show for the contest, with songs to be performed in Welsh. However, {{it was decided that}} the BBC would continue to send one entry for the whole of the United Kingdom. Despite this, Cân i Gymru has been broadcast every year since, with the exception of 1973. The winning song takes part in the annual Pan Celtic Festival in Ireland. Wales has appeared as an independent country in another EBU production, Jeux Sans Frontières and Welsh national broadcaster S4C has <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> {{to take part in the}} Junior Eurovision Song Contest. Wales is also eligible to take part in minority language song contest Liet-Lávlut, but has so far shown no interest.

5|$|Lavalleja soon {{discovered}} that Rosas in neighbouring Buenos Aires was interested in aiding him financially and militarily. In 1832, Lavalleja began to receive aid from Bento Gonçalves, a soldier and farmer from the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Gonçalves had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Rosas to rebel against the Brazilian government in 1835, with the ultimate aim of enabling Argentina to annex the province of Rio Grande do Sul. Together, Lavalleja and Gonçalves initiated a military campaign in Uruguay which was characterized by extensive violence and pillage. Gonçalves betrayed Rosas and Lavalleja by becoming an ally of Rivera. Both then invaded Uruguay and overran {{most of the country}} outside the environs of the capital, Montevideo. Defeated, the then-Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe, like the betrayed Lavalleja a member of the Blanco party, resigned his position as president and fled to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An authorised person must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E

5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx had <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> to self-produce their album by Russell; he {{believed}} it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Hananu logistically {{supported}} the guerrilla operations of Barakat against the French in the Antioch region. He later decided {{to organize a}} rebellion in Aleppo and its countryside. Hananu was motivated to act {{by what he saw}} as the ineffectiveness of the Syrian National Congress, the legislative body of Faisal's state of which Hananu was a member, in preventing French rule. He may also have <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by Rashid al-Tali'a, the Arab government's district governor of Hama, who had been supporting Saleh al-Ali and the Alawite-dominated revolt he was leading against the French in the Syrian coastal mountains. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in March 1920. France was wary that a popular nationalist movement emanating from Faisal's kingdom could spread to Lebanon and French territories in North Africa, and moved {{to put an end to}} Faisal's state. Anti-French resistance manifested at local level as the Committees of National Defense, which began springing up in Aleppo and its hinterland. The committees were founded by members of the local elite, many of whom were sympathetic to Ottoman rule, but the committees quickly became fueled by populist agitation against French colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} <b>been</b> <b>encouraged</b> by the New York Yankees organization {{to establish the}} Sounds as a Triple-A team, {{but he refused to}} go back on his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of the}} season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E
