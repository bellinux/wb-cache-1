40|$|Theaetetus is {{certainly}} one of the most complex dialogues {{and one of the most}} difficult to read, and its terminal part perhaps constitutes its most enigmatic aspect, because we are not told who Plato is conversing with and why, regarding the "theory of the dream" expressed as follows: "science is a true opinion accompanied by logos" (201 c 9 -d 1); thethree definitions of logos given by Socrates all prove insufficient for defining science.

Despite his background, living a normal and peaceful life is what Harutora ever wants.

Universal suffrage thus violates what Brennan names the Competence Principle: it is unjust to impose coercitive decisions on innocent people when these decisions are incompetent.

After having presented Brennan's argument in more detail, the paper adresses one critical question: can an electorate be considered as a collective intentional agent? If not, an electorate cannot have duties. And if it cannot have duties, there is no sensible way to understand Brennan's purported «right to a competent electorate». What is left of Brennan's position is thus rather banal: it is regrettable that some voters are incompetent. And nothing compels us to abandon universal suffrage...|$|E

50|$|In 1880, the San Francisco {{businessman}} George Hearst and his partner, George Hill Howard, {{purchased the}} Boquillas land {{grant from the}} Elias family in Sonora.

In 1891, the United States government established the Court of Private Land Claims to validate land grant claims and attempt to sort out the problems caused by the Surveyor Office, which had previously validated claims. The same year George Hearst died and his son, William Randolph Hearst, and his widow, Phoebe Hearst, filed papers to have their exclusive claim to the Boquillas land grant recognized.

With an entire campus filled with students eager to gain experience and willing to study, it’s easy to find capable workers that are able to learn and perform complex tasks. Teaching student workers to work on a professional level is also aligned with the over-arching goals of knowledge-sharing and mentorship found in academic environments.

500|$|Two {{years after}} Sam Houston's death, Baylor University {{president}} William Carey Crane {{was commissioned by}} Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had {{little more than a}} passing acquaintance with [...] "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's [...] "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author James L.

30|$|Upon {{realizing the}} {{shortcomings}} of TGLP, the government introduced the National Policy on Agricultural Development (NPAD) in 1991. The aim of NPAD was to provide subsidies to improve productivity in the livestock sub-sector by promoting the sustainable use of rangeland resources through fencing of communal grazing areas (GoB 1991). So in essence, the fencing component of NPAD simply accelerated the implementation of TGLP and failed to tackle some of the earlier concerns like dual grazing rights. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> practicing pastoralism. Some ranches had displaced non-pastoral populations and denied them access to natural resources of land, water, veld products and animals (Hitchcock 1978). So for other traditional rural livelihoods such as hunting and gathering, part of the reserve land was later demarcated into Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) {{in an attempt to}} balance the scales. WMAs are multiple-use areas combining wildlife conservation with the creation of economic opportunities for the rural population (GoB 1999). Intense developments within WMAs such as borehole drilling are prohibited, while hunting is controlled through permits or total bans. There are complementary polices and pieces of legislation predicated on sustainable utilization of natural resources also governing these areas, such as the Wildlife Conservation Policy (1986), Tourism Policy (1990), National Conservation Strategy (1990), Wildlife Conservation and National Parks Act (1992), Tourism Act (1992) and Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) concept.|$|R
