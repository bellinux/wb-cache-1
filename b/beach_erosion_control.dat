40|$|Abstract: The {{causes of}} <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> in Doi Duong-Phan Thiet is {{presented}} {{by considering the}} hydro-meteorological and geomorphological conditions in Binh Thuan province. The mild wind speeds from W/SW are predominant in V-X. The gusty wind speeds from E/NE are mainly in XI-IV. The tropical storms occur statistically in X-XII and tides are semi-diurnal. By Hsu and Evan model (1989), the shoreline in Phan Thiet bay, Ham Tien and fishing port breakwater are dynamical equilibrium. With imaginary structures, the shorelines in Ham Tien and fishing port can be stabilized. Using the spectral model and mild slope equation, the wave and current fields in Phan Thiet bay for two representative NE and SW direction seasons are presented. Without coastal works, no <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> is reported in Phan Thiet. However, with coastal works, the unbalance of coastal sediment budget causes <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> in Doi Duong-Phan Thiet. The beach nourishment in associated with geotextile is proposed for <b>erosion</b> <b>controls</b> in Doi Duong tourist resort...|$|R
40|$|Beaches {{are one of}} {{the most}} dynamic environments on earth. They provide storm surge protection, flood control, {{recreational}} activities, habitat for a variety of plants and animals and also provide an important source of income for economies around the country through tourism. Impacts on beaches from natural and anthropogenic sources of erosion are becoming more prevalent as sea levels rise and urban coastal areas grow in population. As a result, engineered <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> techniques were developed to mitigate for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> and protect coastal development. Early forms of these techniques included the use of engineered hard structures such as seawalls, jetties and groins to armor the coast line but they often have unintended impacts or side effects. Beach nourishments, which are increasingly employed around the United States, are considered a more environmentally friendly method by some and are now the preferred method of choice for engineered coastal protection. There is much debate as to whether <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> techniques, including <b>beach</b> nourishments, are an effective mitigation tool for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> or if tactics such as human population retreat are a better solution. Due to the large number of people that live and recreate near beaches and the economies that rely on the tourism generated earnings, retreat is not a viable option. Coastal erosion techniques such as beach nourishments are needed to provide protection against coastal inundation and maintain economically important recreational beaches while balancing environmental concerns...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the results of}} a study conducted to evaluate the long term effects of groin placement on beach re-nourishment and beach restoration in the Yucatan peninsula. The study includes the evaluation of six control points located on Chelem beach in Yucatan, Mexico, very close to the Progreso pier. The control points were set up in an active groin field to record data on the re-nourishment project covering the Chelem <b>beach</b> area. These <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> groins were constructed as part of an experimental project to see how the adopted U. S. Army Corps of Engineers guidelines, for installing groins, affected the re-nourishment of the beach. The scope {{of this study is to}} document how placing groins using the USACE guidelines (transversally spacing them by a distance of three times their longitudinal length) affects the shoreline erosion patterns. The profile of the beach was generated by GPS technology and by utilizing the Emery-Method (Krause, 2004). The beach profiles were checked on a weekly basis to ensure the effects of the groins were being adequately monitored. A Beach Morphology Analysis Package (BMAP) model for shoreline evaluation was run to accurately display the displacement of sediment along the coast. Based on this modeling, conclusions are presente...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{employ a}} choice-based {{conjoint}} survey design to elicit individual choices of <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> programs that can potentially cause multiple effects on beach environment. Two empirical choice models, which incorporate individual heterogeneity, {{are used to}} analyze and compare the elicited individual choices of erosion control programs.

We find that the economic benefit of an erosion control program to preserve a stretch of sand beach can be grossly exaggerated if potential negative impacts on the coastal environment from the same program are not considered.

40|$|In {{the third}} report, {{based on the}} {{numerical}} results of large scale coastal behavior and methodology for stabilization of Joestu-Ogata coast, a practical methodology for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> by headlands is first proposed. The practical application is proposed for stabilizing Joetsu-Ogata coast by formation {{of a series of}} stable sandy beaches. Secondly, experiments on the formation of stable sandy beach were carried out to examine the applicability of the proposed methodology for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> by headlands. In order to compare the hydraulic performances of the methodology for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> by headlands with other methods such as detached breakwaters in the stabilization of the sandy beach which is being eroded, by use of the similitude of beach change by Ito and Tsuchiya, the physical scales of the model experiment was determined, a series of experiments of the formation of stable sandy beach and beach changes by the methods were then conducted. The changes in shoreline and bottom topography after employing these methods for <b>beach</b> <b>erosion</b> <b>control</b> were observed and compared to find which method can stabilize the sandy beach in a long term sense. In the case of detached breakwaters, tombolos are generally formed in relation to the length of the breakwater and its onshore distance from the shoreline, but a couple of detached breakwaters spaced considerably are needed as headlands to stabilize the sandy beach. In the case of headlands, however, when a comparative condition in formation of sandy beaches by headlands is made, a stable sandy beach can be formed well between the headlands...|$|E
