5|$|In June 2012, Sea World {{applied for}} a permit to {{demolish}} the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> water ride system and the interior of its show building. The <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> had been sitting dormant since its closure in October 2010 and had been earmarked by the park as a site for a future attraction. On 12 July 2012, Christian von Elverfeldt from Mack Rides revealed Australia would be receiving a water roller coaster in 2013; leading to speculation that Sea World might have revived its plans. Further development application filings, and reports by the Roller Coaster DataBase and the Gold Coast Bulletin, confirmed this speculation. In September 2012, Sea World asked Austrian firm Dynamic Motion Rides (DyMoRides) to develop a theming and show design concept for the yet-to-be-announced Storm Coaster. DyMoRides was ultimately contracted for the full turnkey project in April 2013. DyMoRides subsequently contracted PEL Creative for creative direction, Full-On Lighting for lighting design, Volume One for audio and visual effects, and Sculpt Studios for theming design.|$|E
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle.</b> As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies {{unconscious}} {{in the sea}} after wrecking his raft. He {{is taken}} aboard a passenger ship, the Queen Anne, by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the Queen Anne vanished in the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a Nazi spy. At that moment, the Queen Anne is boarded by SS troops {{under the control of}} a Oberführer resembling The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), who sets the ship's course for Nazi Germany. The crew of the Queen Anne lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of World War II. Mulder realizes that the Queen Anne did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{exist in}} an {{alternate}} Domain, and {{are referred to}} as creatures with no natural defenses. Most believe that they are fictional creatures; but a few, including the Dewclaws, know that they exist. This was developed further in 2003 by the introduction of the character Danielle, a human who enters the animal world via the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> and transforms into a rabbit. However, she later has a son, Francis, who is born human. The series features jokes on a variety of topics. Many draw satirical parallels between its world and ours, making fun and sometimes social commentary on politics, sports, society, class-snobbery, school, technology, pop culture and corporate culture, for example; in January 2008 the Predator's Union was described as going on strike, in a parody of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.|$|E
5|$|Liz Sanbourne is the {{antagonist}} and foil to her adoptive sister Eve Russell. Initially {{identified only}} by her first name, Liz is first {{seen as the}} owner of a resort on the fictional St. Lisa's Island, located near Bermuda and the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle.</b> Liz is still in love with her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary. Her early appearances center on her attempts to reunite amnesiac Sheridan Crane with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald, despite Brian's interest in her. When Liz arrives in Harmony, it is revealed that she is Eve's half-sister, and is later retconned to become her adoptive sister. Liz exposes Eve's past relationship with Julian Crane, inadvertently leading them to reunite and proving Chad Harris-Crane and Whitney Russell were not committing incest by her identification as Chad's mother. Liz harbors a deep desire for revenge against Eve for unknowingly abandoning her in an abusive household. Liz also seeks vengeance against the Crane family after she was raped by Alistair, and later forced to undergo surgery that made her barren. Liz leaves the show in February 2006, abandoning her vengeance against Eve, Julian, and Alistair to find a new life for herself.|$|E
5|$|En {{route to}} the Sea of Monsters (<b>Bermuda</b> <b>triangle),</b> the Birmingham is {{destroyed}} by Charybdis and Scylla. Thinking Tyson and Clarisse dead, Percy and Annabeth sail in a lifeboat to a nearby island, where they narrowly escape the sorceress Circe, who turns men into guinea pigs. They steal the Queen Anne's Revenge from Circe's harbor and sail towards the island of Polyphemus. Along the way, they pass the island of the Sirens and Annabeth confesses her fatal flaw, hubris, to Percy. When they reach the island, they find Grover, Clarisse, Tyson, and the fleece. Tyson and Percy work together to defeat Polyphemus and return the group to the mainland. Once there, Clarisse takes a plane to Camp Half-Blood with the Fleece. The remaining questers are captured by Luke and taken to the Princess Andromeda. Percy manages to contact Camp Half-Blood through an Iris Message and tricks Luke into admitting that he poisoned Thalia's tree, proving Chiron's innocence {{in front of the}} entire camp. Mr. D then sends Tantalus back to the Fields of Punishment. Luke duels Percy, beats him, and is about to kill the group, but before he does, Chiron and the his centaur relatives appear and rescue them. Returning to the camp, Chiron is given his job back and the Golden Fleece heals Thalia's tree. However, in the final pages, the Golden Fleece also revives Thalia Grace, putting another half-blood back into play for the Great Prophecy the gods fear so much.|$|E
5|$|Liz first {{appears in}} the episode airing on October 3, 2001, {{as the owner of}} the unnamed resort on the fictional island of St. Lisa's, located near Bermuda and the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle.</b> She helps her former boyfriend Brian O'Leary rescue Sheridan Crane {{following}} the explosion of her boat. Along with Brian, and their friend Doc, Liz becomes close with the amnesiac Sheridan while trying to help her to remember her past. Sheridan believes her name is Diana due to confusing memories of her friendship with Diana, Princess of Wales with her own; she begins a romantic relationship with Brian. Liz grows increasingly jealous of the attention Brian pays to Diana and suspicious of Brian's true identity. Liz forms a close friendship with Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald after he comes to the island to pick up a boat for his then girlfriend Beth Wallace. She thinks Luis is Diana's fiancée, but fails to reunite them, despite several attempts, before he returns home. Liz joins Diana and Brian to sail the ship back to the fictional town of Harmony.

25|$|When the UK Channel 4 {{television}} program The <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> (1992) was being produced by John Simmons of Geofilms for the Equinox series, the marine insurance market Lloyd's of London {{was asked if}} an unusually large number of ships had sunk in the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> area. Lloyd's determined {{that large numbers of}} ships had not sunk there. Lloyd's does not charge higher rates for passing through this area. United States Coast Guard records confirm their conclusion. In fact, the number of supposed disappearances is relatively insignificant considering the number of ships and aircraft that pass through on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle,</b> {{also known}} as the Devil's Triangle, is a loosely-defined region {{in the western part of}} the North Atlantic Ocean, where a number of {{aircraft}} and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery. The vicinity of the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas, Europe, and the Caribbean islands. Cruise ships and pleasure craft regularly sail through the region, and commercial and private aircraft routinely fly over it.|$|E

25|$|Skeptical researchers, such as Ernest Taves and Barry Singer, {{have noted}} how mysteries and the paranormal are very popular and profitable. This {{has led to}} the {{production}} of vast amounts of material on topics such as the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle.</b> They were able to show that some of the pro-paranormal material is often misleading or inaccurate, but its producers continue to market it. Accordingly, they have claimed that the market is biased in favor of books, TV specials, and other media that support the Triangle mystery, and against well-researched material if it espouses a skeptical viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1945, {{the five}} planes of Flight 19 {{departed}} {{on a routine}} training mission from NAS Fort Lauderdale and were never seen again.

The strange disappearance of the flight and the coincidental explosion which destroyed Training 49, a plane involved in a search for the missing squadron, contributed to the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> myth.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda's {{economy is}} based on {{offshore}} insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors. Bermuda {{had one of the}} world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle,</b> a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to related severe weather; however, it is somewhat protected by a coral reef that surrounds the island and its position at the north of the belt, which limits the direction and severity of approaching storms.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence David Kusche, {{author of}} The <b>Bermuda</b> <b>Triangle</b> Mystery: Solved (1975) argued that many claims of Gaddis and {{subsequent}} writers were often exaggerated, dubious or unverifiable. Kusche's research revealed {{a number of}} inaccuracies and inconsistencies between Berlitz's accounts and statements from eyewitnesses, participants, and others involved in the initial incidents. Kusche noted cases where pertinent information went unreported, such as the disappearance of round-the-world yachtsman Donald Crowhurst, which Berlitz had presented as a mystery, despite clear evidence to the contrary. Another example was the ore-carrier recounted by Berlitz as lost without trace three days out of an Atlantic port when it had been lost three days out of a port with the same name in the Pacific Ocean. Kusche also argued that {{a large percentage of}} the incidents that sparked allegations of the Triangle's mysterious influence actually occurred well outside it. Often his research was simple: he would review period newspapers of the dates of reported incidents and find reports on possibly relevant events like unusual weather, that were never mentioned in the disappearance stories.|$|E
