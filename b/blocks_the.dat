5|$|As {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{it affects the}} ability of bacteria to produce protein. This either stops growth or results in bacterial death. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it <b>blocks</b> <b>the</b> start of protein production, rather {{than one of the}} later steps. As of 2014 bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained low.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, the {{woodwasp}} {{is fully}} {{dependent on the}} symbionts. Decomposition enables the larvae to unlock the wood by producing white rot. The mycetangia of this and other wasps from the family Siricidae support {{a close relationship with}} saprobiontic fungi. Without the process of decomposition of the host tree and weakening of the infested tree, the development of larvae is arrested. If the tree can recover from the consequences of the wasp secretion, it <b>blocks</b> <b>the</b> boreholes with resin, thus killing the larvae.|$|E

5|$|Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve is open year-round, {{although}} snow sometimes <b>blocks</b> <b>the</b> {{road to the}} park, and {{the visitor}} center is open when the cave is open for tours.

50|$|Like {{all other}} class I {{antiarrhythmic}} agents, quinidine primarily works by <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> fast inward sodium current (INa). Quinidine's effect on INa {{is known as}} a 'use dependent block'. This means at higher heart rates, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> increases, while at lower heart rates, <b>the</b> <b>block</b> decreases. <b>The</b> effect of <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> fast inward sodium current causes the phase 0 depolarization of the cardiac action potential to decrease (decreased Vmax).|$|R
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} dealing with the study of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields in <b>the</b> Krkonoše Mountains.

The outer structure was firstly investigated {{on the basis of the}} morphometric characteristics observed in DMR (digital model of relief) and orto photo maps and subsequently the characteristics of the inner structure were studied during the terraine geomorphologic researching. The following data were observed - for the outer characteristics: litology, exposition of the slope, angle of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields, area (log), index of the solar radiation, the length of the axis x and y of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields, excentricity of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> field, <b>the</b> altitude; and for the outer characteristics: deviation of the axis x from the downslope, the location of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> angularity of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> 'R' values, <b>the</b> length of the axis x and y of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> <b>the</b> height of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> excentricity of <b>the</b> <b>block,</b> inclination of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> and angle of <b>the</b> <b>block.</b> <b>The</b> influence of the given characteristics on the accumulation of <b>the</b> <b>block</b> fields and [...] ...|$|R

While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple.

Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph <b>blocks.</b> <b>The</b> reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making nucleotides that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate <b>blocks</b> <b>the</b> action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of nucleotides. This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
