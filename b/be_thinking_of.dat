The story ends with Cowley telling himself, [...] " [...] 'I showed him...I guess I showed him. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer", a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.|$|E
500|$|St Hill {{possessed a}} {{presence}} which compelled attention {{when he was}} batting. James wrote: [...] "Fires burned in St Hill and you could always see them glow." [...] When playing for Shannon, he insisted on the highest standards, {{and even though he}} was not captain, he would take over if the game was going against his team. James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> other things, far removed." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E

500|$|Six {{years have}} passed, {{and it is}} 1893. Gaylord and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a {{precarious}} living from Gaylord's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life, singing the song [...] "Why Do I Love You?" [...] By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Gaylord abandons [...] Magnolia and Kim. [...] Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song [...] "Bill." [...] She appears to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing [...] "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" [...] for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} legacy {{aspects of the}} film for Scorsese and {{compared}} Scorsese to such established directors as Ingmar Bergman. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said, [...] "The movie's being promoted as the third in the director's unofficial trilogy of faith, after The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Kundun (1997), and {{it feels like a}} self-conscious masterpiece, a summing-up from a filmmaker who, at 74, may <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> his legacy." [...] Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out London gave the film five stars out of five, saying, [...] "Scorsese has hit the rare heights of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman and Carl Theodor Dreyer, artists who find in religion a battleground that leaves even the strongest in tatters, compromised and broken." [...] Emma Green of The Atlantic gave the film high praise, stating, [...] "This is what makes Scorsese's film so radical and so unlike many movies about religion: It's actually art." [...] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph gave the film five stars out of five, stating, [...] "Scorsese's brutal spiritual epic will scald, and succor, your soul." [...] Collin further added, [...] "It's the kind of work a great filmmaker can only pull off with a lifetime's accrued expertise behind him". Brian Truitt of USA Today gave the film 3 stars and a half out of four, stating, [...] "With the religious historical drama Silence, Martin Scorsese proves he’s as masterful a filmmaker with men of God as he is with gangsters." [...] Truitt also argued that the film [...] "marks one of the deeper and most thoughtful projects in Scorsese’s career." ...|$|E
2500|$|As chaos {{broke out}} {{throughout}} China {{towards the end}} of the Eastern Han dynasty, Pang Xi wanted to improve security within Baxi Commandery, so he recruited more men to serve as soldiers. Around the time, Liu Zhang heard rumours that Pang Xi was planning to rebel against him and became more suspicious of Pang. When Pang Xi heard about it, he became fearful and started making preparations to increase the strength of his military forces. He also sent Cheng Yu (程郁), Cheng Ji's son, who was serving in the commandery office, to persuade Cheng Ji to support him in rebelling against Liu Zhang. Cheng Ji wrote to Pang Xi, [...] "Your original intention in recruiting more soldiers was not to start a rebellion. There might have been some misunderstanding, but what is more important is you are performing your duties. If you are fearful and start thinking of rebelling, I will not listen to you." [...] He also wrote to Cheng Yu, [...] "I received grace from the provincial government, so I am obliged to do my best to serve the Governor. You are serving in the commandery office, so you should do your best to serve the Administrator. You should not <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> rebelling." [...] Pang Xi sent a message to Cheng Ji, [...] "Your son is serving in the commandery office. Your family will be in trouble if you do not obey the Administrator!" [...] Cheng Ji replied, [...] "Yue Yang (樂羊) ate his son's flesh not because he did not love his son, but because he was doing so for the sake of upholding righteousness. If you were to make me do the same thing, I'll do it." [...] Pang Xi realised that Cheng Ji would never support him, so he abandoned the idea of rebelling against Liu Zhang; instead, he apologised to Liu Zhang and was pardoned. When Liu Zhang heard about Cheng Ji's loyalty towards him, he promoted Cheng to serve as the Administrator of Jiangyang Commandery (江陽郡; around present-day Luzhou, Sichuan).|$|E
