5|$|Toyota Australia {{planned to}} sell 50 to 70 TRD Aurion units per month with the {{majority}} of the sales coming from Australia. However, the project was unsuccessful, and as of 31 March 2009, TRD Australia halted production of the Aurion TRD (and TRD Hilux), and the division was shut down. When available, the range comprised two variants, the 3500S and 3500SL. The former features performance mufflers, 19-inch alloy wheels, red alcantara leather seats with black alcantara fabric bolsters and other high-performance upgrades. The range-topping 3500SL adds clearance and reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, a colour-coded transmission selection lever, and an eight-way adjustable driver's seat. Furthermore, the SL gains an aluminium rear <b>bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> addition, and is the first production car in the world to use the Eaton twin-vortices supercharger. This substantially reduces engine noise while bringing gains to power and torque.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to {{increased interest in}} fuel economy, Dodge offered the [...] "Dart Lite" [...] fuel economy package which weighed at least 150 lb less than the ordinary Dart Sport. The 225 slant-six was the only available engine, equipped with an aluminum intake manifold {{for the first time}} since 1960 and a specially calibrated carburetor and distributor. <b>Bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> brackets were aluminum instead of steel, while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum. The slant-six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in 1975; in the middle of 1976 production its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron. The high-flow exhaust system included a dual-biscuit catalytic converter, a 2¼" [...] headpipe, and the muffler used on V8 models. The Dart Lite was equipped with a 2.94:1 rear axle rather than the customary 3.21:1 ratio when the car was ordered with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. The A833OD overdrive 4-speed manual transmission housing was made of aluminum. Like all other Darts, the Dart Lites with automatic transmission came with a 2.76:1 rear axle as standard equipment. The Dart Lite with manual transmission was rated by the EPA at 36 mpg (6.5 l/100km) in highway driving. The Plymouth version was the Feather Duster.|$|E
40|$|Modern bumper {{systems are}} governed by laws and {{regulations}} imposed separately by various countries. Today, the regulations in China, North America, and Europe are becoming more similar, {{but there is not}} a widely accepted <b>bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> that meets the requirements of all markets around the globe. A universal <b>bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> beam incorporating Plug-n-Play techniques was developed to meet and exceed all testing requirements and performance standards of each country. These Plug-n-Play techniques consist of adding energy absorbing attachments to the front of a base bumper beam. Simple beam analysis and FEA were the primary analysis tools {{in the development of the}} bumper beam system. Plug 2 ̆ 6 Play techniques were utilized to increase the performance of the universal bumper across all markets...|$|E

2500|$|A {{complete}} re-working of {{the front}} header and bumper highlighted the 1977 Grand Prix, which was the final year for the 1973-vintage bodyshell that was set {{to be replaced by}} a downsized GP for 1978. [...] The parking lamps were now positioned between the quad headlamps, and the previous year's 'waterfall' grille was replaced by a narrower one that extended into the lower portion of the bumper. [...] Behind the <b>bumper</b> were new <b>reinforcements</b> (mounting panels) made from aluminum rather than steel to reduce weight. [...] In back the taillights were simplified to eliminate the weighty pot metal bezels that created the horizontal stripe effect in 1976. [...] The same three models (J, LJ and SJ) were carried over with engine revisions. The base Model J got Pontiac's new [...] V8 as standard equipment, which was much too small and underpowered to propel a 4,000-pound car. Optional engines included a [...] V8 or [...] those two engines standard on the LJ and SJ models, respectively. [...] The original thinking on the 301 CID engine was that the weight savings from using a significantly lighter engine would cancel out the horsepower loss from the smaller displacement. [...] This turned out to be a major miscalculation and 301 equipped cars became much less desirable among Grand Prix enthusiasts and collectors in later years. [...] The 301 also had a knocking (pre-ignition) problem that was later determined to be caused by the shape of the combustion chamber.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} work {{summarizes the}} present state of car passive safety testing according to European methodologies. The main objective is to analysis a <b>bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> made of composite materials. The bumper is tested according to RCAR (Research Council for Automobile Repairs) methodology using numerical simulation. Individual proposed variants are compared with the existing steel construction which does not comply with manufacturers specifications. The PAM-Crash software is used for the simulation. The numerical model is using shell elements and the Ladev`eze model for the description of behaviour of composite materials. The methodology for the set-up of the numerical model in PAM-crash is firstly validated by comparison of experiment and analytical results...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project Reform was situated {{within the scope}} of research and technological development of steel and its utilisation. The central point of investigation was the determination of the load capability of preformed and subsequently welded parts made of high-strength steels. In order to cover a wide spectrum of automotive steel applications and with respect to the current development of modern high-strength steels, - two dual phase steels (HCT 780 X, HCT 980 X), - one trip steel (HCT 690 T), and - one complex phase steel (HDT 780 CD) were selected for the investigations at a sheet thickness of 1. 5 mm. For comparison, the micro-alloyed steel HX 340 LAD acts as the low-strength reference and the press hardening steel 22 MnB 5 (quenched) represents the maximum hardening state. For the experimental verification of the material behaviour for different forming conditions, all selected materials (except 22 MnB 5) were preformed by stretching, biaxial stretching, deep drawing and rolling with two different strain levels each. The main result of the Reform project was to demonstrate the 'modus operandi in principle' for the assessment of the residual formability under crash loading conditions of subsequently welded high-strength steel components. Based on the experimental results, a closed loop simulation of the chain 'cold-forming - welding - crash load' for the prediction of the crash behaviour of car body components was evaluated at U-channel profiles as well as at crash <b>bumper</b> <b>reinforcement</b> demonstrator parts. Guidelines for the consideration of the influences of cold forming and subsequently welding on the behaviour under static, cyclic and crash loads are also given...|$|E
