5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, they normally turn either up or down, but they turn <b>back</b> <b>if</b> they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E

5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who rides on Yoshi's <b>back.</b> <b>If</b> Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E

When he eventually wakes up, the two characters press on with the intention of turning <b>back</b> <b>if</b> they do not find people.|$|E

5|$|On 2 September 2013 on Raw, Cody Rhodes {{was fired}} from the WWE after failing to defeat the WWE Champion Randy Orton, a non-title match into which Rhodes was forced after he {{questioned}} the company's chief operating officer Triple H's authoritarian rule. Goldust returned the following week and similarly lost to Orton in a non-title match, thus failing to get his half-brother rehired. Eventually, their father Dusty Rhodes returned to Raw {{in an attempt to}} convince Stephanie McMahon to give his sons their jobs back. Instead, McMahon propositioned that Dusty could choose either one of his sons to receive a job, but not both. Dusty refused and Big Show knocked out Dusty as per McMahon's orders. In return, the Rhodes Brothers ambushed Triple H's henchmen the Shield on Raw. The next week, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon (later known as the Authority) offered the brothers their jobs <b>back</b> <b>if</b> they could defeat the Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns (the WWE Tag Team Champions) at Battleground. If they lost, they would never work in WWE again and Dusty would lose his job as a trainer at the WWE Performance Center. All three members of the Rhodes family were then attacked by the Shield, including United States Champion Dean Ambrose. On October 6 at Battleground, the Rhodes Brothers made their debut match as a tag team with Dusty backing them up at ringside. Ambrose attempted to interfere, and was taken out by Dusty. Soon after, Cody pinned Rollins in the non-title match to earn the brothers' jobs back. Various WWE wrestlers and agents came out to celebrate with the Rhodes family, including Arn Anderson, Dean Malenko, and Dave Finlay.|$|E

25|$|But other Egyptologists such as Dietrich Wildung see Khufu's {{order as}} an act of mercy: the {{prisoner}} would have received his life <b>back</b> <b>if</b> Dedi actually had performed his magical trick.

The ancient Egyptians were of the opinion that human life should not be misused for dark magic or similar evil things. Verena Lepper and Miriam Lichtheim suspect that a difficult-to-assess depiction of Khufu was exactly what the author had planned. He wanted to create a mysterious character.|$|E
