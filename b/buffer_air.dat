Due to their large canopies and ability to increase soil N and soil organic matter (SOM), to improve conditions for photosynthesis, and to <b>buffer</b> <b>air</b> and soil temperatures, A. auriculiformis and A. mangium have been widely planted in degraded areas to serve as nurse trees for understorey plants in South China (Yang et al. 2009). In Central Africa, A. auriculiformis and A. mangium have been planted as part of Project Makala ([URL] for fuel and wood energy e.g., in DR Congo and the Republic of the Congo.

A. auriculiformis is valued by farmers for both agricultural and wood-energy production in agroforestry or forestry systems in DR Congo (Kasongo et al. 2009; Shure et al. 2010; Dubliez et al. 2018), while A. mangium is mainly used to sustain eucalypt plantations to provide pulp, fuel and wood energy in the Congolese coastal plains of the Republic of the Congo (Shure et al. 2010; Bouillet et al. 2013; Epron et al. 2013; Tchichelle et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{wine grapes}} have {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} alternative crop in Kentucky after laws evolved encouraging private entrepreneurs to invest in vineyards and small farm wineries many decades after prohibition shut down the industry. Grapes grown in Kentucky are exposed to biotic and abiotic stresses that reduce crop yields and quality or kill grapevines. Damaging winter temperatures, spring frosts, and higher than optimal growing temperatures occur regularly. Despite these challenges, grape growing is a successful enterprise {{in many areas of}} the state. Climate is the major limiting factor for sustainable grape growing in Kentucky due to the severity of winters. Vineyard site selection greatly affects crop yields, quality, and sustainability. This bulletin is intended to provide a rating index to evaluate vineyard site suitability for use by Extension personnel and potential grape growers. Macroclimate Macroclimate refers to the prevailing climate of a large geographic region. In Kentucky, air temperatures fluctuate on a day-to-day basis because the land does not <b>buffer</b> <b>air</b> temperatures; the macroclimate is classified as continental. Overall, the quality of wine produced in any region comes primarily from the high quality of the grapes that are carefully vinified through long-held practices in the winery. The quality of the grape is the result of the combination of climate, site, geology, cultivar, and how these factors are managed together to produce the best crop.

40|$|A {{number of}} hormones, enzymes, {{antitumor}} agents, antibiotics and neurotransmitters are peptides. Nowadays, peptides {{are used as}} therapeutic agents against diverse disease areas such as neurological, endocrinological and hematological disorders. Therapeutic peptides pose a number of challenges for pharmaceutical scientists regarding their formulation and delivery. The sensitivity of many peptides to enzymatic breakdown and their poor ability to pass absorbing membranes typically results in a poor bioavailability following non-parenteral administration. Therefore, parenteral administration is {{the most commonly used}} route for systemic delivery of peptide drugs. However, therapeutic peptides are often unstable in aqueous solution limiting their shelf life. The lack of physical and chemical stability may lead to significant degradation during processing and storage of the (aqueous) formulations. Although a dry powder for reconstitution may overcome the lack of physical and chemical stability, from an economic point of view aqueous liquid formulations are preferred. In this presentation the main peptide stability problems in solution will be introduced following known strategies to inhibit peptide degradation, including recent research on improving peptide stability in liquid formulations. In conclusion, the most useful stabilization approaches are optimizing the pH and the type of <b>buffer.</b> Co-solvency, <b>air</b> exclusion, and viscosity enhancement can also be useful to reduce the degradation rate...|$|R

40|$|The {{awareness}} of the environmental impact of the building sector is increasing. Steel reinforced concrete is the most commonly used construction material, though with a high-embodied energy and carbon footprint. Large environmental gains may arise if an alternative to steel reinforced concrete is developed. In this context, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) materials are shown to be promising alternatives with advantages such as lower embodied energy and reduced environmental impact. Predictions suggest that UHPC composite elements for building envelopes could have other benefits such as an increased service life, optimised use of building area due to thinner elements and minimised maintenance due to the absence of reinforcement or use of non-corrosive reinforcing materials such as carbon fibres. In the framework of the H-HOUSE project funded by the European Commission, composite elements are developed.

The growth of this band is attributed to the increasing concentration of Ti(3 +) in these hibonites with decreasing oxygen fugacity. The blue hibonites in meteorites reflect equilibration under reducing conditions based on the intensity of 715 nm band, it is estimated that the hibonite in the Blue Angel inclusion indicates an oxygen fugacity four to five orders of magnitude more oxidizing than that expected in the early solar nebula. This may be due to formation in an anomalously oxidizing region of the nebula or to oxidation during cooling or later alteration. The orange hibonites in Allende reflect oxygen fugacities approximately ten or more orders of magnitude more oxidizing than the expected primitive nebula; this color probably indicates alteration of initially more reduced (blue?) hibonites.

With the emergence of microfluidics, there is an increased focus in addressing this need. While many platforms have been created to successfully complete an immunoassay, they still require bulky external equipment to manipulate fluid within the device. Using technology developed in the BioMiNT lab, we've created an immunoassay platform {{that is capable of}} on-chip pumping and mixing with lateral and vertical-cavity acoustic transducer (LCAT & VCAT respectively) coupled to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT). PDMS devices were fabricated, molded and bonded to glass slides adhered with antigen-spotted nitrocellulose pads. Once they are primed with blocking <b>buffer</b> to introduce <b>air</b> bubbles, the devices are actuated with a PZT to drive fluid pumping and mixing. The reagents are pumped into the device serially and after completion, the spotted antigens on the pad become a dark purple hue, indicating an antibody-antigen binding event. For quantitative results, the intensities are evaluated using computer software. Results show that the resulting spot intensities are comparable to an established, optimized microarray platform in one-fifth of the time. We also show that these results cannot be reproduced in a passive or flow-through microfluidic device, indicating that convective mixing is necessary for improved signal intensity. Using the LCAT/VCAT platform, an immunoassay can be performed in 20 minutes and with increased sensitivity. Future work will involve expanding the device to allow for an automated point-of-care platform...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 86 - 89). Power tower concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) plants are capable of producing extremely high temperatures, as {{they have the ability}} to oversize their solar field and achieve a greater concentration ratio. This theoretically allows power towers to use more efficient, higher temperature cycles including air Brayton and supercritical Rankine cycles, as well as experimental cycles such as the supercritical CO 2 cycle. As part of this thesis, the heat demand of each cycle, as well as the cycle diagram is examined for its suitability for use with CSP plants with thermal energy storage (TES). This will help develop criteria to determine if these cycles could be coupled with a higher temperature storage system. After the general cycle overview, this thesis describes the development, validation, and results of a TES system targeted for use with an air Brayton power cycle. This research analyzes the use of metal alloys as phase change storage materials and makes a case for their use with CSP plants. The numerical model developed here is intended to analyze the performance of high temperature systems suitable for thermodynamic cycles that do not have a commercially available storage system. The storage system essentially combines a heat exchanger and storage system to help realize potential savings over molten salt two-tank storage systems currently employed by industry. FLUENT computational fluid dynamics software is used to model the storage tank. After initial modeling of a hypereutectic binary alloy system it was discovered that FLUENT does not properly account for an individual material phase diagram. So, the thermal properties were altered in FLUENT in order to accurately reflect the thermal performance of the primary storage material chosen for study, AlSi. The model was also analyzed with pure metals and eutectic binary alloys in an effort to achieve stable air temperatures that could support an air Brayton turbine. These included both cascaded and non-cascaded geometries as well as reversed and non-reversed flow. The results of the cascaded models show that the heat exchanger/thermal storage concept is able to <b>buffer</b> the <b>air</b> entering the turbine, and produces relatively stable outlet air temperatures. It was found that using a single, pure metal as the storage material produced the highest, most stable air temperatures of the systems studied. With further optimization and research, this system could become a viable storage option for CSP plants in support of higher temperature cycles...|$|R
40|$|Thinning of forested {{lands and}} timber {{stands in the}} Pacific Northwest have taken place for centuries with a limited {{understanding}} of how the alterations may affect ecosystem functions. The goal {{of this study was to}} examine the soil climate and microbial activity on a seasonal timescale of thinning practices examined at different stages of succession. Two timber stands in Southwestern Oregon within the Grayback Creek Watershed were chosen because of identical forest management techniques separated by a 10 -year treatment interval (40 % variable density thinning). Field methods and equipment measured canopy coverage, soil moisture and temperature at 3 depths (5, 15, 30 cm), as well as snow and precipitation events. Laboratory analysis included particle size analysis (PSA), determination of total %C and %N, and CO 2 respiration. The least diurnal flux was at the deepest (30 cm) and the greatest temperature flux near the surface (5 cm) The covered stand showed a smaller magnitude of diurnal flux compared to the thinned stand (± 3 °C and ± 7 °C respectively). The driest time of the year was identical for both stands, however the thinned stand had twice as much (10. 8 %) water by volume at the 5 cm level compared to the covered stand (5. 2 %). Snowpack acted as a <b>buffer</b> from <b>air</b> temperature limiting the diurnal flux, and the greatest addition to soil water occurred when snow melted on both stands. The thinned stand reached 40 % water content (qs) throughout the profile after the first snowmelt, the covered stand rarely approached that level at any depth and time. CO 2 respiration, total carbon, and total nitrogen were significantly less on the thinned site compared to the covered site (12 v 45 ppm CO 2 at the surface, 2 v 5 % carbon, 7 v 20 % total nitrogen respectively). The lack of vegetation density (therefore decreased transpiration demands) on the thinned site may account for the differences between (1) water content differences at the peak of the dry season, (2) differences in the magnitude of diurnal flux, (3) and amount of precipitation required to reach qs. The CO 2 respiration differences can be attributed to the covered understory vegetation significantly adding more organic matter for microbe decomposition compared to the relatively bare ground on the thinned stand...|$|R
