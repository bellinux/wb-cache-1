40|$|In a {{composting}} greenhouse, {{heat and}} carbon dioxide are generated from a manure-based compost contained in a special chamber attached {{to one side of}} the greenhouse. In-vessel compost units or compost windrows—located in a nearby but separate location—are an alternative to attached compost chambers. In either case, capturing the heat of combustion and distributing it to the greenhouse itself is a design feature that needs attention. Options include wrapping the compost chamber with recirculating water pipes, or using an air-to-water heat exchanger. The heated water is then available for distribution through radiant heating. Since root-zone heating—hydronic tubing used with floor and bench heating—is an established practice in the greenhouse industry, the technology already exists to integrate this source of heat. As with any compost site, equipment access is a basic requirement to facilitate the movement of vehicles, tractors, and <b>bucket</b> <b>loaders.</b> Large-scale composting relies on efficient handling and mixing of raw feedstocks such as manures, straw, and green waste.

50|$|The Hebei tractor rampage was an {{apparently}} spontaneous mass murder on 1 August 2010 in which 17 {{people were killed}} in Yuanshi County, Hebei, China by an intoxicated man driving a <b>bucket</b> <b>loader.</b> At least 20 others were wounded.|$|E
50|$|A loader {{is a heavy}} {{equipment}} machine used in construction to move aside or load materials such as asphalt, demolition debris, dirt, snow, feed, gravel, logs, raw minerals, recycled material, rock, sand, woodchips, etc. into or onto another type of machinery (such as a dump truck, conveyor belt, feed-hopper, or railroad car). There are many types of loader, which, depending on design and application, are called by various names, including <b>bucket</b> <b>loader,</b> front loader, front-end loader, payloader, scoop, shovel, skip loader, wheel loader, or skid-steer.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, a {{grapple fork}} {{may be used}} to lift and {{transport}} large round bales. The grapple fork is a hydraulically driven implement attached {{to the end of a}} tractor's <b>bucket</b> <b>loader.</b> When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.|$|E
5000|$|Backhoe loaders {{are very}} common {{and can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} tasks: construction, small demolitions, light {{transportation}} of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes/excavation, landscaping, breaking asphalt, and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a stump grinder. Enhanced articulation of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the tiltrotator. Many backhoes feature quick coupler (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Some <b>loader</b> <b>buckets</b> have a retractable bottom or [...] "clamshell", enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom <b>loader</b> <b>buckets</b> are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.|$|R
50|$|Loaders {{are used}} mainly for loading {{materials}} into trucks, laying pipe, clearing rubble, and digging. A loader {{is not the}} most efficient machine for digging as it cannot dig very deep below the level of its wheels, like a backhoe can. The capacity of a <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> can be anywhere from 0.5 to 36 m3 depending upon the size of the machine and its application. The front <b>loader's</b> <b>bucket</b> capacity is generally much bigger than a bucket capacity of a backhoe loader.Unlike most bulldozers, most loaders are wheeled and not tracked, although track loaders are common. They are successful where sharp edged materials in construction debris would damage rubber wheels, or where the ground is soft and muddy. Wheels provide better mobility and speed and do not damage paved roads as much as tracks, but provide less traction.|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation studies solutions {{that meet the}} demands made for the propulsion motors of off-road working machines. It {{has been shown that}} in a hybridization process, without a mechanical gear, {{it is not possible to}} cover all the required torque-speed operating points set by the driving conditions of the traditional off-road working machine without largely overdimensioning the electrical components. The dissertation presents a novel solution, which combines a two-step planetary gearbox and a tooth-coil permanent magnet synchronous machine with embedded magnets to solve the problem. The important boundary conditions in terms of the electromagnetic design, mechanics, and cooling are discussed. The high design flexibility offered by permanent magnet synchronous machines is utilized to the full to find a feasible integrated design. Furthermore, the dissertation presents a solution for a gear change mechanism, which is located inside an integrated electric motor gear assembly. The designed and measured performance of the integrated system meets the needs of many off-road working machines. The prototype motor has about 40 kW power and could be adapted for instance on each wheel of a farming tractor, <b>bucket</b> <b>loader,</b> or harvester. The same technology could also be used in on-road applications, such as buses or trucks, intended for difficult terrains...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} on comminution of logging residues with a tub grinder {{was carried out}} in order to calculate the productivity and procurement cost of wood chips. At the investigated site, the tub grinder had a hammer mill crusher {{at the bottom of the}} tub, and a grapple loader and a <b>bucket</b> <b>loader</b> worked as auxiliary machines for the grinder. As a result, the productivity of the tub grinder was 60. 0 loose m 3 /PMH 0, and the total comminuting cost was calculated as 5. 637 US$/m 3, indicating that the comminuting cost of a large-sized crusher was lower than that of a small-sized chipper. The percentage of the cost of loaders, that of carrying in, installing, and carrying out the machines, and that of constructing a landing was 53 % of the total comminuting cost. When a truck with the capacity of 40 m 3 transported wood chips three times a day, the costs of comminution and transportation were 71. 2 US$/t (DM 1), which is almost on a par with those of European countries in which the energy utilization of logging residues is making steady progress. As a result of the discussion about the balance between the processing capacity of the tub grinder and that of other machines, it seemed reasonable for Japanese forestry to consider the use of one tub grinder at several logging sites...|$|E

40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi determinar as propriedades físicas e o intervalo hídrico ótimo (IHO) de um Argissolo, sob diferentes estados de compactação, cultivado com feijoeiro. Foram utilizados três experimentos, cujos tratamentos constituíram-se de: plantio direto (PD); plantio direto compactado pelo tráfego de quatro passadas de máquina (PDc); e escarificação em área anteriormente sob plantio direto (Esc). Avaliaram-se a densidade, a porosidade, a umidade volumétrica e a resistência à penetração do solo. Nas plantas, avaliaram-se a distribuição do sistema radicular e a produtividade. A densidade crítica obtida pelo IHO foi de 1, 75 Mg m- 3. No PDc a densidade do solo foi {{superior}} à crítica na maioria das camadas, enquanto o PD e Esc apresentaram densidade acima da crítica em poucas camadas. A umidade do solo ficou fora dos limites do IHO na maior parte do ciclo da cultura. A resistência à penetração ficou acima da crítica no PDc em todas as avaliações. O sistema radicular concentrou-se superficialmente no PDc com melhor distribuição e desenvolvimento no PD e Esc. Nos três experimentos, a produtividade do Esc foi de 2 a 12 % menor, e a do PDc foi de 30 a 62 % menor do que no PD. A escarificação não foi necessária para as condições físicas do PD. In this work, soil {{properties and}} least limiting water range (LLWR) were determined for an Alfisol under three states of compaction with black beans crop. Three experiments were used, comprising the following treatments: 12 years of no-tillage - NT; 12 years, of no-tillage compacted by four passes of a <b>bucket</b> <b>loader</b> - NTc; and chiseling of soil previously under no-tillage for 12 years - Ch. Throughout the plant cycle, bulk density, total porosity, volumetric water content, air filled porosity and soil resistance to penetration were evaluated. Plant root distribution and yield were also evaluated. The critical bulk density obtained by LLWR was 1. 75 Mg m- 3. In the NTc {{the bulk density}} was higher than critical value for most soil layers, whereas the PD and Ch presented higher value in a few layers. Soil water content was out of LLWR range for most part of plant cycle. Soil resistance to penetration in the NTc was higher than critical value in all evaluated dates, while in roots concentrated superficially. For the three experiments, higher compaction levels (NTc) induced yield reduction from 30 to 62 % and soil chiseling (Ch) induced yield reduction from 2 to 12 % compared to crops under no-tillage (PD). Compaction alleviation by chiseling was not necessary to improve crop yield for soil physical conditions of this area...|$|E
50|$|Because digging {{while on}} tires {{intrinsically}} causes {{the machine to}} rock, and the swinging weight of the backhoe could cause the vehicle to tip, most backhoe loaders use hydraulic outriggers or stabilizers at the rear when digging and lower the <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> for additional stability. This means that the bucket must be raised and the outriggers retracted when the vehicle needs to change positions, reducing efficiency. For this reason many companies offer miniature tracked excavators, which sacrifice the loader function and ability to be driven from site to site, for increased digging efficiency.|$|R

50|$|While the {{front-end}} loaders on CUT size tractors {{are capable}} of many tasks, given their relatively small size and low capacities when compared to commercial loaders, the compact loaders can be made more useful with some simple options. A toothbar is commonly added to {{the front edge of}} a <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> to aid with digging. Some loaders are equipped with a quick coupler, otherwise known as a quick attach (QA) system. The QA system allows the bucket to be removed easily and other tools to be added in its place. Common additions include a set of pallet forks for lifting pallets of goods or a bale spear for lifting hay bales.|$|R

The simulation results obtained show that the type- 2 fuzzy controller is capable of minimizing the position error of a front end <b>loader’s</b> <b>bucket</b> under load variations. This kind of hydraulic system is highly nonlinear due to factors such as leakage and friction. There are uncertainties in this system due to temperature dependence of bulk modulus and fluid viscosity. Such uncertainties together with the load variations cause chattering of the bucket position. Simulation results show for positional error of boom cylinder while varying the load in the bucket and also 50 to 150 % of variation in the nominal value of bulk modulus...|$|R
30|$|The cost of loading {{is related}} to the {{material}} movement in each load. Although the <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> has a certain volume capacity, {{it is not possible to}} utilize all the capacity in a real operation because of the space between the particles. There is a fill factor of the bucket volume depending on particle size distribution. The fill factor is simply the ratio of the volume of loaded material to the capacity of the bucket. If the particle size increases, the space between the particles increases and the fill factor decreases. Decreasing amount of the material in each load means a decrease in the loading efficiency. On the other hand, if the rock is well fragmented, the fill factor and the loading efficiency will be high. The relation between the fill factor and the mean fragmentation size can be found by the regression analysis.|$|R

The result shows that there is an optimal shovel depth when loader shovelling original raw soil, while the operation efficiency of loader is the highest, and there is a best operation depth range of loader shovel, in which work efficiency of loader changes a little, this will bring great convenience to the operation for the driver.  </p...|$|R

As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a fork grapple and a <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> are equipped as a working module.

General Safety • Operators should be trained by a knowledgeable person prior to operating a skid steer loader. This should include reading/understanding the owner’s manual, operational safety, and demonstration of safe operation under anticipated conditions (e. g., terrain, load, etc.). • Never by-pass or disable the safety devices. • Before operating, clear the work area of by-standers and acquaint yourself with surrounding hazards (e. g., electrical lines, low clearance, uneven terrain, ramp edges, etc.). • Consult EHS to determine if hearing protective devices are warranted while operating the equipment...|$|R
40|$|Lameness and {{subacute}} ruminal acidosis (SARA) both {{appear to}} be very prevalent throughout the US dairy industry. Reduced ruminal efficiency, liver and lung abscesses, and laminitis are all thought to be re-lated to SARA. Both the nutritionist and dairy manag-ers {{are responsible for the}} delivery and consumption of a ration that is likely to produce a ruminally healthy pH. Nutritionists should consider the expected amount of physically effective neutral detergent fiber provided by ration ingredients, along with their expected rumi-nal fermentabilities and resultant microbial acid pro-duction. Environmental conditions, such as heat stress, overcrowding, and uncomfortable stalls, which may al-ter feed intake patterns and animal behavior, should also be considered in ration formulation. Additional amounts of physically effective neutral detergent fiber, and/or a reduction in ruminal nonstructural carbohy-drate availability, may be warranted during times of increased animal stress. Higher levels of intake may also predispose the rumen to SARA, since salivary buffer secretion may not adequately compensate for additional acid production. Forage drymatter should be determined twice weekly, or more frequently if results vary by more than 5 percent of the dry matter value. Ration variability can be further reduced by premixing individual forages, or at least attempting to make each <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> of feed a uniform mix obtained from the entire height or face of the bunker silo. Ingredient se-quencing and mixing time should be standardized on a given dairy.

40|$|Stereopsis or Stereo {{vision is}} a {{technique}} that has been extensively used in computer vision these days helps to percept the 3 D structure and distance of a scene from two images taken at different viewpoints, precisely {{the same way a}} human being visualizes anything using both eyes. The research involves object matching by extracting features from images and includes some preliminary tasks like camera calibration, correspondence and reconstruction of images taken by a stereo vision unit and 3 D construction of an object. The main goal of this research work is to estimate the position and the orientation of a front <b>loader</b> <b>bucket</b> of an autonomous mobile robot configured in a work machine name 'Avant', which consists a stereo vision unit and several other sensors and is designed for outdoor operations like excavation. Several image features finding algorithms, including the most prominent two, SIFT and SURF has been considered for the image matching and object recognition. Both algorithms find interest points in an image in different ways which apparently accelerates the feature extraction procedure, but still the time requires for matching in both cases is left as an important issue to be resolved. As the machine requires to do some loading and unloading tasks, dust and other particles could be a major obstacle for recognizing the bucket at workspace, also it has been observed that the hydraulic arm and other equipment comes inside the FOV of the cameras which also makes the task much challenging. The concept of using markers has been considered as a solution to these problems. Moreover, the outdoor environment is very different from indoor environment and object matching is far more challenging due to some factors like light, shadows, environment, etc. that change the features inside a scene very rapidly.

40|$|Methods for {{estimating}} {{productivity and}} costs, and dependent equipment selection process, {{have needed to}} be increasingly reliable. Estimated productivity and costs must be {{as accurate as possible}} in reflecting actual productivity and costs experienced by mining operations to accommodate the long-term trend for diminishing commodity prices, For loading and hauling equipment operating in open pit mines, some of the interrelated estimating criteria have been investigated for better understanding; and, consequently, more reliable estimates of production and costs, also more effective equipment selection process. Analysis recognizes many of the interrelated criteria as random variables that can most effectively be reviewed, analyzed and compared in terms of statistical mathematical parameters. Emphasized throughout is the need for management of the cyclical loading and hauling system using conventional shovels/excavators/loaders and mining trucks to sustain an acceptable “rhythm” for best practice productivity and most-competitive unit-production costs. Outcomes of the research include an understanding that variability of attributes needs to be contained within acceptable limits. Attributes investigated include truck payloads, <b>bucket</b> loads, <b>loader</b> cycle time, truck loading time and truck cycle time. Selection of “ultra-class” mining trucks (≥ 290 -tonne payload) and suitable loading equipment is for specialist mining applications only. Where local operating environment and cost factors favourably supplement diminishing cost-benefits of truck scale, ultra-class trucks may be justified. Bigger is not always better – only where bigger can be shown to be better by reasons in addition to the modest cost benefits of ultra-class equipment. Truck over-loading may, to a moderate degree, increase productivity, but only at increased unit cost. From a unit-cost perspective it is better to under-load than overload mining trucks. Where unit production cost is more important than absolute productivity, under-trucking is favoured compared with over-trucking loading equipment. Bunching of mining trucks manifests as a queuing effect – a loss of effective truck hours. To offset the queuing effect, required productivity needs to be adjusted to anticipate “bunching inefficiency”. The “basic number of trucks” delivered by deterministic estimating must provide for bunching inefficiency before application of simulation applications or stochastic analysis is used to determine the necessary number of trucks in the fleet. In difficult digging conditions {{it is more important to}} retain truck operating rhythm than to focus on achieving target payload by indiscriminately adding loader passes. Where trucks are waiting to load, operational tempo should be restored by sacrificing one or more passes. Trucks should preferably be loaded by not more than the nominal (modal) number plus one pass. The research has: • Identified and investigated attributes that affect the dispersion of truck payloads, bucket loads, bucket-cycle time, loading time and truck-cycle time. • The outcomes of the research indicate a need to correlate drilling and blasting quality control and truck payload dispersion. Further research can be expected to determine the interrelationship between accuracy of drilling and blasting attributes including accuracy of hole location and direction. • Preliminary investigations indicate a relationship between drill-and-blast attributes through blasting quality control to bucket design, dimensions and shape; also discharge characteristics that affect bucket cycle time that needs further research...|$|R
40|$|Tele-remote {{operation}} of mobile earth-moving machines in underground mines supported byoperator assistance functions is attractive {{for safety and}} productivity reasons. This way, operatorscan avoid hazardous underground environments with poor air quality and the productivitycan, in principle, be improved by saving {{the time required to}} commute drivers to and fromthe operational areas. The infrastructure needed to do tele-remote control in the form of highcapacitywireless IP networks is nowadays being deployed in underground mines. In mineswith sufficiently high ceilings, wheel loaders are used in short loading cycles to load blastedrock onto dump trucks. Bucket filling on remote control is less efficient than manual operationdue to the loss of sensory perception resulting from not being in the actual environment. Automatic bucket filling algorithms have been developed earlier but, due to the complexity ofbucket-environment interactions, such algorithms have not produced satisfactory results and arenot commercially available. If tele-remote operation is enabled, it {{can also be used to}} rescuefuture autonomous machines, when they malfunction. This thesis presents the key challengesin automation and tele-remote {{operation of}} earth-moving machines, surveys the literature andavailable technologies to address these challenges. The key contributions of this thesis are highlightingimportant knowledge gaps based on a survey in the field of automation of earth-movingmachines and proposing a machine learning based framework for automatic <b>bucket</b> filling forfront-end <b>loaders.</b> The proposed machine learning based approach to automatic bucket fillinguses linear regression and classification models of lift and tilt actions, which are fitted to thebehavior of an expert driver filling the bucket with gravel pile. The models of operator behaviorfrom the recorded data reveals relationships between sensor data and operator actionsand shows that a learning based approach is feasible. A case study has been done on the useof wheel-loaders in underground mining presenting the use case of assisted tele-remote controlbased on audio-video and sensor feedback. A good communication setup, that considers requirementsof real-time video transmission, is important for tele-remote control. Furthermore,a simulation study evaluates two transport layer protocols with respect to video quality for teleremotecontrol over wireless IEEE 802. 11 networks.

40|$|A {{serial bus}} called ISOBUS based on CAN is {{becoming}} more and more common in the agriculture and forestry industry. The bus specifies communication between tractors and their implements. Earlier each implement had its own monitor to show its functionalities, which could lead to a lot of monitors in the tractor cabin. ISOBUS requires only one monitor, called VT (Virtual Terminal), regardless of the manufacturer of the implement. The aim of this thesis is to implement ISOBUS at Ålö’s ECU (Electronic Control Unit) so that it can present its functionalities to VT. The aim is to integrate a purchased third party commercial ISOBUS library on ECU. The amount of work to achieve ISOBUS compatibility without third party library shall be estimated, and if there is time the task shall also be carried out. An object pool based on Ålö’s existing interface shall be created, where the object pool is the graphical interface shown at VT. A demonstrator of ISOBUS VT shall be done. To implement the third party library hardware functions towards the CAN-bus was required. The hardware functions include receiving messages from a buffer and send messages directly on the bus. For the library to be alive and running it had to be initialized and a periodic call to the library had to be done. The result is that the library was implemented on ECU and data flows between ECU and VT. To achieve ISOBUS compatibility without third party library the existing protocol on Ålö’s ECU has to be removed by a base support for ISOBUS. Then a last part must be written to achieve full compatibility. Commands that the ISOBUS standard defines between ECU and VT has to be written, and callback functions that is called when VT sends commands to ECU. Management of answers and errors also have to be implemented. ISOBUS compatibility without third party library wasn’t carried out, but the amount of work was estimated and a general description of what has to be done is written. The conclusion is that it requires a lot of work and scrutiny of the standard. The advantage is that you get an insight into how the system works and the ability to influence functionalities yourself. The object pool design was based on Ålö’s existing interface. Menu systems was implemented, and a linear bar graph and a meter have the possibilities to show height and angle of the tractor <b>loader</b> <b>bucket.</b> Different ways to show a menu system has been discussed. The result is an object pool with the basic functions for Ålö’s interface, the demonstrator presents these functionalities. The interface for VT can be made quite similar to Ålö’s existing interface, with some differences such as fonts, image quality and menu functions. En seriell buss kallad ISOBUS baserat på CAN blir allt vanligare inom jordbruk- och skogsindustrin. Bussen reglerar hur kommunikationen mellan traktorer och redskap fungerar. Tidigare har varje redskap haft en egen monitor för att se över redskapets funktioner, vilket innebär att det kan bli många skärmar i traktorhytten. Med ISOBUS behövs bara en monitor, så kallad VT (Virtuell Terminal), oavsett tillverkare av redskapet. Syftet med detta examensarbete är att implementera ISOBUS på Ålö:s ECU (Electronic Control Unit) för att denna ska kunna presentera sina funktioner på VT. Målet är att integrera ett inköpt tredjeparts kommersiellt ISOBUS bibliotek på ECU. Arbetet för att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbiblioteket skall uppskattas, och om tid finns utföras. En objektpool baserat på Ålös existerande gränssnitt ska skapas, där objektpoolen är det grafiska interface som visas på VT. En demonstrator av ISOBUS VT skall sättas upp. För att implementera tredjepartsbiblioteket krävde biblioteket hårdvarufunktioner mot CANbussen. Hårdvarufunktionerna tar bland annat emot meddelanden från en buffert och skickar ut meddelanden direkt på bussen. För att biblioteket skulle vara igång och köra måste det initieras och ett periodiskt anrop göras till biblioteket. Resultatet är att biblioteket implementerades på ECU och att det flödar trafik mellan ECU och VT. För att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbibliotek måste det existerande protokollet på Ålös ECU bytas ut med ett grundstöd för ISOBUS. Sedan måste en egen del skrivas för att uppnå full kompatibilitet. Här behöver bland annat kommandon som ISOBUS standarden definierar mellan ECU och VT skrivas, samt callbackfunktioner som anropas då VT skickar kommando till ECU. Hantering av svar och felmeddelanden vid kommunikation måste också implementeras. Att uppnå ISOBUS kompatibilitet utan tredjepartsbibliotek hann inte utföras, däremot uppskattades arbetet och en översiktlig beskrivning om vad som behöver utföras gjordes. Slutsatsen är att det kräver väldigt mycket arbete och finläsning av standarden. Fördelen är att man får en inblick i hur systemet fungerar och möjligheten att påverka funktionaliteter själv. Objektpoolen utformades efter hur Ålös existerande gränssnitt ser ut. Menysystem implementerades, samt att streckdiagram och en cirkulär mätare har möjligheten att visa höjd och vinkel på traktorskopan. Olika sätt för att visa ett menysystem har diskuterats. Resultatet är en objektpool med grundläggande funktioner för Ålös gränssnitt, demonstratorn visar dessa funktionaliteter. Resultatet visar på att det går att få gränssnittet för VT ganska likt Ålös existerande, med vissa skillnader som typsnitt, bildkvalité och menyfunktioner...|$|R
40|$|Initiatives and collaborations among heavy {{construction}} equipment manufacturing companies and training technology firms {{to develop and}} employ simulators for varied training purposes are becoming commonplace. However, human factors research on simulator training for operators of construction equipment is still sparse. For simulator training to be effective, {{it is necessary to}} understand how skills are learned using the simulator, how those skills are transferred to other tasks, devices, and real scenarios, and how well skills are retained after simulator training. ^ This research is on skill development, specifically as it applies to operator training for two specific types of {{heavy construction}} equipment: excavator and wheel loader. It aims at decomposing the complexity of equipment operation and distinguishing the skills to be acquired for each machine. It consists of five studies, three conducted with students at Purdue and two with expert operators at John Deere. ^ Study 1 investigated whether operation of a simulated hydraulic excavator is influenced by an intervening task performed between initial practice on the excavator and a subsequent retention test using a controls familiarization task (which involves just knowing the control functions). Two intervening tasks were inserted: practicing on a simulated loader, and reading an unrelated text intended to distract the participants. Performance on the simulator was compared against that of a group of participants who practiced on the simulated excavator throughout. The results showed no performance cost attributable to inserting practice on the simulated loader while learning the controls on the simulated excavator. The learning trends, however, prompted {{the question of whether the}} same results would bear true for learning a more complex perceptual-motor task. ^ Study 2 was intended to verify whether the alternating equipment sequence yields the same outcome for a more complex truck loading task that involves multiple operations. Besides the two experimental groups (control and loader groups) in Study 1, an additional group which was given practice on the two machines (but with a different practice schedule from the original loader group) was added to address the question of whether the duration of practice on an alternative machine affects performance on the previously learned machine. The number of sessions was also increased, from three to five, to examine the possible influence when participants continue to switch between the machines. Those participants who engaged in intervening practice on the simulated loader showed a smaller performance improvement on learning the truck loading task on the simulated excavator than did the control group who practiced on the simulated excavator for all five sessions. This outcome confirms that the controls familiarization tasks on both machines studied in the preliminary study may have been too simple for the full effects of switching between the machines to be evident. This finding of continued skill improvement upon return to the previously practiced machine inspires consideration of concurrent simulator-based training rather than the practice of learning to operate only one machine at a time. ^ Study 3 analyzed skill transfer using hierarchical task analysis (HTA) to investigate the degree of overlap in specific task components by studying the similarity and dissimilarity of the truck loading task performed in Study 2 on excavator and wheel loader simulators. After the modification and verification by operators of the initial HTAs, the finalized HTAs revealed that the lack of positive transfer found in performing the truck loading task alternately with the excavator and loader was likely due to the differences between loader and excavator in terms of the controls, physical constraints, and the explicit goals and subgoals of the task. In addition, comparing the number of levels of subgoals of HTAs did not evidence any level-of-difficulty differences between tasks. ^ Studies 4 and 5 investigated whether there is a cost when switching between different types of training modules within the same machine. Study 4 was conducted with experienced operators, who provided information on how the four selected tasks on the loader should be performed and classified the perceived difficulty level of each. Verbal protocol analysis was used to decompose the tasks of the four training modules on the loader simulator: 1) Simple Bucket Loading (B 1), Filling a Trench (B 2), Truck Loading (B 3), and Fork Lifting (F). A nine phase, systematic method for deriving the HTAs from the think-aloud protocols was also developed in this study, which successfully generated the four HTAs. The findings show that 1) the HTA of the Fork Lifting module is significantly different than those of the three bucket loading tasks, and 2) although all three bucket loading tasks shared a similar mechanism, the operators ranked B 1 as the easiest, followed by B 2 and then B 3 due to the corresponding accessibility of the dump targets, and fork lifting was ranked as the most difficult task. The results were used to justify the hypotheses for Study 5. ^ Study 5 sought to verify whether an alternating practice sequence within the same machine, i. e. training with an alternative tool (a wide fork) and returning to the original learned tool (a <b>bucket)</b> on a <b>loader</b> simulator, yields better skill transfer and retention (after a one-week interval). Four groups of undergraduate students were tested. Two groups were given two tasks involving bucket loading to practice in the first two sessions, whereas the other two groups were given a bucket loading task in the first session and the fork lifting task in the second session. The transfer and retention tasks both involved a bucket loading task that had not been performed in Sessions 1 and 2. The results showed that the groups who were assigned to practice on two tasks involving the manipulation of buckets performed better in the skill transfer test when the new task was introduced that also involved manipulation of the bucket. The results support the specificity of training principle (for which the practice conditions match the test conditions and thus facilitate retention or transfer) but not the progressive difficulty training principle (for which difficulty impedes performance in the learning stage but facilitates retention). It is suggested that, when training perceptual-motor tasks, tasks practiced during the learning phase should match the transfer task. Manipulation of task difficulty may play a role only if the tasks share task-relevant cognitive processes and mental models. ^ The overall findings of this research provide: 1) better understanding of skill development for the operation of construction equipment, and 2) evidence as to how the trainees can better utilize their time when training on a single machine and concurrently on multiple machines. The findings add to the general body of knowledge on perceptual-motor skill acquisition and to that on training in a specific domain via a specific technology. The findings are expected to generalize to heavy equipment training in related domains, such as forestry and mining, and domains requiring instrument handling skills and robotic arms, such as surgery and orbital space vessel external operations. ...|$|R
