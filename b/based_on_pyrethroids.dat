40|$|After {{its first}} {{introduction}} in the 1980 ’s the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), has spread throughout Southern Europe. Ae. albopictus {{is considered an}} epidemiologically important vector for the transmission of many viral pathogens such as the yellow fever virus, dengue fever and Chikungunya fever, {{as well as several}} filarial nematodes such as Dirofilaria immitis or D. repens. It is therefore crucial to develop measures to reduce the risks of disease transmission by controlling the vector populations. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the efficacy of two application techniques (mist vs. stretcher sprayer) and two insecticides (Etox <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the nonester <b>pyrethroid</b> Etofenprox vs. Microsin <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>pyrethroid</b> type II Cypermetrin) in controlling adult tiger mosquito populations in highly populated areas. To test the effect of the two treatments pre- and post-treatment human landing rate counts were conducted for two years. After one day from the treatment we observed a 100 % population decrease in mosquito abundance with both application meth-ods and both insecticides. However, seven and 14 days after the application the stretcher sprayer showed larger population reductions than the mist sprayer. No effect of insecticid...|$|R

40|$|The {{elimination}} of Triatoma infestans, the main Chagas disease vector in the Gran Chaco region, remains elusive. We implemented an intensified control strategy <b>based</b> <b>on</b> full-coverage <b>pyrethroid</b> spraying, followed by frequent vector surveillance and immediate selective insecticide treatment of detected foci in a well-defined rural area in northeastern Argentina with moderate pyrethroid resistance. We assessed long-term impacts, and identified factors and procedures affecting spray effectiveness. After initial control interventions, timed-manual searches were performed by skilled personnel in 4, 053 sites of 353 - 411 houses inspected every 4 - 7 months over a 35 -month period. Residual insecticide spraying was less effective than expected throughout the three-year period, {{mainly because of}} the occurrence of moderate pyrethroid resistance and the limited effectiveness of selective treatment of infested sites only. After initial interventions, peridomestic infestation prevalence always exceeded domestic infestation, and timed-manual searches consistently outperformed householders' bug detection, except in domiciles. Most of the infestations occurred in houses infested at baseline, and were restricted to four main ecotopes. Houses with an early persistent infestation were spatially aggregated up to a distance of 2. 5 km. An Akaike-based multi-model inference approach showed that new site-level infestations increased substantially with the local availability of appropriate refugia for triatomine bugs, and with proximity to the nearest site found infested at one or two preceding surveys. Current vector control procedures have limited effectiveness in the Gran Chaco. Selective insecticide sprays must include all sites within the infested house compound. The suppression of T. infestans in rural areas with moderate pyrethroid resistance requires increased efforts and appropriate management actions. In addition to careful, systematic insecticide applications, housing improvement and development policies that improve material conditions of rural villagers and reduce habitat suitability for bugs will contribute substantially to sustainable vector and disease control in the Gran Chaco...|$|R
40|$|Background Culicoides biting midges are {{biological}} vectors of internationally important arboviruses {{of livestock}} and equines. Insecticides are often employed against Culicoides {{as a part}} of vector control measures, but systematic assessments of their efficacy have rarely been attempted. The objective of the present study is to determine baseline susceptibility of multiple Culicoides vector species and populations in Europe and Africa to the most commonly used insecticide active ingredients. Six active ingredients are tested: three that are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> synthetic <b>pyrethroids</b> (alpha-cypermethrin, deltamethrin and permethrin) and three on organophosphates (phoxim, diazinon and chlorpyrifos-methyl). Methods Susceptibility tests were conducted on 29, 064 field-collected individuals of Culicoides obsoletus Meigen, Culicoides imicola Kieffer and a laboratory-reared Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen strain using a modified World Health Organization assay. Populations of Culicoides were tested from seven locations in four different countries (France, Spain, Senegal and South Africa) and at least four concentrations of laboratory grade active ingredients were assessed for each population. Results The study revealed that insecticide susceptibility varied at both a species and population level, but that broad conclusions could be drawn regarding the efficacy of active ingredients. Synthetic pyrethroid insecticides were found to inflict greater mortality than organophosphate active ingredients and the colony strain of C. nubeculosus was significantly more susceptible than field populations. Among the synthetic pyrethroids, deltamethrin was found to be the most toxic active ingredient for all species and populations. Conclusions The data presented represent the first parallel and systematic assessment of Culicoides insecticide susceptibility across several countries. As such, they are an important baseline reference to monitor the susceptibility status of Culicoides to current insecticides and also to assess the toxicity of new active ingredients with practical implications for vector control strategies.

MethodsLarvae and pupae of An. gambiae s. l. mosquitoes were collected from the breeding sites in Littoral, Zou, Borgou and Alibori provinces. CDC susceptibility tests were conducted on unfed females mosquitoes aged 2 - 5 d old. An. gambiae mosquitoes were identified to species using PCR techniques. Molecular assays were also carried out to identify kdr mutations in individual mosquitoes. ResultsThe results showed that An. gambiae Malanville and Suru-lere populations were resistant to deltamethrin. Regarding An. gambiae Parakou and Bohicon populations, they were resistant to permethrin. PCR revealed 100 % of mosquitoes tested were An. gambiae s. s. The L 1014 F kdr mutation was found in An. gambiae s. s. Malanville and Parakou at various allelic frequencies.

40|$|The {{toxicity}} of the pyrethroid insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin to freshwater invertebrates {{has been investigated}} using data from short-term laboratory toxicity tests and in situ bioassays and population-level effects in field microcosms. In laboratory tests, patterns of toxicity were consistent with previous data <b>on</b> <b>pyrethroids.</b> The midge Chaoborus obscuripes was most sensitive (48 - and 96 -h EC 50 = 2. 8 ng/L). Other insect larvae (Hemiptera, Ephemeroptera) and macrocrustacea (Amphipoda, Isopoda) were also relatively sensitive, with 48 - and 96 -h EC 50 values between 10 and 100 ng/L. Generally, microcrustacea (Cladocera, Copepoda) and larvae of certain insect groups (Odonata and Chironomidae) were less sensitive, with 48 -h EC 50 values higher than 100 ng/L. Mollusca and Plathelminthes were insensitive and were unaffected at concentrations at and above the water solubility (5 µg/L). Generally, the EC 50 values <b>based</b> <b>on</b> initial population responses in field enclosures were similar to values derived from laboratory tests with the same taxa. Also, the corresponding fifth and tenth percentile hazard concentrations (HC 5 and HC 10) were similar (laboratory HC 5 = 2. 7 ng/L and field HC 5 = 4. 1 ng/L; laboratory and field HC 10 = 5. 1 ng/L), at least when <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the same sensitive taxonomic groups (insects and crustaceans) and when a similar concentration range was taken into account. In the three field enclosure experiments and at a treatment level of 10 ng/L, consistent effects were observed for only one population (Chaoborus obscuripes), with recovery taking place within 3 to 6 weeks. The laboratory HC 5 (2. 7 ng/L) and HC 10 (5. 1 ng/L) <b>based</b> <b>on</b> acute EC 50 values of all aquatic arthropod taxa were both lower than this 10 ng/L, a concentration that might represent the regulatory acceptable concentration. The HC 5 and HC 10 values in this study in The Netherlands (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> static laboratory tests with freshwater arthropods) were {{very similar to those}} derived from a previous study in the United Kingdom (1. 4 and 3. 3 ng/L). This suggests that for pesticides like lambda-cyhalothrin, HC 5 values <b>based</b> <b>on</b> static laboratory tests may provide a conservative estimate of the potential for community-level effects under field conditions.

40|$|Insecticide-treated {{nets and}} indoor {{residual}} spray programs for malaria control are entirely dependent <b>on</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> insecticides. The ubiquitous exposure of Anopheles mosquitoes to this chemistry has selected for resistance {{in a number}} of populations. This threatens the sustainability of our most effective interventions but no operationally practicable way of resolving the problem currently exists. One innovative solution involves the co-application of a powerful chemosterilant (pyriproxyfen or PPF) to bed nets that are usually treated only with pyrethroids. Resistant mosquitoes that are unaffected by the pyrethroid component of a PPF/pyrethroid co-treatment remain vulnerable to PPF. There is a differential impact of PPF on pyrethroid-resistant and susceptible mosquitoes that is modulated by the mosquito’s behavioural response at co-treated surfaces. This imposes a specific fitness cost on pyrethroid-resistant phenotypes and can reverse selection. The concept is demonstrated using a mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called neonicotinoids, and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. Neonicotinoids (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The neonicotinoids are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling Cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three neonicotinoids (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or neonicotinoids. Pesticides are among the Danish apiculturist not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the neonicotinoids on honey bees. When treatment with neonicotinoids in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (<b>based</b> <b>on</b> calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the neonicotinoids seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of neonicotinoids even with three applications. Findings of resistance in Cabbage stem flea beetle in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of Cabbage stem flea beetle has been <b>based</b> <b>on</b> neonicotinoids and <b>pyrethroids,</b> which have different modes of action in Cabbage stem flea beetle. Resistance among Cabbage stem flea beetle towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL).

40|$|Abstract Background Anopheles funestus {{is a major}} malaria vector in {{southern}} Africa. Vector control relies {{on the use of}} insecticide chemicals to significantly reduce the number of malaria vectors by targeting that portion of the female population that takes blood meals and subsequently rests indoors. It has been suggested that the intake of a blood meal may assist female mosquitoes to tolerate higher doses of insecticide through vigour tolerance. It is hypothesized that during the process of blood digestion, detoxification mechanisms required for the neutralizing of harmful components in the blood meal may also confer an increased ability to tolerate insecticide intoxication through increased enzyme regulation. Methods Bottle bioassays using a range of concentrations of the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin were performed <b>on</b> <b>pyrethroid</b> susceptible and resistant laboratory strains of An. funestus in order to detect differences in insecticide susceptibility following a single blood meal. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> these results, a discriminating dosage was identified (double the lowest dosage that resulted in 100 % mortality of the susceptible strain). Blood-fed and unfed females drawn from the resistant strain of An. funestus were then assayed against this discriminating dose, and the percentage mortality for each sample was scored and compared. Results In the insecticide dose response assays neither the fully susceptible nor the resistant strain of An. funestus showed any significant difference in insecticide susceptibility following a blood meal, regardless of the stage of blood meal digestion. A significant increase in the level of resistance was however detected in the resistant An. funestus strain following a single blood meal, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> exposure to a discriminating dose of permethrin. Conclusion The fully susceptible An. funestus strain did not show any significant alteration in susceptibility to insecticide following a blood meal suggesting that vigour tolerance through increased body mass (and increased dilution of internalized insecticide) does not {{play a significant role in}} tolerance to insecticide intoxication. The increase in insecticide tolerance in the pyrethroid resistant strain of An. funestus following a blood meal suggests that insecticide detoxification mechanisms involved in insecticide resistance are stimulated by the presence of a blood meal prior to insecticide exposure, leading to enhanced expression of the resistance phenotype. This finding may be significant in terms of the methods used to control indoor resting populations of An. funestus if the mass killing effect of insecticide application proves increasingly inadequate against blood-feeding females already carrying the insecticide resistance phenotype. </p...|$|R
40|$|Insecticide {{resistance}} has {{the potential}} to compromise the enormous effort put into the control of dengue and malaria vector populations. It is therefore important to quantify the amount of selection acting on resistance alleles, their contributions to fitness in heterozygotes (dominance) and their initial frequencies, as a means to predict the rate of spread of resistance in natural populations. We investigate practical problems of obtaining such estimates, with particular emphasis on Mexican populations of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti. Selection and dominance coefficients can be estimated by fitting genetic models to field data using maximum likelihood (ML) methodology. This methodology, although widely used, makes many assumptions so we investigated how well such models perform when data are sparse or when spatial and temporal heterogeneity occur. As expected, ML methodologies reliably estimated selection and dominance coefficients under idealised conditions but it was difficult to recover the true values when datasets were sparse during the time that resistance alleles increased in frequency, or when spatial and temporal heterogeneity occurred.
