5|$|Many sharks, {{including}} the whitetip reef shark are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey.

5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing {{hyperbaric oxygen therapy}} is rare, and is influenced {{by a number of}} a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> due to use of a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Each somite, or body segment {{can bear}} {{a pair of}} appendages: on the {{segments}} of the head, these include two pairs of antennae, the mandibles and maxillae; the thoracic segments bear legs, which may be specialised as pereiopods (walking legs) and maxillipeds (feeding legs). The abdomen bears pleopods, and ends in a telson, which bears the anus, and is often flanked by uropods to form a tail fan. The number and variety of appendages in different crustaceans may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> responsible for the group's success.|$|E
5|$|In Europe and the Americas, a {{relatively}} small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> associated with misdiagnosis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became increasingly clear that David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} most cases of {{epilepsy}} is unknown. Some cases occur {{as the result}} of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, infections of the brain, and birth defects, through a process known as epileptogenesis. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to a small proportion of cases. Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal nerve cell activity in the cortex of the brain. The diagnosis involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting and determining if another cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests. Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition.|$|E
5|$|With large {{metallic}} red inflorescences {{and attractive}} feathery leaves that {{are perhaps the}} softest of all Banksia species, B.brownii is highly valued by Australia's horticultural and cut flower industries. Seeds and plants are readily available in Australian nurseries, and it is widely cultivated in areas not exposed to dieback. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 50 days to germinate. The plant prefers a sheltered position in soil with good drainage, and must be provided with moisture over summer. It grows quickly, but takes several years to flower. Once established, it is frost-tolerant and tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. The flowers are attractive in late bud, but lose their colour {{as soon as they}} open. Because they are usually surrounded by branchlets, they may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> hidden by foliage.|$|E

Those with gout {{are at increased risk}} of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and kidney and cardiovascular disease and thus are at increased risk of death. It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, but some of the increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E
5|$|After their {{original}} religious activities ceased, Egyptian temples suffered slow decay. Many were defaced by Christians trying {{to erase the}} remnants of ancient Egyptian religion. Some temple buildings, such as the mammisi at Dendera or the hypostyle hall at Philae, were adapted into churches or other types of buildings. Most commonly the sites were left disused, as at the Temple of Khnum at Elephantine, while locals carried off their stones to serve as material for new buildings. The dismantling of temples for stone continued well into modern times. Limestone was especially useful {{as a source of}} lime, so temples built of limestone were almost all dismantled. Sandstone temples, found mostly in Upper Egypt, were more likely to survive. What humans left intact was still subject to natural weathering. Temples in desert areas could <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> covered by drifts of sand, while those near the Nile, particularly in Lower Egypt, were often buried under layers of river-borne silt. Thus, some major temple sites like Memphis were reduced to ruin, while many temples far from the Nile and centers of population remained mostly intact. With understanding of the hieroglyphic script lost, the information about Egyptian culture that was preserved in the surviving temples lay incomprehensible to the world.|$|E
5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They also try to avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E

5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|At , Rwanda's {{population}} density is amongst {{the highest in}} Africa. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> attributed to the {{population density}}. The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country. The only sparsely populated {{area of the country}} is the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east. Kigali is the largest city, with a population of around one million. Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development. According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000. Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000. The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990, to 16.6% in 2006; by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
