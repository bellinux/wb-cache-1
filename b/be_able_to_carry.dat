5|$|An {{unprecedented}} {{event was}} {{the visit of}} Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on March 6 and was allowed to enter the conclave. He stayed there two weeks, freely debating with the electors. Fortunately, he did not press them but only expressed the wish for {{the election of a}} pope who would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers.|$|E
5|$|Stainless steel {{provided}} {{many benefits}} over traditional wood and hardened steel for railroad carbodies; {{it was a}} lighter and stronger material, and its natural silver appearance and resistance to corrosion meant {{that it would not}} have to be painted to protect it from the weather. Since the carbody was much lighter than similar cars, it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> a higher revenue load for the same cost.|$|E

5|$|The Polish–Lithuanian and Prussian {{alliance}} was {{a mutual}} defense alliance signed on 29 March 1790 in Warsaw between {{representatives of the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Prussia. It was signed in the brief period when Prussia was seeking an ally against either Austria or Russia, and the Commonwealth was seeking guarantees that it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out significant governmental reforms without foreign intervention.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed overhead wires were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> trams.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it would}} be {{utilized}} in both directions, {{the capacity of the}} proposed interstate loop line would be equivalent, it is said, to two 2-track lines or one 4-track line from New Jersey to New York City due to its having two crossings between New Jersey and New York. The loop was said to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> 192,500 passengers per hour, or 4.62million daily passengers, had it been built. The estimate was based on the operation of 35 trains per hour in each direction, and each train would be eleven cars long and would carry 100 passengers per car. It was to be built as a multi-phase project, wherein the IRT and BMT would work together to build that system to New Jersey. Extensions of the IRT Flushing Line and BMT Canarsie Line were both considered; the Canarsie Line was to be extended to Hoboken near the Palisades, while the Flushing Line was to be extended to Franklin Street between Boulevard and Bergenline Avenues in Union City. Ultimately, the cost was too great, and with the Great Depression, these ideas were quickly shot down.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion of typical shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although they may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E

During this period, the Navy saw the addition of six first generation of Independence class patrol vessels in December 1970. The growing constraints and strategic need for a base located nearer to the Singapore Straits necessitated a new base, and the Brani Naval Base on Pulau Brani was formally opened in December 1970.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, the Dörfles-Esbach {{connecting}} curve {{was connected}} to the existing network, in order to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> the rails for the construction of the line, among other things. The rails of the new line came from several large German track manufacturers and some were carried by goods trains on the lines from Coburg and Erfurt. At the end of November 2014 Deutsche Bahn announced that all 29bridges on the new line had been completed.|$|E
25|$|In October 1921 Messrs. Langley Bros. {{purchased}} the Saint Francois and renamed the vessel Dorrigo {{to replace the}} ill-fated Fitzroy, which foundered off the coast the previous June and the vessel was placed into the same Coffs Harbour to Sydney route.

25|$|In {{addition}} to their ground-attack role, {{it is believed that}} the Dassault Mirage 2000s and SEPECAT Jaguars of the Indian Air Force are able to provide a secondary nuclear-strike role. The SEPECAT Jaguar was designed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> and deploy nuclear weapons and the Indian Air Force has identified the jet as being capable of delivering Indian nuclear weapons. The most likely delivery method would be the use of bombs that are free-falling and unguided.|$|E
25|$|Designed {{primarily}} {{to replace the}} Soyuz spacecraft, Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure lifting body design and as spaceplane with small wings. In either case, the craft {{would have been able}} to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much less stress on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the International Space Station.|$|E
25|$|Space {{disposal}} {{is attractive}} because it removes nuclear waste from the planet. It has significant disadvantages, {{such as the}} potential for catastrophic failure of a launch vehicle, which could spread radioactive material into the atmosphere and around the world. A high number of launches would be required because no individual rocket would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> very much of the material relative to the total amount {{that needs to be}} disposed of. This makes the proposal impractical economically and it increases the risk of at least one or more launch failures.|$|E

By this point Savory had moved on as Head of Serials and his successor, Shaun Sutton, was more agreeable to change, allowing Wiles' replacement, Innes Lloyd, to make many of the very changes that Wiles had been barred from. Lloyd discussed the situation with Hartnell and the actor agreed that it would be best to leave, although later in life he would claim that he had not wanted to go.|$|E
25|$|Six new Alstom Coradia LINT {{trainsets}} (purchased {{to replace}} the three older Bombardier Talent units) and the two extra passing loops allow the number of trains {{on the line to}} double to four thus reducing wait times. The goal is to cut wait times from 15 to as low as 8 minutes for peak times. Service will run every 10 to 12 minutes. Signals and operations would be adjusted to increase frequency to approximately every 8 to 10 minutes. With more trains and a higher frequency of service, the line will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> more people.|$|E
25|$|The Air Force {{response}} was two-fold. One was WS-199, which explored various options {{to make the}} Air Force's own missiles as immune as the Navy's. The primary method was the air-launched missile, which would be kept on station close to the Soviet Union but outside their defensive range, able to be launched at a moment's notice. They also explored ways to extend the range of ground-launched missiles, so that small mobile missiles might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> out attacks from the United States without being subject to counterattack. Other options, not part of WS-199, was an active defense using the LIM-49 Nike Zeus and its follow-ons, and rail-based launchers.|$|E
