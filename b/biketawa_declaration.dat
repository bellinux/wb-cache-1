50|$|Urwin {{was part}} of the Australian {{delegation}} to the 2000 Pacific Islands Forum summit in Kiribati. Urwin was considered to be a very important drafter of the <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration,</b> which was signed at the Kiribati summit. The <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration,</b> named after the island of Biketawa where negotiations took place, provided a firm political framework for regional cooperation on Pacific island security for the first time. The Declaration established a mechanism by which Forum countries could come to the assistance of its members. The <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration</b> came against a backdrop of increased political instability throughout Melanesia at the time. George Speight had recently staged the 2000 Fijian coup d'état during the same year and the Solomon Islands were nearly brought to civil war due to ethnic tensions on the island of Guadalcanal.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration</b> is a {{declaration}} {{agreed to by}} all {{the leaders of the}} Pacific Islands Forum constituting a framework for coordinating response to regional crises. The declaration was agreed to at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000 in the regional context of the 2000 Fijian coup d'état and ethnic tensions in the Solomon Islands. The <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration</b> has led to military and police forces as well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand, participating in regional peacekeeping and stabilization operations in Solomon Islands (2003-), Nauru (2004-2009) and Tonga (2006).|$|E
50|$|In October 2000, {{national}} {{leaders of the}} Pacific Islands Forum signed the <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration</b> constituting a framework for coordinating response to regional crises leading to New Zealand and Australian military and police forces participating in regional peacekeeping/stabilisation operations in Papua New Guinea (in Bougainville), Solomon Islands (2003-present), Nauru (2004-present) and Tonga (2006).|$|E
50|$|Urwin was {{considered}} to be an instrumental voice in the application of the <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration</b> to the Solomons Island Crisis. Urwin applied the declaration to the crisis and gathered regional support for the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, or RAMSI, which was sent to the Solomon Islands in 2003 to help quell the ethnic violence and remains to this day. RAMSI stabilised the nation and allowed the government of the Solomon Islands to rebuild its administration and the economy.|$|E
50|$|A June 2000 coup in the Solomon Islands {{led to the}} {{formation}} of an Australian led International Peace Monitoring Team (IPMT) to support efforts to preserve peace between warring ethnic groups. The IPMT - which included Defence (civilian and military) participation - helped oversee an end to inter-ethnic conflict and withdrew in June 2002 (Australian Government Department of Defence 2003: 21).After persistent pleas from the Solomon Island Government for Australian intervention, following a renewal of inter-ethnic conflict, Australia brought Pacific Forum Foreign Ministers to Sydney and said it would lead a regional intervention force, RAMSI. This was backed by the Pacific Islands Forum’s <b>Biketawa</b> <b>declaration</b> of 2000, authorising regional action in the case of security crises arising in member countries (Firth 2008: 10).|$|E
50|$|Australia and New Zealand are {{generally}} larger and wealthier {{than the other}} countries {{that make up the}} rest of the forum, Australia's population is around twice that of the other 17 members combined and its economy is more than five times larger. They are significant aid donors and big markets for exports from the other countries. Military and police forces as well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand, have recently been part of regional peacekeeping and stabilization operations in other states, notably in Solomon Islands (2003-) and Nauru (2004-2009), under Forum auspices. Such regional efforts are mandated by the <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration,</b> which was adopted at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000.|$|E

A partnership between Macmillan Brown Center for Pacific Studies (University of Canterbury), Australian National University, United National Development Program and International Political Science AssociationMost significant threats to security in the Pacific Islands region today are internal rather than external. One has only to look at the extraordinary situation today in Nauru, the governance issues in Papua New Guinea, the constitutional concerns in Vanuatu, and the dominance of the military in Fiji. And in considering them, we need to remember that the <b>Biketawa</b> <b>Declaration,</b> agreed 16 years ago now, provides a mechanism {{that can be used to}} combat threats to security in the region, including internal problems...|$|E
