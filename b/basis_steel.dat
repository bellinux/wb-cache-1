When concentration of quenching liquid is 5 %, yield ratio of the steel can be guaranteed to be low, thus safety of cylinder is improved.

When tempered at 570 ℃, inner wall structure of cylinder contains tempering martensite, the strength is high but the plasticity is low. When tempered between 610 ℃~ 615 ℃, temper brittleness happens very easily and toughness is on the low side.

40|$|Pipelines are {{commonly}} buried in depth of 1 m to 2 m {{in which the}} soil condition is most often partially saturated. However, the conventional design guidelines and available analytical models for predicting the uplift resistance and mobilization are based on assumption that the soil is either dry or fully saturated. In unsaturated soils, such an assumption often leads to under-estimate of uplift resistance and over-estimation of uplift mobilization. Enhanced strength and stiffness of unsaturated soils due to suction can increase the uplift resistance along with substantially different peak mobilizations as compared to tradition estimations. This can lead to under or over-estimation of remedial measures during feasibility/design stage, thus false bidding/project estimations. This paper examines the effect of partial saturation on the peak uplift resistance and mobilization of pipelines buried in sandy soils using numerical modelling.

However, growing pressure on the construction industry to consider the longer term financial and environmental implications of projects is encouraging a more holistic view. Thus, materials with higher initial costs, but which offer cost savings over {{the life cycle of}} a structure, are gaining increasing recognition. The life cycle costs of structures of two such metallic materials, namely aluminium alloy and stainless steel, are compared to those of ordinary structural carbon steel in the present study. Two structural applications ? a typical office building and a bridge ? are analysed, whilst offshore applications are briefly discussed. The ratio of initial material cost per tonne was assumed to be 1. 0 : 2. 5 : 4. 0 (carbon steel: aluminium alloy: stainless steel). Following a preliminary structural design to current European design standards taking due account of the material densities and structural properties (principally strength and stiffness), it was found that on an initial cost <b>basis,</b> carbon <b>steel</b> offers the most competitive solution for both the building and the bridge. However, considering the additional life cycle costs including maintenance costs, end of life costs and the residual value of the structure (appropriately discounted to capital cost), the results indicate that carbon steel offers the most competitive life cycle solution for the office building, but delivers the most expensive life cycle solution for the bridge. Overall, it is concluded that on a whole-life basis aluminium alloy and stainless steel may offer more competitive solutions than carbon steel for bridges and exposed areas of building structures...|$|R
