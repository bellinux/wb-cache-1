A load of 200  g {{was applied to}} the surface of the specimens for 10  s. Three indentations equally placed over a circle and each no closer than 0.5  mm to the adjacent indentations were made on the surface of each specimen. The diagonals’ length of the indentations was measured by a <b>built-in</b> scaled <b>microscope,</b> and Vickers values were converted into micro-hardness values. Micro-hardness was obtained using the following equation: HV[*]=[*] 1.854 P/d [...]...|$|R
40|$|A {{facility}} {{has been developed}} to acquire hyperspectral cathodoluminescence (CL) images simultaneously with X-ray composition data. Based around an electron microprobe, the system uses a <b>built-in</b> Cassegrain <b>microscope</b> to efficiently couple emitted light directly into the entrance slit of an optical spectrograph. A cooled array detector allows the parallel acquisition of CL spectra, which are then built up into a multidimensional data-cube containing the full set of spectrally- and spatially-resolved information for later analysis. This setup {{has the advantage of}} allowing wavelength-dispersive X-ray (WDX) data to be recorded concurrently, providing a powerful technique for the direct comparison of luminescent and compositional properties of materials. The combination of beam and sample scanning thus allows the correlation of composition and luminescence inhomogeneities on length scales ranging from a few cm to sub-micron...|$|R
40|$|The extraction, analysis, and {{presentation}} of integrated optical density (IOD) profiles from banded prometaphase chromosome material is {{an increasingly important}} clinical method for the detection and analysis of structural aberrations. Particular translocations, duplications, or deletions of genetic material {{have been shown to}} be implicated in specific mental or physical disorders. Previously, this clinical task was carried out by a laborious manual procedure with little or no automation. This thesis describes an investigation into digital image analysis tech niques for automation in cytogenetics. More specifically, it presents a number of image analysis methods implemented in a clinically useful computer system for studying the banding structure of stained human chromosomes. The computer system consists of a microscope image digiti sation unit based on a high-resolution (1320 X 1035 pixels, 12 bits per pixel) digital CCD cam era and an image analysis {{and presentation}} unit based on a standard graphics workstation. The more precise and objective indications of genetic abnormality. A new method of chromosome classification is proposed based on a conventional Bayesian classifier presented with sampled banding profile values as features. This straightforward method of classification which reflects the human cytogeneticist's approach appears to have been neglected in the past, but gives good results. Using approximately 20 - 30 profile values (features) along the chromosome centreline, the classification result is better than most of the previously reported classifiers. The same classifier is then exploited to solve two related problems. The first is the segmen tation task of identifying which sections belong to which chromosome when two or more chro mosomes overlap. This is by no means obvious with material in which chromosomes can be severely bent or twisted. The second is the axial alignment problem of matching corresponding bands in chromosomes presented to the cytogeneticist for comparison. Alignment is based on the intuitive concept of piece-wise correlation, designed to handle the alignment of high-reso lution profiles with detailed differences in chromosome band structure, and using the sample classifier to evaluate the goodness of fit. The thesis also presents a clinical experiment in which image quality of microscope ocular images, photographs from <b>microscope</b> <b>built-in</b> camera, digital images from standard and high- resolution cameras, and sublimation printer hardcopies was compared. It was shown that the developed high-resolution digitisation unit was superior to standard cameras as judged by number of visible chromosome bands...|$|R
