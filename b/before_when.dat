5|$|Tiberius gave {{money out}} to the people of Rome in his name, and he was {{scheduled}} to hold the consulship next year with the emperor.

5|$|With a {{possible}} set list shaping up during rehearsals, Blackmore convinced {{a friend of}} his, Derek Lawrence, to be the band's producer. They had met years <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> both worked for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States. Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout's sessions, remaining impressed.|$|E
5|$|Abrams {{had been}} rumored as {{director}} since December 2006, and NBC confirmed this the following month. He and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon were both hired to direct an episode during February sweeps week. Abrams had known cast member Kate Flannery years <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> {{he used to}} write in a restaurant where Flannery worked as a waitress. The two were reunited on The Office set, where he stated that he was pleased with her success.|$|E

Adolf sends a letter to van Kempen telling him where to find Ervine. The family are reunited.|$|E
5|$|Alison Hendrix {{returns home}} from rehab {{to find her}} husband Donnie drunk and chastises him. When she catches him trying {{to leave the house}} {{in the middle of the}} night, she persuades him not to give up on their marriage. In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their {{neighbour}} Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night <b>before.</b> <b>When</b> Alison asks what he did with Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse is wrapped in the trunk of their car.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once <b>before</b> <b>when</b> Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E

5|$|On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) {{landed on}} the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula, at what {{thereafter}} became known as Anzac Cove. The first Turkish attempts to recapture the ANZAC beachhead were two unsuccessful attacks in April. Just over two weeks later, the Turks had gathered a force of 42,000 men (four divisions) to conduct their second assault against the ANZAC's 17,300 men (two divisions). The ANZAC commanders had no indication of the impending attack until the day <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> British aircraft reported a build-up of troops opposite the ANZAC positions.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} a Milankovitch cycle {{in the range of}} 100,000 years, related to Earth's orbital eccentricity, its {{contribution}} to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of precession and obliquity. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of ice ages at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.|$|E
5|$|At Moe's Tavern, Moe informs Homer and {{his friends}} {{that one of them}} must be a {{designated}} driver, and Barney loses the choosing draw. After Barney drives the drunken men home in Homer's car, Homer allows him to use it to drive himself home, expecting Barney to return it the following morning. In his distressed state, Barney disappears with the car. Two months later, Barney returns to Moe's Tavern, unable to recall where he left the car. Homer later receives a letter from the New York City government, which informs him that his car has been found parked in the World Trade Center plaza. Homer reveals to the family that he had once been to New York <b>before</b> <b>when</b> he was 17 years old and had a horrible experience. Marge and the children persuade Homer to go retrieve the car and he reluctantly agrees.|$|E

5|$|Both {{teams had}} won the UEFA Champions League before; Manchester United had three titles, while Barcelona had two. The most recent of these had come only the season <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> Manchester United beat Chelsea on {{penalties}} in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. They won the first of their European Cups in 1968, beating Benfica 4–1 at Wembley Stadium, while their second was achieved in 1999 via a last-gasp 2–1 win over Bayern Munich at Barcelona's home ground, the Camp Nou. Barcelona's first European Cup was won as recently as 1992, when they beat Sampdoria 1–0 after extra time at Wembley; their only other title came in 2006 with a 2–1 win over another English side, Arsenal. Prior to 2009, unlike Barcelona, Manchester United had never lost a European Cup final; Barcelona had lost three – in 1961, 1986 and 1994, to Benfica, Steaua București and Milan respectively.|$|E
5|$|In early 2008, he was {{diagnosed}} with malignant melanoma, a severe form of skin cancer. He had fought the disease <b>before,</b> <b>when</b> he had a form of skin cancer removed from his back in 2006. Cooksey suspected his cancer originated from a six-month spell coaching schoolchildren in the searing heat of Las Vegas in the United States. In April 2008, Grays Athletic staged a benefit match for Cooksey. The match consisted of former professional players, as well as current professionals such as Leroy Lita, Nicky Shorey, Aaron McLean, Ray Parlour, Justin Edinburgh, Iain Dowie, Bob Dowie, Clive Allen, Scott Fitzgerald and Paul Merson. He returned to his former club Oldham Athletic in May 2008, where another benefit match was staged for his appeal at Boundary Park, attended by 1,500 fans to see such former players as John Barnes, Luther Blissett and Chris Waddle as well as television actors from Coronation Street.|$|E
5|$|The Little Busters {{will also}} {{participate}} in missions to accomplish some goal, and a mission will either be completed or failed {{depending on the}} choices of the player. These missions are connected with the battle sequences and batting practice in that they serve to give the characters experience, obtain accessories to use during fights, and improve their statistics. However, these missions do not affect the main plot in any way—the player even has the choice to turn off most of the minigames so that the player may focus on the main plot, including the battle sequences and batting practice. The {{first time that the}} game is played, Rin's statistics are weak compared to other characters. However, when the player completes several heroine's routes, Rin's and Riki's statistics will start out higher than <b>before</b> <b>when</b> the player starts a new game, allowing Rin and Riki to stand a better chance against opponents with higher statistics. The statistics of the Little Busters members are shown in a ranking system from highest to lowest in overall statistics.|$|E

When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold him down and carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies to explain to the others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished <b>before</b> <b>when</b> a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E
