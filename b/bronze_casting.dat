5|$|The statue was {{restored}} in 2006 with funds {{donated by the}} university's alumni from the Class of 1956. Approximately $150,000 in reunion campaign funds were used to restore the four historic gates on the university's historic Queens Campus and the William the Silent statue. It was cleaned to remove the effects of graffiti and transparent tape residue, and conservation efforts were needed to restore the statue's <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> and granite base.|$|E
5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have what looks like bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> tradition in Nri.|$|E

25|$|Yela studied {{sculpture}} {{under his}} father Baldomero Yela Montenegro (1859–1909), a sculptor and marble-carver, and afterwards under the Venezuelan Santiago González (1850–1909).

25|$|Gillespie {{is unique}} among the <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> {{fraternity}} {{in being able}} to claim that all moulding, casting and finishing is done entirely by himself in his Dublin studio/foundry.

25|$|Towns became key centres of manufacturing. <b>Bronze</b> <b>casting</b> {{foundries}} {{existed at}} Porolissum, Romula, and Dierna; {{there was a}} brooch workshop located in Napoca, while weapon smithies {{have been identified in}} Apulum. Glass manufacturing factories have been uncovered in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa and Tibiscum. Villages and rural settlements continued to specialise in craftwork, including pottery, and sites such as Micăsasa could possess 26 kilns and hundreds of moulds for the manufacture of local terra sigillata.|$|E
25|$|These new invaders {{likewise}} left numerous {{traces of}} their stay, and two different periods may be easily distinguished from their remains. They were acquainted with iron, and learned from their subjects {{the art of}} <b>bronze</b> <b>casting,</b> which they used for decorative purposes only. They refined the artistry of this work. Their pottery is more artistic and of a higher quality {{than that of the}} Bronze Age. Their ornaments are included among the collections at the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|The Erlitou culture (-1350), {{named after}} its type site in modern Henan, {{dominated}} northern China {{in the early}} second millennium, when urban societies and <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> {{first appeared in the}} area. The cowries, tin, jade, and turquoise that were buried at Erlitou suggest that they traded with many neighbours. A considerable labour force would be required to build the rammed-earth foundations of their buildings. Although the highly stratified Erlitou society has left no writing, some historians have identified as the legendary Xia dynasty mentioned in traditional Chinese accounts as preceding the Shang.|$|E

25|$|Although <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> has a {{long history}} in south India, a much larger and a much greater number of bronze sculptures in all sizes ranging from massive to {{miniature}} were cast during the Chola period than before, further attesting to the importance of bronze sculpture during this period. It should be noted that when in worship, these images are bedecked in silk costumes, garlands, and gem encrusted jewels, befitting the particular avatar and religious context. Decorating temple bronzes in this way is a tradition at least a thousand years old and such decorations are referred to in 10th-century Chola inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|A {{building}} at London South Bank University, which houses the institute's electrical engineering departments is named the Faraday Wing, {{due to its}} proximity to Faraday's birthplace in Newington Butts. A hall at Loughborough University was named after Faraday in 1960. Near the entrance to its dining hall is a <b>bronze</b> <b>casting,</b> which depicts the symbol of an electrical transformer, and inside there hangs a portrait, both in Faraday's honour. An eight-story {{building at}} the University of Edinburgh's science & engineering campus is named for Faraday, as is a recently built hall of accommodation at Brunel University, the main engineering building at Swansea University, and the instructional and experimental physics building at Northern Illinois University. The former UK Faraday Station in Antarctica was named after him.|$|E
25|$|Sculpting Life {{received}} its premier terrestrial broadcast on the Irish National Broadcaster, RTÉ to much critical acclaim. The film, also aired on the Arts Channel in New Zealand, provides a unique {{view of the}} world of a <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> sculptor, as he creates a series of famine sculptures from research, through to unveiling in Ireland Park, Toronto. Partly based on his reading of Joseph O'Connor's the Star of the Sea, Gillespie enters the world of its central character, the murderous Pius Mulvey as he haunts the decks of a coffin ship and becomes an emaciated ghost, living among the hundreds of Irish emigrants crammed into steerage. The documentary follows the sculptor as he brings the character to life in bronze.|$|E

25|$|The Nubian Kingdom of Kush {{in modern}} Sudan was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and {{produced}} monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north. In West Africa, {{the earliest known}} sculptures are from the Nok culture which thrived between 500 BC and 500 AD in modern Nigeria, with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes. Later West African cultures developed <b>bronze</b> <b>casting</b> for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous Benin Bronzes, and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the Yoruba town of Ife in terracotta and metal from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan goldweights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900, some apparently representing proverbs and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} {{about the real}} identity of {{the architect of the}} Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his <b>bronze</b> <b>casting,</b> particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered {{at the foot of the}} tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the rarest}} {{items in the}} {{collection}} is the 58cm high Gloucester Candlestick, dated to c1110, made from gilt bronze; with highly elaborate and intricate intertwining branches containing small figures and inscriptions, it is {{a tour de force}} of <b>bronze</b> <b>casting.</b> Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint's martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on the tail of a parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet. Both masts have main and top-sails, and battlemented fighting-tops are made from gold. These items are displayed in the new Medieval & Renaissance galleries.|$|E
