5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere {{from outer space}} and the solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more {{like that of the}} Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E

5000|$|Cardboard or {{newspaper}} {{can be used}} as mulches. These {{are best}} used as a base layer upon which a heavier mulch such as compost is placed to prevent the lighter cardboard/newspaper layer from <b>blowing</b> <b>away.</b> <b>By</b> incorporating a layer of cardboard/newspaper into a mulch, the quantity of heavier mulch can be reduced, whilst improving the weed suppressant and moisture retaining properties of the mulch. However, additional labour is expended when planting through a mulch containing a cardboard/newspaper layer, as holes must be cut for each plant. Sowing seed through mulches containing a cardboard/newspaper layer is impractical. Application of newspaper mulch in windy weather can be facilitated by briefly pre-soaking the newspaper in water to increase its weight.|$|R
5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, overgrazing and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although overgrazing has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E

But the Mariners were able to defeat the Australian Super League runners-up to take themselves to the grand final of the competition. Against the winners of the Super League grand final, Brisbane, the Mariners were <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the competition favourites.

5|$|When Davies {{presented}} his {{ideas for the}} U.S. Millionaire to ABC, the network's executives initially rejected them, so he resigned his position there and became an independent producer. Determined to bring his idea for the show to fruition, Davies decided that he was betting his whole career on Millionaires production, and the first move that he made was planning to attach a celebrity host to the show. Along with Philbin, {{a number of other}} popular television personalities were considered for hosting positions on the U.S. Millionaire during its development, including Peter Jennings, Bob Costas, Phil Donahue, and Montel Williams, but among those considered, it was Philbin who wanted the job the most, and when he saw an episode of the British Millionaire and was <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> his content, Davies and his team ultimately settled on having him host the American show. When Davies approached ABC again after having hired Philbin, the network finally agreed to accept the U.S. Millionaire. With production now ready to begin, the team had only five months to finish developing the show and get it launched, with Davies demanding perfection in every element of Millionaires production.|$|E

25|$|At the Ring's destruction, Sauron's {{power was}} {{immediately}} broken and his form in Middle-earth was destroyed.

His vast empires collapsed, his armies were defeated, the Dark Tower of Barad-dûr crumbled and the Nazgûl were consumed in a hail of fire from the Mountain as they flew towards it {{trying to save the}} Ring.

25|$|There {{are several}} {{changes in the}} Battle of the Black Gate: Merry is not present there in the book, Pippin does not kill a troll as he does in the novel (instead, Aragorn does), the eagles fight and defeat some of the mounted Nazgûl (while Frodo putting on the One Ring distracted the Nazgûl, who raced away to Mount Doom in the book before a {{confrontation}} could occur), and Aragorn kills the Mouth of Sauron in the extended edition of the film {{but not in the}} book. There was an even larger change planned: Sauron himself would come out in physical form to battle Aragorn, who would only be saved by the destruction of the Ring. Jackson eventually realised it ignored the point of Aragorn's true bravery in distracting Sauron's army against overwhelming odds, and a computer generated Troll was placed over footage of Sauron in the finished film. In the book, after the destruction of the Ring the spirit of Sauron rises like a black cloud from the ruin of Barad-dûr before being <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the wind, but in the film the Eye of Sauron erupts in flame and then explodes as Barad-dûr collapses.

25|$|The Australian {{newspaper}} reported that {{never before had}} an Australian XI led by Ian Chappell been so humiliated in defeat. Australia had started well reducing the West Indies to 119–7. But Clive Lloyd {{as he had done}} so often before, resisted scoring a vital 56, aputting on 40 runs for the last wicket with the capable Wayne Daniel (17*). Chappell was delighted with his bowlers performance on a first day that closed with Australia 33/2, Ian out along with Bruce Laird and brother Trevor retired hurt. Twelve wickets would fall on the second day, Australia were bowled out for just 106, the four pronged West Indian attack making mince-meat of the Aussie batting card. With a lead of 76 the West Indies batted positively, compiling a total of 481 at a remarkable run rate of 4.39 runs per over. Clive Lloyd was again the star scoring a brilliant 197 before being the eighth batsman dismissed. Requiring an unlikely 558 runs to win in their second innings, the aggressive Ian Chappell chose to open the batting, protecting Trevor from the new ball. Ian made 41 but his side were only 83–4 at his dismissal and {{on the verge of a}} crushing defeat. Ray Bright made a good 47 not out, but the Australian tail were <b>blown</b> <b>away</b> <b>by</b> the four quicks, complemented by the medium pace of Richard Austin.

5000|$|The valveless pulsejet is {{not really}} valveless [...] - [...] it just uses the mass of air in the intake tube as its valve, {{in place of a}} {{mechanical}} valve.

In all known successful valveless pulsejet designs, the intake air mass is {{a small fraction of the}} tailpipe air mass (due to the smaller dimensions of the intake duct). This means that the intake air mass will be cleared out of contact with the body of the engine faster than the tailpipe mass will. The carefully designed imbalance of these two air masses is important for the proper timing of all parts of the cycle.|$|R
