5000|$|A {{power-train}} control module, abbreviated PCM, is an automotive component, {{a control}} unit, used on motor vehicles. It is generally a combined control unit, {{consisting of the}} engine control unit (ECU) and the transmission control unit (TCU).

These automotive computers are generally very reliable. The PCM commonly controls more than 100 factors in a car or truck. There are many hundreds of error codes that can occur, which indicates that some subsection of the car is experiencing a problem.

The PCM is one of potentially several on-board computers, or essentially the [...] "brain" [...] of the engine control system.|$|E
40|$|Requirements for {{embedded}} systems are mainly documented using natural language. This {{is due to}} the fact that natural language does not require special nomenclature knowledge and is accepted as the basis for contractual agreements. However, purely natural-language-based requirements engineering (RE) is often error-prone, potentially ambiguous, and does not foster traceability and hence requires tedious manual reviews and analyses. Model-based requirements engineering is often considered a possible solution as models enhance traceability, aid in stakeholder communication, and foster automatic model analysis and model checking. However, model-based requirements engineering is only slowly adopted in the industry, partly because no clear guidelines to their application exist, particularly in legally binding documents. In order to combine the advantages of model-based requirements engineering with the convenience of natural-language-based requirements engineering, we developed a combined RE approach that relies on both a controlled natural language (i. e., a natural language that is restricted in its expressiveness) as well as requirements models and defines a structured interface between both specification paradigms. The purpose of this document is to report on the application of the combined approach in an industrial case study from the automotive industry: a <b>body</b> <b>control</b> <b>module.</b> A <b>body</b> <b>control</b> <b>module</b> is an electronic control unit (ECU) that centralizes the control of body and comfort functions provided by multiple other ECUs distributed in a vehicle.

40|$|Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) {{simulations}} {{have long}} been used to test electronic control units (ECUs) and software in car manufacturers. It provides an effective platform to the rapid development process of the ECU control algorithms and accommodates the added complexity of the plant under control. Accurate Model based HIL simulation (AMHIL) is considered as a most efficient and cost effective way for exploration of new designs and development of new products, particularly in calibration and parameterization of vehicle stability controllers. The work presented in the paper {{is to develop a}} mathematical model of a windscreen wiper system for the purpose of conducting HIL vehicle test and eventually to replace the real component with the model for cost cutting and improved test efficiency. The model is developed based on the electro-mechanical engineering principles. Matlab/Simulink was used as a platform for simulating the mathematical model, in which the real-time code (C language) of the model is complied via Real-time Workshop. dSPACE HIL simulator is adopted as a real-time platform for the HIL tests to the <b>Body</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module</b> (BCM). The mathematical model of the windscreen system is firstly verified in real-time in line with the real components, wherein varied operational conditions are applied. A real value single population Genetic Algorithm (GA) is adopted to optimize the model parameters with the performance criteria for minimizing the errors between the model simulated swing angles of both cranks and their corresponding swing angels measured from the real wiper system in real time. With the AMHIL, control algorithms embedded in the BCM can be verified in a full scope of the operational ranges. With the ability of adjusting the model parameters to represent different designs of the windscreen wiper systems (e. g. geometric design of the linkage system), AMHIL can verify the control strategy BCM before the real prototype is built, {{not only in terms of}} functional tests, but also in terms of reliability and robustness, which can accordingly accelerate production process...|$|E

40|$|The {{embedded}} systems {{used in the}} automotive domain belong to the most complex {{embedded systems}}. The automobile manufacturers permanently try to improve the safety and the comfort for the driver and the other passengers. Most of the developed embedded systems are time- and safety-critical. According to a study of Mercedes-Benz, 80 % of the innovations in the automotive domain are driven by new electronic components and 90 % of their functionality is realized in software. To cope with the increasing complexity {{in the design of}} automotive embedded systems, the automobile manufacturers use more and more the model-based software development instead of the classical programming. In requirements engineering, the first phase in the development process, the requirements on the system are elicited an d documented using natural language. Today, model-based approaches are only used to support the natural language. During the requirements engineering of an automotive embedded system, a requirements engineer has to specify and analyze the functional requirements on the system under development as well as the timing requirements. The functional requirements encompass especially the communication between the different parts of the system. Scenarios provide an intuitive way to model requirements on a reactive system and are therefore often used to specify the communication between the different parts of the system. In the scope of this thesis, we use a model-based approach to specify scenarios. Requirements on the timing behavior of the system are specified within the system architecture. In the automotive domain, many architecture description languages exist, for example EAST-ADL. Although the requirements engineer has to specify and analyze functional as well as timing requirements on the system, there does not exist a requirements engineering methodology that combines the two approaches. Therefore, we have developed a new requirements engineering methodology in the scope of this thesis. The methodology provides a systematic and holistic specification and analysis of functional and timing requirements on an automotive embedded system. Furthermore, we have developed two model transformations to support the requirements engineering methodology. The thesis closes with the evaluation of the methodology and the model transformations based on a <b>body</b> <b>control</b> <b>module...</b>|$|E
