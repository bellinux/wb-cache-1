5|$|Brisingr is {{the third}} novel in the Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini. It was {{released}} on September 20, 2008. Originally, Paolini intended to conclude the then Inheritance Trilogy in three books, but during writing the third book he decided that the series was too complex to conclude in one book, because the single book would <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 1,500 pages long. A deluxe edition of Brisingr, which includes removed scenes and previously unseen art, was released on October 13, 2009.|$|E

5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. Regulatory regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. Regulatory regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to {{come in contact with}} target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up when the need strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|However, nuclear DNA {{sequence}} comparisons {{reported in}} 2017 suggest that Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Sumatran orangutans about 3.4 million years ago. Tapanuli orangutans diverged from Bornean orangutans, much later, about 670,000 years ago. Orangutans travelled from Sumatra to Borneo as the islands were connected by land bridges {{as parts of}} Sundaland during recent glacial periods when sea levels were much lower. The present range of Tapanuli orangutans is thought to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the point where ancestral orangutans first entered what is now Indonesia from mainland Asia.|$|E

5|$|Since Gliese 581c has {{not been}} {{detected}} directly, there are no measurements of its radius. Furthermore, the radial velocity method used to detect it only puts a lower limit on the planet's mass, which means theoretical models of planetary radius and structure can only be of limited use.

5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, who described and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in fact <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers may <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> solving this mystery. They {{noticed a}} large plume of gas {{extending}} {{at least six}} times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed in the infrared, is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E

During Glenn's training, NASA psychologists determined that he was the astronaut best suited for public life. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy suggested to Glenn and his wife in December 1962 that he run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio in 1964, challenging aging incumbent Stephen M. Young (1889–1984) in the Democratic primary election. Since it seemed unlikely that he would be selected for Project Apollo missions, he resigned from NASA on January 16, 1964, and announced his Democratic Party candidacy for the U.S. Senate from his home state of Ohio the following day.|$|E
5|$|Heritage turkey breeds {{have been}} a focus for the {{organization}} since 1997, when a survey showed only 1,335 breeding stock birds of all breeds. A {{study conducted by the}} Conservancy and Virginia Tech concluded that heritage turkey breeds had stronger immune systems than those breeds typically used by industrial growers, and as such were more likely to survive disease epidemics. This study and other programs increased awareness of heritage turkey breeds and by 2003 the breeding population stood at 4,275 turkeys of all breeds. By 2007 this had grown to more than 10,000 birds and 17 breeds were no longer considered to be almost extinct. As of 2010, the number is estimated to <b>be</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 15,000.|$|E
