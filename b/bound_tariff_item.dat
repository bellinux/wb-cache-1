40|$|WTO {{negotiations}} deal predominantly with bound - besides applied - tariff rates. But, how can {{reductions in}} tariffs ceilings, i. e. tariff rates that no exporter may ever actually be confronted with, generate market access? The {{answer to this}} question relates to the effects of tariff bindings on the risk that exporters face in destination markets. The present paper formalizes the underlying interaction of risk, fixed export costs and firms' market entry decisions based on techniques known from the real options literature; doing so we highlight the important role of <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> at the extensive margin of trade. We find that <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> are more effective with higher risk destination markets, that a large binding overhang may still command substantial market access, and that reductions in <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> generate effective market access even when bound rates are above current and long-term applied rates...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{quantitative}} {{assessments of}} the effects of agricultural trade liberalisation have assumed that negotiated reductions in <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> translate into corresponding cuts in applied tariff rates. This approach, however, overestimates the actual reduction in applied tariffs and, hence, the benefits of trade liberalisation, since applied rates are often much lower than the <b>tariffs</b> <b>bound</b> in Uruguay Round schedules. This paper uses data on applied and <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> and the GTAP-CGE model to quantify the magnitude of the resulting bias. The findings suggest that the distortion of estimates is particularly pronounced for modest tariff cuts, as well as for countries where the differences between bound and applied rates are substantial. Hence, quantitative policy analysts who aim to inform decision makers on the likely impacts of negotiated tariff cuts should consider the relationship between <b>bound</b> and applied <b>tariff</b> rates in their assessments in order to avoid mistaken advice [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|Do WTO {{commitments}} {{reduce the}} risk of trade policy reversals? To address this question, we rely on the theoretical model of varying cooperative tariffs by Bagwell and Staiger (1990) to specify our empirical model for the probability of a tariff increase. We then study how WTO tariff commitments affect this probability. We estimate our model using a database of WTO <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> that we built for all WTO Members from 1996 to 2011 at the HS 6 -digit level of disaggregation. Our results show that WTO commitments significantly reduce the probability of a tariff increase, even when the <b>bound</b> <b>tariff</b> is above the MFN applied rate. In addition, the WTO reduces trade policy uncertainty through its monitoring function. These results are robust to including political economy explanations of tariff changes and to addressing endogeneity concerns...|$|R
40|$|Developing {{countries}} {{have an important}} stake in products which have relatively high post-Tokyo MFN tariff rates in developed market economy countries (DMECs). On the whole, their market share is greater in higher tariff imports and, consequently, reductions which cut high tariffs more than lower ones, e. g. by applying tariff ceilings or harmonization formulae, are {{in the interest of}} developing countries. They would benefit from such MFN reductions despite erosions in their existing preference margins. This is due to relatively narrower product coverage of GSP schemes and smaller preference margins in higher tariff imports - other than the schemes for the least developed countries. Therefore, complementing MFN reductions with broadening the product coverage of GSP schemes in high <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> and deepening the preference margins in certain markets would significantly enhance the exports of developing countries. Tariff liberalization and improved GSP product coverage and margins in higher <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> would do very little to developing countries, however, if NTMs were not relaxed to accommodate the potential gains from tariffs. The frequency and trade coverage of NTMs in DMECs affecting high <b>tariff</b> <b>items</b> are significantly greater compared to their overall imports. Furthermore, NTMs substantially discriminate imports from developing countries in high tariff products. Therefore, tariff liberalization schemes which are confined to products not currently covered by NTMs would not yield any noteworthy results for developing countries. This is to say that unless some action is taken in the field of NTMs, no significant expansion of trade can be expected through tariff reductions, not even in the high <b>tariff</b> <b>items.</b> Furthermore, if the relaxation of NTMs is only limited to the accommodation of potential trade expansion through tariff liberalization, even complete elimination of tariffs would only yield meager results. This overall picture is especially bleak for certain sectors, notably labour intensive manufactures such as textiles and clothing and miscellaneous manufactures. In some sectors, particularly in food products, the observations are diluted due to the extreme restrictiveness of some DMECs' trade regimes. Hence, the conclusion to draw is that the importance of liberalization of high tariff products for developing countries can be grossly understated as these evaluations are based on trade which is significantly curtailed by NTMs.  Published in connection with a visit at the IIES...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{liberalization}} studies can be influenced decisively by {{the methodology of}} import tariff aggregation. This article deals with different measures used to aggregate import tariffs. Therefore, {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of different aggregation measures are discussed theoretically. In the empirical part of the paper, the simple average and the trade-weighted average of <b>bound</b> and applied <b>tariffs</b> are calculated for different agricultural products of the EU. The analysis considers ad valorem and specific tariffs as well as tariff rate quotas. Additionally, for the applied tariffs, a distinction is made between MFN-tariffs and bilateral preferential tariff rates. Using the same data base, the product specific Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI) are calculated. Because of the poor data availability at the detailed tariff-line level, a simple partial equilibrium application of these indices is implemented, which can be extended to the whole import tariff data base of an economic trade model. The results show a strong correlation between all aggregation methods, but the size of the import tariffs differs highly, depending on the aggregation measure used. Furthermore, high differences between <b>bound</b> and applied <b>tariffs</b> for some EU agricultural products are calculated. agriculture in international trade, <b>tariff</b> aggregation, <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs,</b> applied tariffs, Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI), Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI), Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|Tariffication is {{an effort}} to convert all {{existing}} agricultural nontariff barriers (NTBs) to trade into <b>bound</b> <b>tariffs</b> and to reduce these tariffs over time. The main economic issues that arise with tariffication stem from the nonequivalence of tariffs in NTBs in a number of scenarios. This paper analyzes nonequivalence arising from the existence of imperfect competition in importing countries, price instability in importing and exporting countries, and inefficient allocation of quantitative restrictions. It is shown that in all these cases the definition of an appropriate "equivalent tariff" to be used in tariffication is not straightforward, and that in general this equivalent tariff cannot be computed on the basis of only observed price differences between countries. Tariff-rate quotas, which are meant to be the main tool in implement tariffication according to the existing proposal, are analyzed in some detail. Concerning the relationship between tariffication and the other elements of the trade liberalization package, it is shown that tariffication would limit the scope of export subsidy policies, and that the existence of production and export subsidies makes observed price gaps between countries of questionable value in setting equivalent tariff levels. Finally, it is argued that the main focus on tariffication should be the conversion of NTBs to acceptable long-run (<b>bound)</b> <b>tariffs</b> rates, and considerable flexibility in the conversion process could be exercised during the transition period. ...|$|R
