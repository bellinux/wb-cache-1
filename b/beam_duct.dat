As a result, four short straight sections of 1. 5 m have been newly created and the lengths of the existing ten straight sections have been extended. The short straight sections are exploited for mini-pole x-ray undulators. A new undulator of VUV-SX is being designed for one of the extended straight sections. Since the successful recommissioning of the ring at October 2005, recovery of the beam lifetime has favorably progressed due to the vacuum scrubbing by the synchrotron radiation.

The vacuum design of the low outgassing rate and the effective pumping configurations to obtain the lowest average pressure in the electron storage ring is to obtain the longer beam life time and the least of the ion trapping effect and the consequent problem of beam ion instability. The inner structure of the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> provides the lower impedance which reduces {{the problems of the}} collective beam instability and the heating dissipation and damage to the vacuum components. The thin wall of the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> and the bellows are designed for the sextupoles that offers the function of fast orbit feedback correction of the beam.

40|$|For longer beam lifetime, many accelerators have {{employed}} ante-chamber type of <b>beam</b> <b>ducts</b> to reduce photon-induced desorption gas around the beam orbit. Still more reduction, however, {{can be expected}} if an X-ray transparent membrane, such as beryllium thin film, is installed between the beam chamber and the ante-chamber because X-rays from the stored beam pass through the membrane while gas molecules desorbed in the ante-chamber are shut out by the membrane. Similarly, photoelectrons and secondary electrons traveling from the ante-chamber to the beam chamber are also shut out by the membrane; this function is expected to mitigate beam-photoelectron instability in positron storage rings.

40|$|In {{addition}} to being observable in laboratory experiments, internal wave beams are reported in geophysical settings, which are characterized by non-uniform density stratifications. Here, we perform a combined theoretical and experimental study of the propagation of internal wave beams in non-uniform density stratifications. Transmission and reflection coefficients, which can differ greatly for different physical quantities, are determined for sharp density-gradient interfaces and finite-width transition regions, accounting for viscous dissipation. Thereafter, we consider even more complex stratifications to model geophysical scenarios. We show that wave <b>beam</b> <b>ducting</b> can occur under conditions that do not necessitate evanescent layers, obtaining close agreement between theory and quantitative laboratory experiments.

40|$|A novel {{rf shield}} {{structure}} for bellows chambers or gate valves in high-current accelerators is proposed. The rf shield has no thin fingers, but nested comb teeth instead at the inner {{surface of the}} <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> The comb-type rf shield has a higher thermal strength structurally than the conventional finger-type one. A simulation also indicates its lower impedance. Especially, the leak of a TE modelike higher order mode through the axial slits, which causes mainly heating of these components, is almost suppressed due to thick teeth. An abrasion test in a vacuum using a test piece of the comb-type rf shield shows less dust generation compared to the finger type. Another preliminary test transmitting 508  MHz microwaves through a prototype rf shield in the atmosphere found no abnormal heating or arcing. A trial model of bellows chambers with the comb-type rf shield will be installed and tested using a real beam in the KEK B-factory positron ring this year...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — During {{the last}} years {{electron}} cyclotron heating (ECH) {{has proven to be}} one of the most attractive heating schemes for stellarators, as it provides net current free plasma start up and heating.

The crotch absorbers are located far from the source to reduce the synchrotron radiation power density thus the design of the cooling is simple. A program of finite element analysis is applied to simulate the thermal loading near the crotch absorber where the heat load is the highest. Normal incident of the irradiation on the absorbers is possible that the production-yields of photon stimulated desorption as well as the photoelectrons are minimized. The vacuum pumps are mounted closed to the source of outgas major coming from the absorbers and form a localized pumping in the antechamber.

40|$|Multi-bunch instabilities degrade {{beam quality}} through {{increased}} beam emittance, energy spread and even beam loss. Feedback systems {{are used to}} suppress multi-bunch instabilities associated with the resistive wall of the <b>beam</b> <b>ducts,</b> cavity-like structures, and trapped ions. A new digital transverse bunch-by-bunch feedback system has recently been commissioned at the Taiwan Light Source, and has replaced the previous analog system. The new system has the advantages that it enlarges the tune acceptance and improves damping for transverse instability at high currents, such that top-up operation is achieved. After a coupled-bunch transverse instability was suppressed, more than 350 mA was successfully stored during preliminary commissioning. In this new system, a single feedback loop simultaneously suppresses both horizontal and vertical multi-bunch instabilities. Investigating {{the characteristics of the}} feedback loop and further improving the system performances are the next short-term goals.

40|$|AbstractSteel {{pipelines}} are {{an important}} part of industrial operations in many sectors. Pipelines serve to transport media in liquid and gaseous state. Ducts, with a ratio of pipe diameter to wall thickness up to 150 are considered as simple <b>beams.</b> <b>Ducts</b> with higher ratio are considered as shell elements. In literature we can find how to calculate these structures stressed by many kinds of load. Failures, that have occurred in recent past suggest, that the issue of industrial piping design is not yet fully explored. The phenomenon presented in this study is behaviour of reinforced steel shell stressed by temperature changes. Due to high temperature load, there is a big temperature deformation of the whole system. However, the deformation caused by temperature is not the same in all parts of the system. As the high temperature source is inside the pipe, the highest temperature is on the inner surface of the shell. The variation of the temperature in the shell and partial warming of ring stiffeners is caused by heat conduction. Due to the different temperatures of the surrounding environment, the stiffener is warmed less than the shell. Therefore the shell and the stiffener are deformed in a different way. The research is, in more details, focused on the area close to the ring stiffener, where it is a higher possibility of cracks initiation and their expansion due to the cyclical stress. The aim of this study is a construction life diagnosis considering this detail; eventually a proposal of a more effective construction detail...|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of HOM-damped cavity has been {{developed}} by collaboration between the Institute for Solid State Physics of the University of Tokyo and the Photon Factory (PF) of KEK. The cavity can absorb the higher-order modes (HOM’s) by silicon carbide (SiC) beam ducts attached {{at both ends of}} the cavity. Four old cavities of the PF ring have been all replaced with the new cavities. Since then, the new cavities have been operating stably, and there is no sign of the instabilities that may come from the HOM’s in the cavities. A maximum beam current of the PF ring is pushed up to around 800 mA with these cavities, whereas the record current achieved with old cavities was around 500 mA. The cavities of the same type are planned to install in Japanese high-brilliance VUV and soft X-ray light source, Super SOR. For this ultra-low emittance ring, we have newly developed a simple HOM damper with rod-shaped coupling antenna and coaxial waveguide. The damper is attached to side port of the cavity and can absorb several HOM’s which can not be damped by the SiC <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|For a superconducting {{undulator}} with periodic length 1. 5 cm and magnet gap 5. 6 mm, {{a magnetic}} flux density 1. 4 T has been achieved, but heat loads from the image current of electrons in the storage ring and synchrotron radiation from the bending magnet are critical issues. The calculated power from the image current is about 3. 5 W/m (RRR = 60) and from the synchrotron radiation of the bending magnet is about 1. 1 W (edge-field considered). This superconducting undulator will be operated at the 3 -GeV TPS storage ring for which the operating current is 400 mA and the magnetic field of the dipole magnet is 1. 19 T. The superconducting RF cavity will be installed in the TPS such that the bunch length is only 2. 8 mm.

40|$|Internal {{gravity waves}} are {{propagating}} disturbances in a stably stratified fluid. Ubiquitous in geophysical systems, they have {{significant impact on}} both fundamental processes and engineering applications. In the ocean, for example, internal waves are a significant means of tidal dissipation, eventually affecting abyssal mixing and the global energy budget. They are also of importance in engineering fields such as deep-water oil drilling, submarine technology and acoustic communications. In the atmosphere, internal waves affect momentum and energy transport processes. While the generation of internal waves in both the ocean and the atmosphere is beginning to be well understood, what is now of great interest is the life of internal waves after their generation. More specifically, how are they dissipated, and what fundamental phenomena occur along the way ? To investigate these issues, this thesis {{presents the results of}} internal wave studies using a combination of experimental and analytical modeling, with a focus on internal wave scattering in the ocean. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the effectiveness of a novel wave generator, which comprises a series of vertically stacked plates that oscillate horizontally, in generating unidirectional plane waves/wave beams and distinct vertical modes is discussed and demonstrated in experiments. The experimental results show excellent agreement with corresponding numerical simulations, which model the wave generator as a vertical boundary on which desired velocity fields are enforced. Finally, it is shown that the Fourier transform of the spatial structure of the wave generator is a useful predictive tool for the emitted wave field. This novel technique of wave generation is then used in the experiments discussed in the remainder of the thesis. The second part of the thesis considers the viscous propagation of internal wave beams in nonuniform stratifications, and uses laboratory observations of wave <b>beam</b> <b>ducting</b> to explain the apparent vanishing of an internal wave beam at the Keana ridge, Hawaii. Furthermore, an analogy between internal wave transmission in nonuniform stratifications and light transmission in optical interferometry is established. Constructing an internal wave interferometer in the lab, selective transmission of wavelengths by nonuniform stratifications is demonstrated. In the final part of the thesis, an investigation of internal wave scattering by ocean-floor topography is carried out. An existing Green function method for internal tide generation is advanced to account for arbitrary two-dimensional topography in arbitrary nonuniform stratifications. The analytical model is then utilized to study the scattering of a mode-I internal tide by idealized topographic shapes in uniform and nonuniform stratifications. The thesis concludes with a case study of the scattering of mode- 1 internal tide at the Line Islands Ridge at Hawaii, the location of an upcoming NSF field study, the EXperiment on Internal Tide Scattering (EXITS). by Manikandan Mathur.

40|$|Using a diamond-based detector, the {{electron}} beam halo in a high-energy accelerator {{can be measured}} with a lower detection limit than that using other instruments, such as a core monitor, a dose meter, or an optical fiber. We have successfully measured an electron beam halo using diamond-based detectors operating in the ionization mode, which were installed in the <b>beam</b> <b>duct</b> to measure {{the intensity of the}} beam halo directly. Pulse-by-pulse measurements were adopted to suppress the background noise efficiently.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the superconducting (SC) wire windings of the mini-pole superconducting undulator at National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) has improved. A precise measurement of the magnetic field was undertaken to examine {{the quality of the}} wire winding. We improved the insulation between the wires and the iron pole to avoid degradation of the SC wire when the coil was trained to a large current. A coating (Teflon, layer thickness 0. 045 r 0. 02 mm) on the iron pole is capable of providing insulation to 0. 5 kV. We pasted extra tape (Teflon, thickness 0. 12 mm) on the coating layer; this tape serves as a buffer that prevents the SC wires scraping the coating layer during adjustment of the position of the SC wire during winding. A quenching experiment was performed to measure the tolerance of the coil during extra heating of the beam duct; a heater (Ni 80 Cr 20) simulated the heating of that duct with synchrotron radiation. The coil and heater were separated with tape (Kapton, thickness 0. 3 mm), stainless steel (SS, 316 L), <b>beam</b> <b>duct</b> (thickness 0. 3 mm), Al foil (thickness 0. 1 mm) and an epoxy layer.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{different}} spallation models {{implemented in the}} particle transport code PHITS on the shielding design of Transmutation Experimental Facility is investigated. For 400 -MeV proton incident on a lead-bismuth eutectic target, an effective dose rate {{at the end of}} a thick radiation shield (3 -m-thick iron and 3 -m-thick concrete) calculated by the Liège intranuclear cascade (INC) model version 4. 6 (INCL 4. 6) coupled with the GEMcode (INCL 4. 6 /GEM) yields about twice as high as the Bertini INC model (Bertini/GEM). A comparison with experimental data for 500 -MeV proton incident on a thick lead target suggest that the prediction accuracy of INCL 4. 6 /GEM would be better than that of Bertini/GEM. In contrast, it is found that the dose rates in beam ducts in front of targets calculated by the INCL 4. 6 /GEMare lower than those by the Bertini/GEM. Since both models underestimate the experimental results for neutron-production doubledifferential cross sections at 180 ◦ for 140 -MeV proton incident on carbon, iron, and gold targets, it is concluded that it is necessary to allow a margin for uncertainty caused by the spallation models, which is a factor of two, in estimating the dose rate induced by neutron streaming through a <b>beam</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|E

A 2. 56 m test copper chamber was coated with the NEG materials (we call it NEG coating here) by a magnetron sputtering. It was installed at an arc section of the KEKB positron ring, where the chamber was irradiated by direct photons with a line density of 6. 5 × 1014 photons m- 1 s- 1 mA- 1. The vacuum pressure around the test chamber during a usual beam operation was lower than the case of non-coated copper chambers by a factor of 4 - 5. The electron number around bunches was measured by a special electron monitor up to a stored beam current of 1600 mA. The measured electron current, however, was almost the same as a non-coated copper chamber, especially at low beam currents, and the effect of the NEG coating was smaller than expected. A simulation explained the result that the abundant photoelectrons in the positron ring reduce the effect of the low SEY. The maximum SEYs of the NEG coating and non-coated copper were evaluated using the simulation as about 0. 9 - 1. 0 and 1. 1 - 1. 3, respectively, which were consistent with the values after a sufficient electron bombardment.

40|$|Physics {{modelling}} {{and engineering}} analysis {{have been carried}} out to determine the operating limits of the upgraded JET neutral beam injector from duct re-ionisation and beam shine-through. The JET neutral <b>beam</b> <b>duct</b> is only 23 cm wide and 90 cm tall at its throat and yet it presently has to transmit more than 11 MW of D" 0 beam particles, resulting in power densities in excess of 200 MW/m" 2. Even at this power level, the copper duct liner can be the limiting component with respect to the pulse length of the Octant 4 injector, depending on plasma current and power. The upgrade to the Octant 8 injector in 2002 will increase the power to #approx# 15 MW of D" 0 at 130 kV, so it is necessary to determine the new limits. It is shown that at full power, the duct will become the major limiting component with respect to pulse-length for this injector. The shine-through power density and integrated energy for various in-vessel components have also been evaluated for the upgraded injector. Thermo-mechanical finite element stress calculations on elements of the ICRH antenna show that the injector can be operated at full power without further restrictions being imposed on the plasma characteristics, e. g. density and shape. For the CFC inner wall guard limiter tiles and their internal reinforcement, however, there is a bulk temperature limit and an enhancement to the existing real-time protection system is proposed.

40|$|Under a {{framework}} of JAERI-KEK joint project of high intensity proton accelerator, as for research and develop of the accelerator driven nuclear transmutation of the long lived radioactive nuclide, it is planed to built the Transmutation Physics Experiment Facility (TEF-P) and the Transmutation Engineering Experiment Facility (TEF-E). The TEF-P {{is used for the}} experiments for subcritical system coupled with a spallation neutron target bombarded with 600 -MeV proton beam accelerated by the LINAC. To limit the maximum thermal power less than 500 W at the TEF-P, an incident beam power should be less than 10 W. On the contrary, at the TEF-E, high power beam of 200 kW is requested. Both high and low power beams are demanded for the transmutation facilities. It is difficult to deliver a low power beam to the TEF-P. Conventional beam extraction technique with a thin foil, is not desirable because the scattering of the beam at the foil requires the massive shield. Therefore, we study a new technique to extract {{a small portion of the}} beam precisely from the high intensity beam by using a laser beam. By a laser beam, H sup - in the beam from LINAC is partially changed to H sup 0 beam so that a low current H sup 0 beam can be obtained. As the cross section of the charge exchange reaction for H sup - ions has a peak around at a wave length of 1 mu m for photons, YAG laser is suitable for this charge exchange because of its 1. 06 mu m wave length. It is derived that 10 W beam for 600 -MeV proton can be extracted by the YAG laser with power of 2 J for each pulse of 25 Hz. By this technique, the pulse width for the extracted beam can be controlled by changing the time width of laser irradiation. When a charge exchanger having the beam collide point existing in straight section, a background beam current of projectile, however, will be increased due to the interaction with the residual gas in the <b>beam</b> <b>duct.</b> Thus, a charge exchanger is devised having the beam collide point in a by changing this charge exchanger, it is demonstrated that the possibility of the charge exchange due to interactions with residual gas can be drastically decrease.
