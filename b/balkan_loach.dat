50|$|The <b>Balkan</b> <b>Loach</b> (Cobitis elongata) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the Cobitidae family.It is found in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, and Turkey.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the most}} recent (2008) assessment, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the <b>Balkan</b> <b>Loach's</b> status as [...] "least concern".|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: In June 2005 the <b>Balkan</b> golden <b>loach</b> Sabanejewia balcanica (Karaman, 1922) {{was found}} {{for the first time}} in Montenegro in the Lim river. Materials and Methods: Nine {{specimens}} were measured morphometrically and meristically. Seventeen morphometric characters were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mmwith callipers and four meristic characters were counted. Results: The habitats in which these specimens have been found belong to the barbell zone with clear water and gravel bottom (large stones, gravel and sand), and rarely below the roots of woody plants. In this locality, beside <b>Balkan</b> golden <b>loach,</b> 9 more species were found. Conclusions: This study is a contribution to dispersion and more detailed knowledge of morphological characteristics of <b>Balkan</b> golden <b>loach...</b>|$|R

40|$|Distribution {{patterns}} and major environmental correlations {{of the species}} of the family Cobitidae are presented here. All three species are still relativem widely distributed in Slovakia. Comparing with the past, no rapid ganges have been found. However, river regulation, pollution and the lowland amelioration affected the distribution of these species. Following {{the results of the}} occurrence of <b>Balkan</b> spined <b>loach</b> (Sabanejewia balcanica) within the mesohabitat scale, distance from source, slope, water depth and vegetation cover are the most influential variables in the proposed model. All these variables that contribute to our model explanation determine the stream morphology that affects the consequences of local temperature conditions and other abiotic factors as oxygen amount. Switching to microhabitat spatial scale, several microhabitat variables significantly influence the spatial distribution of analysed species. Depth more than 40 cm, refuges stones and point near bank (< 15 % of river width) are the most influential ones supplemented with substratum sand, substratum cobbles, substratum boulders, no refuges, refuges woody, depth 0 - 10 cm and maximum velocity none. <b>Balkan</b> spined <b>loach</b> occurs in the microhabitats occupied also by young-of-the-year (YOY) individuals and common minnow (Phoxinus [...] ...|$|R
