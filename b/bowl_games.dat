5|$|Georgia Tech has {{appeared}} in 41 <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> and ranks ninth in all time bowl wins with 23. Georgia Tech's first four bowl game appearances, the Rose Bowl (1929), Orange Bowl (1940), Cotton Bowl Classic (1943), and Sugar Bowl (1944), {{marked the first time}} a team had competed in all four of the Major <b>Bowl</b> <b>Games.</b>|$|E
5|$|Florida State's victory {{raised it}} {{to a final}} record of 84, and Virginia Tech's loss brought it also to a final record of 84. Following the loss, the Hokies had a 510 record in <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> {{including}} 13 in the Gator Bowl and 45 in <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> under head coach Frank Beamer. Florida State's victory gave Seminoles head coach Bobby Bowden the 322nd win of his career, tying him for second in the overall Division I career wins list with Bear Bryant.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} Cherry Bowl and first <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> played in Michigan. This was Army's first ever <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> and Michigan State's first <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> since 1966.|$|R
50|$|The Tournament of Roses hosted {{both the}} {{traditional}} Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>Game</b> presented by Citi and the Citi BCS National Championship Game in 2010. Vizio became the new presenting sponsor {{beginning with the}} 2011 Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>Game.</b> The 2014 Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>Game</b> will mark its 100th college <b>bowl</b> <b>game.</b> The January 1, 2015 Rose <b>Bowl</b> <b>game</b> will be a semifinal game of the College Football Playoff, replacing the BCS.|$|R
50|$|The men’s {{football}} {{team has been}} in six NJCAA <b>bowls</b> <b>games</b> since 2000. The school has won two of the six bowl games.  The first <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> won was called the Citizens Bank Bowl in 2012. The second <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> won was the Red Grange Bowl in 2016. This was the first <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> hosted by College of DuPage.|$|R
5|$|Thanks to its {{appearance}} in the Orange Bowl and a revenue-sharing agreement with other Big East schools, Virginia Tech earned $3.981 million for playing in the 1996 Orange Bowl. $3.5 million of that total came directly from the bowl, while the remaining $481,000 came from the revenue-sharing pool generated by all the Big East teams that participated in <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b> The almost-$4 million payout made Virginia Tech's football team the wealthiest of the 36 schools that participated in <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> after the 1996 season.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Tech Red Raiders {{football}} team {{has appeared in}} 37 post-season <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> since the team's inaugural season in 1925. Texas Tech has won its last four consecutive <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> and nine of its last eleven. Texas Tech's rich bowl tradition ranks 17th in all-time bowl appearances and has set many bowl game attendance records. The Red Raiders have an overall bowl record of 14 wins, 22 losses, and 1 tie.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> it became {{difficult}} to determine a national champion in a fair and equitable manner. As conferences became contractually bound to certain <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> (a situation known as a tie-in), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the Bowl Coalition, which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b> The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences—the Pac-10 and Big Ten—meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition {{was replaced by the}} Bowl Alliance, which reduced the number of <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> to host a national championship game to three—the Fiesta, Sugar, and Orange Bowls—and the participating conferences to five—the ACC, SEC, Southwest, Big Eight, and Big East. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the Big Ten, Pac-10, or the Rose Bowl, and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.|$|E
50|$|West Virginia {{would not}} make another <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> until 1938. This was Gonzaga's only <b>bowl</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
50|$|Utah State {{made just}} one more <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> in the decade. They did not win another <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> until 2012. Ball State won another MAC title in 1996, but lost. They {{did not return to}} a <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> again until 2008.|$|R
50|$|The Mountaineers {{would return}} to a <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> three years later, but wouldn't win one until 2000. TCU {{did not make a}} <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> again under Wacker, waiting 10 years for their next <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> appearance, and 14 for a bowl win.|$|R
5|$|As it grew {{beyond its}} {{regional}} affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> were created: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, the Sun Bowl in 1935, and the Cotton Bowl in 1937. In lieu {{of an actual}} national championship, these <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant {{regions of the country}} that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the Associated Press began its weekly poll of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, {{the final version of the}} AP poll was used to determine who was crowned the National Champion of college football.|$|E
5|$|College {{football}} {{maintained a}} tradition of postseason <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b> Each bowl game {{would be associated with}} a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the <b>bowl</b> <b>games</b> of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the Bowl Coalition, in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the Bowl Alliance, which gave way in 1997 to the Bowl Championship Series (BCS). The BCS arrangement proved to be controversial, and was replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff (CFP).|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Sugar Bowl {{was held}} {{under the rules}} of the Bowl Alliance. The Alliance, {{predecessor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series, was intended to match the champions of the Southeastern Conference, Big East Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, Big 12, Southwest Conference, and one at-large team against each other in the Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. Each year, the two highest-ranked teams would play in a National Championship Game held in place of one of the <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b> The site of the national championship game rotated among the three <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> as did the date of each game. Following the 1995 college football season, the Sugar Bowl was designated for December 31, marking the first time two Sugar Bowls would be held in the same calendar year.|$|E
50|$|The 1986 Gator <b>Bowl</b> <b>game</b> was a post-season college {{football}} <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> between the Stanford Cardinal and the Clemson Tigers, and was played on December 27, 1986, at Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida.

Arizona State, the South Division champions, was also a <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> loser, losing to Texas Tech 37-23 in the Holiday Bowl. The only other loser in a <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> was Washington State, losing by a slim margin to Colorado State 48-45.|$|R

50|$|Thus, Kill left NIU {{without ever}} winning a <b>bowl</b> <b>game.</b> Furthermore, {{the fact that}} Kill left NIU before the team's <b>bowl</b> <b>game</b> added fuel to the debate {{about whether or not}} the NCAA should {{prohibit}} coaches from abandoning their teams before their final <b>bowl</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R

5|$|With its win, Virginia Tech {{clinched}} {{an automatic}} bid to the 2008 Orange Bowl. This caused ripple {{effects in the}} bowl destinations for virtually every bowl-eligible ACC team. In the 2007 season, the ACC had guaranteed tie-ins with eight <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, the WAC had six bowl-eligible teams, five {{of which}} participated in <b>bowl</b> <b>games.</b> The WAC had three conference tie-ins: the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii; and the Humanitarian Bowl. Additionally, the WAC had {{provisions}} for conditional participation in the Poinsettia Bowl in San Diego, California; the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana; and the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was low, in {{part due}} to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel across the country and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous <b>bowl</b> <b>games,</b> when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E
