When Alexandru was in the 7th class grade, he has been accused for being a <b>black</b> <b>hat</b> <b>hacker</b> by a computer science teacher who wrote and submitted a request to ban him from the Computer Science classes. The principal of the school did not approve the request. In the 11th class grade he moved his studies to another high school after a scandal was sparked when some teachers accused Ionut for sending insults via others teachers' email addresses. They claimed the emails were sent by Ionuț while exploiting the vulnerabilities of wireless routers. He strongly rejected these accusations, mentioning that he had explained these vulnerabilities at University of Babes Bolyai a few days earlier in front of an academic audience among whom there were some of his teachers. Due to the lack of standardized Simple Mail Transport Protocol, nowadays anybody with some computer knowledge could send fake emails to that teachers. In July 2013, the accusations got canceled by the principal of the former high school and moreover the teachers from the former high school honored Alexandru naming a Computer Science laboratory with his name. In the 11th grade, he denied an internship offer from Google Switzerland, claiming that he wanted to work independently.
