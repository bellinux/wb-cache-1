5|$|Saban {{moved on}} to a job as head coach at Western Illinois University in 1957, where he quickly <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} team. The Western Illinois Leathernecks finished {{with a record of}} 6–1–1 in 1958, followed by an undefeated 9–0 season in 1959, when Saban also served as an assistant under Otto Graham in the College All-Star Game. Having <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 20–5–1 record over three seasons as coach, Saban drew interest from the professional ranks, and the Boston Patriots of the newly formed American Football League (AFL) hired him as head coach before the circuit's inaugural season in 1960.|$|E
5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He encouraged {{the development of}} a distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers. His poems were known for religious overtones with an emphasis on death and reunions with lost loved ones in the afterlife. Though he <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mild reputation in his day, he was soon forgotten after his death.|$|E
5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added surface marks before casting.|$|E

40|$|Since the European Commission (EC) {{decided to}} <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> own civil global {{navigation}} satellite system called Galileo, {{many people are}} asking why the EC want to <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> additional system. They say {{that they can use}} without any costs the U. S. navigation system GPS and, therefore, {{there is no need for}} the European GALILEO for the applications. But this is not really true. For some special applications GPS is not utilisable because it is no guarantee for the availability of the system...|$|R

5|$|Before the 1958 season, O'Connell, who {{lacked the}} stature and {{durability}} Paul Brown wanted in a starter, retired {{to take a}} coaching job in Illinois, and Milt Plum was named as his replacement. Cleveland, however, was relying increasingly on the running game, in contrast to its pass-happy early years under Graham. As the team <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 9–3 regular-season record, Brown in 1958 ran for 1,527yards – almost {{twice as much as}} any other back and a league record at the time.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR had <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing {{that of the}} United States. Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E

5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) from the sky. Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is <b>built</b> <b>up,</b> <b>a</b> large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Moscow had <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} that consumed {{as much as}} 25percent of the Soviet Union's gross national product {{at the expense of}} consumer goods and investment in civilian sectors. Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which saw at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years.|$|E
5|$|Octavian {{meanwhile}} <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> private army in Italy by recruiting Caesarian veterans and, on 28 November, he {{won over}} two of Antony's legions with the enticing offer of monetary gain.

5|$|On stage, Evans was {{occasionally}} {{replaced by}} the band's first manager, Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with Sherbet prior to Daryl Braithwaite. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which {{also contributed to the}} band's ill feeling toward Evans. By the middle of 1974, the band had <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> strong live reputation which led to a support slot for the visiting Lou Reed.|$|E

5|$|Sir Oliver Popplewell {{published}} his {{inquiry into the}} fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country.

5|$|The {{eruption}} was unexpected, {{and almost}} certainly began some days {{before it became}} apparent at the surface. The sea floor at the eruption site is 130metres (426ft) below sea level, and at this depth volcanic emissions and explosions would be suppressed, quenched and dissipated by the water pressure and density. Gradually, as repeated flows <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> mound of material that approached sea level, the explosions {{could no longer be}} contained, and activity broke the surface.|$|E
5|$|When Gothenburg left Port Darwin on Tuesday, 16 February 1875, Captain Robert George Augustus Pearce {{was under}} orders to make best {{possible}} speed.

He was a man of the sea, a man of sobriety and kindness and was well respected by his fellow sea captains.|$|E

5|$|After {{losing the}} first two games, Samsung Galaxy won a long third game against SK Telecom. SKT {{dominated}} {{the early stages of}} the game and <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> lead in both kills and gold. The turning point in this game was a fight over Baron, an important in-game objective, where Samsung Galaxy was able to kill half of SK Telecom's team and destroy two of their turrets afterwards. After winning a similar engagement over Baron later in the game, Samsung Galaxy was then able to quickly destroy five of SKT's defensive towers and win the game. This third game was the second-longest in competitive League of Legends history, at 71 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past.

In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had <b>built</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity.

In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
