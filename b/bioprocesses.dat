In <b>bioprocess</b> control system design, <b>bioprocess</b> model is used as a tool in many stages such as: control structure selection, stability analysis, and tuning controller parameters.

Joey Stark May 13, 2013 Professional Science Masters Degree Program California State University San Marcos Equipment {{plays an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} downstream manufacturing processes involved {{in the production of}} biological drug products. Biologics are injectable drug products that are regulated by the FDA. Any piece of equipment that comes in contact with these drug products must be qualified before use. The purpose of an equipment qualification is to ensure that it consistently meets the needs of its users. Althea Technologies recently purchased a 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System for use in the downstream manufacturing of biologics. The objective was to validate the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System so that it could be used in the manufacturing of biological drug products. To validate the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System, an installation qualification (IQ) and operational qualification (OQ) was performed. The IQ and OQ on the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System was performed using the documentation provided by the manufacturer of the system, GE Healthcare. Based on the results following the completion of the protocol, the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System met all of the required installation qualification requirements as well as all of the required operational qualification requirements. The successful completion of this protocol means that the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System is a fully operational system. However, before {{it can be used to}} manufacture biological drug products, the protocol must first be reviewed by the Quality Assurance (QA) department at Althea Technologies. The final report is for Althea Technologies use only. This final report will be submitted for review to the QA department. Based on the positive results following the execution of the protocol, Quality Assurance will be releasing the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System for use in the manufacturing of biologics. This will allow Althea Technologies to use the 3 mm <b>BioProcess</b> System as a selling point for new clients, which will increase the production of biological drug products and revenue.

40|$|<b>Bioprocess</b> design {{requires}} substantial {{resources for}} the required experimental investigation of the options for each <b>bioprocess</b> step. With the aim of {{reducing the amount of}} experimentation needed for <b>bioprocess</b> development, a new computational framework called <b>Bioprocess</b> Data and Knowledge Framework (BDKF) has been developed to explore the data and knowledge systematically. In BDKF, the representation of four types of data and knowledge i. e. experimental data, ontologies, theoretical knowledge and empirical knowledge, have been established. The experimental data is the data that comes from previous experiments. The ontologies are the systematic description of the <b>bioprocess</b> terminologies used in the experimental data and knowledge. It can organize the terminologies of a domain as a hierarchy that allows the experimental data to be searched. The theoretical knowledge is the knowledge represented by formal definitions in the <b>bioprocess,</b> such as fundamental equations. The empirical knowledge is the knowledge obtained from practical studies, e. g. the relationships between different scales established through ultra scale-down experimentation. Three reasoning functionalities, search, prediction and suggestion, have been established to imitate human reasoning on using data and knowledge. The search functionality finds relevant experimental data to the <b>bioprocess</b> design problems. With this data, the prediction functionality analyses the data and estimates the possible performance of the <b>bioprocess</b> step. The suggestion functionality produces solutions for further experiments that either confirm the solutions or narrow down the design space. A prototype applying the BDKF approach to illustrate how to capture data and knowledge and how reasoning functionalities work for the operating conditions identification was developed for a case study on centrifugation. Design queries that represented relevant process material information and separation requirements were generated to initiate the BDKF approach. The prototype demonstrated that data from strain variants and data from different scales can be utilized through ontologies, theoretical knowledge and empirical knowledge. A more complicated prototype was developed for the chromatography case study. The prototype introduced a hierarchical heuristic approach to solve the chromatographic process design problems, such as column selection, buffer composition identification and operating conditions determination. This prototype demonstrated that BDKF can be used for both screening and optimisation to propose several potential <b>bioprocess</b> solutions. Evaluation results of each prototype showed that the BDKF approach can make good performance predictions and suggestions for further experiments. It is very promising as an early stage process development tool. Finally, a method for finding a design solution for a giving sequence by using mass balance calculations has been developed. A case study including centrifugation, filtration and chromatography has been examined. This demonstrated that BDKE method had the potential to allow all of the data and knowledge to be used for the whole <b>bioprocess</b> design. Therefore, the BDKF approach can provide a systematic way to harness <b>bioprocess</b> data and knowledge to enhance the efficiency of <b>bioprocess</b> development...|$|R
