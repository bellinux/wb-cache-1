500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> badly off we must blame you for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E
500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E

[...] Noting the singles [...] "Goodies," [...] "1, 2 Step," [...] and [...] "Oh" [...] as {{standout}} tracks, Allmusic gave the album {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Steve Jones of USA Today said, [...] "The voice doesn't blow you away, but as with Goodies, she takes a lyrically intriguing offbeat path from time to time. Though not every song is a goodie, she does have a few treats in store." [...] Even though he said the album wasn't a perfect work, Azeem Ahmad of musicOMH said, [...] "The talent is obviously there <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to carry out Ciara's wish of forgetting about [...] "the other chicks" [...] then there's some fine-tuning needed. For now there's no direct threat to any other hip-hop divas, but the void left by Aaliyah is still there for someone to try and fill. There's no reason why Ciara can't one day hold her own with the best." [...] Jalylah Burrell of PopMatters commented that [...] "Goodies is nothing new, but it is executed well." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the First World War, J.K. and the Government of the Gold Coast {{felt the}} need for an {{advanced}} education. As Guggisberg put it, [...] "In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local demagogues, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes." ...|$|E
