5|$|The most {{prominent}} icon representing the wing is the Connecticut Wing's patch, with an ultramarine blue background and bearing {{the image of}} its mascot, Connie the Search and Rescue Dog. The wing patch was required to be worn on the left sleeve of the <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> uniform until 2006 when National Headquarters made it optional.|$|E
5|$|Anachronism {{is a major}} {{component}} of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish <b>battle</b> <b>dress,</b> Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna. Then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.|$|E

5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E

The series was created in the period between 1995 and 1997. The entire installation measures 75” by 25” and is done on Vellum using ink and watercolor medium.|$|R
50|$|Baade {{became a}} legend in the Afrika Korps and was known to go into <b>battle</b> <b>dressed</b> in a Scottish kilt and {{carrying}} a claymore, a double-edged broadsword. In May 1942 he {{took part in the}} Battle of Bir Hakeim. Baade was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions during the battle. He was wounded on 28 July 1942 at El-Alamein, and evacuated to Germany.|$|R
25|$|After the Korean War, khaki {{utilities}} {{were replaced}} by olive drab versions, which were in turn replaced in the mid-70s by ERDL pattern uniforms. The <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Uniform became the standard utilities in the early 1980s, with the woodland and 6-color desert patterns available. After the Gulf War, the 3-color desert pattern was developed to address deficiencies, and worn until the MCCUU was adopted in 2000.|$|E
25|$|The Desert <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Uniform (DBDU) is a U.S. arid-environment {{camouflage}} battle uniform {{that was}} used by the United States Armed Forces from the early 1980s to the early to mid 1990s, most notably during the Persian Gulf War. Although the U.S. military has long since abandoned the pattern, it is still in widespread use by militaries across the world as of the early 2010s.|$|E
25|$|First {{unveiled}} in June 2004, {{it is the}} successor to the <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Uniform (BDU) and Desert Camouflage Uniform (DCU) worn from the 1980s and 1990s through the early 2000s, respectively. The ACU and its component materials are manufactured by the existing industrial infrastructure which produced the now-obsolete BDU. Official military-grade ACUs are made of 50% nylon and 50% cotton. All other blends are not official issue.|$|E
50|$|A field <b>dressing</b> or <b>battle</b> <b>dressing</b> {{is a kind}} of bandage {{intended}} to be carried by soldiers for immediate use in case of (typically gunshot) wounds. It consists of a large pad of absorbent cloth, attached to the middle of a strip of thin fabric used to bind the pad in place. Field dressings are issued in sealed waterproof pouches to keep them clean and dry; the pouch can be torn open when required.|$|R
50|$|Dances {{are usually}} intricate, highly {{developed}} traditions throughout Mozambique. There {{are many different}} kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out <b>battles</b> <b>dressed</b> in animal skins. The men of Makua dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women {{in the northern part of}} the country perform a traditional dance called tufo, to celebrate Islamic holidays.|$|R
50|$|The Battle of Rovine {{took place}} on 17 May 1395. The Wallachian army led by Voivod Mircea cel Bătrân (Mircea the Elder) opposed the Ottoman {{invasion}} personally led by Sultan Bayezid I the Lightning. The Turkish force heavily outnumbered the Wallachian troops. The legend says that {{on the eve of}} the <b>battle,</b> <b>dressed</b> as a peace emissary, Mircea cel Bătrân talked to Bayezid asking him to leave Wallachia and promising him safe passage back. The Sultan proudly insisted on fighting.|$|R
25|$|The costumes {{demonstrate}} {{a blend of}} period and contemporary fashion, often disregarding historical accuracy altogether, with one character wearing cargo trousers and wielding Japanese swords. Marion sometimes wears a shrug (a clothing item from the mid-2000s), and modern berets are also anachronistically used by soldiers in the series' last episode. In the Series 1, Episode 10, Harold wears Desert <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Uniform camouflage pants which were not introduced until 1962.|$|E
25|$|The Desert <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Uniform was {{designed}} in 1976 {{and uses a}} camouflage pattern known as the Six-Color Desert Pattern or colloquially as Chocolate-Chip Camouflage and Cookie Dough Camouflage. The camouflage received its nickname because it resembles chocolate-chip cookie dough. It {{is made up of}} a base pattern of light tan overlaid with broad swathes of pale green and wide two-tone bands of brown. Clusters of black-on-white spots are scattered over, to mimic the appearance of pebbles and their shadows.|$|E
25|$|In Northern Ireland {{the provincial}} {{government}} had placed the LDV {{under the control of}} the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The police held large stocks of black cloth in reserve, for use by the Ulster Special Constabulary in the event of large-scale civil insurgency. This black cloth was quickly made up into uniforms in the style of the denim overalls by the many clothing factories in the province. The Ulster Home Guard kept their black uniforms until <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> began to be issued in April 1941.|$|E

The corpsmen also provide routine medical/dental care to the crew and embarked personnel. Major medical facilities include four main and two emergency operating rooms, four dental operating rooms, x-ray rooms, a blood bank, laboratories, and patient wards. In addition, three <b>battle</b> <b>dressing</b> stations are located throughout the ship, {{as well as a}} casualty collecting area at the flight deck level. Medical elevators rapidly transfer casualties from the flight deck and hangar bay to the medical facilities.|$|R
50|$|Today, the Dental Corps {{continues}} to maintain high operational readiness for operations in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The dental community is aggressively integrating {{with both the}} medical and line communities {{to prepare for the}} latest challenge, Homeland Defense. They deploy routinely with Marine Expeditionary Units and aboard ships, where beyond their dental duties, they assume roles in triage and surgical support at Marine Battalion Aid Stations and <b>Battle</b> <b>Dressing</b> Stations. Dental personnel continue to {{play a significant role in}} peacekeeping and nation-building through humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions in third world countries.|$|R
5000|$|... "Colonel Stuart {{and myself}} were riding {{at the head}} of the column as the grand {{panorama}} opened before us, and there right in front, about seventy yards distant, and in strong relief against the smoke beyond, stretched a brilliant line of scarlet - a regiment of New York Zouaves in column of fours, marching out of the Sudley road to attack the flank of our line of <b>battle.</b> <b>Dressed</b> in scarlet caps and trousers, blue jackets with quantities of gold buttons, and white gaiters, with a fringe of bayonets swaying above them as they moved, their appearance was indeed magnificent." ...|$|R
25|$|Erste Invasion (First Invasion). As {{the sound}} bombs {{continue}} to detonate, approaching signals of trumpets and trombones can be heard. Lucifer's troops, wearing {{black and red}} <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> invade the hall, pursued by Michael's trumpeter troops, dressed in light blue and red. As the combatants move to and fro, the Lucifer troops succeed in removing some of the camouflage from the precipice, revealing a chrome bunker wall. The combat moves off to the right, the bass detonations cease, the music flak falls silent, and the melancholy Wednesday segment of Eve's formula in the octophonic music suffuses the space.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Greece, kouros sculptures {{from the}} archaic period depict men wearing dreadlocks while Spartan hoplites wore formal locks {{as part of}} their <b>battle</b> <b>dress.</b> Spartan magistrates known as Ephors also wore their hair braided in long locks, an Archaic Greek {{tradition}} that was steadily abandoned in other Greek kingdoms. The style was worn by Ancient Christian Ascetics in the Middle East and Mediterranean, and the Dervishes of Islam, among others. Some of the very earliest adherents of Christianity in the Middle East may have worn this hairstyle; there are descriptions of James the Just, first Bishop of Jerusalem, who is said to have worn them to his ankles.|$|E
25|$|In December 1944, {{after the}} German Army {{had been driven}} from the area, men working in the forest near St Sauvant {{discovered}} an area of broken branches and disturbed earth. They started to examine the site and discovered what remained {{of a number of}} bodies. The local police force were informed and on 18 December started excavating the grave. A number of corpses were still wearing Allied uniform; most of their identity tags had been removed but two remained which identified them as members of Operation Bulbasket, while another was identified by his name inside the <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> tunic. A further body in civilian clothing was identified as that of Second Lieutenant Bundy.|$|E
50|$|Early in the Battle of Tassafaronga, New Orleans took a torpedo hit in her port bow which {{exploded}} two {{magazines and}} blew off the forward {{part of the}} ship back to No. 2 turret. Assigned to the forward battle repair party, Marts was gravely injured by the blast and fires. However, in complete disregard for his own safety, he assisted in carrying an injured medical officer to the <b>battle</b> <b>dressing</b> station amidships where he collapsed from loss of blood and exhaustion. He died from his wounds shortly afterward. For extreme gallantry and self-sacrificing devotion to a stricken comrade, Marts was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.|$|R

25|$|In certain duty stations, Navy {{personnel}} are issued woodland or desert utility uniforms. These {{were similar to}} the other military services' utility uniforms. The Navy {{is in the process}} of phasing out woodland-pattern and three-color desert <b>Battle</b> <b>Dress</b> Utilities in favor of combat uniforms in digital Type II (desert) and Type III (woodland) camouflage based on, but using different colors from, the Marine Corps' MARPAT. Currently issue of Type II is restricted to SEALs and SWCC crews; Type III is issued to personnel such as Seabees and aviation support crew stationed ashore in desert combat zones. In August 2016 the Navy announced that Type III would be issued to all Navy personnel ashore in lieu of the blue Type I NWU, which is to be phased out.|$|E
25|$|A radio drama {{based on}} the {{original}} Metal Gear Solid aired in Japan from 1998 to 1999 as part of Konami's syndicated clud DB program. Directed by Shuyo Murata and written by Motosada Mori, the serial lasted over 12 weekly installments spanning three story arcs. The series was later collected as a two-volume set. The series serves as an alternate continuation {{to the events of}} Shadow Moses, with Solid Snake, Meryl Silverburgh, Mei Ling and Roy Campbell going on further missions as FOXHOUND operatives (Mei Ling and Meryl are depicted wearing a <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> uniform and a sneaking suit respectively), although the stories are not considered part of the mainstream Metal Gear canon. The Japanese voice actors from the game reprised their roles for the series, while new characters are introduced as well.|$|E
25|$|WO's and Officer ranks {{received}} updated shoulder rank epaulettes (and for the Navy, cuff rank insignia) and all General Officer and Flag Officer rank insignia now reflecting service affiliation in {{the duty}} dress uniform (the old pattern epaulettes {{were replaced by}} the army green, air force blue and navy blue epaulettes (duty dress depending on service) and gold (parade dress) epaulettes {{similar to those used}} in the mid 1970s by the Soviet Armed Forces). This was also the case for the Marshal of the Russian Federation rank epaulette, which still retained the Coat of arms of Russia and the Marshal's Star. But this change is now evident in the <b>battle</b> <b>dress</b> and duty uniforms only, in the new 2008 dress uniforms the change is evident in the enlisted and NCO epaulettes, but in the epaulettes of all warrant officers and officers the gold and black epaulettes stayed as is in the dress uniforms.|$|E
50|$|Until {{the rise}} of the New Model Army, {{military}} musicians were solely employed as servants by the nobility, who often maintained their own private armies of armed men, and their minstrels. At times of war, both groups were deployed in <b>battle,</b> <b>dressed</b> in uniforms. The role of the 'bandsmen' was to support the fighting troops by boosting their morales, typically advancing (walking, not marching) onto the battlefield ahead of the columns of troops, and acting as stretcher bearers. The role of stretcher bearer is found with musicians and bandsmen worldwide, however, in the British Army, they are properly trained medical assistants, able to serve in field hospitals, and performing minor surgery (as required), as well as first-aid, and administering injections and medicines.|$|R

6000|$|The verb [Greek: thoraesestai], {{the theory}} runs on, merely meant [...] "to put on body clothing," [...] which Mycenaeans in works of art, if {{correctly}} represented, do not usually put on; they fought naked or in bathing drawers.

These arguments appear rather unconvincing, [Footnote: Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol. xx. pp. 149, 150.] nor does Mycenaean art instruct us that men went into <b>battle</b> <b>dressed</b> in body clothing which was thickly set with many glittering gold ornaments, and was called [...] "a many- glittering thorex." ...|$|R
