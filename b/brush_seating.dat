The subjects had mild peri-implantitis defined as radiographic bone loss of 1 – 2  mm, pocket probing depth (PPD) ≥ 4  mm {{and a positive}} bleeding on probing (mBoP) score. The patients were clinically examined at baseline and after 2, 4, 12 and 24  weeks, and radiographs were taken at baseline and at 3 and 6  months. Treatment of the implants with the chitosan <b>brush</b> <b>seated</b> in an oscillating dental drill piece was performed at baseline and at 3  months. Reductions in the clinical parameters (PPD and mBoP) were compared between baseline and the later examination time points.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Railway axles have {{typically}} {{been designed for}} an infinite life, with a normal maximum service life of 40 years. However, some axles have failed in service. This paper describes five axles that have failed in service {{and the consequences of}} the failures, and suggests causes of the failures. Most had resulted from the slow growth of fatigue cracks across the axles. Electrical arcing, corrosion and stress corrosion cracking had initiated the fatigue cracks. An axle containing small cracks has been returned to service and the crack sizes regularly monitored. It is concluded that more information on axles is required and it is recommended that information on the loads, stresses and materials data should be obtained so that guidance for the design of axles can be updated. It is also recommended that earth return <b>brush</b> <b>seats</b> should be regularly tested for cracks and all axles regularly visually inspected for corrosion...|$|R

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect on peri-implant mucosal inflammation from the use of a novel instrument made of chitosan in the non-surgical treatment of mild peri-implantitis across several clinical centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this 6 -month multicenter prospective consecutive case series performed in six different periodontal specialist clinics, 63 implants in 63 patients were finally included. The subjects had mild peri-implantitis defined as radiographic bone loss of 1 - 2  mm, pocket probing depth (PPD) ≥ 4  mm and a positive bleeding on probing (mBoP) score. The patients were clinically examined at baseline and after 2, 4, 12 and 24  weeks, and radiographs were taken at baseline and at 3 and 6  months. Treatment of the implants with the chitosan <b>brush</b> <b>seated</b> in an oscillating dental drill piece was performed at baseline and at 3  months. Reductions in the clinical parameters (PPD and mBoP) were compared between baseline and the later examination time points. RESULTS: Significant reductions in both PPD and mBoP were observed at all time points compared with the baseline clinical measurements (p <  0. 001). The mean PPD and mBoP at baseline were 5. 15  mm (4. 97; 5. 32) and 1. 86 (1. 78; 1. 93), respectively, whereas the mean PPD and mBoP at 6  months were 4. 0  mm (3. 91; 4. 19) and 0. 64 (0. 54; 0. 75), respectively. Stable reductions in PPD and mBoP were evident up to 6  months after the initial treatment and 3  months after the second treatment. All 63 implants were reported to have stable radiographic levels of osseous support. CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrated that an oscillating chitosan brush is safe to use and seems to have merits in the non-surgical treatment of dental implants with mild peri-implantitis. To measure the effectiveness of the method, a multicenter randomized clinical trial needs to be undertaken...|$|R
50|$|Initially, the Avenger was {{available}} as a four-door saloon in DL, Super and GL trim levels. The DL and Super could be had with either the 1250 or 1500 cc engines, but the GL was only available with the 1500 cc engine. Since the DL was the basic model in the range, it featured little more than rubber mats and a very simple dashboard with a strip-style speedometer. The Super was a bit better equipped, featuring carpets, armrests, twin horns and reversing lights, though the dashboard was carried over from the DL. The top-spec GL model featured four round headlights (which was a big improvement over the rectangular ones from the Hillman Hunter that were used on the DL and Super), internal bonnet release, two-speed wipers, <b>brushed</b> nylon <b>seat</b> trim (previously never used on British cars), reclining front seats, and a round-dial dashboard with extra instrumentation.|$|R
40|$|Data {{concerning}} 19 health-related behaviours {{and associated}} beliefs {{were collected by}} questionnaire from 282 students in the Netherlands on two occasions over one year. While all behaviours showed moderate stability, there were variations {{in the degree of}} change. The highest stability was reported for sleep time, tooth <b>brushing</b> frequency, <b>seat</b> belt usage and health care service utilization. The least stable behaviours included regular exercise and various dietary measures. Predictors of changes in smoking, dietary fat intake, alcohol consumption and regular exercise were analysed in detail. Beliefs assessed at year 1 in the importance of these activities for health predicted changes in behaviour over the study year independently of prior behaviour levels. Awareness of the risks associated with behaviours, and explicit wishes to modify behaviour patterns (eg stop smoking, exercise more), did not predict change from year 1 to year 2. The results indicated that health behaviours vary in their stability, and that health beliefs may predict future health behaviour changes...|$|R
50|$|In March 1975 the two-door {{version was}} dropped: the four-door model {{continued}} in production for another year, but in improved specification form. The existing Triumph Herald three-rail type gearbox {{was replaced with}} a Triumph Spitfire 1500 type single-rail gearbox and the car was fitted with a new clutch. The new look Toledo was also fitted with side body trims, new look black type front grille (replacing the silver type front grille) and a stainless trim {{was added to the}} side roof guttering. The specification again improved; standard equipment now included a rear-view dipping mirror, fasten seat belt warning light, reclining front seats (previously an option), twin reversing lights (also previously an option), cigar lighter, hazard warning lights and a driver's exterior door mirror. A laminated windscreen, front head rests and <b>brushed</b> nylon <b>seat</b> facings were optional extras. The Toledo was finally replaced by the Dolomite 1300 and 1500 in March 1976. Total production was 119,182 cars, making it one of Triumph's best-selling small saloon cars.|$|R

6000|$|Her {{description}} of her aunt {{had not been}} incorrect; the Countess Gemini was further than ever from having folded her wings. She entered {{the room with a}} flutter through the air and kissed Isabel first on the forehead and then on each cheek as if according to some ancient prescribed rite. She drew the visitor to a sofa and, looking at her with a variety of turns of the head, began to talk very much as if, <b>seated</b> <b>brush</b> in hand before an easel, she were applying a series of considered touches to a composition of figures already sketched in. [...] "If you expect me to congratulate you I must beg you to excuse me. I don't suppose you care if I do or not; I believe you're supposed not to care--through being so clever--for all sorts of ordinary things. But I care myself if I tell fibs; I never tell them unless there's something rather good to be gained. I don't see what's to be gained with you--especially as you wouldn't believe me. I don't make professions any more than I make paper flowers or flouncey lampshades--I don't know how. My lampshades would be sure to take fire, my roses and my fibs to be larger than life. I'm very glad for my own sake that you're to marry Osmond; but I won't pretend I'm glad for yours. You're very brilliant--you know that's the way you're always spoken of; you're an heiress and very good-looking and original, not banal; so it's a good thing to have you in the family. Our family's very good, you know; Osmond will have told you that; and my mother was rather distinguished--she was called the American Corinne. But we're dreadfully fallen, I think, and perhaps you'll pick us up. I've great confidence in you; there are ever so many things I {{want to talk to you}} about. I never congratulate any girl on marrying; I think they ought to make it somehow not quite so awful a steel trap. I suppose Pansy oughtn't to hear all this; but that's what she has come to me for--to acquire the tone of society. There's no harm in her knowing what horrors she may be in for. When first I got an idea that my brother had designs on you I thought of writing to you, to recommend you, in the strongest terms, not to listen to him. Then I thought it would be disloyal, and I hate anything of that kind. Besides, as I say, I was enchanted for myself; and after all I'm very selfish. By the way, you won't respect me, not one little mite, and we shall never be intimate. I should like it, but you won't. Some day, all the same, we shall be better friends than you will believe at first. My husband will come and see you, though, as you probably know, he's on no sort of terms with Osmond. He's very fond of going to see pretty women, but I'm not afraid of you. In the first place I don't care what he does. In the second, you won't care a straw for him; he won't be a bit, at any time, your affair, and, stupid as he is, he'll see you're not his. Some day, if you can stand it, I'll tell you all about him. Do you think my niece ought to go out of the room? Pansy, go and practise a little in my boudoir." ...|$|R
