60|$|STANTON (with a laugh). Yes, we're {{strictly}} anti-Cupid, sir, {{from top}} to <b>bottom,</b> (<b>Turning</b> {{to the door to}} the hall.) And now, if you don't mind, Mr. Sloan, I'm going to turn you loose to wander about the grounds on an unconducted tour. To-day is my busy morning--Saturday. We weigh each patient immediately after breakfast.|$|E
60|$|After {{studying}} this fundamental enactment to the <b>bottom,</b> <b>turning</b> it on every side, and finally considering it upside-down, I {{came to the}} conclusion that its tenor was, on the whole, rather more favorable than unfavorable to the Horizontal doctrine. It struck me, a very good argument was to be made out of the constitutional question, and that it presented a very fair occasion for a new member to venture on a maiden speech. Having so settled the matter, entirely to my own satisfaction, I held myself in reserve, waiting for the proper moment to produce an effect.|$|E
60|$|The {{contents}} of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained. At this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully. It was fine washing, and he washed fine and finer, with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch. At last the pan seemed empty of everything but water; but with a quick semi-circular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream, he disclosed a layer of black sand {{on the bottom of}} the pan. So thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint. He examined it closely. In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck. He dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan. With a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the <b>bottom,</b> <b>turning</b> the grains of black sand over and over. A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort.|$|E
5000|$|Richards' {{nickname}} was [...] "the wounded seagull," [...] {{due to his}} tall frame, {{and unusual}} style of making <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> and cutbacks with his arms splayed out awkwardly behind his back.|$|R
50|$|An average day in Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>turns</b> sour for SpongeBob SquarePants {{when he gets}} {{sucked into}} a mysterious portal. Several other Nicktoons are also {{snatched}} away from their own worlds and all are soon stranded in a mysterious laboratory.|$|R
5000|$|When a HIR page in Stack S is accessed, {{it turns}} into a LIR page and {{accordingly}} the LIR page currently at Stack S’s <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> into a HIR page and moves to the top of Stack Q. For example, Graph (c) is produced after page E is accessed on Graph (a).|$|R
50|$|Before {{performing}} the trick, the magician secretly notes the bottom card of the deck. Then, {{he puts the}} cards {{behind his back and}} turns the top card face up. While showing the bottom card to the audience (and announcing its value) he notes the value of the top card which is facing him. The next time he puts the deck behind his back, he moves the top card to the <b>bottom</b> (<b>turning</b> it over in the process, so that it will face the right way) and turns the new top card face up. Again, he announces the value of the bottom card while seeing the value of the face up top card. This can be repeated as long as is desired. When the magician desires to stop, he will move the face up top card to the <b>bottom</b> (<b>turning</b> it over) and leave the top card face down, and make one last announcement of the bottom card's value. All of the cards are now facing the same direction and there is nothing for the audience to find if the cards are examined.|$|E
50|$|After {{arriving}} back in Fremantle on 10 January 1943, the boat got underway 15 days later for her seventh war patrol, with four torpedoes {{short of a}} normal load. At 11:00 on 14 February, Thresher made contact with a Japanese I-65 class submarine east of Thwartway Island. She launched two torpedoes; one was a dud, and the other exploded on the ocean <b>bottom.</b> <b>Turning</b> north and firing deck guns, Threshers adversary soon disappeared over the horizon.|$|E
5000|$|Surrounded {{by family}} and friends, Deneen took his first turns on skis {{at the age of}} 11 months, two months after he began walking. His father had brought him to a ski shop asking for the {{smallest}} skis they had, and had to stuff newspaper in the boots {{in order for them to}} fit. [...] "The boot-fitter was just shaking his head," [...] said Deneen's father. After his father found the flattest slope near the lodge, Deneen skied down toward his mother who was at the <b>bottom,</b> <b>turning</b> along the way as people called his name.|$|E
50|$|A French {{invention}} used {{in sugar}} production {{to move the}} partially processed sugar liquid up a pipe to {{the next stage of}} purification. Hence the name “monte-jus” or “raise juice”. Unlike the acid egg, it traditionally consists of a vertical cylindrical vessel made of steel, with a pipe from the <b>bottom</b> <b>turned</b> upwards, and it is pressurized by steam.|$|R
50|$|German Streuselkuchen {{is usually}} a flat cake made on a baking tray and cut into oblong pieces. It should be very flat - about one inch - so crumbs make about 50% of its height. Yeast dough is the original; a short crust is possible, too, and a puff pastry at the <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> it into a Prasselkuchen.|$|R
50|$|In June 1990, {{the cover}} of Surfing Magazine shocked the surfing {{community}} with a photo of Allen doing a <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> on a 20+ ft wave. Until that cover came out, big wave surfing was all about taking the drop and getting out alive. He performed stunt work for Heath Ledger in the 2005 Lords of Dogtown film.|$|R
25|$|The fairy {{magic was}} {{represented}} by circus tricks. For example, the fairies entered on trapeze bars, and the love potion that Puck fetches was a spinning plate on a rod, which Puck handed to Theseus from a trapeze fifteen feet above the stage. When <b>Bottom</b> <b>turned</b> into an ass, he acquired not the traditional ass's head, but a clown's red nose.|$|R
5000|$|By the mid 1930s, Kekai {{had risen}} {{in the ranks}} of surfing devotees as he innovated drop-knee <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> and hotdogging on shortboards, and surfed on finless boards called [...] "hot curls". He is often {{mentioned}} as having been the top hot curl wave rider of his day. At this time he also began surfing on the North Shore, which is still a popular world-class surf spot.|$|R

50|$|The last racing {{took place}} at Wye on 2 May 1974 and the course closed {{permanently}} in June 1975. The Jockey Club had insisted upon changes to the course in August 1974, including changing the camber of the <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> and improving the grandstand. However, the owners were unable to fund these changes, leading to closure. Wye was a very small, oval track, less than 1 mile (1.6 km) round.|$|R
50|$|The {{bodyboard}} {{differs from}} a surfboard {{in the fact}} that it is much shorter (typically 38 to 43 in in length) and made out of different types of foam. The modern board consists of a foam 'core' encapsulated by a plastic bottom, a softer foam top known as the deck, softer foam sides known as the rails. The core is made of dow/polyethylene, arcel, or Polypro/polypropylene. The bottom is made of Surlyn or Bixby. The deck is made of 8LB or CrossLink. Each type of foam core, deck, or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control. Speed from the <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> is increased when a bodyboarder <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> and the board flexes and recoils, releasing energy. If the board flexes too little or too easily, speed is lost. Dow (polyethylene) cores are best suited to cooler waters as they can be too flexible in warm water. Arcel and Polypro (polypropylene) cores are best suited for warmer waters due to their increased overall stiffness.|$|R
50|$|Having been {{compressed}} {{under the}} enormous {{weight of the}} glaciers, terrain in Finland is rising due to the post-glacial rebound. The effect is strongest around the Gulf of Bothnia, where land steadily rises about 1 cm a year. As a result, the old sea <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> little by little into dry land: the surface {{area of the country}} is expanding by about 7 km2 annually. Relatively speaking, Finland is rising from the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "The iron-rod gunwale {{may now be}} put in, and the 2 inches {{width of}} tin, allowed in excess on the sides and ends of the <b>bottom,</b> <b>turned</b> down closely over the rod, all round and {{soldered}} on the inside. The side elevation of the boat will now be as w x y, fig. IV. [...] "The boat should be proved as to being water-tight by filling it with water, any leak being stopped by more solder.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} (and the original) {{route to}} the Big Pitch is also accessed {{from the bottom of}} the entrance pitch. A wide bedding passage leads to the right. Across the other side a 3 m climb leads to a 10 m pitch. At the bottom of this a thin rift drops into a low bedding which soon enlarges and morphs into Whitehall, a high rift passage. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> left to arrive at the back of the platform overlooking the Big Pitch.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that is true, {{but there}} is a vast {{difference}} between laughing and smiling under water. But is it not singular that you should doubt the only incident in the story which I personally verified? I happened to be in lodgings at the seaside while writing that story, and, after penning the passage you refer to, I went down to the shore, pulled off my clothes, dived to the <b>bottom,</b> <b>turned</b> on my back, and, looking up, I smiled and winked." ...|$|R
50|$|Most boards on {{the market}} today contain one, two, or three rods (usually of carbon or graphite), {{referred}} to as stringers, to strengthen the board, reduce deformation, add stiffness and recoil to the core, thus providing greater speed off <b>bottom</b> <b>turns</b> and transitions on the wave. If a single stringer is used, it is placed {{in the center of the}} board running parallel to the rails. If two are used, they are placed symmetrically about the y-axis. Triple stringers are a combination of the placement of both a single and double stringer.|$|R
50|$|Fa Peng (vase) Rock {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous tor in Hong Kong. The rocks were {{originally}} below the ground surface. As the main rock type in Cheung Chau is granite, chemical weathering can easily take place. Due to the presence of deep weathering profiles, granite layer on the top turned into fine-sized soil by spheroidal weathering, and granite on the <b>bottom</b> <b>turned</b> into big, rounded corestones. When the overlying soil was removed by external medium such as wind and rain, the corestone piled up and formed this vase-looking tor. Honeycomb weathering has also been taking place on Fa Peng Rock ongoingly.|$|R
5000|$|Joey Logano {{scored the}} pole {{for the race}} {{with a time of}} 26.216 and a speed of 137.321 mph. He said after his run he {{believed}} he [...] "had a pretty good (Turns) 1 and 2, I was able to hook the <b>bottom.</b> (<b>Turns)</b> 3 and 4 is where nothing went right. I didn’t think {{it was going to be}} quite good enough. I pushed as hard as I could. Sometimes you overdrive it a little bit and you can still make some speed. Proud of this team and proud of the all-Ford front row. That’s a pretty special deal.” ...|$|R

50|$|Removing the {{sprocket}} {{is done by}} {{reversing the}} chain fold {{so that it is}} on the <b>bottom,</b> and <b>turning</b> the wheel forwards so that the sprocket turns counterclockwise. This is called the Reverse Rotafix.|$|R
500|$|A {{few days}} later, the Krusty Krab's {{business}} quickly dwindles {{due to the}} highway. Believing {{that no one will}} come to the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs decides to finally give Plankton the Krabby Patty formula. Mere seconds before he does, however, the jellyfish from Jellyfish Fields invade Bikini Bottom and start attacking civilians. Seeing {{this as an opportunity to}} demolish the highway, SpongeBob makes an appeal to the people, who agree to destroy it. Everybody in Bikini <b>Bottom</b> <b>turns</b> against Plankton and destroys the pavement and the columns of the highway. [...] Plankton, who thinks his highway is unremovable, tries to save it but gets run over. [...] Jellyfish Fields is restored instantly to its natural state.|$|R
50|$|Richards made a {{decision}} to go. At 17 years old and without Waimea experience nobody would have thought less of him if he didn't, but he felt to walk away would end his hopes of surfing professionally, and put him back in Newcastle at some unappealing apprenticeship. He went with survival uppermost in his mind, and reckoned his first wave twice as big as anything he'd surfed before. By the end of the heat he was game enough on the monsters to actually <b>bottom</b> <b>turn,</b> yet was glad not to reach the final and have to go back out. In time he came to enjoy big waves, without being regarded as a big-wave specialist.|$|R
5000|$|This basic six set, {{also known}} as a [...] "six pack", was also adopted by {{commercial}} aviation. After the Second World War the arrangement was changed to: (top row) airspeed, artificial horizon, altimeter, (<b>bottom</b> row) <b>turn</b> and bank indicator, heading indicator, vertical speed.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a little}} stream of water, coming down the hill {{in the middle of}} the road, and forming a long pool at the <b>bottom.</b> Jonas <b>turned</b> his horse to one side, to avoid this pool of water, and waited until Oliver came up.|$|R
5000|$|Entrepreneurs {{began to}} provide {{solutions}} as the winter progressed. Steps were {{cut into the}} ice at the Chilkoot Pass {{which could be used}} for a daily fee, this 1,500 step staircase becoming known as the [...] "Golden Steps". By December 1897, Archie Burns built a tramway up the final parts of the Chilkoot Pass. A horse at the <b>bottom</b> <b>turned</b> a wheel, which pulled a rope running to the top and back; freight was loaded on sledges pulled by the rope. Five more tramways soon followed, one powered by a steam engine, charging between 8 and 30 cents ($2 and $8) per 1 lb. An aerial tramway was built in the spring of 1898, able to move 9 tonnes of goods an hour up to the summit.|$|R
60|$|If knights errant {{were to be}} believed, not all castles were {{desirable}} {{places to}} seek hospitality in. As a matter of fact, knights errant were not persons to be believed--that is, measured by modern standards of veracity; yet, measured {{by the standards of}} their own time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth. It was very simple: you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent; the rest was fact. Now after making this allowance, the truth remained that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing the door-bell--I mean hailing the warders--it was the sensible thing to do. So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman making the <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> of the road that wound down from this castle.|$|R

5000|$|When {{water is}} finally added, {{it should be}} given generously, and the rice is then finally put to boil (do not stir it any more time, unless it is desired to make another dish with this rice that {{includes}} some form of previously boiling sauce still exposed to heat); in the case it evaporates before the rice is at a texture appropriate to human chewing, more water should be added when noises of vapor bubbles heard coming from the <b>bottom</b> <b>turn</b> more violent than usual as rice finding the overly heated pot contributes to the sounds (it sounds a bit more like deep-frying, though with a more sultry and less [...] "watery" [...] characteristic to the sound). Heating is lowered a bit before such a process starts, preferentially (some 5-10 minutes, practice gives use to the right time).|$|R
