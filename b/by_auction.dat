5|$|In March 1954, Air Kruise {{applied for}} {{permission}} to operate Dakotas on routes between Lympne and Le Touquet, Calais and Ostend. On 29 April, the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation offered Lympne for sale <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> in London. Bidding reached £88,000 but the reserve was £100,000 and the airport was not sold. On 28 August, Silver City Airways trialled a Westland-Sikorsky WS-51 helicopter on cross-Channel flights. Permission had been granted {{for the use of}} these aircraft for freight operations and it was intended to introduce them on 1 April 1955. On 3 October, Silver City Airways operated their last flight out of Lympne as operations were being transferred to the new Lydd (Ferryfield) Airport which had opened on 6 July 1954. A total of 33,487 car ferry flights had been made from Lympne since the service had started in 1948. As of 1 November, Lympne closed as a public airport, although private flying was allowed as long as no passengers were carried for hire or reward.|$|E
5|$|The mill was {{worked by}} Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He {{inherited}} the mill {{on the death}} of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, the mill was sold <b>by</b> <b>auction,</b> and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold. Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from Garboldisham, Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. The mill was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded.|$|E
5|$|The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to {{participate}} in the Triangular trade, yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent. In November 1685, after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway, a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company. The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie, called Brandenburgery, and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west. In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates. In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony. In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735. Their last remains were sold <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> in 1738.|$|E

5|$|Warlugulong {{was first}} {{exhibited}} at {{a show in}} Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell. Realities Gallery in Melbourne then included the work in a major exhibition of Papunya Tula artworks. It was purchased for A$1,200 by the Commonwealth Bank, which hung it in a bank training centre cafeteria on the Mornington Peninsula. The bank sold it <b>by</b> <b>auction</b> in 1996. The auction house trading the work expected it to fetch around $5,000 and {{did not make a}} feature of it in the catalogue, but dealers including Hank Ebes, the successful bidder, recognised the painting's significance and it sold for $36,000 plus commission. After hanging in Ebes's living room for eleven years, it was auctioned in Melbourne by Sotheby's on 24 July 2007. It sold for $2.4million, thoroughly eclipsing the previous record for an Indigenous Australian painting, set when Emily Kngwarreye's Earth's Creation was bought in May of the same year for just over $1million. Warlugulongs buyer was the National Gallery of Australia, which purchased the work as part of its 25th Anniversary Gifts Program. The Gallery considers the painting to be possibly the most important in its collection of Indigenous Australian art. As of 2016, the work is on display in the National Gallery.|$|E

Charles Stapleton bought the mill for £100, and then resold it to James Davidson Jr for £125. In 1900, Davidson defaulted on the mortgage and the mill was sold to Samuel Lomax, a butcher in Aylsham, for £200.
