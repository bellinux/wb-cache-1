As an example, the El Centro 1940 earthquake record is used on a structural model to show the structural responses due to a <b>sliding</b> <b>base</b> with different frictional and stiffness characteristics.

The proposed approach combines time scale separation design and sliding mode control. Different from the existing disturbance estimation <b>based</b> <b>sliding</b> mode control methods, the proposed scheme achieves fast and exact disturbance estimation through time scale separation and eliminates discontinuous switching term, thereby achieving good chattering alleviation effect and providing good transient response.

40|$|Seismic safety against <b>base</b> <b>sliding</b> of Italian {{concrete}} gravity dams subjected to strong earthquakes is reached {{by means of}} a simplified procedure. The mechanical model is represented by a single degree of freedom system having dynamical characteristics which take into account dam-water-foundation interaction. To catch plastic displacement the non linearity of the substructure is modelled, having fixed a threshold value for the sliding foundation resistance presented with the Mohr-Coulomb yielding criterion including a frictional and a cohesive component. The positive effect of a passive wedge resistance is also included. Non linear dynamic response to several natural earthquakes is evaluated for typical examples of Italian {{concrete gravity}} dams, considering the effect of different foundation rocks.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{response of}} pure-friction base isolated masonry building with restricted <b>base</b> <b>sliding</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. A clear smoothened surface is created at the plinth level of the building above the damp-proof course, and the superstructure rests at this level to slide freely, except for the frictional resistance and the rigid stopper. As the superstructure is free to slide at the plinth level, {{there will be a}} feeling to the occupants that it might slide more than the permissible relative displacement limit provided {{at the top of the}} substructure. This may create a fear among the occupants that the building may overturn. In view of this, a mathematical model was developed for masonry building with restricted <b>base</b> <b>sliding</b> system using rigid stopper. Feasible position of the stopper has been determined such that the seismic response of the structure is reduced considerably in comparison with that of corresponding fixed base structure. Investigation was also made to determine the seismic response of the buildings with varying time period, mass ratio, coefficient of friction and damping coefficient subjected to Koyna and five other pseudo earthquakes. The pseudo earthquakes were generated either by increasing or decreasing the ground acceleration and duration of the Koyna accelerogram. It turns out from the present study that the pure-friction isolated restricted <b>base</b> <b>sliding</b> system is effective in reducing the seismic force acting on the masonry building with low value of coefficient of friction...|$|R

The positive output elementary super lift Luo converter performs the voltage conversion from positive source voltage to positive load voltage. This paper proposes a HMSMC capable of providing the good steady state and dynamic performance compared to conventional controllers. Dynamic equations describing the positive output elementary super lift luo converter are derived by using state space average method. The simulation model of the positive output elementary super lift Luo converter with its control circuit is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. The HMSMC for positive output elementary super lift Luo converter is tested for line changes, load changes and also for components variations.
