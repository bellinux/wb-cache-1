5|$|My {{films have}} been {{progressing}} towards {{a certain kind}} of minimalism, even though it was never intended. Elements that can be eliminated have been eliminated. This was pointed out to me <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> who referred to the paintings of Rembrandt and his use of light: some elements are highlighted while others are obscured or even pushed back into the dark. And it's something that we do - we bring out elements that we want to emphasise.|$|E

5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} of South Vietnamese {{forces in the}} Central Highlands came about {{as a result of}} three major factors. Firstly, during much of the war, President Nguyen Van Thieu’s confidence in the ARVN’s intelligence could not be shaken. However, following the capitulation of Ban Me Thuot, Thieu lost all faith in his own military intelligence agencies, when it became evidently clear that the strength of North Vietnamese forces was far greater than what South Vietnamese intelligence agencies had gathered. Consequently, Thieu completely ignored his own military intelligence and the CIA, and made all military decisions by himself without consulting the Joint General Staff. Thus, when Major-General Pham Van Phu requested that Thieu send reinforcements to bolster the strength of South Vietnamese forces in the Central Highlands, Thieu gave him two options: either carry out the President’s orders, or be replaced <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> who was willing to do so. General Phu chose to implement Thieu’s orders and evacuated his units from II Corps.|$|E

The episode was directed by Stephen Williams and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach. It first aired on December 8, 2004, on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). In the episode, flashbacks reveal Jack Shephard being responsible for his father's dismissal from a hospital after performing surgery while drunk.

500|$|It can {{be argued}} {{that this is not a}} true {{exception}} to the doctrine because once the contract is made the [...] "agent" [...] plays no further part, leaving it as an agreement between two parties. Certain elements of the doctrine of agency have been said to clash with privity, however. In some circumstances the principal can sue the third party even when the agent has not disclosed to the third party that he is acting as an agent to the principal. In this situation, the third party can be sued <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> that he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|E

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed.

He accepted that her case [...] "could, perhaps, still be proved <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> else, though I very much doubt it". Highlighting {{that there is a}} gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as [...] "a view grounded on ignorance alone".|$|E
500|$|Earthsea is an {{archipelago}} {{or group}} of islands. In the fictional history of this world, the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. Influenced strongly by Le Guin's interest in Taoism, the world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. Magic in the societies of Earthsea is depicted as a force for both good and evil. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. [...] The internal universe of Earthsea has not remained constant across Le Guin's various works set in it, but has been continually adjusted and revised.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "hail to the thief" [...] {{was used}} by anti-George W.

Yorke described hearing the phrase {{for the first time}} as a [...] "formative moment" [...] for the album. Radiohead chose the title partly to [...] "state the bleeding obvious... that the most powerful country on earth is run <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> who stole an election", but also in response to [...] "the rise of doublethink and general intolerance and madness, and feeling very much like individuals were totally out of control of the situation that somehow it was a manifestation of something not really human." [...] The title also references the leak of the album before its completion. Yorke worried the title might be misconstrued as referring solely to the US election controversy, but his bandmates felt it [...] "conjured up all the nonsense and absurdity and jubilation of the times." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{world of}} Earthsea is {{depicted}} as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. This includes an equilibrium between land and sea (implicit in the name Earthsea), and between people and their natural environment. In addition to physical equilibrium, there is a larger cosmic equilibrium, which everybody is aware of, and which wizards are tasked with maintaining. Describing this aspect of Earthsea, Elizabeth Cummins wrote, [...] "The principle of balanced powers, the recognition that every act affects self, society, world, and cosmos, is both a physical and a moral principle of Le Guin's fantasy world." [...] The concept of balance is related to the novel's other major theme of coming of age, as Ged's knowledge of the consequences of his own actions for good or ill is necessary for him to understand how the balance is maintained.

500|$|The episode's {{title is}} a {{reference}} to the film Viva Las Vegas (1964). The panic and smoke cloud generated from the implosion of Mr Burns' casino is reminiscent of the 1997 disaster film Dante's Peak, and the Simpson family's escape from the smoke cloud is {{a reference to}} a scene in the 1996 science fiction film Independence Day. Outside Rev. Lovejoy's church is a notice that today's sermon will be 'He Knows What You Did Last Summer', which is {{a reference to the}} title of the 1997 slasher film I Know What You Did Last Summer. As Homer and Ned escape from Vegas, a snippet of the theme from the 1996 comic science fiction film Mars Attacks! can be heard. The Comic Book Guy's license plate is NCC-1701, which is also the registration of the USS Enterprise, a fictional starship from the Star Trek media franchise. He also has a bumper sticker which reads [...] "my other car is the Millennium Falcon" [...] which was given to him <b>by</b> <b>somebody</b> who looked like the actor Harrison Ford; the Millennium Falcon was the ship used by Ford's character Han Solo in the Star Wars film series.
