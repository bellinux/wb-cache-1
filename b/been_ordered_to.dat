5|$|Further {{missions}} by II./KG 54 to RAF Croydon were cancelled. I./KG 54 {{struck at}} the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) base at Gosport. ZG 2 {{was supposed to}} provide escort during one these attacks, and in a breakdown of communications, arrived over the target without their Ju 88s, which had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> stand down. One Bf 110 was shot down by No. 238 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Battalion of the Royal Norfolks, {{along with}} the 8th Lancashire Fusiliers, were holding the Allied line at the villages of Riez du Vinage, Le Cornet Malo and Le Paradis with the {{battalion}} headquarters based at Le Paradis. The battalions had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> hold out {{for as long as}} possible against the Germans to give time for the BEF to evacuate from Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|The Varangians had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> march just {{in front}} of the main line with a strong {{division}} of archers a little behind them. The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and fire a volley before retreating behind them. The archers continued this tactic until the army neared contact.|$|E

50|$|During September 14, as winds {{started to}} get stronger, {{evacuations}} <b>were</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> many places. In Kyoto, 268,000 residences <b>were</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> leave and about 81,000 in Fukuchiyama.|$|R
5|$|This officer, to {{encourage}} his regiment; {{which had never}} before been in action, and which had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> lie down to protect itself from the enemy's fire, arose to his feet, advanced in front of the line, and himself fired several shots at the enemy at short range, being fully exposed to their fire at the time.|$|E
5|$|He {{was later}} moved to Xining City No. 1 Detention Centre, {{where he was}} held {{incommunicado}} until April 2009, when {{he was allowed to}} meet with his lawyer, Li Dunyong. Three months later, however, Li Dunyong dropped his case, reporting that he had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> do so by judicial authorities. Another lawyer was reportedly threatened with the closing of his law firm if he chose to defend Dhondup Wangchen.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} World War One, the {{regiment}} was employed in garrison duties in India. In 1914 the 5th LI {{was stationed in}} Nowgong when it was posted to Singapore to replace the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> France. Unusually for 1914–15 the 5th Light Infantry was an entirely Muslim unit, mainly comprising Ranghars (Muslims of Rajput origin) and Pathans, commanded by British and Indian officers. Upon arrival in Singapore, the 5th Light Infantry was based in Alexandra Barracks.|$|E

50|$|Reclassified ATO-138 on 15 May 1944, Partridge <b>was</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> England {{to assist}} in {{preparing}} for the coming invasion of Normandy. The ship remained in England until 10 June, when she <b>was</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> sail for the beachhead.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the day and}} the previous, as many as 500 new special {{police were}} sworn in, {{doubling}} the size of the police force. Each was provided with a star, a revolver and espantoon. The recently arrived regulars brought the garrison of federal troops in the city to between 700 and 800. The vessels Powhatan and Swatara had also <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> the city, along with their 500 marines.|$|E
5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> attack British transports at Ostend, {{but had been}} forced to dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments on the opposite side to right her.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, {{but there was no sign}} of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than Integrity. His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. Integrity departed a week later, Robbins having <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E

5|$|Although Morgan had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, {{he continued}} his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. These had a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, as it had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets and opened fire. This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00 {{the rest}} of the {{division}} had passed the Nahr el Falik. Although the division had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> avoid conflict until they reached the entrenched line near Liktera, leading squadrons attacked 200 Ottoman infantry in a large orchard east of Basse el Hindi. Here they captured about 60 prisoners, two guns and many wagons at the cost of one man killed and two wounded. Another isolated machine gun was captured further north. Near Mukhalid, the 9th Hodson's Horse outflanked another Ottoman position, and another at Nahr Iskanderun at 10:15. A total of 110 prisoners, 2 artillery pieces and 12 wagons were captured.|$|E

5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all be guilty of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|Dawson relayed {{this story}} to Bulawayo, where Company {{authorities}} made enquiries. No {{man who had been}} attached to the column corroborated the account. The Company thought it unlikely that a Matabele inDuna would simply invent a story such as this, however, and angrily speculated that if it were true, then negotiations with Lobengula might have been opened and the war ended before Wilson crossed the river, and the entire episode of the Shangani Patrol avoided (though, as historian Robert Cary writes, this surmision ignores the fact that Forbes had <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> capture Lobengula, not end the war). Lawyers appointed by the Company launched a formal investigation early in 1894.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E

5|$|Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King {{have been}} killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - {{wielding}} dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.|$|E
5|$|Having {{crossed into}} Europe in April 480 BC, the Persian army began its march to Greece. Five major food depots {{had been set}} up along the path: at White Headland on the Thracian side of the Hellespont, at Tyrodiza in Perinthian territory, at Doriskos at the Evros river estuary where the Asian army was linked up with the Balkan allies, at Eion on the Strymon river, and at Therme, modern-day Thessaloniki. There, food had been sent from Asia for several years in {{preparation}} for the campaign. Animals had been bought and fattened, while the local populations had, for several months, <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> grind the grains into flour. The Persian army took roughly three months to travel unopposed from the Hellespont to Therme, a journey of about 600km (360 mi). It paused at Doriskos where it was joined by the fleet. Xerxes reorganized the troops into tactical units replacing the national formations used earlier for the march.|$|E
5|$|In the city, {{they are}} escorted to their hotel by {{agents of the}} Bordurian secret police, who have <b>been</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>to</b> monitor the duo by police chief Colonel Sponsz. Aware {{that they are being}} monitored, Tintin and Haddock escape the hotel and hide in the opera house, where Bianca Castafiore is performing. When police come searching for them, they hide in Castafiore's closet; when Sponsz comes to visit Castafiore in her {{dressing}} room, Tintin is able to steal papers that will secure Calculus' release from the fortress of Bakhine from his coat pocket. After disguising themselves as officials from the Red Cross, Tintin and Haddock are able to get Calculus released from prison and with him escape from Borduria in a tank. Back at Marlinspike Hall, Calculus reveals that he forgot to take his plans for the ultrasonic device with him to Geneva, and that he had left them at home all along; he destroys the plans so that they cannot be used to create a weapon.|$|E
