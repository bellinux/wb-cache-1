In this study, we develop a new QR-GARCH-M model combining a probit model for a binary <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> and a regime switching GARCH-in-mean model for excess stock market return with the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> defining the regime.

40|$|The {{growth rate}} of {{temporary}} help service employment is often {{considered to be a}} leading <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> because the firing and hiring of temporary help workers typically lead that of permanent workers. However, few studies in the literature focus on the mechanism that generates the lag between temporary and permanent growth. This paper investigates how firms extract signals of long-lived shocks from noisy transitory shocks and how this influences their hiring/firing decisions. Our simple model predicts that the average size of transitory demand shocks increases the lag while the average size of long-lived shocks shortens the lag. Our empirical findings based on cross-city analysis show evidence that supports the above predictions, after controlling for city size, city-specific demographic characteristics, and variables based on the industry mix in the city.

40|$|The {{question}} arises whether {{there can be}} an enrichment of <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> research when <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> {{will be used in}} an increasing dimension. This article, dedicated to Professor Adolf Wagner, tries to differentiate three fields of research: Hypothesis formation in theory, characterisation of market imbalances and measurement of cycle and trend in empirical methods, short-term prognoses and turning point analyses in forecasting. Can we establish new hypotheses by considering expectations, gained from surveys? A special proposal aimed at the measure of the reference cycle by using the utilization of capacities in enterprises. It is evident, that when using <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> in <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> research we can avoid the dichotomy between the three fields in <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> research, which has been observed in the past. <b>Business</b> <b>cycle</b> research, <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators,</b> reference <b>cycle,</b> leading <b>indicators,</b> measurement of <b>cycle</b> and trend, measurement without theory. ...|$|R

The present paper evaluates a method of obtaining values of the GRP as soon as monthly and quarterly <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> become available.

With the present method it is possible to continuously refine GRP growth values throughout the year.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether the dynamic {{properties of the}} U. S. business cycle have {{changed in the last}} fifty years. For this purpose we develop a flexible <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> that is constructed from a moderate set of macroeconomic time series. The coincident economic indicator is based on a multivariate trend-cycle decomposition model that accounts for time variation in macroeconomic volatility, known as the great moderation. In particular, we consider an unobserved components time series model with a common cycle that is shared across different time series but adjusted for phase shift and amplitude. The extracted cycle can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} model-based bandpass filter and is designed to emphasize the business cycle frequencies that are of interest to applied researchers and policymakers. Stochastic volatility processes and mixture distributions for the irregular components and the common cycle disturbances enable us to account for all the heteroskedasticity present in the data. The empirical results are based on a Bayesian analysis and show that time-varying volatility is only present in the a selection of idiosyncratic components while the coefficients driving the dynamic properties of the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicator</b> have been stable over time in the last fifty years. ...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{studies on the}} <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> in the past decades, but mostly {{focusing}} on the asymmetric and non-linear features of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> incorporated into the conditional mean equation rather than the conditional variance formulation. Recently, the hypothesis of volatility asymmetry in <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>indicators</b> has been re-examined by, for instance, Ho and Tsui (2003 and 2004) using univariate asymmetric power ARCH (APARCH) and EGARCH models. However, {{the main drawback of}} univariate GARCH analysis is that it fails to capture the co-movement of macroeconomic variables. These co-movement relationships are important issues emphasised by the <b>business</b> <b>cycle</b> researchers, yet not much work has been done on formally modelling co-movements of asymmetric conditional volatilities in the context of multivariate GARCH setting. Our study extends the constant conditional correlation framework proposed by Bollerslev (1990) and the time-varying conditional correlation approach by Tse and Tsui (2002). We propose three new bivariate asymmetric GARCH models to accommodate the individual conditional heteroskedastic effects and the possibly varying conditional correlation relationships of asymmetric volatilities of the <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>indicators</b> in the selected OECD countries including Canada, Italy, the UK and the US. Using indices of industrial production as proxies for <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> <b>indicators,</b> we detect statistically significant evidence of asymmetric conditional volatility in the UK and US. Additionally, we find that the conditional correlations are significantly time-varying, and that the strength of varying correlations may be linked to the degree of economic integration between the countries. These findings have the following implications: - if <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> are conditionally heteroskedastic and exhibit volatility asymmetry, then any theory without such properties is inadequate. - the GARCH structure is consistent with the hypothesis of rational expectations in macroeconomics as rational economic agents make decisions based on all available information (see Hong and Lee, 2001 for details). - since movements in the financial markets are inextricably linked to the overall health of the economy, adequate accommodation of macroeconomic uncertainty such as conditional volatilities of <b>business</b> <b>cycles</b> would help researchers understand more about the causes of changes in financial market volatilities, and ∑ it is vital to understand the domestic macroeconomic policy implications of asymmetric volatility and the corresponding policy co-ordinations among major international trading partners...|$|R

40|$|Forecasting the Quality Spread Using <b>Business</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Indicators</b> Extended Abstract Introduction The {{spread between}} yields on {{corporate}} bonds of differing quality {{is one of}} the most important measures of the aggregate level of credit risk in the economy and has been widely used as an indicator of overall economic activity and of stock prices. It has also assumed considerable importance in recent years as a fundamental determinant of the profitability of complex investment strategies that depend upon the convergence of yields on securities with differing credit risk. A good forecast of the quality spread is likely to be very useful both for economic forecasting and for investment management.
