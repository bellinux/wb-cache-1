25|$|The narrator (Phil Rice) {{states that}} {{increased}} cultural diversity has necessitated the exposition of previously unwritten rules {{regarding the use}} of male restrooms. According to these rules, males should use restrooms as quickly as possible, maximize physical separation from each other when using urinals, flush urinals when they contain concentrated urine, avoid stalls with unflushed toilets, and avoid eye contact and communication with others. The film depicts a scenario in which excess communication leads to a mess in the restroom and thus deficient hygiene and homeostasis, the latter of which is in the lowest tier in Maslow's hierarchy of needs. As the scenario continues, the restroom occupants turn to violence, leading to police and <b>biological</b> <b>hazard</b> team involvement that closes the restroom. Forced to go elsewhere, other men repeat the scenario, eventually leading to complete societal breakdown.|$|E

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} at slaughterhouse was {{the main}} mean of control used historically to protect consumers from <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> transmitted by the consumption of pork. The epidemiological evolution of <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> led the European Union to promulgate new food safety legislation {{in the form of}} the Hygiene Package, based on a risk analysis approach. This package authorizes Member States to develop new meat inspection methods in order to accentuate consumer health protection. However, the levels of detection of <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> during traditional meat inspection have not been established, particularly in quantitative terms. Such an assessment is needed to define risk-based meat inspection schemes. The aim of this study was to provide elements to quantify the lack of detection of <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> by current meat inspection methods. A literature review of 440 references was undertaken to summarise information on the incidence of foodborne zoonoses and the prevalence of <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> on/in pork carcasses. Then for each hazard, the incidence rate of zoonosis induced by pork consumption (lpork) and the ratio of non-control of hazard at and after meat inspection (NC) were calculated.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{health hazards}} {{including}} communicable diseases and skin conditions {{are associated with}} Barbersâ€™ profession to which their visitors are exposed. Thus, knowledge and practice of Barbers would play a vital part in prevention and control of these health hazards. So, {{the aim of this}} study is to assess knowledge and practice, and associated factors among barbers about <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with their profession in Gondar town, North West Ethiopia. Methods To assess knowledge and practice, and associated factors among barbers about <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with their profession in Gondar town, North West Ethiopia, A work place based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 28 to April 6, 2012. The total numbers of Barbers in the town were 960 of which 400 Barbers were participated in the study. Sample size was determined using the formula for single population proportion by considering, 51 % proportion, knowledgeable Barbers from Jimma, Ethiopia, 95 % level of confidence, 5 % margin of error and 15 % none response rate. The numbers of barbers included in the study were selected by using systematic random sampling. Data was collected by face to face interview using a structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Binary and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice of barbers. Results Of 400 barbers, only 72 (18 %) had good knowledge about <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> associated to their profession, While only 61 (15. 3 %) were practicing safely during barbering. Knowledge of the barbers was associated significantly with educational level, owner of the business, working hour and work experience, while practice was associated only with availability of UV sterilizers in the room and working hour. Conclusion Barbersâ€™ practice and knowledge to prevent <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> associated with their profession is very poor. Thus, giving training for the Barbers is required toward prevention of <b>biological</b> <b>hazards</b> associated to their profession. </p...|$|R

50|$|Ptaquiloside is a norsesquiterpene {{glucoside}} {{produced by}} bracken ferns (majorly Pteridium aquilinum) during metabolism. It is identified {{to be the}} main carcinogen of the ferns and be responsible for their biological effects, such as haemorrhagic disease and bright blindness in livestock and oesophageal, gastric cancer in humans. Ptaquiloside has unstable chemical structure and acts as a DNA alkylating agent under physiological conditions. It was first isolated and characterized by Yamada and co-workers in 1983.The pure form ptaquiloside is a colorless amorphous compound. It is readily soluble in water and fairly soluble in ethyl acetate. Except in the plants, ptaquiloside has been detected in the milk and meat of affected livestock, {{as well as in the}} underground water and dry soil around bracken fern vegetation. The prevalence of ptaquiloside in daily sources along with its carcinogenic effects make it an increasing <b>biological</b> <b>hazard</b> in modern days.|$|E

5000|$|A biofilm is a {{community}} of microorganisms adsorbed to a surface. Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed in a polymeric matrix consisting of exopolysaccharides, extracellular DNA and proteins. Seconds after a surface (usually metal) is placed in a solution, inorganic and organic molecules adsorb onto the surface. These molecules are attracted mainly by Coulombic forces (see above section), and can adhere very strongly to the surface. This first layer is called the conditioning layer, and {{is necessary for the}} microorganisms to bind to the surface. These microorganisms then attach reversibly by Van der Waals forces, followed by irreversible adhesion through self-produced attachment structures such as pili or flagella. [...] Biofilms form on solid substrates such as stainless steel. A biofilm's enclosing polymeric matrix offers protection to its microbes, increasing their resistance to detergents and cleaning agents. Biofilms on food processing surfaces can be a <b>biological</b> <b>hazard</b> to food safety. Increased chemical resistance in biofilms can lead to a persistent contamination condition.|$|E

5000|$|Natural neutron {{background}}. A small natural background flux of free neutrons exists {{everywhere on}} Earth. In {{the atmosphere and}} deep into the ocean, the [...] "neutron background" [...] is caused by muons produced by cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere. These high-energy muons are capable of penetration to considerable depths in water and soil. There, in striking atomic nuclei, among other reactions they induce spallation reactions in which a neutron is liberated from the nucleus. Within the Earth's crust a second source is neutrons produced primarily by spontaneous fission of uranium and thorium present in crustal minerals. The neutron background is {{not strong enough to}} be a <b>biological</b> <b>hazard,</b> but it is of importance to very high resolution particle detectors that are looking for very rare events, such as (hypothesized) interactions that might be caused by particles of dark matter. Recent research has shown that even thunderstorms can produce neutrons with energies of up to several tens of MeV. Recent research has shown that the fluence of these neutrons lies between 10âˆ’9 and 10âˆ’13 per ms and per m2 depending on the detection altitude. The energy of most of these neutrons, even with initial energies of 20 MeV, decreases down to the keV range within 1 ms.|$|E
