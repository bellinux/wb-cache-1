30|$|A {{mechanical}} study {{investigating the}} use of two different methods (grub and bolt screws) to secure external fixation half pins to circular frames. A four part experiment: (1) Grub and bolt screws were used to secure half pins in Taylor Spatial frames. Loosening torques were measured using a calibrated torque wrench. (2) Using universal testing machine (UTM), axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening in grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs. (3) We established the application torque to produce failure at the head–driver interface using these two methods. (4) Grub and <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs were created controlling torque. Using UTM, axial loading was applied to establish thresholds for loosening. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS v 20.0. 0. (1) Higher torque is employed when bolt rather than grub screws is used to secure half pins on Rancho cubes (p <  0.05). (2) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in <b>bolt</b> <b>screw</b> constructs when the torque applied to secure the constructs is not controlled (p <  0.05). (3) Torque required for failure at the head–driver interface was 5.3  Nm for grub screws and 9.9  Nm for bolts. (4) Loading threshold for loosening is higher in grub screw constructs when the same torque was applied to secure them (p <  0.05). Bolt screws can be employed to secure the half pin–frame interface. They offer good stability and reduce failure at the head–driver interface. Further {{research is needed to}} determine the mechanical properties of such constructs in vivo.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{low carbon}} steel ST 41 in {{everyday}} life as material is nut, <b>bolt,</b> <b>screw</b> thread, weapons equipment, and so forth. This is because prior experience has carburizing steel is easy {{to do with the}} nature of the engine (Daryanti, 2006 : 63). However, the use of steel ST 41 is limited to the parts that have less friction and heavy loads. This is because the carbon steel ST 41 mechanical properties, especially hardness and ductility less according to the existing needs. To obtain a construction material that is hard on the surface and at the core of ductile steel carburizing is carried out. Carbonization or carburizing is the process of adding the element carbon on the surface of {{low carbon steel}}, heating carbonization carried out at a temperature of 900 - 950 degrees Celsius (Beumer, 1980 : 50).

40|$|Cold headability is {{the ability}} of a {{cylindrical}} metallic specimen to be shaped at high strain rate into the head of a <b>bolt,</b> <b>screw</b> or other cold-formed part without cracking. This property is material dependent and can be influenced by many factors such as chemical composition, surface condition, and microstructure. This project focuses on the effect of microstructure upon the cold headability of a medium carbon steel (1036 M). Six different microstructures were produced by various heat treatment conditions. Drop Weight Tower (DWT) tests, developed at McGill in 2000 by Dr. N. Nickoletopoulos, were used on samples of these materials. Visual inspection, metallographic and SEM analysis were performed to identify cracks on the surface of tested samples, and trace their cause. The axial and circumferential strains of tested samples were measured and the strains at which cracks first occurred were used to assess the cold headability. This research further indicates that DWT testing is a valid method for evaluating the cold headability of metallic materials and that the cold headability is particularly sensitive to the microstructure of a material...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe {{fractures}} {{around the}} supramalleolar region {{are difficult to}} manage and deformities may occur following insufficient or inadequate treatment attempts. The treatment of those deformities is even more challenging. The available options for surgical fixation have inherent problems considering the soft tissue problems, infection and compliance of the patients. In this study, we report the preliminary outcome of new IMN system in use of supramalleolar deformities. Patients and MethodsThree patients with supramalleolar deformities were recruited for this study. Two patients had periarticular distal tibia malunions and one patient had nonunion in same region. All patients were operated with using newly designed intramedullary nail system with a unique distal interlocking <b>bolt</b> <b>screw.</b> The outcome for each patient was followed-up and evaluated with using AOFAS score. ResultsThe patients were followed up for 3 years, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. The AOFAS scores were 36, 33, and 21 preoperatively; and 75, 68, and 75 postoperatively in Patients 1, 2 and 3, respectively. ConclusionIn our patient series, adequate fixation following correction of the deformity was seen. Although {{the number of the}} cases are limited this study provides encouraging results regarding the outcome of new IMN system in use of supramalleolar deformities...|$|E
