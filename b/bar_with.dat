At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by {{the radio station}} on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse {{of which has been}} visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium <b>bar</b> <b>with</b> two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so that the standard can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification. At the 94th Meeting of the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) (2005) it was recommended that the same {{be done with the}} kilogram.|$|E

5|$|Jørgen Olufsen's House (Jørgen Olufsens Gård) on Østerågade is Denmark's best {{preserved}} merchant's {{mansion in}} the Renaissance style. Built mainly of sandstone in 1616, {{it also has}} a half-timbered section. The style is reminiscent of similar buildings in the north of Germany and in the Netherlands. Olufsen, Jens Bang's half brother, was not only a successful merchant but also mayor of Aalborg. When it was built, the residence with its integrated warehouse was on the Østerå, an inlet from the sound with access for barges.

5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was {{the small amount}} of water {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had indicated that the break-up of the largest fragments would occur at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals to a few tens of megapascals (from 0.3 to a few hundred <b>bar),</b> <b>with</b> some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with {{the temperature in the}} range 100–160K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185–270K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 <b>bar</b> <b>with</b> temperatures of 190–235K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10–20 bar and temperatures are 270–330K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.|$|E

Coulthard, who {{finished}} second, was second on 50 points, two points ahead of teammate Häkkinen and eight ahead of Barrichello. Despite not finishing, Fisichella maintained fifth place with 18 points. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari maintained their lead with 92 points, McLaren's 10-point penalty meant that they remained second on 88 points. Williams jumped to third on 19 points, pushing Benetton into fourth on 18 points and <b>BAR</b> <b>with</b> 12 points moved ahead of Jordan into fifth, with seven rounds of the season remaining.|$|E
5|$|Timmy, {{the late}} Jimmy's friend, asks Langly {{to attend a}} Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor.

She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.|$|E
5|$|Braham {{was summoned}} to see Basil Embry. The {{commanding}} officer made Braham wait until he had cleaned himself up and was properly dressed. Embry gave Braham a stern rebuke for risking himself in such a fashion. He had not given his agreement to the operation and Braham had taken off before he could give a definitive answer. Nevertheless, his 29th victory eased the tension and Embry invited him to the bar for a conciliatory beer. Bill Gregory did not fly with Bob Braham again. His DFC and <b>bar</b> <b>with</b> DFM reflected his contribution to Braham's success. He may also have taken the events of 12 May 1944 as a warning. For Braham, the thrill of ranger operations was addictive. On 25 May 1944 he attempted another but turned back because of poor weather. His last operations were flown with both Embry and Walsh on 6 June 1944 during the Normandy landings. The Western Front, dormant since 1940, was now re-activated. Braham flew over Normandy several times with Mosquito bomber groups in June 1944. These counted as his last successful operations.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 56 points, ahead of David Coulthard on 50 points and Mika Häkkinen on 48 points. Rubens Barrichello was fourth with 36 points whilst Giancarlo Fisichella was fifth with 18 points. In the Constructors' Championship Ferrari were leading with 92 points, McLaren and Williams with 88 points and 19 points were {{second and third}} respectively, whilst Benetton with 18 points and <b>BAR</b> <b>with</b> 12 points contended with fourth place. Ferrari and McLaren had so far {{dominated}} the championship winning ten out of the ten previous races.

5|$|In his 1917 piece The Tides of Manaunaun, Cowell {{introduced}} a new notation for tone clusters on the piano and other keyboard instruments. In this notation, only {{the top and bottom}} notes of a cluster, connected by a single line or a pair of lines, are represented. This developed into the solid-bar style seen in the image on the right. Here, the first chord—stretching two octaves from D2 to D4—is a diatonic (so-called white-note) cluster, indicated by the natural sign below the staff. The second is a pentatonic (so-called black-note) cluster, indicated by the flat sign; a sharp sign would be required if the notes showing the limit of the cluster were spelled as sharps. A chromatic cluster—black and white keys together—is shown in this method by a solid <b>bar</b> <b>with</b> no sign at all. In scoring the large, dense clusters of the solo organ work Volumina in the early 1960s, György Ligeti, using graphical notation, blocked in whole sections of the keyboard.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} sport, {{the use of}} poles for {{vaulting}} distances was recorded in Fierljeppen contests in the Frisian area of Europe, and vaulting for height was seen at gymnastics competitions in Germany in the 1770s. One of the earliest recorded pole vault competitions was in Cumbria, England in 1843. The basic rules and technique of the event originated in the United States. The rules required that athletes do not move their hands along the pole and athletes began clearing the <b>bar</b> <b>with</b> their feet first and twisting so that the stomach faces the bar. Bamboo poles were introduced in the 20th century and a metal box in the runway for planting the pole became standard. Landing mattresses were introduced in the mid-20th century to protect the athletes who were clearing increasingly greater heights.|$|E
5|$|Set in {{the grounds}} of Cobdown Park, the Cobdown Sports and Social Club evolved from the former social club for Reeds International, the paper-maker.

Although it {{remained}} a members club, with many of the same activities, the club was opened up to the general public and new activities were added. Sports form an important part of these activities, and the club is an important local centre {{with a wide range of}} facilities to cater for groups and organisations, such as schools and businesses. Membership is also open to sports teams that wish to use the club. Facilities include a <b>bar,</b> <b>with</b> snooker and pool tables, a darts board, and a big screen for major sporting events. There is a dedicated function room that is used for social and business events and can accommodate a maximum of 100 people seated.|$|E
