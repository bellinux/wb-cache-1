40|$|Though cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is {{a staple}} for many {{poor people in}} Africa, it has major {{nutritional}} disadvantages. The tuberous root has very low levels of essential nutrients. Consequently, malnutrition is widespread {{among the people who}} depend on as a staple in their diet. Breeding cassava for enhanced nutritional quality and making such biofortified varieties available to endusers could help prevent related deficiencies. This paper presents experiences and progress in the genetic enhancement of nutrients in cassava at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. Selected cassava clones were screened for levels of β-carotene, iron, zinc, and protein; useful variation was in levels of the nutrients were identified that have provided the genetic basis for their enhancement. From baseline concentrations of 4 μ/g (β-carotene), 9 mg/kg (iron and zinc), and 4 % (protein), levels have risen to > 12 μ/g (β-carotene), > 40 mg/kg (iron), > 25 mg/kg (zinc), and > 20 % (protein) through recombination and selection. To broaden the genetic <b>base,</b> <b>nutrient</b> rich germplasm was sourced from Latin America, south-east Asia, and a few countries in Africa. This has contributed to an increase of more than 100 % nutrient levels. Promising clones are evaluated in multilocational trials for agronomic characteristics and stability of nutrient levels. So far, our results show that carotene concentration in cassava is a stable trait, suggesting that selection for the trait can be reliably done at a single location. Some genotypes with good performance and are stable for both carotene levels and yield have been identified. Polyploid breeding for the enhancement of carotene levels is also being explored; preliminary results show that carotenoid levels are higher in tetraploids than in their diploid counterparts. Attempts to combine high levels of protein, iron, zinc, and carotene into single genotypes are underway. HarvestPlusInternational Institute of Tropical AgriculturePeer Revie...|$|E
40|$|Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors {{have been}} shown to be {{potential}} vectors for the treatment of diseases, including protocols using RNA interference (RNAi). AAV vector production in insect cells using the baculovirus vector expression system has been a major advance in furthering their use. A major limitation of AAV vector production at high cell densities is a reduction in cell specific yield, which is thought to be caused by nutrient limitations. Nutrient consumption profiles after infection, however, have still not been fully characterized, probably due to the difficulty of characterizing consumption patterns based on increases in cell density, which are minimal after infection. It is known, however, that cells increase in size after infection; therefore, the driving hypothesis of this thesis was that biovolume, or the total volume enclosed by the membrane of viable cells, which accounts for both cell density and cell size, could be used to characterize nutrient consumption patterns both before and after infection. The relationships between nutrient consumption and change in cell density and biovolume were examined by statistical correlation analysis. It was found that in uninfected cultures, no significant correlation differences, using either cell density or biovolume, were observed since cell size remained relatively constant; however, in infected cultures, more than half of the nutrients were found to be better correlated with biovolume than with cell density. When examining the nutrient and metabolite concentration data on a biovolume basis, nutrient consumption remained relatively constant. It is hypothesized that since it has been reported that the rate of cell respiration increases after infection, a more complete oxidation of nutrients occurs to satisfy increased energy needs during infection. By having a basis to <b>base</b> <b>nutrient</b> consumption, we can better assess the needs of the culture. This will allow the development of feeding strategies based on cellular requirements instead of supplying the cultures with generic nutrient cocktails. It is expected that different nutrient mixtures can be used to target different goals such as 1) enhancing cell growth (before infection) and 2) improving the production of recombinant products (after infection). This will not only increase the efficiency of AAV vector production, but will also reduce the cost of production and make the process more economical by eliminating the addition of unnecessary nutrients. Although promising, some limitations of using biovolume still exist. A first limitation is the biovolume measure itself. This measure requires a device that measures cell size, such as a Coulter Counter Multisizer (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), which can be expensive. Capacitance probes can be a more cost effective tool to estimate biovolume; however, the availability of capacitance probes is still not common. A second limitation is the interpretation of the biovolume profiles, which can depend strongly on the fraction of cells in culture that are infected. If the culture is infected asynchronously, then there will be many different cell populations in the culture. Future work may require separating the cell size distribution into populations of viable and non-viable cells to get a better biovolume measure as opposed to assuming that viability is well distributed over the entire range of cell sizes. In infected cultures where the viability may be low, it is likely that the cell size distribution of non-viable cells will be concentrated at the lower end of the distribution (smaller diameter) rather than being well distributed over the whole range. If this is the case, for the infected cultures with low viability, the mean cell diameter calculated will be underestimated, which will lead to an overestimation of nutrient consumption for cultures with low viability. This will certainly affect the accuracy of the nutrient consumption profiles. By separating cell size distribution data into different cell populations of viable and nonviable, the accuracy can be improved...|$|E

40|$|Organic plant raising {{has been}} {{investigated}} under two previous government funded projects (OF 0109 & OF 0144) (1, 2) and it was shown in this research that organic ‘transplants’ could be produced {{for a range of}} crop species (3, 4, 6, 7). However, some species were easier to produce than others and one of the limiting factors was the availability of suitable nutrient sources, especially for supplementary feeding. The use of animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources in organic plant raising has always been considered far from ideal and there are now moves within the EU to ban all animal bi-products in organic plant raising. This work aimed to identify suitable non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources to be used as <b>base</b> <b>nutrients</b> for growing media and as supplementary feeds. The objectives of the project are; 1. 	To identify suitable alternative, non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources for organic plant raising. 2. 	To assess these non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources under UK organic plant raising conditions. To identify suitable alternative, non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources for organic plant raising. A UK, European and international search (literature, web, phone/personal contacts) was undertaken in early 2002 to establish what suitable, non-animal <b>based,</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources were available. Information on the products was sourced from the producer, supplier or manufacture and collated. Products that were obviously not suitable for organic production were excluded. This search identified a wide range of different types of non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources. A range of these products were used in the assessments in objective 2. To assess these non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> sources under UK organic plant raising conditions. Media trials Three commercially available growing media which utilise a non-animal <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> source were identified; Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt and a fourth was made for the purposes of these trials in consultation with the manufacturer; Vapogro with double the added <b>base</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Two species with contrasting requirements (leek and cabbage) were used to assess the efficacy of these media. Cabbage •	The Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt media all produced cabbage transplants considered to be of an acceptable quality, when supplied with supplementary feed. •	The Vapogro media with double the normal strength of base feed was able to produce cabbage transplants of acceptable quality without the need for supplementary nutrients. •	The Vapogro media with double the normal strength of base feed was able to produce cabbage transplants that were as large as those produced in the Sinclair and Melcourt growing media with supplementary feed. Though they were at an earlier growth stage. •	When supplied with supplementary feed, the Vapogro medium with double the normal strength of base feed produced significantly larger cabbage transplants than the other three media, though they were not more advanced in terms of growth stage. •	The Sinclair, Vapogro and Melcourt media, when supplied with supplementary feed, produced cabbage transplants that were not significantly different from one another in most respects. •	Adding supplementary feed to all the media resulted in more severe aphid infestation. Leek •	All of the growing media used were only able to produce leek transplants of acceptable quality when supplementary nutrients were added. •	The largest most vigorous leek transplants were produced in the Melcourt media, this is particularly significant as this is a peat free medium. •	The Vapogro media with double the added <b>base</b> <b>nutrients</b> was able to produce acceptable leek transplants, but they were severely attacked by sciarid fly, which caused large numbers to die. Supplementary feed trials Four commercially available non-animal derived, organic supplementary feeds were identified (AmegA BIOFEED 5. 0 - 0 - 2. 5; Westland Organic Tomato and Vegetable liquid feed (WTV); Bioplasma NATURAL GROW and Gem Fruit ‘n’ Veg Fertilizer). These were tested against a standard animal derived organic feed and conventional mineral fertiliser feed. Two species with contrasting requirements (leek and cabbage) were used to assess the efficacy of these feeds in a single growing media (Vapogro). •	Two of the feeds, WTV and AmegaA (with added phosphorus) produced cabbage and leek transplants of acceptable quality, broadly equivalent to those fed Nu-Gro, the standard organic supplementary feed. •	AmegaA without added phosphorus produced lower quality transplants. •	Bioplasma NATURAL GROW and Gem Fruit ‘n’ Veg Fertilizer produced poor quality transplants, not significantly different from zero feed in most respects. •	The exception to this was the degree of rooting, which was lower in the feeds with largest shoots, AmegaA with added phosphorus, and WTV and highest with the Bioplasma NATURAL GROW feed. •	Leeks grown with AmegaA with added phosphorus suffered severe sciarid fly attack •	The use of AmegaA and WTV merit further investigation, particularly regards their field performance. Conclusion. This study has shown that there area range of non-animal based organic base and supplementary feeds available to the UK organic plant raiser.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research was to begin {{the development of a}} non-invasive optical sensor for measuring glucose concentration in the output medium of cell cultures grown in a unique NASA bioreactor referred to as an integrated rotating-wall vessel (IRWV). The input, a bovine serum <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> media, has a known glucose concentration. The cells within the bioreactor digest a portion of the glucose. Thus, the non-invasive optical sensor is needed to monitor the decrease in glucose due to cellular consumption since the critical parameters for sustained cellular productivity are glucose and pH. Previous glucose sensing techniques have used chemical reactions to quantify the glucose concentration. Chemical reactions, however, cannot provide for continuous, real time, non-invasive measurement as is required in this application. Our effort while in the fellowship program was focused on the design, optical setup, and testing of one bench top prototype non-invasive optical sensor using a mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy technique. Glucose has a fundamental vibrational absorption peak in the mid-infrared wavelength range at 9. 6 micron. Preliminary absorption data using a CO 2 laser were collected at this wavelength for water based glucose solutions at different concentrations and one bovine serum <b>based</b> <b>nutrient</b> medium (GTSF) with added glucose. The results showed near linear absorption responses for the glucose-in-water data with resolutions as high at 108 mg/dl and as low as 10 mg/dl. The nutrient medium had a resolution of 291 mg/dl. The variability of the results was due mainly to thermal and polarization drifts of the laser while the decrease in sensitivity to glucose in the nutrient medium was expected due to {{the increase in the number}} of confounders present in the nutrient medium. A multispectral approach needs to be used to compensate for these confounders.

From this research, further NASA support was obtained to continue the work throughout the year in which a more stable light source will be used at smaller, near-infrared, wavelengths. It is anticipated that a more compact, non-invasive, optical glucose sensor will be realized which can be used with a bioreactor on future space shuttle missions.

Different concentrations of salicylic acid had different effects on enzyme activities in Capsicum annuum L...|$|R
40|$|Senior thesis {{written for}} Oceanography 444 [Author's Abstract] Nutrients {{in the ocean}} are used by {{plankton}} {{at the bottom of}} the food web, which act as food for progressively larger organisms. In particular, nitrogen <b>based</b> <b>nutrients</b> are often in short supply, limiting the growth of the plankton. The process of denitrification converts these nutrients into nitrogen gas which escapes into the air, preventing them from being used. Denitrification can be broken into two processes, known as heterotrophic denitrification and the anammox reaction, which are both driven by bacteria. This study focused on these two processes in attempt to show which of them removes more nitrogen from the water. To do so, each nutrient was tagged with an isotope tracer and injected into bags of seawater. As the nutrients incubate in the bag, the bacteria inside converted the tagged nutrients into tagged nitrogen gas, which was measured using a mass spectrometer. The amount of nitrogen gas produced from each process is an indicator of the rates of heterotrophic denitrification and the anammox reaction. This information allows for an interpretation of each process’ contribution to nitrogen removal in the ocean...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the dietary regimens reported by athletes competing at a major international competition and report whether these were <b>based</b> on <b>nutrient</b> composition, religious beliefs, cultural eating style, food intolerance or avoidance of certain ingredients. A questionnaire was randomly distributed to 351 athletes in the main dining hall of the athletes’ village over the three main meal periods during the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games (23 rd Sept - 14 th Oct, 2010). The majority (n= 218, 62 %) of athletes reported following one or more dietary regimens, with 50 % (n= 174) following a diet <b>based</b> on the <b>nutrient</b> composition of the food. Significantly more athletes from weight category and aesthetic sports (28 %, p= 0. 005) and from power/sprint sports (41 %, p= 0. 004) followed low fat and high protein regimens respectively. Other specialised dietary regimens were followed by 33 % of participants, with avoidance of red meat (13 %), vegetarian (7 %), Halal (6 %), and low lactose regimens (5 %) reported most frequently. Significantly more athletes from non-Western regions followed a vegetarian diet (p< 0. 001), while more vegetarians reported avoiding additives (p= 0. 013) and wheat (p=< 0. 001). A Western style of eating was the most commonly reported cultural regimen (72 % of total with 23 % from non-Western regions). Those following a Western diet were significantly more likely to report following a regimen <b>based</b> on <b>nutrient</b> composition (p= 0. 02). As a high proportion of athletes from differing countries and sports follow specialised dietary regimens, caterers and organisers should ensure that adequate nutrition support and food items are available at similar events...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{methods for}} the parameter {{identification of a}} model of subtilin production by Bacillus subtilis. Based on a stochas-tic hybrid model, identification is split in two subproblems: estimation of the genetic network regulating subtilin production from gene expression data, and estimation of population dynamics <b>based</b> on <b>nutrient</b> and popu-lation level data. Techniques for identification of switching dynamics from sparse and irregularly sampled observations are developed and applied to simulated data. Numerical results are provided to show the effectiveness of our methods...|$|R
