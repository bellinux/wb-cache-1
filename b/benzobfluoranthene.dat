50|$|PAHs - The EPA has {{classified}} seven PAH compounds as probable human carcinogens: benzaanthracene, benzoapyrene, <b>benzobfluoranthene,</b> benzokfluoranthene, chrysene, dibenz(a,h)anthracene, and indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene.|$|E
5000|$|Benzokfluoranthene [...] is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. Classified as a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), it is a colourless solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Impure samples can appear off white. Closely related isomeric compounds include benzo(a)fluoranthene, <b>benzo(b)fluoranthene,</b> benzo(e)fluoranthene, and benzo(j)fluoranthene.|$|E
50|$|According to the City of Austin, Dillo Dirt {{contains}} {{levels of}} heavy metals including Arsenic, Cadmium, Copper, Lead, Mercury, Molybdenum, Nickel, Selenium, and Zinc. In a separate toxicological analysis of Dillo Dirt, {{levels of the}} following pollutants were found: Beta-BHC, DDE, Dieldrin, Endrin aldehyde, <b>Benzo(b)fluoranthene,</b> Dibenz(a,h)anthracene, Benzo(a)anthracene, Indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene, and Bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate. Very few tests {{have been carried out}} on Dillo Dirt, so average pollutant, radioactivity, or carcinogen levels are generally unknown.|$|E
50|$|On February 22, 2014, NASA {{announced}} a greatly upgraded database for detecting and monitoring {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs), including benzeacephenanthrylene (as <b>benzobfluoranthene,</b> a synonym), in the universe. According to NASA scientists, over 20% of the carbon in the universe {{may be associated with}} PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are abundant in the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.|$|E
50|$|Benzojfluoranthene is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the chemical formula C20H12. Classified as a {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon}} (PAH), it is a colourless solid that is poorly soluble in most solvents. Impure samples can appear off white. Closely related isomeric compounds include benzo(a)fluoranthene (BaF), <b>benzo(b)fluoranthene</b> (BbF), benzo(e)fluoranthene (BeF), and benzo(k)fluoranthene (BkF). BjF is present in fossil fuels and is released during incomplete combustion of organic matter. It has been traced in the smoke of cigarettes, exhaust from gasoline engines, emissions from the combustion of various types of coal and emissions from oil heating, {{as well as an}} impurity in some oils such as soybean oil. More than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, including the benzofluoranthenes.|$|E
5000|$|Historical {{deposition}} of coal ash used for residential, commercial, and industrial heating, {{as well as}} for industrial processes such as ore smelting, were a common source of contamination in areas that were industrialized before about 1960. Coal naturally concentrates lead and zinc during its formation, as well as other heavy metals to a lesser degree. When the coal is burned, most of these metals become concentrated in the ash (the principal exception being mercury). Coal ash and slag may contain sufficient lead to qualify as a [...] "characteristic hazardous waste", defined in the USA as containing more than 5 mg/l of extractable lead using the TCLP procedure. In addition to lead, coal ash typically contains variable but significant concentrations of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs; e.g., benzo(a)anthracene, <b>benzo(b)fluoranthene,</b> benzo(k)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, indeno(cd)pyrene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and others). These PAHs are known human carcinogens and the acceptable concentrations of them in soil are typically around 1 mg/kg. Coal ash and slag can be recognised by the presence of off-white grains in soil, gray heterogeneous soil, or (coal slag) bubbly, vesicular pebble-sized grains.|$|E
30|$|PAHs mix {{solution}} (1 - 1) [Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, <b>Benzo(b)fluoranthene,</b> 1, 2 -Benz anthracene, Benzo(a)pyrene, Benzo(k)fluoranthene, Benzo(g,h,i)perylene, Chrysene, Dibenz(a,h)anthracene, Fluoranthene, Fluorene, Indeno(1, 2, 3 -cd)pyrene, Phenanthrene, Naphthalene, Pyrene] {{were purchased}} from AccuStandard.
