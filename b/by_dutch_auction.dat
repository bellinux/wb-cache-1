The applicability of this solution is assessed through system-level simulations using the Monte Carlo approach. When considering the duration of association procedures, results {{have shown that the}} distributed mechanism scales well with increasing density of femtocell sites. Additionally, macrocell users benefit from better link quality and less uncoordinated interference generated by the underlay femtocell tier. To illustrate, after performing handover, the co-channel interference experienced by a tagged macrocell user becomes less than one tenth of that in full interference scenario. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies Anglo-Dutch premium auctions {{used in the}} {{secondary}} market for financial securities in eighteenth-century Amsterdam, Europe's financial capital at the time. An Anglo-Dutch premium auction consists of an English <b>auction</b> followed <b>by</b> a <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction,</b> with a cash premium paid to {{the winner of the}} first round regardless of the second-round outcome. To rationalize the introduction and continued use of this auction format, we need to determine whether bidding behavior was consistent with equilibrium play. We model this auction format theoretically, and show that the likelihood of a bid in the second round should be higher when there is greater uncertainty about the value of the security being sold. We then test this prediction on data from 16, 854 securities sold at auction on 469 days over an 18 -year period in the late 1700 s; using several different proxies for the uncertainty of a given security's value, we find support for this theoretical prediction.

40|$|An Anglo-Dutch premium auction {{consists}} of an English <b>auction</b> followed <b>by</b> a <b>Dutch</b> <b>auction,</b> with a cash premium paid to {{the winner of the}} first round. We study such auctions used in the secondary debt market in eighteenth-century Amsterdam. This was among the first uses of auctions, or any structured market-clearing mechanism, in a financial market. We find that this market presented two distinct challenges - generating competition and aggregating information. We argue that the Anglo-Dutch premium auction is particularly well-suited to do both. Modeling equilibrium play theoretically, we predict a positive relationship between the uncertainty in a security's value and the likelihood of a second-round bid. Analyzing data on 16, 854 securities sold in the late 1700 s, we find empirical support for this prediction. This suggests that bidding behavior may have been consistent with (non-cooperative) equilibrium play, and therefore that these auctions were successful at generating competition. We also find evidence suggesting that these auctions succeeded at aggregating information. Thus, the Anglo-Dutch premium auction appears to have been an effective solution to a complex early market design problem...|$|R

The timber was mostly sold to house builders and shipyard owners, though some was retained for working into specialist commemorative furniture.
