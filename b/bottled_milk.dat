2500|$|In {{an effort}} to respond to growing {{consumer}} awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: [...] "British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics {{of the food and}} drink they buy". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its <b>bottled</b> <b>milk</b> and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by Farmers Weekly in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.|$|E

5000|$|In the British Isles, in the 20th century, <b>bottled</b> <b>milk</b> was {{delivered}} to households {{in the early morning}} (by [...] "milkmen") and left on doorsteps to be collected. Birds, particularly but not exclusively tits (Paridae) and principally blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, great tit Parus major, coal tit Periparus ater regularly attacked the bottles, opening the foil or cardboard lids, and drank the cream of the top. This behaviour was studied, and strong evidence found that learning was involved, although possibly at the level that milk bottles represent a food source, rather than particular techniques. Later studies built on these observations (see the references in the two papers cited).|$|E

50|$|Large {{cities in}} the eastern United States {{encouraged}} nearby rural areas to specialize in production of milk, but milk cars were transporting milk up to 300 mi by 1900. Railroads connecting these rural areas to cities scheduled daily milk trains (sometimes called milk runs) to pick up loaded milk cars from collection points along their route. These trains sometimes carried a mail car and a passenger car. Milk trains usually arrived at their destination {{cities in the}} late evening so the milk could be unloaded and processed for delivery the following morning. A returning train of empty milk cars departed {{the city in the}} early morning hours. These were often the last scheduled passenger trains serving those rural areas, and most milk was traveling in highway trucks by 1960. Rail transport of milk peaked in 1931 when the Official Railway Equipment Register listed 2174 railway-owned milk cars and 480 cars owned by shippers. Most railway-owned milk cars were made of wood; but the Erie Railroad built over two hundred steel cars in the 1930s, and fifty steel cars delivered to B&M in 1958 were the last milk cars built for United States railroads. The last fifteen were numbered 1900-1914, and equipped with gasoline-powered mechanical refrigeration to transport <b>bottled</b> <b>milk</b> as a unit train from Bellows Falls, Vermont to First National Stores in Somerville, Massachusetts. B&M cars numbered 1915-1934 were built without mechanical refrigeration and served as insulated boxcars when no longer needed for milk transport. After <b>bottled</b> <b>milk</b> loadings ended in 1964, B&M made the last United States delivery of bulk milk in August 1972 to Boston from Eagle Bridge, New York.|$|E

50|$|The Murgon butter factory's {{diversification}} into {{dairy products}} other than butter from the 1940s enhanced {{the longevity of}} SBCDA operations compared to other factories which became increasingly vulnerable to closure from the 1960s.

While cheese making ended during or shortly after the war at most of these places, Murgon maintained this production until the 1990s. In 1948 pasteurised <b>bottled</b> <b>milk</b> sales commenced and in 1953, the earliest part of the complex was remodelled and a modern pasteurisation and bottling plant was installed. In 1950 the office was re-established in new brick and concrete premises opposite the factory in Macalister St, with the former office building operating as the co-operative's trading arm from 1951. This was followed in 1952 {{with the construction of}} a dairy research laboratory, staffed by members of the Department of Agriculture and Stock, adjacent to the new office.
