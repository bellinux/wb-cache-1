5|$|Tooth {{breakage}} {{is related}} to a carnivore's behavior. A study of nine modern carnivores found that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The most breakage occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least breakage occurred in the African wild dog, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone {{increases the risk of}} accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.|$|E
5|$|The finger {{bones of}} bats {{are much more}} {{flexible}} than those of other mammals, owing to their flattened cross-section and to low levels of minerals, such as calcium, near their tips. The elongation of bat digits, a key feature required for wing development, {{is due to the}} upregulation of bone morphogenetic proteins (Bmps). During embryonic development, the gene controlling Bmp signaling, Bmp2, is subjected to increased expression in bat forelimbs—resulting in the extension of the manual digits. This crucial genetic alteration helps create the specialized limbs required for volant locomotion. The relative proportion of extant bat forelimb digits compared with those of Eocene fossil bats have no significant differences in relative digit proportion, suggesting that bat wing morphology has been conserved for over 50 million years. During flight, the bones take on bending and shearing stress; and the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> felt are smaller than terrestrial mammals, however the shearing stress is larger. The wing bones of bats have a slightly lower breaking stress point than those of birds.|$|E

25|$|A typical plywood {{panel has}} face veneers {{of a higher}} grade than the core veneers. The {{principal}} function of the core layers {{is to increase the}} separation between the outer layers where the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> are highest, thus increasing the panel's resistance to bending. As a result, thicker panels can span greater distances under the same loads. In bending, the maximum stress occurs in the outermost layers, one in tension, the other in compression. Bending stress decreases from the maximum at the face layers to nearly zero at the central layer. Shear stress, by contrast, is higher {{in the center of the}} panel, and at the outer fibres.|$|E
500|$|Also, {{with such}} a long, narrow hull came a {{consequent}} penchant for bending, {{which led to the}} challenge of adequate hull strength, especially longitudinal strength. This challenge was complicated in a capital ship by the heavy weight of main turrets and guns. This was an area in which British battlecruisers were notably deficient.

500|$|Dinosaurs {{stand with}} their hind limbs erect {{in a manner}} similar to most modern mammals, but {{distinct}} from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side. This posture is due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur. Their erect posture enabled early dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that surpassed those of [...] "sprawling" [...] reptiles. Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> on limbs. Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including rauisuchians, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a [...] "pillar erect" [...] configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the upper pelvic bone was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of columns {{supporting}} the structure. As the ground level rises from the shore {{to the level of the}} Yerba Buena Tunnel, the height of the above ground portion of the columns varies. Since the rock structure supporting these is a hard shale, it would be normal under previous engineering methods to simply dig a relatively shallow foundation for each column, with the structural length varying progressively. Modern seismic analysis and computer simulations revealed the problem with such a design; while the long columns could flex several feet at the top (0.6 meter, more or less), the shorter columns were likely to break, since the rigid deck structures cause the imposition of a similar amount of motion at the tops of the columns, imposing more bending stress per unit length on the shorter columns. This problem was solved by making the columns of similar (but not uniform) length, with the [...] "shorter" [...] columns extending in permanent open shafts to deep foundations. This allows all columns of the YBITS to respond in a sufficiently uniform manner. The space between a column and its pit is covered by a protective sacrificial cover, forming a type of base isolation system at the more sensitive column locations. In addition, the western landing of the YBITS is a zero moment hinge, and so there are no vertical <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> at that point.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a test rig designed to check {{and assess the}} accuracy of the incremental hole drilling (IHD) method. An external load produces a controlled linearly through thickness variable uniaxial <b>stress</b> field (reference <b>bending</b> <b>stress),</b> known with good accuracy, that can be applied and removed at each hole increment. After the separation between the bending relaxed strain from the residual stress relaxed strain, it is possible to reproduce the <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> distribution in order to have complete confidence of the residual <b>stress</b> measurement. The <b>bending</b> verification of the IHD method was already proposed by other investigators before, but residual stress measurements were then performed on independent configurations. The proposed testing procedure gives a 'real time' verification of the residual stress measurement. Any experimental malfunctioning due to the operator inexperience, or any error during the stress calculation from the relaxed strain would produce an evident difference between the expected reference <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> and the IHD <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> output. Moreover, the reference <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> helped for understanding that the not perfect hole cylindrical shape causes an underestimate of the predicted stress near the surface. A zero depth offset correction was proposed. This correction was tested on the reference <b>bending</b> <b>stress,</b> and then applied to the residual stress prediction.

50|$|For drilled bar-stock thermowells, {{the most}} common form of failure is bending fatigue at its base where the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> are greatest. In extreme flow {{conditions}} (high-velocity liquids or high-velocity, high-pressure gases and vapors) catastrophic failure may occur with <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> exceeding the ultimate strength of the material. For extremely long thermowells, the static component of the <b>bending</b> <b>stresses</b> may govern design. In less demanding services, fatigue failure is more gradual and often preceded by a series sensor failures. The latter are due to the acceleration of the thermowell tip as it vibrates, this motion causes the element to lift off the bottom of the thermowell and batter itself to pieces. In cases where the acceleration stresses have been measured, sensor accelerations at resonant conditions often exceed 250 Gs and have destroyed the accelerometer.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of buried piping, {{resistance}} of the pipe-soil system to the applied vertical load is a significant design consideration. Application of a resultant vertical load perpendicular to the longitudinal pipe axis results in ovalization of the pipe, with resulting vertical pressures in the soil bedding and horizontal pressures in the soil backfill adjacent to the pipe, as well as internal forces and moments in the pipe wall. For pipes that are relatively rigid compared to the soil backfill, the developed internal forces in the pipe hoop and resulting internal moments in the wall tend {{to be higher than}} a more flexible pipe with a stiffer soil backfill. For many buried pipes, design to consider through-wall <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> is not included and consideration of a buckling allowable is considered adequate. However, for safety-related pipes, investigation to include the through-wall <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> is considered important. Although estimation of the internal hoop stresses in a buried pipe is relatively straight forward, several different methodologies are presented in various industry documents for calculating the through-wall <b>bending</b> <b>stress</b> due to the resulting internal moments.
