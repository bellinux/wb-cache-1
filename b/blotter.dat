Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, in one case, was distributed on <b>blotter</b> paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} story, Gray's caveat {{was taken to the}} US Patent Office a few hours before Bell's application. Gray's caveat was taken to the Patent Office in the morning of February 14, 1876, shortly after the Patent Office opened and {{remained}} {{near the bottom of the}} in-basket until that afternoon. Bell's application was filed shortly before noon on February 14 by Bell's lawyer who requested that the filing fee be entered immediately onto the cash receipts <b>blotter</b> and Bell's application was taken to the Examiner immediately. Late in the afternoon, Gray's caveat was entered on the cash <b>blotter</b> and was not taken to the Examiner until the following day. The fact that Bell's filing fee was recorded earlier than Gray's led to the myth that Bell had arrived at the Patent Office earlier. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not know this happened until later. Gray later abandoned his caveat and did not contest Bell's priority. That opened the door to Bell being granted US patent 174465 for the telephone on March 7, 1876.|$|E
500|$|The Briarcliff Manor {{police force}} {{was founded by}} Edward Cashman, a one-person force who covered his beat on foot and by bicycle. The crime rate was low during both world wars, and village police work {{primarily}} involved rounding up animals (as the constabulary had done since before the Revolution). Most other cases were traffic violations, due to the village's size and parkway access. During the 1980s (as in the 1940s), the police <b>blotter</b> primarily consisted of accidents and traffic violations on the four major roads traversing the village; a 1939 village history asserted that [...] "Briarcliff {{has never had a}} serious crime". Burglaries have been primarily residential, and murder is rare. In 1989, when the police force considered replacing its [...]38 six-shot revolvers with semiautomatic 9mm pistols, opinion was divided; village officials could not remember when an officer last fired a gun on duty.|$|E

500|$|On April 22, 1921, a {{month after}} he turned 18, Beiderbecke was arrested by two Davenport police {{officers}} on a charge brought by {{the father of a}} young girl. According to biographer Jean Pierre Lion, [...] "Bix was accused of having taken this man's five-year-old daughter into a garage and committing on her an act qualified by the police report as 'lewd and lascivious.'" [...] Although Beiderbecke was briefly taken into custody and held on a $1,500 bond, the charge was dropped after the girl was not made available to testify. According to an affidavit submitted by her father, this was because [...] "of the child's age and the harm that would result to her in going over this case." [...] It is not clear from the father's affidavit if the girl had identified Beiderbecke. Until recently, biographers have largely ignored this incident in Beiderbecke's life, and Lion was the first, in 2005, to print the police <b>blotter</b> and affidavit associated with the arrest. He dismissed the seriousness of the charge, but speculated that the arrest nevertheless might have led Beiderbecke to [...] "feel abandoned and ashamed: he saw himself as suspect of perversion." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, drugs {{described}} as LSD in the 1970s occasionally actually contained PCP, amphetamine, or other drugs that have quite different effects from LSD. There are now many research chemicals (DOB 2C-I, DOC, DOI, etc.) {{that can be}} nearly indistinguishable from real LSD before use, and thus can be easily confused with [...] "bad acid." [...] Some of these, such as 25I-NBOMe are even potent enough for psychoactive doses to fit on <b>blotter</b> paper, and may occasionally be sold as LSD when the latter is scarce. [...] The idea of adulterating <b>blotter</b> LSD with these chemicals, however, has no known basis in fact.|$|E

Small quantities of 25I-NBOMe can provide a large numbers of doses. Vendors may import 25I-NBOMe in bulk and resell individual doses for considerable profit.|$|R

2500|$|Anti-drug {{educators}} frequently {{tell their}} students some variant {{on the theme}} of inevitable strychnine poisoning through LSD use, for example, that strychnine is commonly sold as a cheaper substitute for LSD by unscrupulous drug dealers; that strychnine is a byproduct of LSD synthesis; that the body produces strychnine as a result of LSD metabolism; or that strychnine is used as a preservative to prevent the otherwise natural, rapid decomposition of LSD, allowing it to be stored; or that strychnine is somehow necessary to bond LSD to <b>blotter</b> paper. None of this is true. These claims may even be believed and propagated by drug users themselves. In reality, most hallucinogens cause some degree of mental or physical discomfort after the [...] "trip" [...] is over. This is an indirect effect of the drug, not strychnine or any other adulterant. Additionally, strychnine {{is one of the most}} bitter substances known. The bitter taste can be detected at 1 part per million, which is well below the toxic level. Finally, the dangerous dose of strychnine is too high to be contained in a <b>blotter</b> square, even if the entire square were composed of the poison.|$|E
50|$|LSD is {{virtually}} never laced with other chemicals, but other lysergamides such as ALD-52 are sometimes sold as LSD-25. DOB, DOI, and other closely related drugs are sometimes sold as LSD. Several other highly potent hallucinogens such as Bromo-DragonFLY or 25I-NBOMe {{can be found}} in the form of <b>blotters.</b> LSD is also tasteless in normal dosages, so detection is only possible after ingestion or reagent testing. For these reasons, it is not uncommon to find <b>blotters</b> sold as LSD completely devoid of psychoactive substances.|$|R

This report describes a rapid method for the simultaneous identification and quantitation of DOB and its precursor (DMA) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS–MS), using 2, 3 -dimethoxyphenethylamine- d 3 as internal standard. Regression equations were linear over the tested concentration range with good correlation coefficients. The achieved levels of sensitivity may be suitable to confirm the possible presence of DOB and DMA also in low concentration or in traces in seized material for forensic analysis. The developed method showed good reproducibility and sensitivity, and {{could be used for}} similar routine analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the detection of DOB and DMA from <b>blotters...</b>|$|R

This habit character allows saprophytes to impair the fungal growth and interfere the identification on both Moist <b>Blotters</b> (MB) and the Deep-Freezing <b>Blotters</b> (DFB). Since, these two techniques are not efficient enough to detect this fungus, the researchers planned to search for an alternative technique for detecting this fungus. Soaking three layers of <b>blotters</b> used as seed-beds in water solutions alkalined with KOH or NaOH at pH 10 presents the optimum seed-bed condition for manifesting the fungus on seed. This seed-bed condition also suppress the growth of saprophytes, so as the fungus was transparently shown on seeds.

So far, it is recommended to use the alkalined seed-bed when searching for V. dahliae on fennel seed...|$|R
