5|$|Until 1886, the Sultan of Zanzibar {{controlled}} {{a substantial}} portion of the east African coast, known as Zanj, and trading routes extending further into the continent, as far as Kindu on the Congo River. That year, the British and Germans secretly met and re-established the area under the Sultan's rule. Over the next few years, most of the mainland possessions of the Sultanate were taken by European imperial powers. With the signing of the Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty in 1890 during Ali bin Said's reign, Zanzibar became a British protectorate. In August 1896, Britain and Zanzibar fought a 38-minute war, the shortest in recorded history, after Khalid bin Barghash had taken power after Hamid bin Thuwaini's death. The British had wanted Hamoud bin Mohammed to become Sultan, believing that he would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the Sultan's palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city. Khalid retreated and later went into exile. Hamoud was then installed as Sultan.|$|E

25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a sheet of paper and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E

25|$|Australasian Signed English {{was created}} in the late 1970s to {{represent}} English words and grammar, using mostly Auslan signs together with some additional contrived signs, as well as borrowings from American Sign Language (ASL). It was, and still is, used largely in education for teaching English to Deaf children or for discussing English in academic contexts. It was thought to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for hearing teachers and parents to learn another mode of English than to learn a new language with a complex spatial grammar such as Auslan.|$|E
25|$|The woman rides {{her horse}} hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse {{to the woman}} and Gashade allows Coley to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> without Coley. She and Spear demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon.|$|E

But some formats {{that are not}} easily editable, such as PDF, are generally not considered {{to fit in with}} the goals of Project Gutenberg. Also Project Gutenberg has two options for master formats that can be submitted (from which all other files are generated): customized versions of the Text Encoding Initiative standard (since 2005) and reStructuredText (since 2011).|$|E

25|$|Germany {{understood}} that the region would not be re-attached. Therefore, they favored {{the lesser of two}} evils and tacitly supported the interests of Lithuania. The Weimar Republic saw both Poland and France as its major enemies while Lithuania was more neutral. Also, once Germany restored its might, it would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to recapture the region from weaker Lithuania than from larger Poland. Already on February 22, 1922, the Germans unofficially informed the Lithuanians that they were not opposed to Lithuanian action in Klaipėda and that, understandably, such a stance would never be officially declared. Such attitudes were later confirmed in other unofficial German–Lithuanian communications and even during the revolt, when Berlin urged local Germans not to hinder the Lithuanian plans.|$|E
25|$|On May 13, 2009, Pakistan's {{ambassador}} to the United States Husain Haqqani revealed on The Daily Show to Jon Stewart that Pakistan's decision to strike a peace deal with Taliban militants earlier, which effectively ceded control of large swathes of the country's northwest, {{was all part of}} a cunning plan to fool the Taliban, which is now coming to fruition with the commencement of Operation Black Thunderstorm. The ambassador mentioned to Jon Stewart that President Asif Ali Zardari's signing of the Nizam-e-Adl Regulation, which was the Swat peace deal, {{was nothing more than a}} trick to lure the Taliban from the mountains and countryside to the main towns where it would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for the Pakistani military to kill or capture them.|$|E
25|$|The Court buttressed its {{determination}} {{based upon}} the underlying premises of the directness requirement. First, the Court explained that great difficulties arise when courts attempt to determine damages caused by attenuated actions. For example, in this case, National could have lowered its prices for numerous reasons unrelated to the asserted fraud. Conversely, Ideal's lost sales could have resulted from factors other than National's alleged RICO violation. Secondly, the direct causal connection requirement is especially warranted where the direct victims of the RICO violation can pursue their own claim. Here, the State of New York could file suit and in that situation, it would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for a court to calculate New York's damages. Based on the foregoing reasons, the Court reversed the Second Circuit's holding that Ideal had satisfied the proximate cause requirement under its section 1962(c) claim.|$|E

Chi is voiced by Rie Tanaka in the anime and Georgette Rose in its English counterpart. The manga and anime follow Hideki's find of Chi and their relationship, but differ in the storyline. Chi's critical reception has been mostly positive, with reviewers calling her [...] "cute". In addition to Chobits, {{she is also a}} crossover character in the series [...] and is referenced in other works.|$|E
500|$|One of CERA's {{objectives}} in approving the implosion {{was to find}} out how the soil behaved, as Radio Network House was built on one of the worst soils in Christchurch. Seismograph readings showed ground velocity of 12mm/s, which is comparable to a large truck slowly driving across the demolition site. With any residual concerns about the performance of poor soils during building implosions removed, it will <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for other building owners to obtain consent from CERA. Further implosions are likely, with a representative from Controlled Demolition, Inc. describing the Christchurch market as a [...] "target-rich environment". So far, only the Christchurch Central Police Station has since also been demolished by implosion in early 2015; this happened in May 2015.|$|E
500|$|The GRC scheme {{has been}} criticized as {{weakening}} the candidate–voter relationship, because {{it may be more}} difficult for voters to feel that candidates actually represent them when {{there are a number of}} candidates in a team to vote for. Most voters elect MPs whom they can identify with and are better able to represent their interests. It would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> for voters to identify with a single candidate than with a team of, say, four individuals. Also, since there will be key vote pullers in every GRC, the unknown or unpopular candidate is [...] "dragged into Parliament on the coat-tails of the major vote-puller". This alienates the electorate from its representatives, thereby undermining the idea of representation. Since the people [...] "cannot clearly identify themselves with the candidates ... responsibility for choices cannot be ascribed to the people".|$|E

500|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} of a {{containment}} vessel for an unsuccessful explosion, known as [...] "Jumbo", was assigned to Robert W. Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory's X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful, the outer walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder, made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson. They drew up specifications for a steel sphere [...] in diameter, weighing [...] and capable of handling a pressure of [...] After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> to manufacture. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, Babcock & Wilcox; they had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, the {{decision}} problem [...] "is N a composite number?" [...] (or equivalently: [...] "is N a prime number?") appears to <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> than {{the problem of}} actually finding the factors of N. Specifically, the former can be solved in polynomial time (in the number n of digits of N) with the AKS primality test. In addition, {{there are a number}} of probabilistic algorithms that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept the vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of primality testing is a crucial part of the RSA algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.|$|E
