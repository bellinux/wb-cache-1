5|$|Xigbar's {{telescopic}} sight was {{changed from a}} crosshair and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, {{which is used to}} shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member Axel was slightly edited; in the original, he <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.|$|E

5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in Canada, the Smoking Man (William B. Davis) {{is found}} by Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). At FBI Headquarters, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) reveals to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) {{is leading the}} case {{investigating}} the shooting.

The Smoking Man is reunited with the Syndicate members, including the First Elder and the Well-Manicured Man, who want him {{to help them with}} the situation concerning Gibson.

Scully learns that Mulder and Diana know each other from long ago.|$|E
5|$|In 1922 the American film Hope, {{directed}} by Legaren à Hiller and starring Mary Astor and Ralph Faulkner, {{was based on}} the imagined origins of the painting. In it Joan, a fisherman's wife, is treated poorly by the rest of her village in her husband's absence, and has only the hope of his return to cling to. His ship returns but <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> flames, before he is washed up safe and well on shore. The story is interspersed with scenes of Watts explaining the story to a model, and with stills of the painting. By the time the film was released, the fad for prints of Hope was long over, to the extent that references to it had become verbal shorthand for authors and artists wanting to indicate that a scene was set in the 1900s–1910s. Watts's reputation continued to fade as artistic tastes changed, and in 1938 the Tate Gallery removed their collection of Watts's works from permanent display.|$|E

5|$|In another vision Scully lies on a {{table and}} is visited by her {{deceased}} father. Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes the both of them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|Later, Jack asks Liz {{about her}} {{relationship}} with her boyfriend Carol (Matt Damon), an airline pilot. She tells him that during the summer break the two met twice a month in a hotel. Jack does not believe that the relationship is serious since Carol never stays at Liz's apartment. He decides to force Carol to stay with Liz and reserves all the rooms of the hotel that Liz and Carol stay in when he is in New York. During his stay with Liz, Carol <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> tears and asks her where their relationship is heading as he believes that she is resisting him, which she denies. The next day, Carol decides to leave New York early, but tells Liz that they need to work on their relationship. The two go their separate ways and agree to meet again on October 14.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{locates the}} elderly man and confronts him; however, he injects {{her with the}} {{chemical}} after explaining that Lisa {{will be responsible for}} the coming future.

5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration.

5|$|Magi sacrifices {{herself to}} give the fairies a chance, and she tells Crysta to {{remember}} everything she's learned. Zak manages to stop the machine, depriving Hexxus {{the source of his}} power, but he manifests himself within the oil in the machine and begins to ignite the forest ablaze. Crysta seemingly sacrifices herself by allowing herself to be devoured by Hexxus and all seems lost, until he begins to sprout limbs and leaves like a tree.

Hexxus is imprisoned by the newly grown tree at the very border of FernGully which <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> bloom. Crysta appears after the fight, having survived her ordeal and successfully succeeded Magi as a magical fairy.

5|$|The old man kills Dr. Yonechi (Hiro Kanagawa), a Japanese researcher, by {{pricking}} {{him with}} a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli (Susan Lee Hoffman), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound {{has not yet been}} invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he <b>bursts</b> <b>into</b> flames. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a time traveller who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.|$|E
