40|$|Background: Improved local {{treatment}} of uveal melanoma {{makes it possible}} for many patients to retain the affected eye, but a proportion will develop secondary complications such as neovascularisation of the iris (NVI) and require enucleation. Although vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is known to correlate with NVI and can cause NVI in experimental models, this pro-angiogenic cytokine is consistently reported to be absent in uveal melanoma. Novel anti-VEGF therapies are now in clinical trial, and the authors therefore wished to determine whether VEGF-A was indeed elevated in melanoma <b>bearing</b> <b>eyes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Treatments for {{retinoblastoma}} (Rb) {{vary depending}} on the size and location of the intraocular lesions and include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. We examined whether agents used to treat Rb induce a pro-survival phenotype associated with increased expression of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis family of proteins. We document that exposure to carboplatin, topotecan or radiation resulted in elevated expression of survivin in two human Rb cell lines but not in normal retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. Cellular levels of survivin were attenuated in Rb cells exposed to an imidazolium-based survivin suppressant, Sepantronium bromide (YM 155). Protein expression patterns of survivin in RPE cells were not altered following treatment protocols involving exposure to YM 155. Including YM 155 with chemotherapy or radiation increased levels of apoptosis in Rb cells but not in RPE cells. Intraocular luciferase expressing Rb tumors were generated from the Rb cell lines and used to evaluate the effects of carboplatin and YM 155 on in-vivo survivin expression and tumor growth. Carboplatin induced expression of survivin while carboplatin combined with YM 155 reduced survivin expression in tumor <b>bearing</b> <b>eyes.</b> The combination protocol was also most effective in reducing the rate of tumor regrowth. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin provides a therapeutic advantage for Rb cells and tumors treated with chemotherapy...|$|R
