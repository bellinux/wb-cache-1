5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to <b>break</b> <b>character.</b> Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E

50|$|Corpsing is British {{theatrical}} {{slang for}} unintentionally <b>breaking</b> <b>character</b> by laughing. In North American TV and film, this is {{commonly referred to}} as breaking, and it is generally categorized as a blooper. The origin of the term corpsing itself is unclear, but may come from (provoking an actor into) <b>breaking</b> <b>character</b> by laughing while portraying a corpse. As the name suggests, many examples of corpsing have been created from actors performing this role or related roles, such as a sleeping or unconscious character.|$|R

50|$|In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), <b>breaking</b> <b>character</b> {{occurs when}} an actor ceases to {{maintain}} the illusion {{that they are the}} character they are portraying, such as by behaving off-script or expressing a genuine emotion the character is not meant to be feeling. If the <b>breaking</b> of <b>character</b> is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take.|$|R

[...] Chamberlain said he [...] "just gave the horse a quick pat before hopping on" [...] but found himself [...] "getting tugged the other way as the horse was munching away on the straw poking out of the end of my sleeve!" [...] An animatronic version of Chamberlain's head which operated by remote control was used in some scenes. [...] Some of the actors had to only pretend to look at the animatronic head during their scenes, because if they looked at it while it responded, they would laugh and <b>break</b> <b>character.</b>|$|E
500|$|On February 19, Fox News {{and various}} right-wing {{commentators}} including Glenn Beck claimed that Swagger and Colter's characters were {{a mockery of}} the Tea Party movement meant to [...] "demonize" [...] the Tea Party. WWE responded to the criticism by stating that they were incorporating [...] "current events into [...] storylines" [...] to [...] "create compelling and relevant content for [...] audience" [...] and that [...] "this storyline in no way represents WWE’s political point of view". WWE followed by having Swagger and Colter <b>break</b> <b>character</b> during a video to invite Beck to appear on Raw while justifying that the storyline was designed to elicit a crowd response for the protagonist, Alberto Del Rio, and the antagonists, Swagger and Colter, while remaining within a PG rating, unlike several high-rated scripted dramas that use murder and rape in their storylines. Beck rejected the invitation. On the March 18 episode of Raw, Swagger broke the ankle of Del Rio's ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez after Rodriguez tried to save Del Rio from Swagger's vicious assault.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Day-Lewis {{gave his}} first {{critically}} acclaimed performance playing {{a gay man}} in an interracial relationship in the film My Beautiful Laundrette, set in 1980s London during the period when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. The film {{is the first of}} three Day-Lewis films to appear in the BFI's 100 greatest British films of the 20th century, ranking 50th. Day-Lewis gained further public notice with A Room with a View (1985). Set in the Edwardian period of turn-of-the-twentieth-century England, he portrayed an entirely different character: Cecil Vyse, the proper upper class fiancé of the main character. In 1987, Day-Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman's adaptation of Milan Kundera's The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman. During the eight-month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to <b>break</b> <b>character</b> on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule. During this period, Day-Lewis and other young British actors of the time such as Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tim Roth, and Bruce Payne, were dubbed the [...] "Brit Pack".|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to <b>break</b> <b>character,</b> when she next appeared, and bow.

500|$|The {{budget was}} set at $5.5 million, and the film was shot in 35 days in Los Angeles, San Pedro and New York City. Spacey said that they shot the {{interrogation}} scenes with Palminteri over a span of five to six days. These scenes were also shot {{before the rest of}} the film. The police lineup scene ran into scheduling conflicts because the actors kept blowing their lines. Screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie would feed the actors questions off-camera and they improvised their lines. When Stephen Baldwin gave his answer, he made the other actors <b>break</b> <b>character.</b> Byrne remembers that they were often laughing between takes and [...] "when they said, 'Action!', we'd barely be able to keep it together." [...] Spacey also said that the hardest part was not laughing through takes, with Baldwin and Pollak being the worst culprits. Their goal was to get the usually serious Byrne to crack up. They spent all morning trying unsuccessfully to film the scene. At lunch a frustrated Singer angrily scolded the five actors, but when they resumed the cast continued to laugh through each take. Byrne remembers, [...] "Finally, Bryan just used one of the takes where we couldn't stay serious." [...] Singer and editor John Ottman used a combination of takes and kept the humor in to show the characters bonding with one another.|$|E

2500|$|As {{their show}} progressed and ratings skyrocketed, French and Saunders {{received}} {{higher and higher}} budgets with which to create elaborate parodies of mainstream culture. These ranged anywhere from recreations of films (Thelma & Louise, Misery, Titanic, and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?) to spoofs on popular music artists (Madonna, Bananarama, ABBA and The Corrs being favourites). Certain spoken phrases and sight gags that referenced previously performed sketches (often from years before) were incorporated for loyal fans. In particular there is a running gag suggesting that French and Saunders are unable to accurately affect accents; this first appeared in their spoof of Gone with the Wind when they break their character {{in the middle of}} an elaborate and expensive parody to argue about the authenticity of their Southern accent. Saunders goads French to try the accent by saying: [...] "How are you?", and French responds with an interpretation sounding more like a strong Northern Irish accent. Since then, the duo often <b>break</b> <b>character</b> in the middle of elaborate sketches to do an [...] "accent check" [...] and repeat these lines.|$|E
