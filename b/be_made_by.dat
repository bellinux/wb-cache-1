5|$|Molybdenum-99, which decays to form technetium-99m, can {{be formed}} by the neutron {{activation}} of molybdenum-98.

5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual passenger information systems; station announcements had to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the train operator.

5|$|While AIB patrols {{continued}} {{to report that}} no Japanese troops were located in the Jacquinot Bay area, the Australian command decided that the landing there would <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> a combat-ready force protected by naval vessels. This was intended both as a precaution against a sudden Japanese offensive and to provide useful experience for the units involved. The landing was designated Operation Battleaxe.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might blow the paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading {{the attack on the}} Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E

5|$|Although calcium is in {{the same}} group as {{magnesium}} and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organocalcium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive, although they have recently been investigated as possible catalysts. Organocalcium compounds tend to be more similar to organoytterbium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of Yb2+ (102pm) and Ca2+ (100pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, calcium dicyclopentadienyl, Ca(C5H5)2, must <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> directly reacting calcium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound's solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, {{and there is}} some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal can <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> slow {{pyrolysis}} of wood by heating it in {{the absence}} of air in a kiln. The carefully stacked branches, often oak, are burned with a very limited amount of air. The process of converting them into charcoal takes about fifteen hours. Charcoal is used as a fuel in barbecues and by blacksmiths and has many industrial and other uses.|$|E

Neerja was released on 19 February 2016 to positive critical reception, with praise directed to Kapoor's performance, {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist.|$|E
5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia {{as they had}} been fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E
