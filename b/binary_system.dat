5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a thermonuclear explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray <b>binary</b> <b>system,</b> comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{examined}} numerically exact configurations of close <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> composed of incompressible fluids with internal flows. Component stars of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> {{are assumed to}} be circularly orbiting each other but rotating nonsynchronously with the orbital motion, i. e. stars in <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> have steady motions seen from a rotational frame of reference. We have computed several equilibrium sequences by taking fully into account the tidal effect of Newtonian gravity without approximation. We consider two <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> consisting of either 1) a point mass and a fluid star or 2) a fluid star and a fluid star. Each of them corresponds to generalization of the Roche [...] Riemann or the Darwin [...] Riemann problem, respectively. Our code can be applied to various types of incompressible <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with various mass ratios and spin as long as the vorticity is constant. We compare these equilibrium sequences of binaries with approximate solutions which were studied extensively by Lai, Rasio and Shapiro (LRS) as models for neutron star [...] neutron star (NS [...] NS) <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> or black hole [...] neutron star (BH [...] NS) <b>binary</b> <b>systems.</b> Our results coincide qualitatively with those of LRS but are different from theirs for configurations with small separations.

40|$|We analise the {{behavior}} of lithium abundance {{as a function of}} effective temperature, projected rotational velocity, orbital period and eccentricity for a sample of 68 <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with giant component and orbital period ranging from about 10 to 6400 days. For these <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> the Li abundances show a gradual decrease with temperature, paralleling the well established result for single giants. We have also observed a dependence of lithium content on rotation. <b>Binary</b> <b>systems</b> with moderate to high rotation present also moderate to high Li content. This study shows also that synchronized <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with giant component seems to retain more of their original lithium than the unsynchronized systems. For orbital periods lower than 100 to 250 days, typically the period of synchronization for this kind of <b>binary</b> <b>systems,</b> lithium depleted stars seems to be unusual. The suggestion is made that there is an 'inhibited zone' in which synchronized <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with giant component having lithium abundance lower than a threshold level should be unusual.

40|$|We used deep wide field {{photometric}} {{observations to}} derive {{the fraction of}} <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> {{in a sample of}} five high-latitude Galactic open clusters. By analysing the color distribution of Main Sequence stars we derived the minimum fraction of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> required to reproduce the observed color-magnitude diagram morphologies. We found that all the analysed clusters contain a minimum binary fraction larger than 11 % within the core radius. The estimated global fractions of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> range from 35 % to 70 % depending on the cluster. The comparison with homogeneous estimates performed in globular clusters indicates that open clusters hold a significantly higher fraction of <b>binary</b> <b>systems,</b> as predicted by theoretical models and N-body simulations. A dependence of the relative fraction of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> on the cluster mass has been detected, suggesting that the binary disruption within the cluster core is the dominant process that drives the fraction of <b>binaries</b> in stellar <b>systems.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication by MNRA...|$|R

5|$|A close {{binary star}} system occurs when two stars orbit {{each other with}} an average {{separation}} that is of the same order of magnitude as their diameters. At these distances, more complex interactions can occur, such as tidal effects, transfer of mass and even collisions. Tidal interactions in a close <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> can result in modification of the orbital and rotational parameters. The total angular momentum {{of the system is}} conserved, but the angular momentum can be transferred between the orbital periods and the rotation rates.|$|E
40|$|Most {{methods of}} orbit {{determination}} are often difficult for numerical implementations {{since they are}} developed before the computer era. The recently developed mathematical technique of semi-definite programming (SDP) has been implemented for many problems in scientific fields including astrometry. This is {{a good opportunity to}} resolve orbits of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> located in the southern hemisphere since more than seventy years Bosscha Observatory had been continuously conducting observations of <b>binary</b> <b>systems.</b> Here we describe prospects of application of SDP for deriving orbital parameters of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> using data supplied by Bosscha Observatory that has been published in the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg. This study will support observers at Bosscha Observatory to appropriately select target stars belong to <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> for their ongoing researches.

40|$|In this paper, the {{volatility}} of <b>binary</b> <b>systems,</b> consisting of neopentylglycol(NPG), pentaerythritol(PE) and trihytdroxy methyl-aminomethane(TAM) with different components, was studied experimentally.

40|$|A radial {{velocity}} {{study of the}} stars which are located on a second sequence above the single-star zero-age main sequence at a given color in the color-magnitude diagram of the open cluster Praesepe, (NGC 2632) shows that 10, and possibly 11, of 17 are <b>binary</b> <b>systems.</b> Of the <b>binary</b> <b>systems,</b> five have full amplitudes for their velocity variations that are greater than 50 km/s. To {{the extent that they}} can be applied to globular clusters, these results suggests that (1) observations of 'second-sequence' stars in globular clusters would be an efficient way of finding main-sequence <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> in globulars, and (2) current instrumentation on large telescopes is sufficient for establishing unambiguously the existence of main-sequence <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> in nearby globular clusters...|$|R
5|$|Binary {{systems of}} sub-brown dwarfs are {{theoretically}} possible; Oph 162225-240515 was initially {{thought to be}} a <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> of a brown dwarf of 14 Jupiter masses and a sub-brown dwarf of 7 Jupiter masses, but further observations revised the estimated masses upwards to greater than 13 Jupiter masses, making them brown dwarfs according to the IAU working definitions.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{heating effect}} of binary star systems works {{to prevent an}} initial core collapse of the cluster. When a star passes near a <b>binary</b> <b>system,</b> the orbit of the latter pair tends to contract, releasing energy. Only after the primordial supply of binaries is exhausted due to interactions can a deeper core collapse proceed. In contrast, the effect of tidal shocks as a globular cluster repeatedly passes through the plane of a spiral galaxy tends to significantly accelerate core collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{orbital motion}} of the Sirius <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> brings the two stars to a minimum angular {{separation}} of 3arcseconds and a maximum of 11arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least 300mm (12in) aperture and excellent seeing conditions. A periastron occurred in 1994 and the pair have since been moving apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope.|$|E
5|$|According {{to general}} relativity, a <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> will emit {{gravitational}} waves, thereby losing energy. Due to this loss, {{the distance between}} the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period. Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable. This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period. Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.|$|E

When <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with a {{chemically}} peculiar (CP) star {{are compared}} with normal-star <b>binary</b> <b>systems,</b> they present: a lower incidence, a deficiency of short periods, rather eccentric orbits, and companions of low mass. Unfortunately {{these results are}} based on a relatively small (∼ 50) number of CP-star <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> with known orbital parameters and a similar analysis has not yet been carried out for helium-peculiar stars, as there is only one helium-weak star with known orbital elements. With the aim to contribute to the study of <b>binary</b> <b>systems</b> whose brightest component is a CP star, we have performed spectroscopic observations and determined the orbital elements for seven of these systems.

5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a <b>binary</b> <b>system,</b> a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Collisions of solitary stars {{within the}} Milky Way occur {{only once every}} -; far less {{frequently}} than the appearance of novae. Collisions occur with greater frequency in the dense core regions of globular clusters (cf. blue stragglers). A likely scenario is a collision with a binary star system, or between two binary systems containing white dwarfs. This collision can leave behind a close <b>binary</b> <b>system</b> of two white dwarfs. Their orbit decays and they merge through their shared envelope. However, a study based on SDSS spectra found 15 double systems of the 4,000 white dwarfs tested, implying a double white dwarf merger every 100 years in the Milky Way. Conveniently, this rate matches the number of Type Ia supernovae detected in our neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting <b>binary</b> <b>system.</b> The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

Due to these chance encounters, some exotic classes of stars, such as blue stragglers, millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries, are much more common in globular clusters. A blue straggler is formed from the merger of two stars, possibly {{as a result of an}} encounter with a <b>binary</b> <b>system.</b> The resulting star has a higher temperature than comparable stars in the cluster with the same luminosity, and thus differs from the main sequence stars formed at the beginning of the cluster.|$|E
