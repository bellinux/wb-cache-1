40|$|Summary-Impedance {{transformers}} in VHF {{region are}} {{constructed by the}} distributed constants circuit, therefore their physical lengths are to olong to use in general low power equipments. 　In order to compact the impedance transformer and be more wide band, this paper introduces a new circuit element <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix.</b> 　The impedance transformer by the <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> is perfectly small and its electrical characteristic satisfies our demands. 　Designs are tried about multi-quarterwave types for general use and tapered line types for extra wide band. These results of experiments about trial designs are obtained values under 1. 2 in VSWR...|$|E
40|$|A {{statistical}} model is developed {{to predict the}} noise induced in the terminal loads of a TWP running above ground and illuminated by a plane-wave electromagnetic field. The model accounts for random variations of the pitch of the <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> formed by wires, and is derived {{under the assumption that}} the TWP is electrically-short at the frequency of interest. The obtained closed-form formulation makes the proposed model computationally efficient and suitable to perform extensive parametric simulations, aimed at unveiling the impact played by the geometrical features of non-uniform twisting on the statistical estimates of the induced noise...|$|E
40|$|A transmission-line {{model is}} {{developed}} for predicting {{the response of}} a twisted-wire pair (TWP) circuit {{in the presence of}} a ground plane, illuminated by a plane-wave electromagnetic field. The twisted pair is modeled as an ideal <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix,</b> the total coupling is separated into differential- (DM) and common-mode (CM) contributions, and closed-form expressions are derived for the equivalent induced sources. Approximate upper bounds to the terminal response of electrically long lines are obtained, and a simplified low-frequency circuit model is used to explain the mechanism of field-to-wire coupling in a TWP above ground, as well as the role of load balancing on the DM and CM electromagnetic noise induced in the terminal loads...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{modeling}} issue of the nearfield coupling of an unshielded twisted-wire pair on a nearby single wire. It introduces {{a discussion about the}} appropriate modeling method for predicting the induced current on the victim wire and proposes a cost-effective approach to deal with either ideal or nonideal twisted pair. A nonideal twisted pair consists of a twisted pair whose ends are left untwisted for connection to equipment. We show that the current distribution may follow a specific spatial distribution on the nearby wire. These coupling effects are evidenced through the analysis of an equivalent circuit under the low-frequency assumption. These behaviors are illustrated for the case of both an ideal twisted pair and a nonideal twisted pair. For the latter, the ideal <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> may be modeled by a simple equivalent model bifilar cable...|$|E
40|$|Random {{non-uniformity}} of {{the twist}} pitch {{play an important}} role in radiated immunity of twisted-wire pairs (TWPs). In this work, a numerical prediction model based on transmission-line theory is used to investigate the response of a TWP with non-uniform twisting. The TWP is connected to balanced loads, is placed above an ideal ground plane, and illuminated by a plane-wave electromagnetic field. Unlike in previous works, where non-uniform TWPs were simply described as a cascade of individual twists of helical shape with different pitch, here the TWP is represented as a <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> with continuous variation of the twist pitch. The modeling approach is therefore more consistent with the physical structure of a real TWP, and exploits a random function which relates the local value of the twist-pitch with the position along the TWP. It is shown that twist-pitch non uniformity does not affect the common-mode component of the response to the external field, whereas it influences the differential-mode voltage, whose sensitivity to twist-pitch non uniformity can be conveniently analyzed by resorting to a statistical approach...|$|E
40|$|Helices are {{broadband}} antennas {{that provide}} moderate gain, largely real input impedance and circular polarization when {{operating in the}} axial mode regime. A modified form of the helix, the spherical helix, {{has been shown to}} yield similar polarization and gain characteristics over a narrow bandwidth but a much larger beamwidth. This investigation examines multifilar hemispherical helices and produces two specific designs with some desirable radiation characteristics. The side-fed quadrifilar helix and the top-fed <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> are the new hemispherical designs which are studied in detail both numerically and experimentally. The Numerical Electromagnetics Code 4 is used to analyze the radiation characteristics of the proposed multifilar hemispherical helices. Directivity, E- and H-plane radiation patterns, axial ratio and input impedance of a few example designs are calculated. Measurements, taken in the anechoic chamber at the Virginia Tech antenna range, generally confirmed the simulation results. It is shown that the bifilar hemispherical helix provides a flat gain curve over the measured bandwidth (~ 14 %) and generally elliptical polarization with near circular polarization in limited case. ii...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of twist-pitch nonuniformity on the radiated susceptibility of a twisted-wire pair (TWP) running above ground and illuminated by a plane-wave field is investigated via a transmission-line model. The geometrical {{representation of the}} TWP involves a <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> with a variable pitch function, which readily allows for the description of any unwanted/unknown deviations from the ideal twist geometry. Basic examples are used to show that such a deformation plays {{a fundamental role in}} the pickup of differential-mode (DM) noise, thus substantiating the need for the proposed prediction model. By describing the pitch random variations as a spatial stochastic process, a realistic representation of the twisting features is obtained (both for TWPs with imperfect uniform twists and for TWPs intentionally manufactured with random nonuniform twists). Repeated runs are used to characterize the sensitivity of the induced DM noise to random nonuniform twisting. Especially, it is shown that the twist-pitch nonuniformity, sometimes intentionally used to reduce pair-to-pair crosstalk in TWP cables, may however lead to a severe decrease of the TWP immunity to external fields...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{design and}} {{analysis}} of omnidirectional single feed circularly polarized, wide axial ratio beamwidth resonant side-fed <b>bifilar</b> <b>helix</b> antennas {{that do not require}} a ground plane is presented. The simulation and measurement results show that side-fed helix antennas of various radii gives near perfect circular polarization (CP) almost over the whole sphere except at and around nulls, at a certain turn angle by properly proportioning the area of loop (A) with the product of pitch (ρ) and radianlength (l) of helix. Helix antennas with smaller radii give axial ratio (AR) close to one at higher values of turn angle with lower value of resonant input impedances but CP is less sensitive to inaccuracy in turn angle. However helix antennas with larger radii results in AR close to one at lower values of turn angle and provides better values of input resistance but its AR is more sensitive to variations in turn angle. The simulated results show that the polarization solid angle beamwidth (for AR ≤ 3 dB) varies from 3. 96 pi to 4 pi steradian. The gain and 3 dB beamwidth of the antennas are 2 dBi and 90 ◦ respectively. The polarization bandwidth varies from 34 % to 65 %. The simulated results are verified by experimental measurements. 1...|$|E
