5|$|Bonded by <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> an American thrash metal band, {{named after}} Exodus' debut album Bonded by Blood. Like its labelmates Evile, Gama Bomb, and Municipal Waste, Bonded by <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} thrash metal revival movement. The band was formed in mid-2005 by vocalist Jose Barrales, who {{with the help of}} friends {{completed}} the band's original lineup with guitarist Alex Lee, drummer Carlos Regalado, and bassist Ruben Dominguez.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into semen.|$|E
5|$|About 50–80% of {{salicylate}} in the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> {{bound to}} albumin protein, {{while the rest}} remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 L/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.|$|E
5000|$|Among the Germanic tribes, <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{used during}} their sacrifices; the Blóts. The <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} to have the power of its originator, and, after the butchering, the <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> sprinkled on the walls, on the statues of the gods, and on the participants themselves. This act of sprinkling <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> called blóedsian in Old English, and the terminology was borrowed by the Roman Catholic Church becoming to bless and blessing. The Hittite word for <b>blood,</b> ishar <b>was</b> a cognate to words for [...] "oath" [...] and [...] "bond", see Ishara.The Ancient Greeks believed that {{the blood of the}} gods, ichor, was a substance that was poisonous to mortals.|$|R
30|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> {{withdrawn}} from the rats under ether anaesthesia 24  h after the final treatments. <b>Blood</b> samples <b>were</b> collected from the inferior vena cava to the proper tubes. The <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> centrifuged at 2063  ×g for 15  min at 4  °C, and the serum was obtained to determine liver function.|$|R
30|$|Turtles were sedated with an {{intramuscular}} injection of 5 to 10 mg/kg tiletamine-zolazepam (Zoletil®, Virbac, Carros, France), and 1 ml of <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{obtained from the}} jugular vein using a 29 -gauge × 12.7 -mm needle. <b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> placed in two tubes of 0.25 and 0.75 ml containing lithium heparin, respectively: 0.75 ml of <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> centrifuged at 2, 000 ×g for 3 min to separate the plasma used for biochemistry analysis, and 0.25 ml of <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> used to obtain data on the packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, and WBC differential count.|$|R
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> {{supplied}} to the cervix by the descending {{branch of the}} uterine artery and drains into the uterine vein. The pelvic splanchnic nerves, emerging as S2S3, transmit the sensation of pain from the cervix to the brain. These nerves travel along the uterosacral ligaments, which pass from the uterus to the anterior sacrum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by American {{progressive}} rock band OSI, released by InsideOut Music on April 27, 2009 in Europe and May 19, 2009 in North America.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first angiogram. About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> limited to the subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, {{the origin of the}} <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E
30|$|For {{determination}} of markers of oxidative stress, <b>blood</b> samples <b>were</b> collected, without using any anticoagulant {{and then the}} <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> allowed to clot for 30  min at 25  °C. The <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> centrifuged at 700 x g for 10  min. A pipette was used to separate the top yellow serum layer without disturbing the white Buffy layer.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth century, some Arab <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}}; English Anglo-Arab and Thoroughbred <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> introduced {{towards the end}} of the eighteenth century. In the early twentieth century, after the First World War, there was some addition of Andalusian blood.|$|R
25|$|Galen's ideas {{prevailed in}} {{medicine}} until the 17th century. It <b>was</b> thought that <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{produced by the}} liver from chyle contaminated with ailments by the intestine and stomach, to which various spirits were added by other organs, and that this <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> consumed by all the organs of the body. This theory required that the <b>blood</b> <b>be</b> consumed and produced many times over. Even in the 17th century, his ideas were defended by some physicians.|$|R
5|$|In Cold <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> an {{adventure}} game developed by Revolution Software for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 2000 in Europe and in 2001 in North America. The player assumes {{the role of}} John Cord—an MI6 agent who is captured while on assignment and tries {{to figure out who}} betrayed him through a series of flashbacks.|$|E
5|$|Marrow or <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> {{examined}} under light microscopy, {{as well as}} flow cytometry, {{to diagnose}} the presence of leukemia, to differentiate AML from other types of leukemia (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia - ALL), and to classify the subtype of disease. A sample of marrow or <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> typically also tested for chromosomal abnormalities by routine cytogenetics or fluorescent in situ hybridization. Genetic studies may also be performed to look for specific mutations in genes such as FLT3, nucleophosmin, and KIT, which may influence {{the outcome of the}} disease.|$|E
5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> kept from clotting by an anticoagulant in the saliva.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blood</b> serum <b>is</b> {{extensively}} used in {{tissue culture}} and for perfusion of organs. Its nutritive and protective {{value for the}} preservation and growth of animal cells in vitro is well known. Spermatozoa and ova are cells especially differentiated for fertilization. It has been reported (Chang, 1947) {{that there is a}} spermicidal factor in serum which kills spermatozoa of its own species and Of other species in vitro. This paper deals with a series of experiments which demonstrate a thermolabile factor in the sera of certain species which kills fertilized rabbit ova. Methods <b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> collected aseptically by heart puncture with or without anesthesia in the case of rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. It was obtained from the jugular vein in the domestic animals (cattle, horse, sheep, and goat) except in pigs, when the <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> collected from the neck vessels at slaughter. Fowl <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> obtained by puncturing between cranium and atlas; human <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> drawn from the basilic vein. The whole <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> centrifuged two or three times at 2, 000 ml,. r~, to secure clea...|$|R
30|$|Whole <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> {{drawn by}} direct {{puncture}} of the inferior vena cava in mice, {{which had been}} deeply anesthetized with intraperitoneal 10  % pentobarbital (100  mg/kg body weight). <b>Blood</b> samples <b>were</b> used for three different purposes; whole blood cell counts, serum collection, and preparation of white blood cell suspensions. For whole blood cell counts, <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> collected into tubes containing ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA), and was analyzed using a whole blood counter (Celltacα; Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan). For serum collection, <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> collected into tubes without EDTA, and thereafter individual serum samples were separated from the clotted blood by centrifugation and stored at − 80  °C until the assays were performed. For preparation of white blood cell suspensions, whole <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> collected into tubes containing EDTA, <b>blood</b> cell suspensions <b>were</b> prepared after hemolysis of erythrocytes by distilled water, and the resultant suspensions were used for flow cytometry.|$|R
50|$|Royal <b>Blood</b> <b>are</b> an English rock duo {{formed in}} Brighton in 2013. The band's sound is {{reminiscent}} of and rooted in modern blues rock, hard rock, garage rock, stoner rock and psychedelic rock. Their first album Royal <b>Blood</b> <b>was</b> released in August 2014.|$|R
5|$|Adult {{amphibians}} {{and most}} reptiles {{have a double}} circulatory system, meaning a circulatory system divided into arterial and venous parts. However, the heart itself is not completely separated into two sides. Instead, it is separated into three chambers – two atria and one ventricle. Blood returning from both the systemic circulation and the lungs is returned, and <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> pumped simultaneously into the systemic circulation and the lungs. The double system allows blood to circulate to and from lungs which deliver oxygenated blood directly to the heart.|$|E
5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 in <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|Biopsy of {{the kidney}} may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the glomerulus, where <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|Cooper is woken early by {{the sound}} of a raucous party in the Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, Truman and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.|$|E
5|$|Developed by Probe Entertainment, the Game Boy port is {{superior}} to the Game Boy version of the original game but only contains eight of the 12 playable fighters from the arcade game (lacking Baraka, Johnny Cage, Kung Lao and Raiden); Kintaro and Noob Saibot were also removed from the game. Only three of ten arenas are retained from the arcade version: the Kombat Tomb, the Pit II and Goro's Lair. The Kombat Tomb contains the port's only Stage Fatality and Goro's Lair is much simpler in this version (consisting of a brick wall with no openings or glowing eyes). <b>Blood</b> <b>is</b> completely removed and each playable character retains only one of their Fatalities plus the Babality.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
30|$|Five {{fish from}} each {{experimental}} replicate {{were randomly selected}} to collect the blood sample from the caudal vessels. The fish <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> then pooled together and heparinized for hematological studies. A drop of each fish’s <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> also used to make blood smear for leucocyte differential count.|$|R

5|$|Horizontal {{transmission}} {{is the most}} common mechanism of spread of viruses in populations. Transmission can occur when: body fluids are exchanged during sexual activity, e.g., HIV; <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> exchanged by contaminated transfusion or needle sharing, e.g., hepatitis C; exchange of saliva by mouth, e.g., Epstein–Barr virus; contaminated food or water is ingested, e.g., norovirus; aerosols containing virions are inhaled, e.g., influenza virus; and insect vectors such as mosquitoes penetrate the skin of a host, e.g., dengue.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that {{was seen in the}} first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker <b>blood,</b> <b>is</b> attempting to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E
