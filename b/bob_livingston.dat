In 1977, {{he became the}} campaign coordinator for Republican <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston,</b> who {{for the second time}} sought to represent Louisiana's 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. Livingston had lost in the 1976 general election to Democrat Richard Alvin Tonry. When Tonry was forced to resign because of campaign finance violations in 1977, Livingston won the seat in a special election, with Couhig's backing, and served until 1999.|$|E
25|$|Flynt has {{repeatedly}} {{weighed in on}} public debates by trying to expose conservative or Republican politicians with sexual scandals. He did so during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton in 1998, offering $1 million for evidence and publishing the results in The Flynt Report. These publications led to the resignation of incoming House Speaker <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston.</b> In 2007, Flynt repeated his $1 million offer and also wrote the foreword to Joseph Minton Amann and Tom Breuer's The Brotherhood of Disappearing Pants: A Field Guide to Conservative Sex Scandals, which contained some cases published by Flynt.|$|E

25|$|Vitter won {{a special}} {{election}} to Louisiana's 1st congressional district in 1999, succeeding Republican U.S. Representative <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston,</b> who resigned after disclosure that he had committed adultery. In the initial vote on May 1, 1999, former Congressman and Governor David C. Treen finished first with 36,719 votes (25 percent). Vitter was second, with 31,741 (22 percent), and white nationalist David Duke finished third with 28,055 votes (19 percent). Monica L. Monica, a Republican ophthalmologist, had 16 percent; State Representative Bill Strain, a conservative Democrat, finished fifth with 11 percent; and Rob Couhig, a Republican lawyer {{and the owner of}} New Orleans's minor league baseball team, garnered 6 percent. In the runoff, Vitter defeated Treen 51–49 percent.|$|E

He finished in fifth place with 5,149 votes (8 percent). Former Republican Governor David C. Treen was forced into a runoff for the seat with state Representative David Vitter. Vitter narrowly won {{the second round of}} balloting and held the seat from 1999 to 2005. Vitter then became the state's first Republican U.S. senator since Reconstruction. Couhig was even overshadowed in the House race by the controversial Republican convert David Duke.|$|E
25|$|Santana {{was signed}} by CBS Records {{and went into the}} studio to record their first album in January 1969. They were not {{satisfied}} with the subsequent release (which consisted of tracks recorded in May 1969) and decided changes needed to be made. This resulted in the dismissal of drummer <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston.</b> Santana replaced him with Mike Shrieve, who had a strong background in both jazz and rock. Percussionist Marcus Malone was forced to quit the band due to involuntary manslaughter charges, and the band re-enlisted Michael Carabello. Carabello brought with him percussionist Jose Chepito Areas, who was already well known in his native Nicaragua, and, with his skills and professional experience, was a major contributor to the band.|$|E

Ferguson described the show as [...] "a cross between Land of Giants, Marine Boy and Jacques Cousteau on speed." [...] Each episode's plot usually consisted of a very simple idea, such as a bug infestation on board or a Cinderella-style story mixed with all the above segments strung together with very quick jokes, narrative humour and stories told by the Allstars.|$|R
25|$|Cleveland {{began its}} first postseason {{game against the}} Bills with two scoring drives in the first quarter, one ending with a 51-yard {{touchdown}} pass from Graham to Lavelli {{and the other with}} a 31-yard field goal by Groza. The Bills, however, came back in the second quarter with a pair of touchdown throws by quarterback George Ratterman to take a 14–10 lead at halftime. The first score was set up by an interception of a Graham pass by <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston</b> on the last play of the first quarter, while the second one came on a long drive {{at the end of the}} first half that was extended by a roughing the kicker penalty against the Browns. The Browns regained the lead in the third quarter after Lou Saban intercepted Ratterman and returned the ball to the Bills' two-yard line. Edgar Jones ran it in for a touchdown from there. An 80-yard Bills drive gave Buffalo a 21–17 lead toward the end of the third quarter, but Cleveland again went ahead 24–21 on a three-play touchdown drive capped by a 49-pass from Graham to Dub Jones. After missing a field goal in the fourth quarter, Buffalo looked to at least even the score on a drive five minutes left in the game. The Bills were near midfield when Ratterman threw an interception to Warren Lahr that he returned 52 yards for the game-winning touchdown. Graham had 326 passing yards in the game, while Ratterman had 293.|$|E

Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans. Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson remarked: [...] "There is no room in the party of Lincoln for a Klansman like David Duke."

5000|$|Higgs mentored young singers in {{his yard}} and began working with Bob Marley in 1959. In fact, it was {{at one of the}} {{informal}} music lessons Joe Higgs held in Trench Town, that <b>Bob</b> and Bunny <b>Livingston</b> met Peter Tosh. Marley acknowledged later on that Higgs had been an influential figure for him, while Higgs described their time together: [...] "I am the one who taught the Wailers the craft, who taught them certain voice technique". It was Higgs who introduced the Wailers to Dodd in 1963. Higgs has also been described as the [...] "Father of Reggae" [...] by Jimmy Cliff. For a while Higgs toured with Cliff, acting as his bandleader as well as writing songs for Cliff including [...] "Dear Mother", and also performed with The Wailers on their US tour when Bunny Wailer refused to go on the tour in 1973. Higgs wrote [...] "Steppin' Razor" [...] in 1967 as his entry in the Festival Song Contest, later recorded by Tosh without crediting Higgs. Higgs later won a court case to establish his rights as composer but never received any profits from the song's success.|$|R
40|$|Is {{there an}} 'ideal' primary school {{curriculum}}? Who should decide what the curriculum is? Should teachers have autonomy over how they teach? The curriculum {{is the heart}} of what teachers teach and learners learn: Effective teaching is only possible with an effective curriculum. Yet in spite of its importance, there has been a crisis in curriculum that has been caused in large part by governments assuming direct control over the curriculum, assessment, and increasingly, pedagogy. Creating the Curriculum tackles this thorny issue head on, challenging student and practising primary school teachers to think critically about past and present issues and to engage with a new wave of curriculum thinking and development. Considering curriculum construction and its impact on teaching and learning in the four countries of the UK, key issues considered include: • Who should decide the curriculum, its aims and its values • the extent to which issues in primary education swing back and forth • Subjects versus thematic organisation, stages and phases, progression, breadth and balance • prescription versus teacher autonomy • the key features of effective classroom practice • strategies for assessing the whole curriculum • how language in the classroom influences curriculum design • understanding curricula in the context of children's social and personal circumstances • creativity, curriculum and the classroom. Illustrated throughout with strategies and case studies from the classroom, Creating the Curriculum accessibly links the latest research and evidence with concrete examples of good practice. It is a timely exploration of what makes an effective and meanginful curriculum and how teachers can bring new relevance, motivation and powerful values to what they teach. © 2013 Dominic Wyse, Vivienne Marie Baumfield, David Egan, Carmel Gallagher, Louise Hayward, Moira Hulme, Ruth Leitch, <b>Bob</b> Lingard, Kay <b>Livingston</b> and Ian Menter.

2500|$|Newt Gingrich, whose {{approval}} as Speaker, {{both in the}} Congress and in {{the public}} eye, had already greatly suffered due to his polarizing political style and a formal House reprimand and $300,000 fine for political ethics violations, was widely blamed for the political failure of impeachment and the House losses by Republicans in the 1998 midterms and during the 1996 general election as well. Facing the second major attempt in as many years by House Republicans, including DeLay, to oust him as Speaker, Gingrich announced he would resign from Congress. Following Gingrich's announcement, Appropriations Committee chairman <b>Bob</b> <b>Livingston</b> of Louisiana became the presumptive Speaker-elect until December 1998, when, during House debate over its still-ongoing impeachment proceedings, he admitted to extramarital affairs himself and withdrew his name from consideration as Speaker. Armey {{was out of the}} running after fending off a bruising challenge to his majority leader's post from Steve Largent of Oklahoma, and DeLay, as the third-ranking House Republican, appeared to have the inside track to the Speakership. However DeLay decided that he would be [...] "too nuclear" [...] to lead the closely divided House that had resulted from the Republican House losses in 1996 and 1998. So instead DeLay proposed his chief vote-counter, Chief Deputy Whip Dennis Hastert, as a compromise candidate, since Hastert had very good relations {{on both sides of the}} aisle. As Congress reconvened in January 1999, Hastert was elected House Speaker, and DeLay was reelected House Majority Whip.|$|E
