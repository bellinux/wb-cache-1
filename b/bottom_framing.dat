50|$|In March 1941, {{during a}} heavy weather run from Key West to New York by MTBRON 2 (Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 2), Elco 70-footers pounded heavily in 8 to 10 foot waves even at {{moderate}} speeds, and seas continuously broke {{high over the}} bows. Operating personnel reported extreme discomfort and fatigue. All boats suffered from some sort of structural failure (forward chine guards ripped away, <b>bottom</b> <b>framing</b> under bows broken, side planking cracked (indicating lack of longitudinal strength), and other weaknesses). In April 1941, MTBRON 1 reported enthusiasm over the 81-foot Higgins (PT-6) and with the Higgins showing such good seakeeping, that further purchase of Scott-Paine boats was unnecessary. And, in early 1941, BuShips lent Packard engines to both Huckins and Higgins, which wanted to build competitive boats at their own expense.|$|E

2500|$|The {{elevated}} chainstay bicycle {{was popular}} in the early 90s.

This makes them unsuitable for ship-based overseas transportation. Because they are not stackable and are lifted by the bottom corners, they require special handling when transported by rail.

The mechanical performance of <b>bottom,</b> <b>frame</b> and cylinder under {{the effect of the}} four kinds of assembling methods was investigated. Ultimately, the best assembling process was confirmed. Results indicated that the finite element analysis model was reliable and exactly.

The cross-shore tidal component may be generated by tidal straining due to the river plume. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

50|$|The MP412 {{was unique}} in {{that it had a}} break-open frame rather than a swing-out {{cylinder}} design of most modern revolvers and a composite <b>bottom</b> <b>frame</b> consisting of steel with a polymer envelope. The REX never entered full production, possibly due to lack of market interest. This {{may be due to the}} break-action design being seen as not as strong as the more modern swing-out cylinder design which is inherently stronger, having a solid top instead of a top latch. The largest potential market, the United States, was closed to this revolver because it was manufactured in Russia; President Bill Clinton signed an agreement with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s voluntarily banning the import of firearms from Russia to the United States.|$|R
