40|$|The top-performing {{systems for}} billion-scale high-dimensional {{approximate}} nearest neighbor (ANN) search are {{all based on}} two-layer architectures that include an indexing struc-ture and a compressed datapoints layer. An indexing struc-ture is crucial as it allows to avoid exhaustive search, while the lossy data compression is needed to fit the dataset into RAM. Several {{of the most successful}} systems use product quantization (PQ) [4] for both the indexing and the dataset compression layers. These systems are however limited in the way they exploit the interaction of product quantization processes that happen at different stages of these systems. Here we introduce and evaluate two approximate near-est neighbor search systems that both exploit the synergy of product quantization processes in a more efficient way. The first system, called Fast <b>Bilayer</b> <b>Product</b> Quantization (FBPQ), speeds up the runtime of the baseline system (Multi-D-ADC) by several times, while achieving the same accu-racy. The second system, Hierarchical <b>Bilayer</b> <b>Product</b> Quan-tization (HBPQ) provides a significantly better recall for the same runtime at a cost of small memory footprint increase.

40|$|Fatty acid {{intercalated}} layered double hydroxides {{were used}} as additives for Jojoba oil and polymer matrices. The {{first phase of the}} study was to intercalate carboxylic acids (C 14 to C 22). These were successfully intercalated into layered double hydroxides (LDHs), with the formula [Mg 0. 7 Al 0. 3 (OH) 2](CO 3) 0. 15 • 0. 5 H 2 O. The one-pot synthesis consistently yielded a <b>bilayer</b> intercalated <b>product</b> for the range of acids employed. The intercalated anions had an orientation tilt angle of 55 – 63 °, depending on the length of the fatty acid chain. However, there is an indication that the anion exchange process employed in this study is accompanied by probable dissolution and recrystallisation of the LDH. This is supported by the different growth habits and sizes of platelets observed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the organo-LDH platelets were found to have varying MII/MIII compositions, ranging from 1. 65 to 6, indicating that the one-pot synthesis yields an array of mixed metal hydroxides. Polymer composites, containing 5 % and 10 wt. % of stearate intercalated layered double hydroxides (LDH-stearate) and neat layered double hydroxides (LDH-CO 3), were prepared via melt-compounding to explore the use of LDHs as an additive. The stearate modified starting material was bilayer-intercalated clay. During melt compounding, excess stearates were released and the clay reverted to a monolayer-intercalated form. Comprehensive characterisation and study of the fatty acid-intercalated LDH showed that these organoclay hybrids exhibit thermotropic behaviour. This behaviour ultimately leads to the exudation of excess fatty acid. The exuded stearates were found to have lubricating and plasticising effects on the poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) and linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) matrices. Strong hydrogen bond interactions between the chains of poly(ethyleneco- vinyl alcohol) (EVAL) and the clay platelet surfaces overwhelmed the lubrication effect and caused an increase in the melt viscosity of this matrix. The notched Charpy impact strength of this composite was almost double that of the neat polymer. It appears that this can be attributed to the ability of the highly dispersed and randomly oriented nanosized clay platelets to promote extensive internal microcavitation during impact loading. The creation of a large internal surface area provided the requisite energy dissipation mechanism. The study also considered fatty acid-intercalated LDH as an argillaceous mineral for potential use as a rheological additive in Jojoba oil. A minimum of 20 wt. % LDH in Jojoba oil formulation was found to be stable, i. e. it did not form separate layers on standing. The viscosity of the neat Jojoba oil demonstrated Newtonian behaviour, whereas the modified LDH/Jojoba oil formulation shear thinned, which is a typical non-Newtonian behaviour. Viscosity as a function of temperature showed complex rheological behaviour for the long chain fatty acids C 16 to C 22. The viscosity increase is assumed to be due to a combination of three events, which include the formation and changes of LDH microstructures within the oil, the loss of excess fatty acids into the oil matrix, and the formation of fatty acid crystal networks. Shear action also induced some delamination of the clay platelets. Thesis (PhD(Eng)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013. Chemical Engineeringunrestricte...|$|R
40|$|Gramicidin A (gA) {{molecules}} were covalently {{linked with}} a dioxolane ring. Dioxolane-linked gA dimers formed ion channels, selective for monovalent cations, in planar lipid bilayers. The main {{goal of this}} study was to compare the functional single ion channel properties of natural gA and its covalently linked dimer in two different lipid bilayers and HCl concentrations (10 - 8000 mM). Two ion channels with different gating and conductance properties were identified in <b>bilayers</b> from the <b>product</b> of dimerization reaction. The most commonly observed and most stable gramicidin A dimer is the main object of this study. This gramicidin dimer remained in the open state most of the time, with brief closing flickers (tau(closed) approximately 30 micros). The frequency of closing flickers increased with transmembrane potential, making the mean open time moderately voltage dependent (tau(open) changed approximately 1. 43 -fold/ 100 mV). Such gating behavior is markedly different from what is seen in natural gA channels. In PEPC (phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylcholine) bilayers, single-channel current-voltage relationships had an ohmic behavior at low voltages, and a marked sublinearity at relatively higher voltages. This behavior contrasts with what was previously described in GMO (glycerylmonooleate) bilayers. In PEPC bilayers, the linear conductance of single-channel proton currents at different proton concentrations was essentially the same for both natural and gA dimers. g(max) and K(D), obtained from fitting experimental points to a Langmuir adsorption isotherm, were approximately 1500 pS and 300 mM, respectively, for both the natural gA and its dimer. In GMO bilayers, however, proton affinities of gA and the dioxolane-dimer were significantly lower (K(D) of approximately 1 and 1. 5 M, respectively), and the g(max) higher (approximately 1750 and 2150 pS, respectively) than in PEPC bilayers. Furthermore, the relationship between single-channel conductance and proton concentration was linear at low bulk concentrations of H+ (0. 01 - 2 M) and saturated at concentrations of more than 3 M. It is concluded that 1) The mobility of protons in gramicidin A channels in different lipid bilayers is remarkably similar to proton mobilities in aqueous solutions. In particular, at high concentrations of HCl, proton mobilities in gramicidin A channel and in solution differ by only 25 %. 2) Differences between proton conductances in gramicidin A channels in GMO and PEPC cannot be explained by surface charge effects on PEPC membranes. It is proposed that protonated phospholipids adjacent to the mouth of the pore act as an additional source of protons for conduction through gA channels in relation to GMO bilayers. 3) Some experimental results cannot be reconciled with simple alterations in access resistance to proton flow in gA channels. Said differences could be explained if the structure and/or dynamics of water molecules inside gramicidin A channels is modulated by the lipid environment and by modifications in the structure of gA channels. 4) The dioxolane ring is probably responsible for the closing flickers seen in the dimer channel. However, other factors can also influence closing flickers...|$|R
