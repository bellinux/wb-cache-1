25|$|Pelee Island {{is reached}} by ferry from Leamington, Ontario or by plane or ferry in Sandusky, Ohio {{and is the}} largest of the Lake Erie islands. The island has a unique {{ecosystem}} with plants rarely found in Canada such as wild hyacinth, yellow horse gentian, and prickly pear cactus. There are two endangered snakes including the <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> and the Lake Erie water snake. Songbirds migrate there in spring, and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall.|$|E
500|$|Steppe grasslands predominate in {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. Precipitation is {{irregular}} and averages [...] to [...] per year. Hailstorms, blizzards, and thunderstorms rush across the prairie, which has little shelter for plants or animals. Nevertheless, many animals make their home here: among them, grey wolf, coyote, antelope, jackrabbit, kit fox, and bison. The rattlesnake and bull snake live in this prairie, {{as well as the}} <b>blue</b> <b>racer.</b> Many birds have their habitat here: geese, ducks, falcons, hawks, turkey buzzards, owls, sparrows, larks, blackbirds, and more. Evening primroses, prairie lilies, blazing star, aster, goldenrod, sunflower, and wild onions are common plants. So too are wild alfalfa, buffalo bean, and prairie clover legumes. Vegetation is predominantly blue grama, little bluestem, bunchgrass, buffalograss, wheatgrass, and green needleleaf.|$|E
2500|$|Islands tend to {{be located}} in the western side of the lake and total 31 in number (13 in Canada, 18 in the U.S.). The island-village of Put-in-Bay on South Bass Island attracts young crowds who {{sometimes}} wear [...] "red bucket hats" [...] and are prone to [...] "break off cartwheels in the park" [...] and general merriment. Kelleys Island was depicted by the Chicago Tribune as having charms that were [...] "more subtle" [...] than Put-in-Bay, and offers amenities such as beach lounging, hiking, biking and [...] "marveling at deep glacial grooves left in limestone." [...] Pelee Island is the largest of Erie's islands, accessible by ferry from Leamington, Ontario and Sandusky, Ohio. The island has a [...] "fragile and unique ecosystem" [...] with plants rarely found in Canada, such as wild hyacinth, yellow horse gentian (Triosteum angustifolium) and prickly pear cactus, as well as two endangered snakes, the <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> and the Lake Erie water snake. Songbirds migrate to Pelee in spring, and monarch butterflies stop over during the fall.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> {{were the}} second indoor {{football}} team {{to be based}} in Marion, the first being CIFL charter members the Marion Mayhem from 2006 to 2010.

50|$|In May 2013, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> {{announced}} that they were leaving the CIFL again, this time to join the Xtreme Indoor Football League. The league {{was supposed to be}} run by <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> owner LaMonte Coleman. However in August 2013, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> re-signed with the CIFL to a multi-year contract. Coleman has hired Marc Huddleston as the 2014 Head Coach and Director of Football Operations. After a 5-1 start, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> {{announced that}} Coleman would be taking over as the team's head coach. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> recovered from a down season in 2013, by winning the CIFL's new South Division title, clinching them home-field advantage in the South Division playoffs. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> faced off against the Northern Kentucky River Monsters in the South Division title game and won 56-40. With the win over Northern Kentucky, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> clinched their second berth in the CIFL Championship Game. After three quarters of play, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> were tied at 26 with the Erie Explosion in the 2014 CIFL Championship Game when Aaron Smentanka found Evan Twombly for a score. After Marion turned over the ball on downs, Richard Stokes scored again for the Explosion, {{which turned out to be}} the final score of the game, making the score 38-26.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>racers</b> {{are active}} foragers.The younger snakes may consume crickets and other insects, whereas adults feed {{primarily}} on rodents, songbirds, and snakes. Adults engage in both terrestrial and arboreal foraging. <b>Blue</b> <b>racers</b> are diurnally active. Probable natural predators of adult <b>blue</b> <b>racers</b> include the larger {{birds of prey}} (e.g., red-tailed hawk, northern harrier, great horned owl) and carnivorous mammals such as raccoons, foxes, and coyotes. Dogs and feral house cats are known to kill and/or harass juvenile <b>blue</b> <b>racers.</b> The eggs and young are likely vulnerable to {{a wider variety of}} avian and mammalian predators.|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "hoop snake" [...] {{was quite}} as {{authentic}} {{to us as}} the <b>blue</b> <b>racer,</b> although no one had actually seen one. Den Green's cousin's uncle had killed one in Michigan, and a man over the ridge had once been stung by one that came rolling down the hill with his tail in his mouth. But Den's cousin's uncle, {{when he saw the}} one coming toward him, had stepped aside quick as lightning, and the serpent's sharp fangs had buried themselves so deep in the bark of a tree, that he could not escape.|$|E

To hasten conviction of her charm, but glance at the stacks of handbills in the corner, green, and yellow, and white. Upon them you see an incompetent presentment of the senorita in her professional garb and pose. Irresistible, in black lace and yellow ribbons, she faces you; a <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> is spiralled upon each bare arm; coiled twice about her waist and once about her neck, his horrid head close to hers, you perceive Kuku, the great eleven-foot Asian python.|$|E

5000|$|The Marion <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> were a {{professional}} indoor football team based in Marion, Ohio. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> began play as an expansion {{team in the}} Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL) in 2011, {{before moving to the}} United Indoor Football League (UIFL) for the 2012 season. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> returned to the CIFL in 2013. The team had announced that it would be joining the Xtreme Indoor Football League (XIFL) for the 2014, but later re-signed with the CIFL. During the 2015 season, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> played as members of X-League Indoor Football.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>racers</b> {{seem to be}} {{relatively}} intolerant of high levels of human activity {{and for most of}} the active season they remain in areas of low human density.Evidence to suggest this comes largely from radio telemetry data from both <b>blue</b> <b>racers</b> and eastern fox snakes that inhabited the same general areas on Pelee Island(although studies were not conducted concurrently). In contrast to <b>blue</b> <b>racers,</b> fox snakes were often found under front porches, in barns/garages, and in the foundations of houses; whereas, most (but not all) <b>blue</b> <b>racers</b> were observed in more [...] "natural" [...] settings. Therefore, <b>blue</b> <b>racers</b> are more confined to areas with minimal anthropogenic activity. Campbell and Perrin also noted that racers were among the first snakes to disappear from suburban areas.|$|R
50|$|In June, 2013, Wallace {{was named}} the first {{head coach of the}} {{expansion}} Columbus Beast of the Xtreme Indoor Football League, but when the Beast owner moved his other franchise (the Marion <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers)</b> to the Continental Indoor Football League, it was announced that Wallace was to be the Head Coach for the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers.</b> However, Wallace left the <b>Blue</b> <b>Racers</b> to pursue his teaching career.|$|R
50|$|In the United States: Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, South Dakota and Iowa are now {{the only}} states with extant populations of <b>blue</b> <b>racer.</b> Western South Dakota has a {{thriving}} population of Blue Racers though.

5000|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> {{has been}} on Ontario's Endangered Species List since 1971. Consequently, habitat {{determined}} to be critical to the snake's persistence is protected (from destruction or significant alteration) under Ontario's Endangered Species Act (ESA). In 1998, <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> [...] "habitat" [...] on Pelee Island was spatially delineated (primarily utilizing mark-recapture and radio telemetry data collected from 1990-1998), and formally identified for the Conservation Land Tax Incentive Program, Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR). Subsequent to the spatial delineation (or mapping) of this habitat, the OMNR determined that these lands should be protected from destruction or human interference as is required under the ESA. The habitat protection afforded by the ESA has significant land use implications, particularly because a substantial percentage of <b>blue</b> <b>racer</b> habitat identified occurs on private lands. Unfortunately, implementing a program to effectively protect endangered species habitat on private lands has been extremely difficult. Several areas known to harbour blue racers and the important microhabitats used by them (e.g., hibernacula) are formally protected on Pelee Island. Lighthouse Point Provincial Nature Reserve and the Stone Road Alvar Complex (owned and managed by the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, Essex Region Conservation Authority, and Nature Conservancy Canada) {{are the two most}} important protected areas for the <b>blue</b> <b>racer.</b>|$|E
