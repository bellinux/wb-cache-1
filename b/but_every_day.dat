Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

The film {{was met with}} reasonable reviews, and was a box office success, earning $256million worldwide. His performance was well received by critics; Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleiberman wrote that Eckhart [...] "may be playing {{a bit of an}} ideal [...] but he makes goodness as palpable as he did yuppie evil in 'In the Company of Men'." [...] In an August 2004 interview, Eckhart claimed that he had not worked for nearly a year before he was cast in the movie. [...] "I felt like I sort of was getting away from what I wanted to do as an actor. [...] I had nine months off, but it wasn't a vacation. Sure, I didn't earn any money for nine months, <b>but</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> I was reading scripts, I was producing my own material, I was taking meetings, I was working on my craft." ...|$|E

Leave Lahore alone, and let Sirhind be a boundary between you and me." [...] Sher Shah, however, replied [...] "I have left you Kabul. You should go there." [...] Kabul was {{the capital of the}} empire of Humayun's brother Kamran, who was far from willing to hand over any of his territories to his brother. Instead, Kamran approached Sher Shah and proposed that he actually revolt against his brother and side with Sher Shah in return for most of the Punjab. Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal, and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him. Humayun refused, citing the last words of his father, Babur, [...] "Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effectiveness of an interactive smoking cessation program when first implemented in a naïve population of Romanian adolescents. The secondary objective was to assess youngsters’ attitudes and beliefs towards tobacco dependence, their compliance to smoking cessation interventions and success rate of a standard smoking cessation pilot program. Materials and methods: A total of 231 subjects 14 - 19 years old participated in the Adolescent Smoking Cessation (ASC) pilot program in Romania in 2005. Subjects were evaluated based on the ASC questionnaire, a validated set of questions about smoking and cessation profile, whether current smoker or not. Smoking status was validated by carbon monoxide determination in exhaled air. Participants were delivered 6 interactive ASC sessions about smoking hazards and methods to quit smoking. A final evaluation was done to assess overall program’s impact and to reward quitters and reducers by prizes. Results: Study population was made of 52. 4 % <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers, 10. 4 % at least once/week <b>but</b> not <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers, 6 % less than once/week smokers, 23. 4 % never smokers and 7. 8 % ex-smokers. Cessation rate was 12. 3 % in <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers and 16. 6 % in at least once a week <b>but</b> not <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers. Also, 4. 1 % <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers and 30 % at least once/week not <b>every</b> <b>day</b> smokers reduced number of cigarettes smoked/day. The program registered a high attendance rate/sessions as 85. 2 % of subjects were present in all sessions. Also, significant changes occurred in participant’s beliefs about smoking and cessation. Conclusions: Pilot ASC was an efficient program with 12. 3 % of daily smokers to quit smoking and its positive impact on personal smoking and cessation beliefs in 90 % of participants.
