ABC Sports began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.|$|E

As the decade wore on, {{the quality of the}} soundtrack songs grew [...] "progressively worse". Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that he hated many of the songs chosen for his films.

The game was also criticized for its lack of variety in enemies, its continued use of puzzles that require players to move boxes, and its relatively short story. God of War III also received some criticism. GameFront's Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel antagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. IGN complained about the game's weapons, and said [...] "that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades.

2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have to start doing that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. <b>But</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> <b>large</b> I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E

40|$|Asset allocation, the {{decision}} of {{how much of a}} portfolio to allocate to different types of securities, is one of the fundamental issues in financial economics. The paper examines the portfolios created out of lump-sum pensionary benefits received by 495 government pensioners who retired between 1967 and 2002. The paper uses the available data for the household investment in financial assets between 1970 and 2002, and compares it with the investment in financial assets of the pensioners. It is found that pensioners in the sample remain under-diversified. They were found to have taken an alarming magnitude of idiosyncratic risk. Despite being seemingly aware of the benefits of diversification, pensioners appear to adopt a “naive” strategy for diversifying their portfolios without giving proper consideration to the correlations among the assets that they invest into. Over the years, the average number of assets in pensioner portfolio has increased resulting in a decrease in the average portfolio variance. This may be ascribed to facts that reforms in Indian market opened floodgates for investment avenues and that these improvements resulted primarily from changes in the correlation structure of the Indian household investment market. Least diversified portfolios were found amongst pensioners who had lesser funds at their disposal and retirees of lower class (junior) categories. An analysis of a cross-sectional variations in diversification across demographic groups also suggest that younger, active and recent retirees are over-focused thereby holding under-diversified portfolios, not <b>by</b> chance <b>but</b> <b>by</b> choice. <b>By</b> <b>and</b> <b>large,</b> results indicate that pensioners face an intimidating task of constructing and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio despite realizing the benefits of it...|$|R

40|$|Background: Methylphenidate (MPH) is an efficacious and {{normally}} well-tolerated treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although treatment effects are usually assessed using parent-rating scales, {{these can be}} supplemented by more objective methods. Here we examine the associations between ratings and one such method, assessments made across {{the day in the}} laboratory classroom. Method: Comparison of Methylphenidates in the Analog Classroom Setting (COMACS) was made in a large (n = 184) placebo-controlled trial comparing Equasym XL (R) /MetadateCD (R), Concerta (R), and placebo (PLA) using a Laboratory School protocol. Therapeutic effects were measured using direct observation, scores on a simple math productivity task and parent ratings. Results: Treatment effects were observed on all measures. Laboratory measures were correlated with each other, most strongly between Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn and Pelham Scale (SKAMP) inattention and Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP).
