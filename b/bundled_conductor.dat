40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} an alternative procedure {{to obtain an}} equivalent conductor from a <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor,</b> {{taking into account the}} distribution of the current in subcondutors of the bundle. Firstly, it is introduced a brief background about the concept of Geometric Mean Radius (GMR) and how this methodology is applied to define an equivalent conductor and its electric parameters. Emphasizing that the classical procedure, using GMR, is limited to premise which the current is equally distributed through subconductors. Afterwards, it is described the development of proposed method and applications for an equivalent conductor obtained from a conventional transmission line <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> and from an equivalent conductor based on a bundle with compressed SF 6 insulation system, where the current is unequally distributed through subconductors...|$|E
40|$|A {{finite element}} method is {{proposed}} for {{an investigation of the}} bipolar <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> ionized field. A computation program for the corona ionized field analysis was developed in which Deutsch's assumption was waived. The subconductors were considered as separate parts where the mutual impact was included. Each electric field line was initiated from the subconductor surface. The electric field was calculated by adopting the third order interpolating method. Furthermore, a method of estimating the initial space charge density of fluxtubes was introduced and then calculated by using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Finally, the computation program was verified and the corona current and related field properties of a Ḱ 0 kV HVDC transmission line were investigated. Full Tex...|$|E

50|$|Aerial bundled cables (also aerial <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> {{or simply}} ABC) are {{overhead}} power lines using several insulated phase <b>conductors</b> <b>bundled</b> tightly together, usually with a bare neutral conductor. This contrasts with the traditional practice of using uninsulated conductors separated by air gaps. This variation of {{overhead power lines}} utilizes the same principles as <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors,</b> except that they are closer together {{to the point of}} touching but each conductor is surrounded by an insulating layer (except for the neutral line).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} an optimization {{calculation procedure}} used, for <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> configuration of compact transmission lines, to improve certain operating performance and electromagnetic fields (EMF) management techniques. The objective function of this optimization {{problem is to}} allow the charges and surface maximum gradients on all subconductors {{to be the same}} and as balanced as possible. As a result, three optimum schemes are induced in this paper for 220 kV transmission lines. Parameters of compact lines and their unbalance, surge impedance, electric field distribution under the line, corona loss and radio noise level are also evaluated. EMF field management and field minimization over the right-of-way (ROW) of the optimum schemes are also presented. EMF fields are analyzed, evaluated and compared to attainable fields of standard compact and conventional lines...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} high temperature superconducting (HTS) transmission cables, it was found that mechanical strength of the superconducting tape is the most crucial property that needs to be improved. It is also desirable to increase the current carrying capacity of the conductor so that fewer layers are needed to make the kilo-amp class cables required for electric utility usage. A process has been developed by encapsulating a stack of Bi- 2223 /Ag tapes with a silver or non-silver sheath to form a strengthened bundle superconductor. This process was applied to HTS tapes made by the Continuous Tube Forming and Filling (CTFF) technique pursued by Plastronic Inc. and HTS tapes obtained from other manufacturers. Conductors with a bundle of 2 to 6 HTS tapes have been made. The <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> is greatly strengthened by the non-silver sheath. No superconductor degradation as compared to the sum of the original critical currents of the individual tapes was seen on the finished conductors...|$|E
40|$|Wind excited {{vibrations}} {{generated by}} the vortex shedding are very common in high-voltage overhead transmission lines. Although such vibrations are barely perceptible due to their low amplitudes (less than a conductor diameter), controlling them, however, is extremely important since they may lead to conductor fatigue. Mathematical models are therefore necessary for the computation of these vibrations, not only to evaluate the risk of potential damage to the transmission line but also for studying {{the efficiency of the}} damping measures. For single conductor transmission lines, the so-called energy-balance method gives fairly good results for the estimation of vibration amplitudes. However, the problem becomes more involved for the conductor bundles attached with different damping devices. A modified form of the energy-balance method is thus needed. This thesis presents a mathematical-mechanical model for modeling the vibrations of the conductor bundles with many spacer dampers and Stockbridge dampers, by considering subconductors as continuous systems. External damping devices are incorporated into the model by means of their complex impedance matrices. The presented model results in a smaller system matrix in comparison to what is obtained while modeling the conductor as a discrete system. This modeling procedure yields a complex non-polynomial transcendental eigen- value problem (TEVP). Solving such a TEVP is simple for smaller systems, e. g., for single conductor transmission lines. However, for a comparatively bigger system like the one in case of conductor bundles, it is a formidable task to obtain all the system eigenvalues in a certain frequency domain. The first goal of the presented thesis is to find e±cient numerical methods for obtaining the solutions of TEVPs. Different numerical techniques are discussed and their results are compared. Newton's approach for the solution of the eigenvalue problem is found to be an e±cient solution technique for obtaining the complex eigenvalues of a TEVP of the current type. After obtaining the complex eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the system, an energy balance principle is presented in order to obtain the actual vibration amplitudes in the subconductors. In energy balance the energy input from the wind is equated with the energy loss due to external damping and the conductor's self damping. Wind power input is normally obtained using data from the wind tunnel experiments or from the experiments carried out with transmission lines in the field, for laminar and turbulent wind speeds. Wind power input data is only available for single oscillating rods/cylinders, as obtaining such data via experiments for different configurations of multi-cylinders, is a difficult task. The second goal of the presented work is to numerically obtain the wind power input for the oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A finite-volume approach is used for the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. Moving grids are used to incorporate the movements of the cylinders. Firstly, accuracy and feasibility of the numerical results are verified by solving the flow around a single cylinder, and comparing the obtained results with the available experimental data. For similar setups as used in the experiments from different researchers, numerical wind power input for a single oscillating cylinder is obtained. Good agreement with the experimental results is found. The numerical approach is subsequently further extended to obtain the wind power input for two oscillating cylinders in a tandem arrangement. A considerable difference between the wind power inputs for the downstream cylinder in a cylinder-tandem and for a single oscillating cylinder is observed. The newly obtained wind power input is utilized for the energy balancing in a <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> benchmark problem, and results are discussed...|$|E
40|$|According to the {{galloping}} {{mechanism of}} iced conductors, the aerodynamic simulations were performed based on actual wind tunnel tests. Aeroelastic models of single and <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> with a typical ice-coating section forms (crescent section) were set up. The simulation results were in good agreements with wind tunnel tests, {{and it showed}} that numerical simulation method can be used instead of wind tunnel tests. The wind attack angles have seriously affected the aerodynamic force of the iced conductor. The wake of vortex shedding for the iced single conductor was analyzed. As for the iced <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors,</b> sub-conductors at the downstream were seriously influenced by the ones at the upstream locations and the aerodynamic force of the sub-conductors at the downstream was lower than of those at the upstream. The negative slope of Nigol coefficient to the <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> was larger {{than that of the}} single wire, but the absolute value of the amplitude was less than that of the single <b>conductor,</b> and the <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> were more likely to gallop than the single ones.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, this {{transmission}} capacity {{was no longer}} sufficient. It could not be increased by using <b>bundle</b> <b>conductors</b> or more conductive cables, as <b>bundle</b> <b>conductors</b> tend to have much greater wind-induced oscillations than single conductors, which can result in short circuits in such a long span. Normal overhead lines use conducting cables with a larger aluminium portion but these {{do not have the}} tensile strength needed for this span.

40|$|As {{residential}} customers {{become more}} energy conscious and environmentally aware, {{the installation of}} grid connected photovoltaic solar panels for small-scale electricity generation is expected to increase. However, the issue of quality of the electrical supply is as equally important as adopting sustainable energy. This thesis proposes a method to determine the quality of electrical supply based on the acceptable level of harmonic current that can be injected from a typical grid connected residential type photovoltaic inverter system (PVIS). The acceptable number of PVISs is based on not exceeding the recommended harmonic voltage levels in medium voltage (MV- 11 kV) and low voltage (LV- 415 V) distribution systems given in standard AS/NZS 61000. 3. 6 - 2001 and its application guide HB 264 - 2003. To undertake this study, an acceptable frequency domain model of a typical power system is developed, an appropriate model of a typical inverter spectrum is proposed and a method for allocating harmonic voltage distortion levels for PVIS in MV and LV systems by incorporating background distortion is suggested. The harmonic voltage distortion levels caused by the residential type PVIS are calculated based on conventional methods such as nodal analysis applied over the distribution network. A typical residential power system is adapted from the available literature. The LV distributors of the power system were modelled based on residential load and PVIS aggregation, and MV feeders are modelled based on distribution transformer aggregation. The distributors selected for LV systems study are based on overhead open-wire conductor, aerial <b>bundled</b> <b>conductor</b> and underground cabling types and the MV system feeders are based on an open-wire overhead conductor system. Residential load for harmonic studies is modelled based on the duration of equipment usage (with typical household ratings) during the power generation (active time) of the PVIS. Active time of the PVIS is estimated from field measurement data. Since the LV system is of multiple earth neutral (MEN) construction, an additional system study is required to investigate the effective neutral harmonic impedance. This study revealed {{the significance of the}} zero sequence impedance of the system to show the importance of representing the neutral current within the study. Consequently, the acceptable number of PVIS units is limited by triplen harmonic voltage magnitudes suggested by recommended harmonic voltage levels. Studying the available literature revealed that the development of a harmonic current spectrum to represent a typical photovoltaic inverter 2 ̆ 7 s line current is required. Hence, an adequate harmonic current spectrum was developed being selected from three distinct methods. The PVIS spectrums were modelled up to 40 th harmonic, and an appropriate model was selected from among the three proposed models based on their compliance to recommended harmonic current emission levels, both individual and total, as suggested by standards. Examining the harmonic range up to 40 th revealed that recent LV distribution network harmonic studies associated with PVIS are not wide enough in harmonic range to show some important network wide harmonic issues. Allocation of harmonic voltage distortion levels for the LV PVIS was based on the background distortion level and recommended harmonic voltage planning levels and the suggestion in standards to incorporate sufficient diversity for the MV and LV distribution systems contribution. Background harmonic voltage distortion levels were calculated based on published data related to field measurements from dedicated residential feeders in distribution systems. This study has proposed and identified a method to assess the harmonic distortion levels in MV and LV distribution systems, and related key issues, to assist the harmonic management of these systems due to grid connected PVIS...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} short-circuit oscillations {{in power}} lines. Short-circuit currents generate electromagnetic {{forces on the}} conductors, exciting short-circuit oscillations. Since the short-circuit periods are very short, the short-circuit forces in single conductor overhead lines are usually low {{because of the large}} phase spacing. However these forces may have considerable impact on distribution lines due to the change in phase spacing during short-circuit occurrences. For <b>bundle</b> <b>conductor</b> lines, the short-circuit forces between subconductors are significantly higher due to the small distance between them.

40|$|Under {{the certain}} rain-wind conditions, <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> exhibit a rain-wind induced large-amplitude {{vibration}}. This type of vibration {{can cause the}} fatigue fractures of conductors and fatigue failures of spacers, which threaten the safety operation and serviceability of high-voltage transmission line. To reveal the mechanism of rain-wind induced vibration of <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors,</b> a series of 2 -dimensional CFD models about the twin <b>bundled</b> <b>conductors</b> with rivulets are developed to obtain the curves of aerodynamic coefficients with the upper rivulet angle. The influences of the forward conductor’s aerodynamic shielding and the upper rivulet’s aerodynamic characteristics on the leeward conductor are discussed. Furthermore, a 2 -dimensional 3 DOF model for the rain-wind induced vibration of the leeward conductor is established. The model is solved by finite element method and Newmark method, {{and the effects of}} the wind velocity and the upper rivulet’s motion on vibration amplitude of the leeward conductor are analyzed. By contrast with the wake-induced vibration, it can easily find that the characteristics of rain-wind vibration are obviously {{different from those of the}} wake-induced vibration, and the main reason of the rain-induced vibration may be due to the upper rivulet’s motion...|$|R

The field surrounding a <b>bundle</b> of <b>conductors</b> is similar to the field that would surround a single, very large conductor—this produces lower gradients which mitigates issues associated with high field strength.

50|$|High-voltage {{overhead}} conductors are {{not covered}} by insulation. The conductor material is nearly always an aluminum alloy, made into several strands and possibly reinforced with steel strands. Copper was sometimes used for overhead transmission, but aluminum is lighter, yields only marginally reduced performance and costs much less. Overhead conductors are a commodity supplied by several companies worldwide. Improved conductor material and shapes are regularly used to allow increased capacity and modernize transmission circuits. Conductor sizes range from 12 mm2 (#6 American wire gauge) to 750 mm2 (1,590,000 circular mils area), with varying resistance and current-carrying capacity. Thicker wires would lead to a relatively small increase in capacity due to the skin effect (which causes most of the current to flow close {{to the surface of the}} wire). Because of this current limitation, multiple parallel cables (called <b>bundle</b> <b>conductors)</b> are used when higher capacity is needed. <b>Bundle</b> <b>conductors</b> are also used at high voltages to reduce energy loss caused by corona discharge.|$|R
