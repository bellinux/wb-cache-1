5|$|The {{policy of}} attacking London after the {{successful}} 7 September raid quickly became counter-productive, {{and in this}} matter the Luftwaffe suffered from serious misjudgement resulting from their intelligence service. The crews had been told the RAF was down to its last reserves and that one more assault would clinch victory. This was incorrect which meant bomber crews would <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a shock on 15 September. The RAF had been given much needed rest after intense operations by the shift in German strategy. British radar, having been virtually untouched, {{was still able to}} follow the slow German build ups over France long before the first German aircraft reached British airspace. It would give the rested Fighter Command units plenty of warning. Moreover, by choosing to attack London, it exposed the bombers to greater danger by forcing them to fly greater distances in hostile air space. German crews would be forced to fight all the way to London and back. As it happened, all the German bomber units were at least intercepted on 15 September, and were then scattered as they withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The Duke of Norfolk {{left the}} touring party after the First Test {{in order to}} prepare Sir Winston Churchill's funeral (the statesman was 87 and was given a state funeral {{when he died in}} 1965). Billy Griffith, the Secretary of the MCC {{replaced}} him as manager until he returned {{at the end of the}} year. The team travelled to Townsville, the furthest north that a MCC team had ever played a game in Australia. The wicket-keeper-captain Colin Hossack won the toss and batted, but the Queensland Country XI were all out for 165 Wilfred Brown (24) and Malcolm Campbell (40) adding 65 for the first wicket, but then they lost 7 wickets for 19 runs until John Page (31) and Hossack (25) added 39 for the eighth-wicket. David Larter took 3/39 and Ray Illingworth 3/46. By the end of the first day the MCC were 258/3 with Peter Parfitt hitting 98 in 72 minutes, winning prizes for the fastest 50 in the match and the first six to be hit. Ted Dexter, the main draw in the side, played carefully so as to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>for</b> the Saturday, but was caught on the fence for 2. Tom Graveney made 118, David Sheppard 67, Ray Illingworth 58 and Dexter declared on 423/9 the next day. David Allen (5/57) bowled out the locals for 138 for an innings win, even though Brown made 47, having batted for 7 hours in three innings against the MCC and being hit for 21 runs off an over by the Darling Downs batsman Don Bickel, who was awarded a trophy for his 44 in 38 minutes.|$|E

On 26 June, NSB stated that [...] in April they had discovered that not checking the whole axle was a weakness in the maintenance procedures, but that despite this, no new examinations had been done.

Being a witch is about ripping away layers of social conditioning, gender limitations and protective shields. It is, in a sense about moving towards being the complete and total woman. There is intensity, conviction and passion in the way Ipsita talks about witchcraft, or Wicca—the Craft of the Wise—and its relevance throughout history." [...] Chakraverti also observes that [...] "If I had come from a different rung of society, or was illiterate, the reaction wouldn't be the same. I have observed that it is always the person they will accept, and then the word Wicca. Witches are not born, they are made. Or perhaps they sculpt themselves."
