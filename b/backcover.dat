Drake Bell wrote all of the songs on the album, however, all the songs were, as with Telegraph, co-written along with either Michael Corcoran and/or C.J. Abraham. The album was produced by Backhouse Mike (Michael Corcoran) and co-produced by Drake and C.J. Abraham, and was mixed by Rob Jacobs and C.J. Abraham.

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} 4 -Couv, a treebanking project {{aiming at}} develop a large multipurpose treebank for French language. The main characteristic {{of this project}} is to provide adequate material for both linguistic and psycholinguistic research. The treebank is made of short and self-contained texts selected from a corpus of <b>backcovers</b> coming from different editors and different genres. Such material makes possible classical linguistic research (especially in syntax and discourse), but offers also new perspectives in experimental linguistics: being short texts and semantically coherent, they perfectly fit {{with the requirements of}} eye-tracking or electro-encephalographic recordings. At this stage, 4 -Couv contains 3, 500 trees automatically tagged and parsed, and manually corrected. Its format is compatible with other standard French treebanks. We present in this paper, the treebank, its annotation and the different treebanking tools that have been developed for the different stages of its elaboration: text selection, tagging, parsing and manual correction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} {{of the type of}} text used as primary data in treebanks is of certain importance. First, it has an influence at the discourse level: an article is not organized {{in the same way as}} a novel or a technical document. Moreover, it also has consequences in terms of semantic interpretation: some types of texts can be easier to interpret than others. We present in this paper a new type of treebank which presents the particularity to answer to specific needs of experimental linguistic. It is made of short texts (book <b>backcovers)</b> that presents a strong coherence in their organization and can be rapidly interpreted. This type of text is adapted to short reading sessions, making it easy to acquire physiological data (e. g. eye movement, electroencepholagraphy). Such a resource offers reliable data when looking for correlations between computational models and human language processing...|$|R

50|$|Viereck's {{memoir of}} life in prison, Men Into Beasts, was {{published}} as a paperback original by Fawcett Publications in 1952. The book is a general memoir of discomfort, loss of dignity, and brutality in prison life. The front matter and <b>backcover</b> text focuses on the situational homosexuality and male rape described in the book (witnessed, not experienced, by Viereck). The book, while a memoir, is thus the first original title of 1950s gay pulp fiction, an emerging genre in that decade.|$|E

Above this depiction they are only identified as [...] "Staff A" [...] through [...] "Staff E" [...] (with the felt puppet Kere Ellis being [...] "Staff E'") and a description of their skill underneath. In the Japanese edition, the volumes come with a dust jacket using a paper stock similar to brown wrapping paper. Dark Horse attempted to emulate this cover style by using a similar stock for the cover of the English edition. However, starting with volume 12 Dark Horse switched to a glossier paper stock for cost cutting reasons.|$|E
5000|$|On September 18, 1970, Turner's {{relationship}} with Hendrix {{came to an}} unexpected close when Hendrix died from drug-related complications {{at the age of}} 27. Soon after, Turner sought to establish his own music career by forming his own band, The Velvert Turner Group. The band was composed of Turner on lead guitar and as lead vocalist, Prescott Niles on bass guitar, Christopher Robinson on keyboards, and Tim McGovern on drums. Turner even resembled Hendrix, sporting an afro and wearing colorful clothing in concerts. Performance-wise, Turner was also known to play behind his back or with his teeth. In 1972, Tom Wilson pursued the opportunity to record the band for their debut album on the Phillips label. The group's debut album, Velvert Turner Group, reflects the guitar playing of Hendrix's later work, and Turner even produced vocals similar to Hendrix. All but one of the tracks were original material, and the final track was a cover version of the Hendrix song, [...] "Freedom". Even the <b>backcover</b> of the album features a fish-eye view image, reminiscent of The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced?. Velvert Turner Group failed to impact the national charts, and the band broke up soon after. Turner's former bandmates reappeared in groups including The Knack, The Motels, and The New York Dolls.|$|E
50|$|In 1964 Editor Tchou reprinted Les Rêves Et Les Moyens de Les Diriger, but the 1867-Appendix, {{entitled}} 'Un rêve apres avoir pris du hatchich' (Transl.: A dream after I took hashish) had, {{due to its}} contents, {{been left}} out, without indication. In 1982 an abbreviated English edition appeared, {{which was based on}} the Tchou-edition, and consequently it did not contain the Appendix either, nor did it refer to it. The Den Blanken & Meijer-article revealed this fact, and the authors presented for the first time an English translation of this Appendix. Others were stimulated by above,and in 1992 the French Dream Society 'Oniros' held in Paris a commemoration on Saint-Denys. Leading dream specialists Carolus den Blanken, Celia Green, Paul Tholey (1937-1998) and Oniros president-elect Roger Ripert paid their respect. In 1995 society Oniros published an integral French version of Denys' book on dreams, and Italian, Dutch and Japanese translations appeared. Recently several French editions of Les Rêves has been published. It is not always evident if these (E)books areintegral versions or based on the 1964-Tchou edition. In 2016 an integral English version (inclusive the original frontpage, <b>backcover</b> and frontispice) appeared as a free of charge E-book with the title:'Dreams and the Ways to Direct Them: Practical Observations', edited by Drs. Carolus den Blanken & Drs. Eli Meijer.
