40|$|Identifying the {{reproductive}} consequences of insect migration {{is critical to}} understanding its ecological and evolutionary significance. However, many empirical studies are seemingly contradictory, making recognition of unifying themes elusive and controversial. The <b>beet</b> <b>webworm,</b> Loxostege sticticalis L. is a long-range migratory pest of many crops in the northern temperate zone from 36 °N to 55 °N, with larval populations often exploding in regions receiving immigrants. In laboratory experiments, we examined (i) {{the reproductive}} costs of migratory flight by tethered flight, and (ii) the reproductive traits contributing to larval outbreaks of immigrant populations. Our {{results suggest that the}} <b>beet</b> <b>webworm</b> does not initiate migratory flight until the 2 nd or 3 rd night after emergence. Preoviposition period, lifetime fecundity, mating capacity, and egg hatch rate for adults that experienced prolonged flight after the 2 nd night did not differ significantly from unflown moths, suggesting these traits are irrelevant to the severity of <b>beet</b> <b>webworm</b> outbreaks after migration. However, the period of first oviposition, a novel parameter developed in this paper measuring synchrony of first egg-laying by cohorts of post-migratory females, for moths flown on d 3 and 5 of adulthood was shorter than that of unflown moths, indicating a tightened time-window for onset of oviposition after migration. The resulting synchrony of egg-laying will serve to increase egg and subsequent larval densities. A dense population offers potential selective advantages to the individual larvae comprising it, whereas the effect from the human standpoint is intensification of damage by an outbreak population. The strategy of synchronized oviposition may be common in other migratory insect pests, such as locust and armyworm species, and warrants further study...|$|E
40|$|Transmission of parasites and {{pathogens}} {{is generally}} positively density-dependent: as an insect population 2 ̆ 7 s density increases, {{the risk of}} an individual becoming attacked or infected also increases. In some insect species, individuals experiencing crowded conditions are more resistant to natural enemies than those experiencing low density conditions, and they are predicted to divert resources to increase resistance. This phenomenon is called density-dependent prophylaxis. Here, possible expression of prophylaxis in fifth-instar larvae of <b>Beet</b> <b>Webworm,</b> Loxostege sticticalis, to biocontrol agents was investigated under rearing densities of 1, 10, and 30 larvae per jar (650 mL). Larvae reared at the moderate density and those reared in isolation displayed the greatest and lowest resistance, respectively, to an entomopathogenic fungus and a parasitoid. Moreover, larvae from the moderate density treatment exhibited elevated phenoloxidase, total haemocyte count and antibacterial activity in the haemolymph, whereas phenoloxidase levels in the midgut were not affected. The results suggest that larval rearing density significantly affects the immune system, and they provide evidence for density-dependent prophylaxis of larval L. sticticalis against its biocontrol agents. These results have implications for understanding the population dynamics and biocontrol of <b>beet</b> <b>webworm...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flight and {{reproduction}} are usually considered as two life history traits that compete for resources in a migratory insect. The <b>beet</b> <b>webworm,</b> Loxostege sticticalis L., manages {{the costs of}} migratory flight {{and reproduction}} through a trade-off in timing of these two life history traits, where migratory behavior occurs during the preoviposition period. To gain insight into how migratory flight and reproduction are coordinated in the female <b>beet</b> <b>webworm,</b> we conducted experiments beginning {{at the end of}} the preoviposition period. We used flight mills to test whether flight performance and supportive flight musculature and fuel are affected by the number of eggs oviposited, or by the age of mated and unmated females after onset of oviposition by the former. The results showed that flight distance, flight velocity, flight duration, and flight muscle mass decreased abruptly at the onset of oviposition, compared to that of virgin females of the same age which did not change over the next 7 d. These results indicate that onset of oviposition triggers a decrease in flight performance and capacity in female beet webworms, as a way of actively managing reallocation of resources away from migratory flight and into egg production. In addition to the abrupt switch, there was a gradual, linear decline in flight performance, flight muscle mass, and flight fuel relative to the number of eggs oviposited. The histolysis of flight muscle and decrease of triglyceride content indicate a progressive degradation in the ability of adults to perform additional migratory flights after onset of oviposition. Although the results show that substantial, albeit reduced, long-duration flights remain possible after oviposition begins, additional long-distance migratory flights probably are not launched after the initiation of oviposition...|$|E
40|$|Traps baited with floral {{chemicals}} on {{the island}} of Hawaii captured several pest moth species. Chrysodeixis eriosoma (Doubleday) (green garden looper), Au- tographa biloba (Doubleday) (bi-lobed looper), and Mythimna unipuncta (Haworth) (true armyworm), all Noctuidae, as well as Hymenia recurvalis (L.) (<b>beet</b> <b>webworm),</b> a Crambidae, were trapped with phenylacetaldehyde (PAA). There was no response by moths to β-myrcene (BM), methyl salicylate (MS), cis-jasmone (CJ), methyl- 2 -methoxy benzoate (MMB), 2 -phenylethanol (2 PE), or linalool (LIN) when these chemicals were tested singly. When other floral chemicals were presented in traps with PAA, numbers of C. eriosoma captured were increased by BM, MS, 2 PE or MMB. Numbers of A. biloba and Peridroma saucia (Hübner) (variegated cutworm) were increased by including BM with PAA in traps. Numbers of M. unipuncta were increased by BM or 2 PE, and numbers of H. recurvalis were increased by MMB or LIN, presented with PAA. Both sexes of these five species of moths were trapped with floral females captured were mated, and many females possessed mature eggs...|$|E
40|$|The <b>beet</b> <b>webworm,</b> Loxostege sticticalis (L.) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), uses both {{diapause}} {{and migration}} as life history strategies. To determine {{the role of}} diapause plays in the population dynamics of L. sticticalis, the reproductive and flight potentials of adults originating from diapause and nondiapause larvae were investigated under controlled laboratory conditions. Preoviposition period, lifetime fecundity, and daily egg production of females originating from diapause larvae {{were not significantly different}} from those originating from nondiapause larvae, showing that diapause has no significant effect on reproductive capacity when adults are provided with an adequate carbohydrate source. However, females that developed from diapause larvae lived significantly longer than those from nondiapause larvae. Flight capacity, including flight duration, distance and velocity of 3 -d-old adults were all significantly greater in adults originating from diapause larvae than those from nondiapause larvae. L. sticticalisadults developing from diapause larvae tended to have more extreme values of longest flight duration and furthest flight distance than those from nondiapause larvae. Together, these results suggest that long-distance flight potential of L. sticticalis is greater after larval diapause than after direct development to adulthood. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between sexes within the two categories of moths in terms of total flight duration, total flight distance, flight velocity, and longest flight duration...|$|E
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that insects living in high-density populations exhibit {{an increase in}} immune function to counter {{a higher risk of}} disease. This phenomenon, known as density-dependent prophylaxis, has been experimentally tested in a number of insect species. Although density-dependent prophylaxis is especially prevalent in insects exhibiting density-dependent phase polyphenism, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Our previous study demonstrated that the antibacterial activity of lysozyme is important for this process in the <b>beet</b> <b>webworm</b> Loxostege sticticalis. In this study, a lysozyme cDNA from L. sticticalis was cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA is 1078 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 426 bp that encodes 142 amino acids. The deduced protein possesses structural characteristics of a typical c-type lysozyme and clusters with c-type lysozymes from other Lepidoptera. LsLysozyme was found to be expressed throughout all developmental stages, showing the highest level in pupae. LsLysozyme was also highly expressed in the midgut and fat body. Elevated LsLysozyme expression was observed in L. sticticalis larvae infected by Beauveria bassiana and in larvae reared under crowding conditions. In addition, the expression level of LsLysozyme in infected larvae reared at a density of 10 larvae per jar was significantly higher compared to those reared at a density of l or 30 larvae per jar. These results suggest that larval crowding affects the gene expression profile of this lysozyme. This study provides additional insight into the expression of an immune-associated lysozyme gene and helps us to better understand the immune response of L. sticticalis under crowding conditions...|$|E
40|$|The larvae of the {{southern}} <b>beet</b> <b>webworm</b> Herpetogramma bipunctalis (Fabricius, 1794) damage the leaves of species in the plant genus Rubus. The present study investigated the biology of H. bipunctalis and developed a protocol for raising H. bipunctalis under laboratory conditions. On {{the basis of the}} biological data, we devised a life table. In order to develop the rearing procedures, we determined which oviposition substrate and blackberry cultivar were the most appropriate for larval development. The mean durations of the egg, larval, and pupal stages were 5. 59 days, 26. 37 days, and 13. 37 days, respectively, and the corresponding survival rates were 80. 83 %, 49. 07 %, and 83. 23 %. The mean pupal weight was 0. 0491 g for males and 0. 0536 g for females. The mean life cycle (egg-to-adult) period was 45. 33 days, and overall survival to adulthood was 33. 01 %. H. bipunctalis females laid a mean of 252. 63 eggs over a mean of 13. 60 days of oviposition; the mean pre-oviposition period was 2. 67 days. Mean female and male life spans were 17. 51 and 19. 25 days, respectively, and the sex ratio was 0. 51. The life-table data indicated that H. bipunctalis can reproduce 57. 9 times per generation. Each cage contained one blackberry leaf placed on a paper towel. This method allowed us to obtain the greatest number of eggs. The larval stage was shorter for insects reared on leaves of the Guarani cultivar than for those reared on leaves of the Xavante cultivar (22. 63 vs. 26. 37 days). These basic data can aid in establishing strategies for the management of H. bipunctalis on blackberry farms...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) of the <b>beet</b> <b>webworm,</b> Spoladea recurvalis {{has been}} sequenced. The circular genome is 15, 273 bp in size, encoding 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two rRNA genes, and 22 tRNA genes and containing a control region with gene order and orientation {{identical to that}} of other ditrysian lepidopteran mitogenomes. The nucleotide composition of the mitogenome shows a high A+T content of 80. 9 %, and the AT skewness is slightly negative (- 0. 023). All PCGs start with the typical ATN codons, except for COX 1, which may start with the CGA codon. Nine of 13 PCGs have the common stop codon TAA; however, COX 1, COX 2 and ND 5 utilize the T nucleotide and ND 4 utilizes TA nucleotides as incomplete termination codons. All tRNAs genes are folded into the typical cloverleaf structure of mitochondrial tRNAs, except for the tRNASer(AGY) gene, in which the DHU arm fails to form a stable stem-loop structure. A total of 157 bp intergenic spacers are scattered in 17 regions. The overlapping sequences are 42 bp in total and found in eight different locations. The 329 bp AT-rich region is comprised of non-repetitive sequences, including the motif ATAG, which is followed by a 14 bp poly-T stretch, a (AT 11 microsatellite-like repeat, which is adjacent to the motif ATTTA, and a 9 bp poly-A, which is immediately upstream from the tRNAMet gene. Phylogenetic analysis, based on 13 PCGs and 13 PCGs+ 2 rRNAs using Bayesian inference and Maximum likelihood methods, show that the classification position of Pyraloidea is inconsistent with the traditional classification. Hesperioidea is placed within the Papilionoidea rather than as a sister group to it. The Pyraloidea is placed within the Macrolepidoptera with other superfamilies instead of the Papilionoidea...|$|E
