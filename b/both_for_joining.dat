5000|$|In 1887, George M. Pullman {{introduced}} his patented vestibule cars. Older railroad cars had open platforms at their ends, which were used <b>both</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> {{and leaving the}} train, but {{could also be used}} to step from one car to the next. This practice was dangerous, and so Pullman decided to enclose the platform to produce the vestibule. For passing between cars, there was a passageway {{in the form of a}} steel-framed rectangular diaphragm mounted on a buffing plate above the centre coupler. The vestibule prevented passengers from falling out, and protected passengers from the weather when passing between cars. In the event of an accident, the design also helped prevent cars from overriding each other, reducing the risk of telescoping. Pullman's vestibule cars were first used in 1887. Among the first to use them was the Pennsylvania Railroad on the Pennsylvania Limited service to Chicago.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{called the}} Wild Hearts (two words), the band {{originally}} included singers Snake (ex-Tobruk) and Dunken F.

These demos remain unreleased and displayed a sound resembling Guns N' Roses, with the Wildhearts sound still to be developed. Some of the demos were produced by Ric Browde and intended for an EP release that never materialized, though these demos are occasionally found on unofficial releases. In March 1991, Ginger reluctantly took over on lead vocals despite his reservations, as he has never thought himself a good singer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A spatial {{distance}} join is {{a relatively}} new type of operation introduced for spatial and multimedia database applications. Additional requirements for ranking and stopping cardinality are often combined with the spatial distance join in online query processing or Internet search environments. These requirements pose new challenges as well as opportunities for more efficient processing of spatial distance join queries. In this paper, we first present an efficient k-distance join algorithm that uses spatial indexes such as R-trees. Bidirectional node expansion and plane-sweeping techniques are used for fast pruning of distant pairs, and the planesweeping is further optimized by novel strategies for selecting a sweeping axis and direction. Furthermore, we propose adaptive multistage algorithms <b>for</b> k-distance <b>join</b> and incremental distance join operations. Our performance study shows that the proposed adaptive multistage algorithms outperform previous work by up to an order of magnitude <b>for</b> <b>both</b> k-distance <b>join</b> and incremental distance join queries, under various operational conditions. Index Terms—Spatial databases, k-distance join, incremental distance join, adaptive query processing, multistage query processing, plane sweeping, sweeping index, estimating cutoff distance. ...|$|R
50|$|These moves {{depleted}} the Sun Belt {{and made}} the need to expand their membership more urgent than ever, as the Sun Belt was left with ten full members and only eight members that sponsor football (the minimum number required for a conference to sponsor football at the FBS level) for the 2013 season. Appalachian State University accepted an invitation on March 27, 2013 to join the Sun Belt effective July 1, 2014. Georgia Southern University accepted a similar Sun Belt invitation {{at the same time}} as Appalachian State. Appalachian State and Georgia Southern <b>both</b> <b>joined</b> <b>for</b> all sports from the Southern Conference on July 1, 2014. Both schools had been very successful within the Football Championship Subdivision, combining to win 9 national championships since 1985. They upgraded to the Football Bowl Subdivision, and were eligible for Sun Belt conference championships in 2014, but were not postseason eligible in football until 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{influence}} of George Orwell's experience as a war-time BBC radio broadcaster on the author as he created the world of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR. In 1985 W. J. West published the transcripts of Orwell's wartime broadcasts. West suggested in his introductory preface that Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR was based directly on his BBC experience and problems encountered with the Ministry of Information at that time. This thesis argues that, though Orwell probably drew on his BBC experience for the psychological content of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, Winston's treatment {{at the hands of}} Big Brother is not based on anything the author endured during his tenure at the BBC. To this end Orwell's personal and political reasons <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>joining</b> and leaving the BBC are discussed. The connection between reality and fiction in Orwell's works, both documentary and fictional, is examined, and the literary nature of all of Orwell's writing taken into consideration in an exploration of the creative dynamic shaping Orwell's expression...|$|R
40|$|The query {{processing}} in {{a mobile}} computing environment involves join processing among different sites which include static servers and mobile computers. In this paper, we first present some unique {{features of a}} mobile environment, and then, {{in light of these}} features, devise query processing methods <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>join</b> and query processing. Remote mobile joins are said to be effectual if they are, when interleaved into a join sequence, able {{to reduce the amount of}} data transmission cost required for distributed mobile query processing. It can be verified that the total data transmission cost of the processing in a distributed mobile query can be reduced by the algorithms designed by using effectual remote joins.. 4 simulator is developed to evaluate the performance of algorithms devised. Our results show that the approach of interleaving the processing of distributed mobile queries with effectual remote mobile joins is not only efficient but also effective in reducing the total amount of data transmission cost required to process distributed mobile queries...|$|R
