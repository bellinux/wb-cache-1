500|$|Championship runner-up Fernando Alonso {{expressed}} {{pride for}} his team, {{going so far}} as to call the 2012 season [...] "the best season of my career". During the podium interview with Nelson Piquet, he asserted: [...] "Obviously we lost the championship now, but I don't think, as you said, that we lost here in Brazil, we lost in some races where we were a little bit unlucky. But this is a sport, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> something with your heart, when you do something with 100 per cent, you have to be proud of your team, happy for them, and we will try next year." [...] The press later pointed out Alonso's [...] "grace after the race", contrasting him to Vettel who had criticized the competition's [...] "dirty tricks" [...] during his post-race press conference.|$|E
500|$|The Holy Trinity Church in Doncaster {{was used}} as the {{location}} for the wedding. The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we had to be careful that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E

5000|$|And, {{the key to}} {{architectural}} photography? “It's {{all these}} little teeny things—ironing a tablecloth, smoothing the wrinkles out of the bedspread. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> them, no one notices, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>do</b> them, everyone notices.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I understand, Mr. Armstrong," [...] Hiram Powlett agreed. [...] "Naturally, <b>when</b> he told <b>you</b> about himself, {{he did not}} ask it to be kept a secret, {{because he}} <b>did</b> not know <b>you</b> would meet any one that knowed him. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> meet such, <b>you</b> {{thought that it was}} right to say nothing about it, and I agree with you; but of course this matter of the Squire going queer in his mind makes all the difference, and I think, as you says, Captain Mervyn ought to be fetched home. When he has seen the Squire is {{properly}} taken care of, he can go away where he likes." ...|$|R

I don't find any fault with you for going to the Melmottes,--though I was very sorry to hear it; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> it, I don't think you should complain of people because they won't have the Melmottes crammed down their throats.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Osmond was {{apparently}} {{on the point}} of saying something that would match these words, but he changed his mind and rejoined simply: [...] "Ah well, it's proper you should go with her, very proper.

You say you don't know me, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> you'll discover what a worship I have for propriety." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have a brace of revolvers upstairs," [...] he said, [...] "and {{will give}} one {{to each of}} you boys. Carry them always, but put them on under your coats, {{so that they may}} not be noticed; it would be as well for you to {{practice}} yourselves in their use; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> so, always go some distance from the station, so that the sound will not be heard." ...|$|E

Don't laugh at me, I say; and don't thwart me! I may make you the emperor's prime minister some day. I can if I choose.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There are {{two kinds}} of socialists,' said Herr Max, bending once more over his glasses; 'the one kind is always {{thinking}} most of its rights; the other kind is always thinking most of its duties. Oswald belongs to the first, Le Breton to the second. I've often observed it so among men of their two sorts. The best socialists never come from the bourgeoisie, nor even from the proletariate; they come from among the voluntarily déclassés aristocrats. Your workman or your bourgeois who has risen, and who interests himself in social or political questions, is always thinking, [...] "Why shouldn't I have as many rights and privileges as these other people have?" [...] The aristocrat who descends is always thinking, [...] "Why shouldn't these other people have as many rights and privileges as I have?" [...] The one type begets aggressive self-assertion, the other type begets a certain gentle spirit of self-effacement. You don't often find men of the aristocratic class with any ethical element in them--their hereditary antecedents, their breeding, their environment, are all hostile to it; <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> find them, mark my words, Uta, they make the truest and most earnest friends of the popular cause of any. Their sympathy and interest in it is all unselfish.' ...|$|E

5000|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews. Amiga Action gave {{an overall}} score of 62% but their reviewers were split. Reviewer Alex said [...] "The graphics are well implemented, and I {{was impressed by}} the use of first-person perspective when shooting or saving a goal" [...] but reviewer Doug concluded [...] "I've played my fair share of soccer games, and this World Cup tie-in is certainly not the best. The game is quite hard to get the hang of, <b>but</b> even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> get used to the controls the game still doesn't play that well".|$|R
2500|$|Don was {{a terrific}} {{television}} personality. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> saw Don <b>doing</b> his floor show, whether in clubs or theatres, {{when he had a}} live audience and band he really owned that stage.

60|$|So {{you must}} read {{of them in}} such books as Peaks, Passes, and Glaciers, and Mr. Willes's Wanderings in the High Alps, and Professor Tyndall's {{different}} works; or you must look at them (as I just now said) in photographs or in pictures. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> that, or {{when you see a}} glacier for yourself, you must bear in mind what a glacier means--that it is a river of ice, fed by a lake of snow. The lake from which it springs is the eternal snow-field which stretches for miles and miles along the mountain tops, fed continually by fresh snow-storms falling from the sky. That snow slides off into the valleys hour by hour, and as it rushes down is ground and pounded, and thawed and frozen again into a sticky paste of ice, which flows slowly but surely till it reaches the warm valley at the mountain foot, and there melts bit by bit. The long black lines which you see winding along the white and green ice of the glacier are the stones which have fallen from the cliffs above. They will be dropped {{at the end of the}} glacier, and mixed with silt and sand and other stones which have come down inside the glacier itself, and piled up in the field in great mounds, which are called moraines, such as you may see and walk on in Scotland many a time, though you might never guess what they are.|$|E
6000|$|In {{that one}} little corner of California is found {{a species of}} mining which is seldom or never {{mentioned}} in print. It is called [...] "pocket mining" [...] and I am not aware that any of it is done outside of that little corner. The gold is not evenly distributed through the surface dirt, as in ordinary placer mines, but is collected in little spots, {{and they are very}} wide apart and exceedingly hard to find, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> find one you reap a rich and sudden harvest. There are not now more than twenty pocket miners in that entire little region. I think I know every one of them personally. I have known one of them to hunt patiently about the hill-sides every day for eight months without finding gold enough to make a snuff-box--his grocery bill running up relentlessly all the time--and then find a pocket and take out of it two thousand dollars in two dips of his shovel. I have known him to take out three thousand dollars in two hours, and go and pay up every cent of his indebtedness, then enter on a dazzling spree that finished the last of his treasure before the night was gone. And the next day he bought his groceries on credit as usual, and shouldered his pan and shovel and went off to the hills hunting pockets again happy and content. This is the most fascinating of all the different kinds of mining, and furnishes a very handsome percentage of victims to the lunatic asylum.|$|E
