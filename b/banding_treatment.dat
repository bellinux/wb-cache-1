40|$|This study {{examines}} the agronomic response, efficiency and profitability of fertilizer microdosing in maize. An {{experiment with the}} following treatments was conducted: control without fertilizer, microdosing treatments, with the rate of 27 + 27, 53 + 53 and 80 + 80 kg ha− 1, and banding of fertilizer with 100 + 100 kg ha− 1 of di ammonium phosphate (DAP) + urea, applied at planting and jointing, respectively. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The experiment was conducted during the 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013 cropping seasons at Ziway, Melkassa and Hawassa in the semiarid central rift valley region of Ethiopia. Compared to the control, the fertilizer treatments had higher yield and fertilizer use efficiency (FUE) profitably. The 27 + 27 kg ha− 1 fertilizer rate increased the grain yield by 19, 45 and 46 % at Hawassa, Ziway and Melkassa, respectively, and it was equivalent to the higher rates. The value cost ratio (VCR) was highest with the lowest fertilizer rate, varying between seven and 11 in the treatment with 27 + 27 kg ha− 1, but two and three in the <b>banding</b> <b>treatment.</b> Similarly, FUE was highest with the lowest fertilizer rate, varying between 23 and 34 kg kg− 1 but 7 and 8 kg kg− 1 in the <b>banding</b> <b>treatment.</b> The improved yield, FUE, VCR and gross margin in maize with microdosing at the 27 + 27 kg ha− 1 of DAP + urea rate makes it low cost, low risk, high yielding and profitable. Therefore, application of this particular rate in maize may be an option for the marginal farmers in the region with similar socioeconomic and agroecological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Cooperations between {{engineers}} and physicians are crucial for studying and solving complex medical-biological problems. The study of obesity - unanimously {{regarded as a}} multi-factorial disease - is a typical example where specialists from various areas of medical research may be supported by engineers expert in system theory and software development. The effectiveness and the risk-benefit profile of medical intervention in this field (i. e., bariatric surgery and gastric banding) may require advanced data analysis to classify patient typologies and to predict the effects of therapies. In this paper the experience gained {{by a team of}} engineers joining a team of physicians is described: as a first step a specific software for data analysis was developed in the case of obese patients. The software toolbox implemented standard statistical models for classification of subjects according to their psychological profile. Afterwards, the analysis was extended using artificial neural networks for modeling and predicting the outcome of gastric banding in term of excess weight loss after 2 years, based on the preliminary knowledge of the psychological profile of patients involved. Obtained results demonstrate that the cooperation {{led to the development of}} a reliable tool for physicians, as an aid to forecasting the outcome of the therapy and to predict the patients candidate to get better benefits from a gastric <b>banding</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that inflammation actively participates in ascending aortic aneurysm formation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the expression changes of adhesion molecules and MMPs in an experimental model of ascending aortic aneurysm induced by ascending aorta banding in Wistar rats. Twelve rats developed aortic dilation after ascending aorta <b>banding</b> <b>treatment,</b> while nine normal animals underwent surgery without banding were used as controls. Light microscope and scanning electron microscope showed that the wall of the ascending aorta became disorganized as well as infiltration by inflammatory cells in aneurysmal rats. By using immunohistochemical techniques, a significant increase in the immunostaining of MCP- 1 was observed in the aneurysmal wall as compared to the normal aortic wall. Under similar experimental conditions, we also found that the immunostaining of ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 was markedly increased in the aneurysmal wall. In addition, gelatin zymographic analysis showed that the expression and activities of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 were remarkably enhanced in the ascending aorta of ascending aortic aneurysmal rats as compared to normal rats. These results demonstrate that MCP- 1, ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1 are involved in the pathogenesis of ascending aortic aneurysm and an increase in the immunostaining and activity of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 may promote the progression of ascending aortic aneurysm...|$|E

40|$|The striped {{cucumber}} beetle, Acalymma vittatum (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), {{is a key}} pest of cucurbit crops {{throughout its}} range. A novel precision band applicator was designed to inject a solid stream of imidacloprid solution in-furrow directly over the seed during planting to reduce beetle leaf feeding on pumpkin, zucchini, and cucumber crops. In 2004 and 2005, bioassays at the cotyledon through fifth leaf were conducted on striped cucumber beetles using seedling leaf tissue grown from seeds treated using both continuous and precision banded in-furrow imidacloprid solution applications. In 2004, 80 % of bioassay trials had treatments with beetle mortality {{significantly higher than the}} check, whereas 70 % of the bioassay trials showed no significant difference in mortality between continuous in-furrow and precision <b>banded</b> <b>treatments.</b> In 2005, 79 % of bioassay trials had treatments with beetle mortality significantly higher than the check, whereas 100 % of the bioassays showed no significant difference in beetle mortality between continuous in-furrow and precision <b>banded</b> <b>treatments</b> at the same insecticide rate. The environmental savings of precision <b>banded</b> <b>treatments</b> compared with continuous in-furrow treatment reduced imidacloprid up to 84. 5 % on a per hectare basis for all cucurbits tested in 2004 and 2005, translating into an economic savings up to 030215 /ha. In separate bioassay trials conducted in 2005 on pumpkin, where insecticide band length and injection volume were manipulated independently, several treatments had significantly higher beetle mortality than the check.

The PVC bands were attached two ways, either to the leg of the bird or to the cage floor. Leg <b>band</b> <b>treatments</b> included one, two, three, four, and six birds banded (one band per bird) per cage of six birds. Cage <b>band</b> <b>treatments</b> included one, two, and four PVC strips attached to the cage floor. The attachment of PVC bands to cages was very effective in controlling NFM. Birds in the <b>treatment</b> with four <b>bands</b> attached to the cage floor were essentially mite free {{for the duration of the}} 19 -week test. Based on this test, the leg banding technique does not seem to be as effective or practical for controlling NFM on caged layers as is attachment of the bands to the cage floor. The use of per-methrin-impregnated PVC bands or strips attached to the floor of poultry cages shows promise for effective NFM control and for relieving stress on birds resulting from conventional spraying or dusting treatments...|$|R

40|$|Replacing {{herbicides}} with {{mechanical cultivation}} can reduce pesticide use in row crop production. Although {{a majority of}} Iowa’s corn land is cultivated, most is cultivated only once and herbicide is broadcast applied. To increase grower confidence in reducing herbicide use and in using cultivation for interrow weed control, a three-year field experiment compared various single-cultivation plus band-herbicide application strategies with broadcast application strategy and no-control strategy. To cover larger acreages in a narrow window of time, cultivation speed was increased each year from 11. 3 to 14. 1 to 16. 9 km/h (7. 0, 8. 8, and 10. 5 mph). A 38 -cm (15 -in.) herbicide <b>band</b> <b>treatment</b> had less weed growth, and generally greater yield, extended leaf height, and corn population than did a 19 -cm (7. 5 -in.) <b>band</b> <b>treatment.</b> Few differences were noted among cultivator styles. Weed management and grain yield were as good or better with the traditional low-crown sweep as with other styles. Its wider cutting width (56 -cm or 22 in.) in 76 -cm (30 -in.) rows resulted in a lower corn population, however, when operated at 16. 9 km/h (10. 5 mph) with a crosswind. Differences in weed population and visual weed cover rankings when comparing single-cultivation with broadcast-only strategies varied with years. Grain yield from a treatment using a single cultivation with a low-crown sweep and a 38 -cm (15 -in.) wide herbicide band was statistically equivalent to that from a broadcast-only treatment in all three years. Results {{of this study indicate}} that herbicide use can be halved and weed control and corn yield can be maintained by use of a 38 cm (15 in.) herbicide band and a single sweep cultivation...|$|R

40|$|A field micro-plot {{experiment}} using nitrogen isotope (15 N) labeling {{was conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of placement methods (broadcast and band) and N rates (60, 150 and 240 kg ha- 1) on the fate of urea- 15 N in the wheat-soil system in Guangde County of Anhui Province, China. N fertilizer applied in bands increased grain yield by 15 % compared with broadcast application. The N fertilizer application rate had a significant effect on grain yield, straw yield and aboveground biomass, as well as on N uptake and N concentration of wheat. The recovery of urea- 15 N was a little higher for broadcast (34. 0 - 39. 0 %) than for <b>band</b> <b>treatment</b> (31. 2 - 38. 2 %).

40|$|Background Early in {{a season}} the crop covers only part of total field area. Treating that area uniformly can {{therefore}} be wasteful. An ability to differentiate between crop rows and inter-row spaces would provide opportunities for increased treatment efficacy, reduced environmental impact and reduced input costs. <b>Banded</b> <b>treatments</b> on, or between crop rows, requires a level of precision {{that is difficult to}} achieve in practice. So, despite the potential advantages inter-row cultivation and band spraying are limited to use in high value crops. Recent advances pioneered by some of the consortium partners now offer automatic guidance systems for inter-row cultivation. These are currently used in intensive vegetable production and by those growing cereals organically. They offer enhanced accuracy, higher forward speeds and reduced driver fatigue compared to manual systems. Whilst helpful, the science behind these developments has limitations with respect to work rate. In particular the need for inter-row hoes to match drill bout width makes such systems uneconomic for conventional cereal producers.

40|$|Linuron is a {{substituted}} urea herbicide {{registered for}} use on asparagus, carrots, celery, corn (field and sweet), cottonseed (use volutarily removed by registrant), parsley, parsnips, potatoes, sorgum, soybeans, and winter wheat. Linuron may be applied preplant, preemergence, postemergence, or post transplant using ground equipment. The registered modes of application are <b>band</b> <b>treatment,</b> directed spray, or broadcast spray. The most current EPA records show 9 active end-use product registrations and 5 technical grades of linuron. End-use products include wettable powder (50 % a. i.), flowable concentrate (40. 6 % a. i.), water dispersable granules (50 % a. i.), and liquid suspensions. Linuron functions as an herbicide through the inhibition of photosynthesis. It is approved {{for a wide range}} of noxious weeds, but local conditions and weed resistance have limited its use to specific states and, often, specific portions of states. These combined factors greatly reduce actual linuron use from levels provided for in EPA registration documents and registrant lables. Toxicity to fish is considered slight to moderate, however linuron is quite toxic to aquatic invertebrates. The invertebrate toxicity is probably the most significant potential adverse effect from this pesticide since invertebrates serve as a primary food source for young and juvenil...|$|R
