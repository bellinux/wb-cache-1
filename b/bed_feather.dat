40|$|OBJECTIVES: Allergens {{produced}} by domestic mites (DM) {{are among the}} most common allergic sensitizers and risk factors for asthma. To compare exposure levels between workplaces and living areas a new assay able to measure airborne DM antigen concentrations was developed. METHODS: At workplaces and in living areas, 213 floor dust samples and 92 personal inhalable dust samples were collected. For sensitive quantification of DM antigens, a new enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on polyclonal antibodies to Dermatophagoides farinae extract was developed. Reactivity of five house dust mite and four storage mite species was tested. All dust samples were tested with the new EIA and with the Der f 1 and Der p 1 -EIAs (Indoor Biotechnologies, UK) which detect major allergens from D. farinae and D. pteronyssinus by monoclonal antibodies. Samples below the detection limit in the DM-EIA were retested in an assay variant with a fluorogenic substrate (DM-FEIA). RESULTS: The newly developed DM-EIA detects antigens from all nine tested domestic mite species. It has a lower detection limit of 200 pg/ml of D. farinae protein, compared to 50 pg/ml for the DM-FEIA. DM antigens were detected by DM-EIA/FEIA in all floor dust and 80 (87 %) of airborne samples. Der f 1 was found in 133 (62 %) floor dust and in only 6 airborne samples, Der p 1 was found in 70 (33 %) of floor samples and in one airborne sample. Der f 1 and DM concentrations were highly correlated. DM-antigens were significantly higher in inhalable airborne samples from textile recycling, <b>bed</b> <b>feather</b> filling, feed production, grain storage and cattle stables in comparison to living areas. CONCLUSIONS: A new sensitive EIA directed at DM antigens was developed. DM antigen quantities were well correlated to Der f 1 values and were measurable in the majority (87 %) of airborne dust samples. Some workplaces had significantly higher DM antigen concentrations than living areas...|$|E

40|$|Various {{cross-sectional}} and {{longitudinal studies}} have suggested that synthetic bedding is associated with asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema while <b>feather</b> <b>bedding</b> seems to be protective. Synthetic bedding items have higher house dust mite allergen levels than <b>feather</b> <b>bedding</b> items. This is possibly the mechanism involved although fungal and bacterial proinflammatory compounds and volatile organic compounds may play a role. In this review we present and discuss the epidemiological evidence and suggest possible mechanisms.

50|$|Colony-nesting {{birds have}} been used by humans as a source of food in the form of eggs and meat, down for <b>bedding,</b> <b>feathers</b> for quill pens, and guano for fertilizer. Over-exploitation can be devastating to a colony, or even to an entire {{population}} of a colonial species. For example, there was once a large seabird known as the great auk, which nested in colonies in the North Atlantic. Eggs and birds were used for a variety of purposes. Beginning in the 16th century, seafarers took the birds in especially great numbers to fill ships' larders, and by the mid-19th century, the great auk was extinct. Likewise, the short-tailed albatross of the North Pacific was heavily harvested at what seems to have been its primary colony on Torishima Island. Millions of birds were killed with a few decades {{at the end of the}} 19th century. It survives, though endangered. In North America, the case of the highly gregarious passenger pigeon has been well documented. It was hunted as if inexhaustible. Case in point: in 1871, in Wisconsin, an estimated 136 million pigeons nested in a dense congregation over a wide area; thousands of people were drawn to hunt the birds, shipping the squab to market by rail. The passenger pigeon is a famous example of a familiar bird going extinct in modern times.|$|R
