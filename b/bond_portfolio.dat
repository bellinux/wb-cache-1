We focus here on the risk {{issues raised by the}} classical market-capitalization weighting scheme. We propose an approach to properly measure sovereign credit risk in a fixed-income portfolio. For that, we assume that CDS spreads follow a SABR process and we derive a sovereign credit risk measure based on CDS spreads and duration of <b>portfolio</b> <b>bonds.</b> We then consider two alternative weighting methods which are fundamental indexation and risk-based indexation. Fundamental indexation is based on GDP indexation whereas risk-based indexation uses a risk budgeting approach based on our sovereign credit risk measure.

We show that the risk budgeting approach is the most appropriate scheme to manage sovereign credit risk in <b>bond</b> <b>portfolios</b> and gives very appealing results with respect to active management of <b>bond</b> <b>portfolios.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper has}} two main goals: to analyze country {{allocations}} in international <b>bond</b> <b>portfolios</b> and {{to describe the}} development of bond markets around the world. In the primary analysis, we find that country weights in U.

Positions in local-currency-denominated bonds are particularly sensitive to past and prospective volatility of returns. Analysis of reallocations in <b>bond</b> <b>portfolios</b> from 1997 to 2001 reveals a flight to quality from countries with low and declining credit ratings; reallocations in U. S. investors' equity portfolios also reveal a discriminating flight from higher credit risks. In the secondary analysis, we present measures of the size and currency composition of bond markets and analyze the development of local currency bond markets. We find that while country size and the level of economic development influence the level of bond market development, past policies [...] -as evidenced in the level and volatility of historical inflation [...] -play an important role. An implication for developing countries is that creditor friendly policies, such as vigilance on the inflation front, can enable local bond market development and in turn attract global investors, in part by promoting the development of derivative instruments that allow the decoupling of bond and currency investments.
