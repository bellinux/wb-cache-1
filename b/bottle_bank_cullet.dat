40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analysis}} of glass waste generation rates from a sample of households distributed throughout the UK is presented. The effects of household size, age profile, and social class were evaluated in the study. The greatest explanatory value (r 2 = 0. 17) was obtained when households were classified into three categories: households with one person resident, non-manual worker households {{with more than one}} person resident, and manual worker households with more than one person resident. At a mean of 28. 9 kg per household per annum, annualised glass waste generation rates were lowest among one-person households and highest (86. 7 kg per household per annum) among non-manual worker households with more than one person resident. Coefficients arising from the analysis were used to predict household glass waste generation rates in 39 electoral wards in Birmingham. A model developed earlier by The Open University to predict the spatial distribution of glass recycled by households was also used to predict the quantity of glass taken to <b>bottle</b> <b>bank</b> sites by households in each of the 39 yards.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the technological economics of glass recycling in Britain. Attention {{was focused on}} recovery schemes operated within Scotland, comparisons being made with schemes {{in the rest of}} Britain and in Europe. An examination was made of general recycling problems and of glass recycling problems in particular. The various systems for glass recycling were reviewed and were put {{in the context of the}} waste management system as a whole. A survey was undertaken of Local Authorities operating glass recycling schemes. The aim was to provide a comprehensive data set to enable a consistent assessment of glass recovery schemes to be taken. This emphasised the importance of taking a standard approach to assessing the viability of recovery schemes. This needs to be done in terms of both private and social costs and benefits to provide a full economic assessment of the system. A general computer model has been developed to allow local authorities to check the viability of their on-going operations. As they operate under different conditions this model was split into separate assessment of a <b>Bottle</b> <b>Bank</b> scheme and a trade collection scheme. In addition, an investment appraisal model was developed to cover both situations. These allow managers to assess the viability of their schemes and can be used to highlight key costs. An International review was undertaken to see what lessons may be learned and what actions may be taken by the local authorities, industry, the general public, and by central government...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of the 20 th Century, breast milk banks have {{facilitated}} the exchange of breast milk from mothers with an excess supply to infants in need. But while early banks used a seller model, purchasing milk as a commodity from lower class women, today banks use a donor model, relying on middle class women who give their milk away as a gift. This dissertation explores why the commodified model of breast milk banking first arose, and why banked breast milk was giftified (but still commodified) {{by the end of the}} century. I use content analysis of institutional records from three banks operating in three different eras, and interviews with current milk bank managers, donors, and parents of recipients to address these questions. My analysis indicates that in each era a confluence of factors, in particular women's employment, conceptions of motherhood, medical practices and beliefs, and technologies shapes the exchange of banked breast milk. In the early 20 th century new technologies made the physical disembodiment of breast milk possible, while mothering practices and medical authorities' preferences promoted breast milk's symbolic disembodiment, promoting the milk's commodification, while limited employment opportunities created a pool of willing sellers. During the 1960 s new mothering practices and related changes in physicians' preferences sacralized the milk, making its sale by mothers culturally inappropriate. Today, high levels of maternal employment and portable, efficient breast pumps create an excess supply of milk that mothers are loath to dispose of due to its sacralized status, sustaining the donor model. But banks still sell the milk as a commodity, albeit a non-profit one, to parents who use the milk both as food and as a form of good parenting in a <b>bottle.</b> Breast milk <b>banking</b> therefore involves both gift and commodity exchange. And as interviews with donors and parents of recipients demonstrate, many middle class donors want to be paid, while middle class parents who purchase the milk reject the idea of donor compensation, pointing to breast milk's ambiguous status even among those intimately involved in its exchange, and the role of social class in mediating actors' perceptions and experiences...|$|R
