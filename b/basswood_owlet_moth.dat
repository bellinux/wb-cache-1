40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the lepidopterous of the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> family. The work {{is aimed at}} {{studying}} the species composition, biology, ecology and economy significance of the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> under {{the conditions of the}} altitude belt of the South Osetia, and at the developing of the biological bases of struggle against the harmful species. The methods of investigation: catching by the light-traps ESLU- 3 equipped with lamps LUF- 15 and the methods of the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> selection, the route investigations and count of the number (Osmolovsky, 1964); the field tests of pyretroids and the determination of the residue number in the plants. For the first time, the List of the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> of the South Osetia (201 species) has been compiled; the zonal and stacial distribution of the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> has been studied; studied or specified has been the biology of 21 harmful species; the groups of species by the degree of harmfulness have been isolated; the territory of the South Osetia has been divided by regions by the complexes of the harmful <b>owlet</b> <b>moths.</b> The tes of the new chemical insecticides against the <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> has been performed, its high efficiency has been shown; the system of protection of the cabbage and sugar beet against the harmful <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> has been improved. The chemical method of protection of cabbage from the vermins (especially <b>owlet</b> <b>moths),</b> using the synthetic pyretroids has been introduced in sovkhoz Eredvi of Tschinvalsky region. The method ensures the reduction of treatments, the norms of consumption of the preparations and labour at a simultaneous increase of the cabbage crop by 1, 4 timesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R

50|$|D. traskiae is slow to {{increase}} its population due to several factors. Some plants produce few seeds, and some produce few seeds that are viable. Seeds produced are sometimes taken and consumed by deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus ssp. exilis). On the other hand, when the mice cache the seeds, they may aid in its difficult seed dispersal. Seedlings that successfully emerge are consumed by the mice and by the larvae of <b>owlet</b> <b>moths.</b> Others perished in drought.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the main {{physical}} defense in caterpillars and adults alike is mimicry. Most <b>owlet</b> <b>moths</b> have drab colors {{with a variety}} of patterns suitable to camouflage their bodies. The second physical defense consists in thousands of secondary setae that surround the body. The subfamilies that present this mechanism are Pantheinae and Acronictinae. The third is aposematism, represented by species of Cucullinae. Finally, all adults have another mechanism for defense: a tympanal organ available to hear the echolocation spread out by bats, so the moths can avoid them.|$|R
50|$|The Noctuidae, {{commonly}} known as <b>Owlet</b> <b>moths,</b> cutworms or armyworms, is the most controversial family in the superfamily Noctuoidea because many of its clades are constantly changing, {{along with the other}} families of Noctuoidea. It was considered the largest family in Lepidoptera for a long time, but after regrouping Lymantriinae, Catocalinae and Calpinae within the family Erebidae, the latter holds this title now. Currently, Noctuidae is the second largest family in Noctuoidea, with about 1,089 genera and 11,772 species. However, this classification is still contingent, as more changes continue to appear between Noctuidae and Erebidae.|$|R

The Coleophora case-bearers C. linosyridella and C. viscidiflorella are polyphagous species whose larve have been recorded on the Bush Baccharis {{as well as other}} plants.
