For nine hours and 21 minutes, he chiselled away the England attack and the {{sculpture}} that he left behind represented perseverance and craft. There was the usual stoic, expressionless face under the helmet, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> see the determination in {{his eyes as he}} planted himself at the wicket, struck root and bore fruit.|$|E

Suppose the total composition were 50/50%. You could make this composition using 50% of 50/50% vapor and 50% of 50/50% liquid, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> also make it from 83.33% of 45/55% vapor and 16.67% of 75%/25% liquid, as well as from many other combinations. The separation of the two traces represents the range of combinations of liquid and vapor that can make each total composition.|$|E

You could tell he wasn't going anywhere, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> never convince the trainer. He's almost a caretaker. He's watching out for you completely. You could see the devotion involved." [...] Drawing upon material originally created for his critically acclaimed one-man off-Broadway show [...] "Dreamer Awakens," [...] Davis completed the script in 1999 and moved to Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the book}} concludes, Gladwell {{writes about the}} unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a {{descendant}} of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met {{and fell in love}} with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success [...] "is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky", and at the end of the book, he remarks, [...] "Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> read it as an extended apology for my success." ...|$|E
500|$|Stephen also {{commented on}} the feud, opining that while [...] "Mercedes and Mitzeee are hardly Dynasty's Alexis and Krystle, they are enjoying quite a good spat". After Mercedes' {{stalking}} of Mitzeee, Stephen went on to say: [...] "No one could deny that Mercedes has had one heck of an exciting life. Siege victim, kidnap victim, depressive, stalker..." [...] Stephen urged Mercedes to realise that [...] "there are other guys in the world apart from Riley. True, you've had them all, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it! So now manipulative Mercedes has the upper hand over her rival [...] After all, who’d suspect anyone of stabbing themselves – very few people are warped enough to do that".|$|E
500|$|TV Week often {{commented on}} her {{pregnancy}} storyline. After the plot was half way through Erin Miller of TV Week said that Nicole {{had changed her}} mind about adopting her baby [...] "more times that Julia Gillard has uttered the phrase 'moving forward'". Upon watching Nicole's beach birth scenes, the magazine website editor quipped [...] "Who knew sand had birthing properties?! Well, maybe not... <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> forgive pregnant teen Nicole for thinking that after a casual stroll along the Bay's beach ends with Angelo delivering her newborn son!" [...] Commenting on the realism of the storyline they added: [...] "Only in the Bay would a baby be born on the beach!" [...] Miller thought it was odd she had then [...] "miraculously lost any signs that she even had a baby." [...] She quipped [...] "already the teen is back to wearing skin-tight dresses!". They later described Nicole and Marilyn's argument over George as [...] "the mother of all rifts" [...] and said [...] "It's exhausting just thinking about it!" [...] Miller later criticised Nicole's career in fashion, after John told her he hated her designs for the Surf Club. She said [...] "I had to agree with him - putting lifesavers in pink polo-neck swimmers is a terrible idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Illmatic {{has been}} noted {{as one of the}} most {{influential}} hip hop albums of all time, with pundits describing it as an archetypal East Coast hip hop album. Jeff Weiss of Pitchfork writes: [...] "No album better reflected the sound and style of New York, 94. The alembic of soul jazz samples, SP-1200s, broken nose breaks, and raw rap distilled the Henny, no chaser ideal of boom bap." [...] Citing Illmatic as part of a string of notable albums released in 1994, David Drake of Stylus Magazine writes [...] "This was the critical point for the East Coast, a time when rappers from the New York area were releasing bucketloads of thrilling work". John Bush of Allmusic compares Illmatic to another DJ Premier production, The Sun Rises in the East (1994), as [...] "one of the quintessential East Coast records". Along with the critical acclaim of the Wu-Tang Clan's debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) (1993) and the success of The Notorious B.I.G.'s debut Ready to Die (1994), Illmatic was also instrumental in restoring interest in the East Coast hip hop scene. [...] "Rarely has the birthplace of hip-hop," [...] wrote Rob Marriott of Complex, [...] "been so unanimous in praise of a rap record and the MC who made it." [...] As Nas later recounted: [...] "It felt amazing to be accepted by New York City in that way...at the time a lot of West Coast hip-hop was selling; East Coast wasn't selling as much, especially for a new artist. So back then you couldn't tell in the sales, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> tell in the streets".|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hart {{also found}} admirers in the Premier League, with several top-flight scouts {{attending}} matches. On 30 November 2005, the Shropshire Star newspaper reported that Everton goalkeeping coach Chris Woods {{had been present}} at Town's previous league match, a 4–3 loss at Rochdale. Manager Gary Peters said [...] "Everton have been to watch him, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say the same about Arsenal, Chelsea and every other team in the Premiership." [...] Speculation about his future continued {{for the duration of}} the season, and with the presence of their goalkeeping coach Tim Flowers at several matches, Manchester City became the most likely of his suitors.|$|E

2500|$|In pre-release {{publicity}} for I have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, Ellison {{said that it}} would be a game [...] "you cannot possibly win". Though the gaming media found that the finished game backed away from this controversial promise, and Sears said that he had convinced Ellison that having a game with only negative endings was a bad idea, in a 2013 interview Ellison insisted that [...] "I created it so you could not win it.

2500|$|In 1995 {{the band}} {{released}} Mirror Mirror, produced by Gouldman, Stewart and Adrian Lee of Mike + The Mechanics, and without participation from Godley or Creme. Despite initial objections by Gouldman, Mirror Mirror included an acoustic version of [...] "I'm Not in Love" [...] {{which became a}} No.29 UK hit single, but overall the album did not fare very well. Gouldman has described Mirror Mirror as [...] "almost like two-halves of an album", largely {{a result of the}} fact that he and Stewart recorded in separate countries. [...] "I don't like to say we hoodwinked the people, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> say it's not quite what it appears to be, and anyone with any sense, who reads the credits, could see that," [...] he told Goldmine magazine.

Predrag Dukic, senior equity sales trader at CM Capital Markets Bolsa, wrote: [...] "The independence movement seeks to paralyze the region with strikes, disobedience, etc., a nightmare scenario for what until yesterday seemed a strong Spanish economic recovery." [...] Markus Schomer, chief global economist at PineBridge Investments, suggested that the uncertainty both in and outside of Spain has made it hard to price the scenarios into final markets so far. Further he commented a strong approval could result in a euro 0.0255% sell off, just as {{in the aftermath of the}} German federal election the previous week. [...] "I don’t think there is an immediate change coming from that referendum. It'll take quite a bit longer to assess where this is going and what this will mean, how the EU will react, how the Spanish government will react. So I don't think you'll see people adjusting their portfolios on Monday, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>could</b> get the classic knee-jerk, risk-off reaction." ...|$|E
