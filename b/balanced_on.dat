5|$|Close to Lakefield and off {{the road}} in their own {{enclosure}} were three dwellings known as Lakefield Cottages. Mr. Rogerson, a gardener and caretaker at Lakefield, lived {{in one of the}} cottages, and eventually his wife's two pedigree Pomeranians– Darkie and Duchess– would become the models for Potter's fictional Duchess. Darkie had a fine black mane, but Duchess was more intelligent and could sit up with a lump of sugar <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> her nose.|$|E
5|$|Pictish stones {{dating from}} the 6th to 9th centuries {{featuring}} what has been dubbed the Pictish Beast may be the earliest representations of a kelpie or kelpie-like creature. Other depictions show kelpies as poolside maidens, as in Draper's 1913 oil on canvas. Thomas Millie Dow had also sketched the kelpie in 1895 as a melancholy dark-haired maiden <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> a rock, a common depiction for artists of the period. Folklorist Nicola Bown has suggested that painters such as Millie Dow and Draper deliberately ignored earlier accounts of the kelpie and reinvented it by altering its sex and nature.|$|E
5|$|The Passing Zone {{made its}} first {{appearance}} during season 1 of America's Got Talent, {{as part of the}} Chicago auditions aired on July 5, 2006. Wee bounced a rubber (prop) bowling ball off of Morse's face ("to make sure you're paying attention"), then climbed onto Morse's shoulders while Morse <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> a Rola Bola long enough for the duo to juggle a total of six flaming torches in unison. The judges' assessments were not unanimous; David Hasselhoff rejected them ("That's the act?!") while Brandy and Piers Morgan wanted to see more.|$|E

40|$|With {{the loss}} of a lower limb, amputees lack the active muscle {{empowered}} control of the ankle that is important for balance control. We examined single-leg stance on prosthesis vs. sound limb <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges in transtibial amputees. When <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb, the lateral displacement of the center of pressure was reduced and was compensated by an increase in counter-rotation. We show that single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb can be compared to <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge. Standing on a prosthetic limb involves the same balance mechanisms as <b>balancing</b> <b>on</b> narrow ridges of 40 -mm to 20 -mm width. Yet, the ability to <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> a narrow ridge with the sound limb was only a weak predictor for an amputee's ability to stand on the prosthetic limb. Balancing in single-leg stance on a prosthetic limb is not a common activity. The ability to compensate with the sound limb may therefore be functionally more important than the ability to stay in dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>on</b> the prosthetic limb. (C) 2016 IPEM.

5|$|The fox {{discovers the}} badger {{asleep in his}} bed, and {{originally}} plans to hit him, but decides against this due to the Badger's teeth. He decides to play a trick upon him involving a pail of water <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> the overhead tester of the bed. Brock however is awake, escapes the trick, and makes tea for himself in the kitchen. Mr. Tod thinks the bucket has killed Tommy and decides to bury him in the tunnel the rabbits have dug, thinking Tommy dug it. When Mr. Tod discovers Tommy in the Kitchen and has tea thrown over him, a violent fight erupts that continues outdoors. The two roll away down the hill still fighting. Benjamin and Peter quickly gather the bunnies, and return home in triumph.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> the top of beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to {{who would be the}} first to break it. After {{punishing}} the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it finally broke. Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

5|$|Tripura {{is noted}} for bamboo and cane handicrafts. Bamboo, wood and cane {{are used to}} create an array of furniture, utensils, {{hand-held}} fans, replicas, mats, baskets, idols and interior decoration materials. Music and dance are integral {{to the culture of}} the state. Some local musical instruments are the sarinda, chongpreng (both string instruments), and sumui (a type of flute). Each indigenous community has its own repertoire of songs and dances performed during weddings, religious occasions, and other festivities. The Tripuri and Jamatia people perform goria dance during the Goria puja. Jhum dance (also called tangbiti dance), lebang dance, mamita dance, and mosak sulmani dance are other Tripuri dance forms. Reang community, the second largest scheduled tribe of the state, is noted for its hojagiri dance that is performed by young girls <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> earthen pitchers. Bizhu dance is performed by the Chakmas during the Bizhu festival (the last day of the month of Chaitra in Hindu calendar). Other dance forms include wangala dance of the Garo people, hai-hak dance of the Halam branch of Kuki people, and sangrai dance and owa dance of the Mog. Alongside such traditional music, mainstream Indian musical elements such as Indian classical music and dance, Rabindra Sangeet are also practised. Sachin Dev Burman, a member of the royal family, was a maestro in the filmi genre of Indian music.|$|E

In 1937 he sketched designs for a shoe hat for Schiaparelli, which she featured in her Fall-Winter 1937-38 collection. The hat, shaped like a woman's high heeled shoe, had the heel standing straight up and the toe tilted over the wearer's forehead. This hat was worn by Gala Dalí, Schiaparelli herself, and by the Franco-American editor of the French Harper's Bazaar, heiress Daisy Fellowes, who was one of Schiaparelli's best clients.|$|E
25|$|Tool use by American {{alligators}} and mugger crocodiles {{has been}} documented. During the breeding season, birds such as herons and egrets look for sticks {{to build their}} nests. Alligators and crocodiles collect sticks to use as bait to catch birds. The crocodilian positions itself near a rookery, partially submerges with the sticks <b>balanced</b> <b>on</b> its head, and when a bird approaches to take the stick, it springs its trap.
