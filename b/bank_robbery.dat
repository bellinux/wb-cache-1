It was shot using a camera that company creator Siegmund Lubin had built back in 1901.|$|E

The opening <b>bank</b> <b>robbery</b> scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one.|$|E

The cameras used for non-IMAX 35mm scenes were Panavision's Panaflex Millennium XL and Platinum.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro.
