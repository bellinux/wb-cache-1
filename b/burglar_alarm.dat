5|$|Jealous of Kim's {{attraction}} to Edward, Jim suggests Edward pick {{the lock on}} his parents' home to obtain a van for Jim and Kim. Edward agrees, but when he picks the lock, a <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> is triggered. Jim flees and Edward is arrested. The police determine that his period of isolation has left Edward without any sense of reality or common sense. Edward takes responsibility for the robbery, telling a surprised Kim he did it because she asked him to. Edward is shunned by the neighborhood except for the Boggs.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescence {{has several}} {{functions}} in different taxa. Haddock et al. (2010) list as {{more or less}} definite functions in marine organisms the following: defensive functions of startle, counterillumination (camouflage), misdirection (smoke screen), distractive body parts, <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> (making predators easier for higher predators to see), and warning to deter settlers; offensive functions of lure, stun or confuse prey, illuminate prey, and mate attraction/recognition. It is much easier for researchers to detect that a species is able to produce light than to analyse the chemical mechanisms or to prove what function the light serves. In some cases the function is unknown, as with species in three families of earthworm (Oligochaeta), such as Diplocardia longa where the coelomic fluid produces light when the animal moves. The following functions are reasonably well established in the named organisms.|$|E

25|$|A <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> {{contains}} sensors {{which are}} connected to a control unit via a low-voltage hardwire or narrowband RF signal {{which is used to}} interact with a response device. The alarm was patented (U.S. patent #9,802) on June 21, 1853, by the Reverend Augustus Russell Pope of Somerville, Massachusetts. As the first person to commercialize Pope's invention, Edwin Holmes acquired Pope's patent rights in 1857 for US$1,500.|$|E

500|$|Like Albert Einstein and Edward Teller, Feynman was a late talker, and by {{his third}} {{birthday}} had yet to utter a single word. He retained a Brooklyn accent as an adult. That accent was thick enough {{to be perceived as}} an affectation or exaggeration – so much so that his good friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a [...] "bum". The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. When he was in grade school, he created a home <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> system while his parents were out for the day running errands.|$|E
500|$|Green was awoken {{some time}} after midnight {{by the sound of}} the home's {{built-in}} fire alarm system. She initially assumed that the sound was a false alarm caused by her dogs triggering the <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm,</b> but when she tried to shut off the alarm at the control panel in her bedroom and it continued sounding, she opened her bedroom door and found smoke in the hallway. She exited the house using a deck that connected to her first-floor bedroom. While standing on the deck, she heard her son Tim on the home's intercom system, calling to ask her what he should do. [...] "He used to be my thirteen-year-old", Green explained to police, and said that she had told him to stay in the house and wait for firefighters to rescue him. She had then knocked on a neighbor's door to ask them to call 9-1-1. When she returned to the house, she found Kate, who had climbed through her second-floor bedroom window, {{on the roof of the}} home's garage. Green called to Kate to jump, and Kate landed safely on the ground in front of Green.|$|E
500|$|The {{next two}} seasons {{were just as}} {{disastrous}} for the team's reputation. Several players, including Wallace, Stoudamire, and Qyntel Woods, were cited for marijuana possession. Woods pleaded guilty to first-degree animal abuse for staging dog fights in his house, some involving his pit bull named Hollywood. Hollywood and Woods' other pit bull, Sugar, were confiscated, and Woods was given eighty hours of community service. He also agreed to donate $10,000 to the Oregon Humane Society. Wallace was suspended for seven games for threatening a referee. Zach Randolph and Patterson got in a fight during practice, with Randolph sucker punching his teammate in the eye, an injury which kept Patterson from making a meaningful contribution during the playoffs. When police came to Stoudamire's house {{to respond to a}} <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm,</b> they noticed the smell of marijuana, searched the premises, and found a pound of cannabis located in a crawlspace; the search was later declared illegal and charges in the matter were dropped. Guard Bonzi Wells famously told Sports Illustrated in a 2002 interview: [...] "We’re not really going to worry about what the hell (the fans) think about us. They really don’t matter to us. They can boo us everyday, but they’re still going to ask for our autographs if they see us on the street. That's why they’re fans, and we’re NBA players." [...] Wells was fined $50,000 by the Blazers for the statement.|$|E

50|$|The police {{receive a}} {{tremendous}} number of false <b>alarms</b> from <b>burglar</b> <b>alarms.</b> In fact the security industry reports that over 98% of such alarms are false ones. Accordingly, the police give very low priority response to <b>burglar</b> <b>alarms</b> {{and can take}} from twenty minutes to two hours to respond to the site. By contrast, the video analytic-detected crime is reported to the central monitoring officer, who verifies with his or her own eyes that it is a real crime in progress.

5000|$|Residential <b>burglar</b> <b>alarms</b> can {{be caused}} by {{improper}} arming and disarming of the system, power outages and weak batteries, wandering pets, and unsecured doors and windows. [...] In the U.S. false alarms cost police agencies up 6.5 million personnel hours, according to the International Association of Chiefs of Police. [...] A 2002 study by the U.S. Justice Department estimated the cost of false alarms to be as high as $1.5 billion.

6000|$|... "Now {{there is}} the history of that burglar alarm--everything just as it happened; nothing extenuated, and naught set down in malice. Yes, sir,--and when I had slept nine years with burglars, and {{maintained}} an expensive <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> the whole time, for their protection, not mine, and at my sole cost--for not a d---d cent could I ever get THEM to contribute--I just said to Mrs. McWilliams that I had had enough of that kind of pie; so with her full consent I took the whole thing out and traded it off for a dog, and shot the dog. I don't know what you think about it, Mr. Twain; but I think those things are made solely {{in the interest of the}} burglars. Yes, sir, a <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> combines in its person all that is objectionable about a fire, a riot, and a harem, and at the same time had none of the compensating advantages, of one sort or another, that customarily belong with that combination. Good-by: I get off here." ...|$|E

"Well, we were {{gradually}} fading {{toward a}} better land, {{on account of}} the daily loss of sleep; so we finally had the expert up again, and he ran a wire to the outside of the door, and placed a switch there, whereby Thomas, the butler, always made one little mistake--he switched the alarm off at night when he went to bed, and switched it on again at daybreak in the morning, {{just in time for the}} cook to open the kitchen door, and enable that gong to slam us across the house, sometimes breaking a window with one or the other of us. At the end of a week we recognized that this switch business was a delusion and a snare. We also discovered that a band of burglars had been lodging in the house the whole time--not exactly to steal, for there wasn't much left now, but to hide from the police, for they were hot pressed, and they shrewdly judged that the detectives would never think of a tribe of burglars taking sanctuary in a house notoriously protected by the most imposing and elaborate <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> in America.|$|E

One winter's night we were flung out of bed by the sudden music of that awful gong, and when we hobbled to the annunciator, turned up the gas, and saw the word 'Nursery' exposed, Mrs. McWilliams fainted dead away, and I came {{precious}} near {{doing the same thing}} myself. I seized my shotgun, and stood timing the coachman whilst that appalling buzzing went on. I knew that his gong had flung him out, too, and that he would be along with his gun as soon as he could jump into his clothes. When I judged that the time was ripe, I crept to the room next the nursery, glanced through the window, and saw the dim outline of the coachman in the yard below, standing at present-arms and waiting for a chance. Then I hopped into the nursery and fired, and in the same instant the coachman fired at the red flash of my gun. Both of us were successful; I crippled a nurse, and he shot off all my back hair. We turned up the gas, and telephoned for a surgeon. There was not a sign of a burglar, and no window had been raised. One glass was absent, but that was where the coachman's charge had come through. Here was a fine mystery--a <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm</b> 'going off' at midnight of its own accord, and not a burglar in the neighborhood! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not go}} {{one single}} cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twain--not a single cent--and I will tell you why. When we were {{finishing}} our house, we found {{we had a little}} cash left over, on account of the plumber not knowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I was always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no, let's have a <b>burglar</b> <b>alarm.</b> I agreed to this compromise. I will explain that whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing, and we decide upon the thing that Mrs. McWilliams wants--as we always do--she calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New York and put in the alarm, and charged three hundred and twenty-five dollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now. So we did for awhile--say a month. Then one night we smelled smoke, and I was advised to get up and see what the matter was. I lit a candle, and started toward the stairs, and met a burglar coming out of a room with a basket of tinware, which he had mistaken for solid silver in the dark. He was smoking a pipe. I said, 'My friend, we do not allow smoking in this room.' He said he was a stranger, and could not be expected to know the rules of the house: said he had been in many houses just as good as this one, and it had never been objected to before. He added that as far as his experience went, such rules had never been considered to apply to burglars, anyway.|$|E
