As for students social software is also a vehicle for teachers learning about technology innovations that emerge from design research and human innovation. The evaluative research on how these innovations <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> practice tends <b>to</b> lag behind the innovation itself. There is, however, {{a growing body of}} work on the student experience to ascertain what is appropriate and likely to be effective.|$|R

The paper suggests a Penrosian inspired frame {{to the study of}} innovation systems by analysing path creation dynamics. By combining the analysis of attention rules and search rules we get an explanation of how positive and negative heuristics are formed and consequently how technological trajectories evolve, <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> and come <b>to</b> constitute central elements of innovation systems. Using nanotechnology as a case the paper focuses on how the innovation system is seeding trajectories.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a repetition}} of a study presented in Suchman's book Plans and Situated Actions. There have been complaints {{about the lack of}} replication studies <b>in</b> disciplines related <b>to</b> CSCW (particularly Software Engineering and HCI). However, these complaints often <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> wider attempts <b>to</b> install a principled scientific method within these disciplines. Plans and Situated Actions was not a scientific text but drew upon naturalistic analysis. This paper shows there is value in recreating Plans and Situated Actions, and argues {{it would be helpful to}} recreate other studies. However, such repetition does not and need not constitute a scientific replication. The paper argues that while repetition and reanalysis may improve rigour in computing research, this need not be with a view to making it more scientific...|$|R
40|$|Different {{research}} perspectives, contexts, and competencies {{almost certainly}} result in individual researchers interpreting data in different, sometimes radically different ways, {{and it is}} simply not credible to expect a single researcher or research group to gain the full potential from a given data set. Shared data thus represent an untapped resource of significant potential and, if the scientific community is to benefit to the full, it is essential that effective data conservation and sharing practices <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> mainstream research. <b>To</b> this end, EP 2 DC is a prototype EPrints module designed to support the submission of experimental data sets together with the manuscript to which they correspond. Its development recognises the worth and potential for reuse of high quality research data, and is consistent with trends in scientific publishing and funding agency policies that advocate a more responsible approach to conserving research data...|$|R

It contrasts the right to identity to the right <b>to</b> privacy <b>in</b> {{the context of a}} national identity scheme, and defines identity theft and its consequences. The analysis and findings are relevant to the one proposed for the United Kingdom, to other countries which have similar schemes, and to countries like Australia who have the long term goal of establishing one. Under a national identity scheme, being asked to provide ‘ID’ will become as commonplace as being asked one’s name, and the concept of identity will <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> processes essential <b>to</b> the national economic and social order. The analysis reveals {{the emergence of a new}} legal concept of identity. This emergent concept and the associated individual rights, including the right to identity, potentially change the legal and commercial landscape...|$|R
40|$|A {{story about}} a secretary, a mechanic, and a {{typewriter}} as told in a company provides the starting-point for this paper. With the story in mind we then discuss two lines of thought which arise from it: (1) Gender, stereotypes and unity, (2) Gender, stereotypes, and technology. Gender is an important common denominator and gives a feeling of 'us-ness' in the heterogeneous world that a large company represents. At the organizational level and at the general societal level, male unity can bridge cultural heterogeneity and hierarchical distances. Stereotyped images of women affect the way male R and D workers think and, ultimately, also the way technical artifacts are designed. We intend to describe how gender images <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> machines, and <b>to</b> indicate some of the negative results of this as manifest {{in the development of}} the typewriter. Our conclusion is that superior corporate male thinking and behaviour do not pay off in the long run.

40|$|Property tax {{incentives}} or selective waivers {{have been used}} extensively in Ireland in the last 25 years to stimulate property development and investment for urban regeneration. This paper investigates their prolonged use and examines their contributory role in the property crash and resulting financial crisis in 2008. Prolonged interventions can result in extensive distortion of property market operations. As a result, interventions aimed at revitalising a failing market <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> market processes <b>to</b> {{the extent that they}} may contribute to a more general subsequent market failure. This paper examines the recent experience in the use of {{tax incentives}} in urban regeneration in Dublin during the period 1986 – 2011. The effects of the property- and area-based tax incentive schemes initiated under the Finance Act of 1986 and Urban Renewal Act of 1986 are examined. The paper provides an overview of the benefits, costs, and impacts of the incentives from an urban development market perspective. The tax schemes are examined in terms of the rationale for their introduction and their effectiveness in operation from the public exchequer perspective. This examination is placed in the context of current debates on urban regeneration and the use of fiscal incentives in an international perspective. <b>In</b> order <b>to</b> gain insight into the specific performance of the incentives <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> policy objectives, selected interviews were carried out to obtain the opinions of policy makers and planning interests...|$|R
40|$|Purple loosestrife was {{introduced}} to North America from Europe and Asia <b>in</b> the early <b>to</b> mid 1800 ’s. The seeds were carried in ship ballast and on livestock that were brought to this country for trade. Purple loosestrife was widely cultivated for its ornamental and pharmacological values. But this species can invade wetland habitats and result in negative im-pacts on the ecosystem. Such ecosystem effects include altered detritus decomposition and nutrient cycling. Also, purple loosestrife may displace native plant species, forming dense monotypic stands that reduce native plant species richness and diversity. Purple loosestrife has little value for wildlife as few species utilize the plant for a food source or shelter. Regulations Purple loosestrife is not listed as a federal noxious weed. It is listed as a state noxious weed in Arkansas and South Carolina, and a Class B noxious weed in Alabama and North Carolina. It is widely recognized as an invasive weed of wetlands. Description Vegetative growth Purple loosestrife is a perennial species that over-winters as a stem base. Plants are composed of numerous angled stems that grow to over 6 feet. The leaves are lance shaped with fine hairs, and are attached directly to the stems with-out petioles. Leaves can be opposite, whorled, or spiraled around the stem. Flowering/fruiting Purple flowers occur in axillary clusters that form a spike inflorescence. Each flower has 5 - 7 narrow, wrinkled purple pet-als. Flowering begins in late June and continues through September. It {{has been suggested that}} purple loosestrife can draw pollinators away from native plants, which may aid in this plants prolific seed production. A mature multi-stemmed plant, 1. 5 - 6 feet in height, may produce between two and three million seeds that can remain viable in the soil for many years. It takes approximately eight weeks from germination for purple loosestrife to flower. Dispersal mechanisms Seed move by drifting in moving water. Long-distance transport occurs when seeds <b>become</b> <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> mud adhering <b>to</b> wildlife, livestock, humans, and vehicles. The weed spreads vegetatively by detached shoot and rootstock fragments...|$|R
