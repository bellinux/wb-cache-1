5|$|The North {{is known}} for its often crumbly cheeses, of which Cheshire cheese is the {{earliest}} example. Unlike Southern cheeses like Cheddar, Northern cheeses typically use uncooked milk and a pre-salted curd pressed under enormous weights, resulting in a moist, sharp-tasting cheese. Wensleydale, another crumbly cheese, is unusual in that it is often served as a side to sweet cakes, which are themselves well represented in Northern England. Parkin, an oatmeal cake with <b>black</b> <b>treacle</b> and ginger, is a traditional treat across the North on Bonfire Night, and the fruity scone-like singing hinny and fat rascal are popular in the North East and Yorkshire respectively.|$|E
25|$|The town {{is known}} for {{gingerbread}} biscuits which were first made in 1740 by William Eggleston. Eggleston, a baker by trade, was a producer of a biscuit called Grantham Whetstones. Whetsones were a rusk like dry biscuit enjoyed locally and also by coach drivers who used to stop in Grantham to change their horses whilst travelling on the Great North road. According to folklore, Egglestone, whilst baking whetsones in his dimly lit kitchen one morning, mistook one ingredient for another, resulting in a ginger-like biscuit {{to emerge from the}} oven. The mistake was a huge success and the biscuit became established as Grantham gingerbread, known as a white gingerbread because it is not made with molasses or <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b> This provides a delicate ginger flavour, rich in butter, with a domed top that has a crackled surface. The centre is hollow and resembles a honeycomb.|$|E
50|$|Treacle mining is the fictitious mining of treacle, {{similar to}} {{molasses}} in a raw form similar to coal. The subject purports to {{be a serious}} topic, but is in fact an attempt to test the credulity of the reader. The thick <b>black</b> nature of <b>treacle</b> makes the deception plausible. The topic has been a standing joke in British humor for a century or more.|$|R

60|$|Two {{or three}} men, looking little and black like monkeys, leapt {{over the edge}} as they had done and dropped on to the beach. These came {{ploughing}} down the deep sand, shouting horribly, and strove to wade into the sea at random. The example was followed, and the whole black mass of men began to run and drip over the edge like <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b>|$|E

50|$|Treacle is any uncrystallised syrup {{made during}} the {{refining}} of sugar. The most common forms of treacle are golden syrup, a pale variety, and a darker variety known as <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b> <b>Black</b> <b>treacle,</b> or molasses, has a distinctively strong, slightly bitter flavour, and a richer colour than golden syrup. Golden syrup treacle is a common sweetener and condiment in British cookery, found in such dishes as treacle tart and treacle sponge pudding.|$|E
5000|$|Muscovado sugar can be {{substituted}} for brown sugar in most recipes by slightly reducing the liquid content of the recipe. A substitute for muscovado {{can be made by}} mixing white sugar with molasses (<b>black</b> <b>treacle)</b> at a ration of about 1:10 by weight.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{ingredients of}} a Yorkshire parkin are oatmeal, flour, <b>black</b> <b>treacle</b> (similar to molasses), fat (traditionally lard, but modern recipes use butter or margarine), and ginger. Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Yorkshire parkin, whilst Lancashire Parkin is baked using Golden Syrup and extra sugar.|$|E

50|$|In the North West of England, however, veda {{bread is}} {{something}} quite different: a sweet, sticky loaf made with <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b> It is eaten sliced, dry, or with butter or margarine. The molasses in the treacle help {{to preserve the}} mixture, and veda bread connoisseurs will leave a freshly baked loaf for several weeks in a closed cake tin to allow the flavours to mature before they eat it.|$|E
50|$|Many {{households}} {{have their own}} recipe for Christmas pudding, some handed down through families for generations. Essentially the recipe brings together what traditionally were expensive or luxurious ingredients — notably the sweet spices that are so important in developing its distinctive rich aroma, and usually made with suet. It is very dark in appearance — effectively black — {{as a result of}} the dark sugars and <b>black</b> <b>treacle</b> in most recipes, and its long cooking time. The mixture can be moistened with the juice of citrus fruits, brandy and other alcohol (some recipes call for dark beers such as mild, stout or porter).|$|E
50|$|Molasses, or <b>black</b> <b>treacle</b> (British, {{for human}} consumption; known as {{molasses}} otherwise), is a viscous product resulting from refining sugarcane or sugar beets into sugar. Molasses varies by amount of sugar, method of extraction, {{and age of}} plant. Sugarcane molasses is agreeable in taste and aroma, and is primarily used for sweetening and flavoring foods in U.S., Canada and elsewhere, while sugar beet molasses is foul-smelling and unpalatable, so it is mainly used as an animal feed additive in Europe and Russia, where it is chiefly produced. Molasses is a defining component of fine commercial brown sugar.|$|E
5000|$|A {{traditional}} Cornish fisherman's celebratory drink is [...] "Mahogany", {{made from}} two parts local gin—now usually Plymouth Gin—mixed with one part <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b> In chapter 7 of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the Dormouse {{tells a story}} of Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie living {{at the bottom of}} a well, which confuses Alice, who interrupts to ask what they ate for sustenance. [...] "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, 'It was a treacle-well.'" [...] This is an allusion to the so-called [...] "treacle well", the curative St. Frideswide's Well at Binsey, Oxfordshire.|$|E
5000|$|From about 1830 to 1900, bonfire toffee {{was quite}} popular in Yorkshire. In the 1890s, it was {{sometimes}} called [...] "Tom Trot." [...] Bonfire toffee was usually a homemade confectionery. Although industrial manufacturing of confectionery {{had begun in}} the 1840s, the price of <b>black</b> <b>treacle</b> in the 1890s and {{first decade of the}} 20th century often rose above the price of sugar which made store-bought toffee too expensive for many. Even in the 1960s, it was common from older people in a neighbourhood to make bonfire toffee to hand out to children on Guy Fawkes Night.|$|E
5000|$|Bonfire toffee (also {{known as}} treacle toffee, Plot toffee, or Tom Trot) is a hard, brittle toffee {{associated}} with Halloween and Guy Fawkes Night (also known as [...] "Bonfire Night") in the United Kingdom. The toffee tastes very strongly of molasses (<b>black</b> <b>treacle),</b> and cheap versions {{can be quite}} bitter. In Scotland, the treat is known as claggum, with less sweet versions known as clack. In Wales, it is known as loshin du. (losin du or taffi triog). The flavour {{is similar to that}} of butterscotch, although it is a toffee and never a viscous liquid.|$|E
5000|$|Parkin or Perkin is a {{gingerbread}} cake traditionally {{made with}} oatmeal and <b>black</b> <b>treacle,</b> which originated in northern England. Often associated with Yorkshire, particularly the Leeds area, [...] {{it is very}} widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November, but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas.|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Suck It and See" [...] tells a {{narrative}} {{story of a}} biker (drummer Matt Helders) and his relationship with a lover, portrayed by American model Breana McDow, who briefly appears partially nude in the video. The video is set in California and mocks the macho nature of American biker culture. It has also been suggested that the video is a tongue-in-cheek response to criticism that the band's sound has become too [...] "Americanised". Alex Turner briefly appears in a cameo. The biker's storyline is continued in the <b>Black</b> <b>Treacle,</b> Evil Twin and arguably the R U Mine? video.|$|E

5000|$|The paper mills around Maidstone in Kent {{were known}} as [...] "The Tovil Treacle Mines" [...] by locals, after the area {{where one of the}} mills owned by Albert E. Reed was situated. The company helped the myth with a float in Maidstone {{carnival}} with a [...] "treacle mine" [...] theme. One suggested source of the story in this area is a rumour that the paper industry was threatened during the Second World War because there was no imported timber. Fermentation of straw was tried, creating a sticky goo. There were attempts to make paper from other than rags in the 19th century and an early commercial success was achieved by Samuel Hook and his son, Charles Townsend Hook, using straw at Upper Tovil Mill in the 1850s. The road next to Upper Tovil Mill became known, and was later named, as Straw Mill Hill. To produce pulp, the straw was cooked in hot alkali. After separation of the fibre, the remaining liquid looked like <b>black</b> <b>treacle.</b> Upper Tovil Mill closed in the 1980s and the site was used for a housing estate.|$|E
