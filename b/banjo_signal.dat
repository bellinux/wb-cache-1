The others are on display at the Baltimore and Ohio Museum and the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the <b>banjo</b> <b>signal</b> was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in interlocking plants. Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|E
