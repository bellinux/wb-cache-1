5000|$|Standard: Collings Archtops {{come with}} a lower <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> of 16", 17", and 18". Based on the {{earliest}} American f-hole archtops of the 1920s, the 16" [...] archtops are a rarity among modern archtop models {{in that they are}} designed to be played as acoustic guitars.|$|E
5000|$|Worldwide, the L-5 was {{the first}} guitar to feature f-holes. Then as well as today, the {{construction}} of the L-5 is similar in construction, carving, bracing and tap-tuning, to building a cello. This guitar as well as the cello are similarly designed in order to amplify and project the acoustic vibration of strings throughout carved and tuned woods, using f-holes as the projection points. From 1922 to 1934 the L-5 was produced with a 16" [...] lower <b>bout</b> <b>width.</b> In 1934 the lower bout was increased to 17" [...] - and this width is still used today. Also released in 1934 was the one-inch larger 18" [...] archtop guitar named the [...] "L5 Super" [...] which in a couple years was renamed the [...] "Super 400". These two master-built acoustic guitars are Gibson's top-of-the-line carved wood and highly ornate archtop instruments. These guitars cannot be constructed quickly, nor can corners be cut, and their price does mirror this fact. The time, skilled workmanship and materials used in these builds has been delivered non-stop for the past 90+ years. Since the 1930s there have been several other 17" [...] archtops designed by Gibson, including variations introduced as more-affordable less ornately decorated models - these were introduced to consider the budgets of musicians.|$|E
40|$|There is an {{implicit}} assumption in cited literature on precision agriculture (PA) that spreading of fertiliser is performed perfectly {{in the field}} leading to uniform application, this is not true. Variation can be large and often the actual performance of spreading equipment used has never been measured or verified. In various {{countries around the world}} there are quality assurance (QA) systems designed to achieve a prescribed level of performance. Even within these QA schemes limited testing is undertaken and always under perfect or near perfect conditions. The test methods are designed to establish an acceptable <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> which meets an acceptable evenness of spread if driven accurately. The test {{does not take into account}} wind conditions (except for requiring less than 15 kmhr- 1 for testing), humidity, slope, terrain or the instrumentation to maintain the desired <b>bout</b> <b>width.</b> This paper examines the effect of the farm environment and the physical characteristics of fertilisers on the spread patterns of fertilisers in the field. Fertilisers with heterogeneous particle size distributions proved to have more robust spread patterns under field conditions than those with homogeneous particle size distributions...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} X(4260) and X(4360) solving Faddeev Equation under the Fixed Center Approximation. We find {{a state of}} I = 1 with mass around 4320 MeV and a <b>width</b> <b>bout</b> 25 MeV for the case of ρ meson {{scattering}} from X(3700) (DD̄) and 4256 MeV and a width about 30 MeV of D̄ scattering from D 1 (2420) (ρD). The results obtained in present work are in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|Body: In {{its more}} {{traditional}} construction {{the body is}} a bit shorter overall, and narrower at the bouts than the guitar, but also somewhat deeper. Typical dimensions are: length 45-50 cm; <b>width</b> (upper <b>bout)</b> 23-24 cm; <b>width</b> (lower <b>bout)</b> 29-30 cm; depth 11-12 cm. [...] Many models have a simple sound hole (8-9 cm), although some specimens show highly decorative rosettes. The bridge frequently has showy extensions called [...] "daggers" [...] that extend along the top. On each upper bout are two [...] "auxiliary" [...] tuning machines, for tuning the four outlying strings (two {{on each side of}} the neck). These outlying strings are known as [...] "diablitos" [...] (lit. [...] "little devils"), [...] "tiples" [...] (trebles), or simply, [...] "Devils".|$|R
40|$|Major agronomic and {{economic}} losses {{are caused by}} inaccurate application of nutrients from ground based spreading vehicles. These losses come from both over and under application of fertiliser resulting from such practices as driving at inappropriate bout widths. This work reviewed current spreader testing procedures; compared the performance of international test methodologies and evaluated {{the use of a}} digital image processing program to perform spreader testing. Methods to evaluate field performance were developed; this analysis of field application was used to calculate the economic effect of using precision agricultural technologies in New Zealand dairy farming systems. A matrix of fourteen hundred 0. 5 x 0. 5 m fertiliser collection trays was used to evaluate individual test methodologies. Results indicated that there were major variations in calculated certifiable <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> between different methods and direct comparison should be avoided. Tray layout within ± 5 m of the centre spread line had the largest effect on calculated <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> whilst methods that incorporated rows of trays in the longitudinal direction were less variable compared to those using a single transverse test. The probability too accurately assign bout widths using different international test methods was analysed, the ACCU Spread (Australia) test method had the highest level of confidence in its <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> calculation followed by the ES (Europe) test method. The ISO(i) (World), ISO(ii) (World) and Spreadmark (NZ) tests were all found to be comparable to one another whilst the ASAE (USA) method had the lowest level of confidence in its <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> calculation because of wide collector tray spacing. A method to extract a wider range of data from spreader tests using a hybrid image processing system was developed. Results indicated that there was a strong relationship between two dimensional particle area and particle mass under laboratory (R 2 = 0. 991) and field (R 2 = 0. 988) conditions. Although transverse spreader tests provided a good indication of machine performance, they did not account for the interaction of the spreader and its operational environment. A method was developed that used the vehicle location during field application and the transverse spread pattern represented as polygons to create field application maps. Initial results showed large variations compared to the measured transverse spread pattern. A wider study over 102 paddocks on four dairy farms showed that average variation was 37. 9 %. An improvement to the field application method discussed is given; this tool used the geographical position, heading angle and a series of static spread pattern tests from the spreading vehicle to achieve greater accuracy in field measurements. The described field application methods were used to assess the ability to execute a nutrient plan using both actual and optimised spreading data collected during field application. A loss of $ 66. 18 ha- 1 was calculated when comparing the efficiency of using current spreading methods to those assumed in nutrient budgeting practice. If a guidance and control system were used correctly to provide optimised field application the loss could be reduced to $ 46. 41 ha- 1. This work highlighted the difficulties in achieving accurate field nutrient application; however, by developing the ability to quantify field performance, economic opportunities could be evaluated. Overall, this work found that there was a strong agronomic {{and economic}} case for the implementation of precision agricultural technologies in the New Zealand fertiliser industry. However, the current range of equipment used by the spreading industry would have difficulty in delivering these benefits...|$|E
40|$|Background Early in {{a season}} the crop covers only part of total field area. Treating that area uniformly can {{therefore}} be wasteful. An ability to differentiate between crop rows and inter-row spaces would provide opportunities for increased treatment efficacy, reduced environmental impact and reduced input costs. Banded treatments on, or between crop rows, requires a level of precision {{that is difficult to}} achieve in practice. So, despite the potential advantages inter-row cultivation and band spraying are limited to use in high value crops. Recent advances pioneered by some of the consortium partners now offer automatic guidance systems for inter-row cultivation. These are currently used in intensive vegetable production and by those growing cereals organically. They offer enhanced accuracy, higher forward speeds and reduced driver fatigue compared to manual systems. Whilst helpful, the science behind these developments has limitations with respect to work rate. In particular the need for inter-row hoes to match drill <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> makes such systems uneconomic for conventional cereal producers.

40|$|The {{particle}} size range specifications for two biosolids-derived organomineral fertilizers (OMF) known as OMF 10 (10 : 4 : 4) and OMF 15 (15 : 4 : 4) were established. Such specifications will enable field application of OMF with spinning disc systems using conventional tramlines spacing. A theoretical model was developed, which predicts the trajectory of individual fertilizer particles off-the-disc. The drag coefficient (Cd) was estimated for small time steps (10 - 6 s) in the trajectory of the particle {{as a function of}} the Reynolds number. For the range of initial velocities (20 to 40 m s- 1), release angles (0 Â° to 10 Â°) and particle densities (1000 to 2000 kg m- 3) investigated, the analysis showed that OMF 10 and OMF 15 need to have particle diameters between 1. 10 and 5. 80 mm, and between 1. 05 and 5. 50 mm, respectively, to provide similar spreading performance to urea with {{particle size}} range of 1. 00 to 5. 25 mm in diameter. OMF 10 and OMF 15 should have 80 % (by weight) of particles between 2. 65 and 4. 30 mm, and between 2. 55 and 4. 10 mm, respectively. Due to the physical properties of the material, disc designs and settings that enable working at a specified <b>bout</b> <b>width</b> by providing a small upward particle trajectory angle (e. g., 10 Â°) are preferred to high rotational velocities. However, field application of OMF with spinning discs applicators may be restricted to tramlines spaced at a maximum of 24 m; particularly, when some degree of overlapping is required between two adjacent bouts. The performance of granular fertilizers can be predicted based on properties of the material, such as particle density and size range, using the contour plots developed in this study...|$|E
