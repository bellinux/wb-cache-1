Different repair techniques are available, with distinctive level of intrusion, but the substitution of the damaged part with a solid wood prosthesis is a methodology well accepted.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the expression {{and distribution of}} keratinocyte growth factor (FGF) (FGF- 7) and its receptor (KGFR) during reepithelialization of human skin. KGF mRNA levels increased rapidly by 8 - 10 -fold and remained elevated for several days. In contrast, KGFR transcript levels decreased early but were significantly elevated by 8 - 9 d. A KGF-immunoglobulin G fusion protein (KGF-HFc), which specifically and sensitively detects the KGFR, localized the receptor to differentiating keratinocytes of control epidermis, but revealed a striking decrease in receptor protein expression during the intermediate period of reepithelization. Suramin, which blocked KGF <b>binding</b> and <b>stripped</b> already bound KGF from its receptor, failed to unmask KGFRs in tissue sections from the intermediate phase of wound repair. The absence of KGFR protein despite increased KGFR transcript levels implies functional receptor downregulation {{in the presence of}} increased KGF.

40|$|Apart {{the winter}} period, the {{activity}} in specialized agricultural cultivations (i. e. wine- and fruit-growing) is distributed {{for a long}} period of the year. Some tasks, such as pesticide distribution, are repeated several times during the growing season. On the other hand, mechanization is one of the pillars on which is based the modern agriculture management. As a consequence, in wine growing the tractor driver has to be considered a worker potentially subjected to high level of vibrations, due to the poor machinery conditions often encountered, and sometimes to the rough soil surface of the vineyard combined with the high travelling speed adopted in carrying out many operations. About vibrations, the Italian Decree 81 / 08 basically refers to the European Directive 2002 / 44 /CE, that provides some very strict limits of exposure, both for whole body and hand-arm districts. In Oltrepo pavese, a large hilly area located the south part of the Pavia province (Lombardy - Italy) wine growing is the main agricultural activity; for this reason, a detailed survey on the vibration levels recorded at the tractor driver’s seat was carried out, in order to ascertain the real risk to which the operators are exposed. The activity in wine growing has been classified into 6 groups of similar tasks, as follows: 1. canopy management: pruning, trimming, <b>binding,</b> <b>stripping,</b> etc.; 2. soil management: harrowing, hoeing, subsoiling etc.; 3. inter-row management: chopping of pruning, pinching, grass mowing, etc.; 4. crop protection: pesticides and fungicides distribution, sulfidation, foliar fertilization, etc.; 5. grape harvesting: manual or mechanical; 6. transport: from the vineyard to the cellar. For each group of tasks, the vibration levels on 3 the traditional axes (x, y and z) were recorded, and then an exposure time was calculated for each of them, in order to ascertain the risk level in comparison to what provided by the dedicated standard. Finally, a detailed study was conducted on the most dangerous working conditions, with the goal to offer solutions able to reduce the overall exposure, as improving the comfort level, as to shorten the working time when possible and/or to provide suitable periods of rest...|$|R
40|$|A master {{equation}} {{approach to}} the kinetics of co-operative ligand binding reactions in proteins is developed. As a specific example, equations based on the Perutz description are applied to several reactions of hemoglobin, both in the absence and {{in the presence of}} organic phosphates. The observed time dependence of 0, <b>binding</b> to <b>stripped</b> hemoglobin is fitted with a total of four parameters, of which two are held fixed at values determined from the experimentally measured rate constants for the last step of ligand binding. An analysis of Gibson’s data (1970 a) for oxygen-binding kinetics of unstripped hemoglobin shows that phosphate binding not only stabilizes the deoxy quaternary conformation of hemoglobin but also increases both the strength of the quaternary conformational constraints and the kinetic time scaling parameter for the deoxy quaternary conformation. A single set of five parameters is used to fit the deoxygenation data of Salhany et al. (1970) in the presence of varying concentrations of PzGlyc 8. The five para meters are determined by fitting the theory to the data in the absence of P,Gly...|$|R

40|$|Ankyrin-band 3 {{bridge is}} {{believed}} to {{play a critical role}} in maintaining membrane stability and red blood cell morphology. This work demonstrates that D 3 -D 4 repeats of ankyrin interact with cdb 3 with a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 monomer to monomer, in solution. In a separate assay using his-tagged cdb 3 dimer along with a 125 I-labeled cdb 3 dimer we showed that a D 3 -D 4 ankyrin fragment is capable of bridging two cdb 3 dimers suggesting an existence of tetramer species of band 3 maintained in a solution by only two of the four subdomains of ankyrin involved in the membrane binding. ^ Oxygenation state of the red blood cell has been shown to modulate critical functions in the erythrocytes such as membrane transport, glycolysis and glycolitic enzyme binding to membrane. Little is known about the effect of oxygenation on membrane-cytoskeleton interactions. We report here that deoxygenation of RBCs leads to the reduction of ankyrin <b>binding</b> to <b>stripped</b> inside-out-vesicles. Furthermore, ankyrin retains its membrane localization while displaying increased accessibility in deoxygenated erythrocytes. ^ A beta-hairpin loop comprising residues 175 - 185 of the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 was shown in vitro to be a major ankyrin binding site on the erythrocyte membrane. We showed that a surgical deletion of this region of band 3 in transgenic mice was enough to ablate ankyrin binding to murine erythrocyte membranes while retaining a biconcave cellular morphology. Clearly, the ankyrin-band 3 linkage is not a requirement for maintenance of membrane stability and red cell morphology. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{agricultural}} by-products of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus) {{were investigated}} {{to determine their}} potential use {{for the removal of}} lead(II), copper(II), cadmium(II), zinc(II) chromium(VI) and chromium(III) ions from contaminated aqueous solutions. Results have shown a pH dependent binding trend from pH 2 to 6, with the maximum binding taking place around pH 5. 0. Time dependency experiments showed a rapid adsorption of lead(II), copper(II), cadmium(II), zinc(II), and chromium(III) ion within the first five to fifteen minutes. Binding capacity experiments produced a significant binding for lead(II) and measurable amounts for copper(II), cadmium(II), zinc(II) and chromium(III), calculated as milligram of metals per gram of the biomass. Results showed that after 3 cycles of metal <b>binding</b> and <b>stripping</b> with 0. 5 M sodium citrate, the binding ability of the immobilized hop biomass for Pb(II), Cr(III), Cu(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II) did not decrease. Comparison studies were performed with ion-exchange resins, including carboxylic, sulfonic and phosphate functional groups. Studies performed with hop leaves and stems showed that this biomass is potentially useful for removing heavy metals from aqueous waste solutions. However, there is no information about the functional groups involved in the biosorption of Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II) and Cr(III) to hop biomass. Thus, experiments were performed to establish how the modification of chemical groups possessed by hop biomass changes the binding ability. The treatments included native, esterified, and hydrolyzed hop leaves and stems biomasses. It was observed that the hydrolization of the biomass significantly increased the binding ability to the metals, while esterification of carboxyl functional group significantly decreased the biosorption of Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II) and Cr(III). ^ Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) studies were utilized in order to understand and validate of the mechanisms by which these metals bind to the hop biomass. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) were used to investigate the binding mechanism of heavy metals to hop biomass. Overall, these studies indicated that carboxyl functional groups {{play a critical role in}} the biosorption of lead(II), copper(II), cadmium(II), zinc(II) and chromium(III) by hop leaves and stems biomass.

40|$|The {{concentration}} of multiplication stimulating activity (MSA), an insulinlike growth factor (IGF), {{is high in}} fetal rat serum. We now report that MSA is exclusively associated wth an albumin-size binding protein in fetal rat serum; the growth hormone-dependent, gamma globulin-size binding protein, which predominates in the older animal, is absent from fetal rat serum. When 125 I-MSA was incubated with fetal rat serum and then gel filtered on Sephadex G- 200, specific radioactivity eluted in the void volume (peak I) and the albumin region (peak III); by contrast, specific radioactivity eluted mainly in the gamma globulin region (peak II) in adult rat serum. Pools of the Sephadex G- 200 fractions were chromatographed on Sephadex G- 50, in 1 M acetic acid, to separate the binding protein from IGF activity. Analysis of IGF activity by chick embryo fibroblast bioassay, competitive protein binding assay, and MSA by radioimmunoassay revealed that all the IGF activity and MSA in fetal rat serum resided in peak III. Measurement of MSA binding capacity of the <b>stripped</b> <b>binding</b> protein by Scatchard analysis demonstrated {{that the majority of}} binding capacity also was found in peak III in fetal rat serum; most of MSA binding capacity was in peak II in adult rat serum. In fetal rat sera, in addition to the peak III binding protein, which is the major carrier of endogenous MSA, there is a component in peak I capable of specifically binding 125 I-MSA. This component elutes as a single species from a Sepharose- 6 B column. As MSA associated with peak III gradually declined in early neonatal life, peak II-associated IGF activity measured by chick embryo fibroblast bioassay showed a rise of activity with a peak at 5 d of neonatal life, a nadir at 20 d, with an increase again to attain adult levels. These studies demonstrate that the MSA binding protein in the fetus is different from the growth hormone-dependent binding protein in adult life...|$|R
