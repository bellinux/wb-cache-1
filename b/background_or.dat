5|$|Camouflage is the {{concealment}} {{of animals}} or objects of military interest by {{any combination of}} methods that helps them to remain unnoticed.

5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} <b>background</b> <b>or</b> sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious reader with an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's <b>background</b> <b>or</b> family before 1087. Later in life he was {{involved}} in founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E
5|$|Motion {{camouflage}} is camouflage {{which provides}} a degree of concealment for a moving object, given that motion makes objects easy to detect however well their coloration matches their <b>background</b> <b>or</b> breaks up their outlines. The principal form of motion camouflage, and the type generally meant by the term, involves an attacker's mimicking the optic flow of the background as seen by its target. This enables the attacker to approach the target while appearing to remain stationary from the target's perspective, unlike in classical pursuit. The attacker chooses its flight path so as {{to remain on the}} line between the target and some landmark point. The target therefore does not see the attacker move from the landmark point. The only visible evidence that the attacker is moving is its looming, the change in size as the attacker approaches. Motion is also used in a variety of other camouflage strategies, including swaying to mimic plant movements in the wind or ocean currents.|$|E
5|$|Sanger {{returned}} to the United States in October 1915. She planned to open a birth control clinic modeled on the world's first such clinic, which she had visited in Amsterdam. She first had to fight the charges outstanding against her.Kennedy, p. 77. Noted attorney Clarence Darrow offered to defend Sanger free of charge but, bowing to public pressure, the government dropped the charges early in 1916.Sanger, Autobiography, pp. 183–189.Engelman, p. 61–62: Sanger also gained sympathy from the public when her five-year-old daughter died immediately before the trial. No longer under the threat of jail, Sanger embarked on a successful cross-country speaking tour, which catapulted her into {{the leadership of the}} U.S. birth control movement. Other leading figures, such as William J. Robinson and Mary Dennett, chose to work in the <b>background,</b> <b>or</b> turned their attention to other causes. Later in 1916, Sanger traveled to Boston to lend her support to the Massachusetts Birth Control League and to jailed birth control activist Van Kleeck Allison.|$|E

5|$|The Boggs' {{neighbors are}} curious about their new house guest, and the Boggs throw a {{neighborhood}} barbecue welcoming Edward. Most {{of the neighbors}} are fascinated by Edward and befriend him, except for the eccentric religious fanatic Esmeralda and Kim's boyfriend Jim. Edward repays the neighborhood for their kindness by trimming their hedges into topiaries. This leads him to discover he can groom dogs' hair, and later he styles the hair of the neighborhood women. One of the neighbors, Joyce, offers to help Edward open a hair salon. While scouting a location, Joyce attempts to seduce Edward, but scares him away. Joyce tells the neighborhood women that he attempted to seduce her, reducing their trust in him. The bank refuses to give Edward a loan as {{he does not have}} a <b>background</b> <b>or</b> financial history.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} <b>background</b> <b>or</b> foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (up, down, left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to officials, teachers, merchants, farmers, artisans, and retainers, {{there were many}} other occupations. The pig-breeder was not seen as a lowly profession if it was merely utilized by a poor scholar {{to pay for a}} formal education. For example, the first chancellor in Han to lack either a military <b>background</b> <b>or</b> a title as marquess was the pig-breeder Gongsun Hong (公孫弘) of Emperor Wu's reign. Physicians who practiced medicine and studied medical classics could not only make a decent income, but were also able to gain an education and become officials. The physician Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was nominated for office while another became Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (郎中令). Those who practiced occult arts of Chinese alchemy and mediumship were often employed by the government to conduct religious sacrifices, while on rare occasions—such as with Luan Da (d. 112 BCE)—an occultist might marry a princesses or be enfeoffed as a marquess. While it was socially acceptable for gentry scholars to engage in the occult arts of divination and Chinese astrology, career diviners were of a lower status and earned only a modest income. Other humble occultist professions included sorcery and physiognomy; like merchants, those who practiced sorcery were banned from holding public office. Being a butcher was another lowly occupation, yet there is one case where a butcher became an official during Emperor Gaozu's reign, while Empress He (d. 189 CE) and her brother, the regent He Jin (d. 189 CE), came from a family of butchers. Runners and messengers who worked for the government were also considered to have a lowly status, yet some later became government officials.|$|E

5|$|The Central Committee (CC) is the CPV's most {{powerful}} institution. It delegates {{some of its}} powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo {{when it is not}} in session. When the Vietnam War ended in 1975, the Vietnamese leadership, led by Lê Duẩn, began to centralise power. This policy continued until the 6th National Congress, when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power. Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation. The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh's reform initiatives; because of this, Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders. This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s. The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial-level officials in the 1990s; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success. These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee; for example, more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work. Because of these changes, power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved. The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15.6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2000. The current President of the Socialist Republic, Trương Tấn Sang, was directly elected from the provinces at the 8th Party Congress, held 1996. Because of the devolution of power, the powers of the Central Committee have increased substantially; for instance, when a two-thirds majority of the Politburo voted in favour of retaining Lê Khả Phiêu as General Secretary (the leader of Vietnam), the Central Committee voted against the Politburo's motion and voted unanimously in favour of removing Lê Khả Phiêu from his post of General Secretary. The Central Committee did this because the majority of its members were of provincial <b>background,</b> <b>or</b> were working in the provinces; because of this, these members were the first to feel the pinch when the economy began to stagnate during Lê Khả Phiêu's rule.|$|E

The amount of <b>background</b> (<b>or</b> foreground) blur depends on the distance from the plane of focus, so if a background is close to the subject, {{it may be difficult to}} blur sufficiently even with a small DOF.
