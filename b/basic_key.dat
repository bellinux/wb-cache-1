40|$|A {{process for}} the secure {{transmission}} of data is presented that has {{to a certain degree}} the advantages of the one-time pad (OTP) cipher, that is, simplicity, speed, and information-theoretically security, but overcomes its fundamental weakness, the necessity of securely exchanging a key that is as long as the message. For each transmission, a dedicated one-time pad is generated for encrypting and decrypting the plaintext message. This one-time pad is built from a randomly chosen set of <b>basic</b> <b>keys</b> taken from a public library. Because the <b>basic</b> <b>keys</b> can be chosen and used multiple times, the method is called multiple-time pad (MTP) cipher. The information on the choice of <b>basic</b> <b>keys</b> is encoded in a short keyword that is transmitted by secure means. The process is made secure against known-plaintext attack by additional design elements. The process is particularly useful for high-speed transmission of mass data and video or audio streaming.

50|$|There {{are four}} <b>basic</b> <b>key</b> {{components}} to successful inoculation: threat, refutational preemption, delay, and involvement. The first is threat, which provides motivation to protect one's attitudes or beliefs (Pfau, 1997a). Threat {{is a product}} of the presence of counterarguments in an inoculation message and/or an explicit forewarning of an impending challenge to an existing belief (see Compton & Ivanov, 2012). The message receiver must interpret that a message is threatening and recognize that there is a reason to fight to maintain and strengthen their opinion. If the receiver of an opposing message does not recognize that a threat is present, they will not feel the need to start defending their position and therefore will not change their attitude or strengthen their opinion (Banas & Rains, 2010, p. 285).|$|E
5000|$|The Fourth Mephisto Waltz (S.696) {{remained}} unfinished and was {{not published}} until 1955. Liszt worked on the piece in 1885. Like the Second Waltz, the Fourth uses an introduction and coda which do not stick to the <b>basic</b> <b>key.</b> While the work is mainly in D, it begins and ends on C-sharp. This, writes noted Australian Liszt scholar and pianist Leslie Howard, was an encouragement while working on his performing version {{to refer to the}} main material in the slow Andantino and to recapitulate a portion of the fast Allegro before Liszt's coda. Some critics do not consider this waltz as original as its predecessors and surmise that, had Liszt lived to complete it, he might have made considerable improvements.

5000|$|Financial Darwinism [...] {{analyzes}} the dominant global forces behind the tectonic financial shift {{that has taken}} place in finance of the past quarter century and then comprehensively explores the challenges facing financial institutions as well as the universe of their potential responses. Conceptually, it consists of two highly interrelated parts. The first one is the evolutionary thesis called Dynamic Finance. This thesis explains the origins and drivers of the profound changes in the global financial landscape. Tilman proposes that the <b>basic</b> <b>key</b> to understanding the behavior of modern financial institutions and capital markets lies in the recognition {{of the fact that the}} process of economic value creation in finance has undergone a fundamental transformation. More specifically, due to significant margin pressures on basic financial businesses, active risk taking has begun to play an increasingly dominant role how financial institutions create (and destroy) shareholder value. In order to demonstrate this, the book introduces the concept of risk-based economic performance that helps depart from the outdated accounting-earnings-inspired mental paradigm. Throughout, the dynamism of risk-taking and business decisions is emphasized as a distinguishing characteristic of the dynamic new world vis-à-vis the old financial regime.|$|E
