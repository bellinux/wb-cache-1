40|$|Protection of {{environment}} {{and human health}} is major concern for European Union. European Commission has established integrated pollution prevention and control directive and directives concerning large combustion plants (LCP) and waste incineration (WI) plants to prevent emissions from industrial installations. The LCP and WI directives set the lowest requirements such as emission limit values and monitoring requirements that the operators have to comply in EU. European Commission has also published <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technique</b> (BAT) reference documents to help authorities determine the requirements in environmental permits for the installations. This thesis is looking into the authority requirements for continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are set by the competent authorities in Spain, Estonia, France, Poland, Czech and UK. Power plants have to monitor and report air emissions {{with the help of}} CEMS. It consists of measurement equipment, analysers and sample conditioning systems as well as environmental data management solution. Directives and standards set the requirements for the CEMS, but still requirements differ between the target countries. For instance, according to the study only in UK certification (MCERTS) for the analyser is required and only in Spain plant owner is not allowed to perform the compliance reporting of the plants emissions. It is the responsibility of competent authority. Also the charging and trading emissions differ between the target countries. The coming directive on industrial emissions will be possibly accepted in the end of 2010. It will unify and straiten the requirements. Emission limit values will lower and the emission monitoring requirements will be stricter. Due to the directive, the importance of the use of <b>best</b> <b>available</b> <b>technique</b> will be emphasized. BAT reference documents for large combustion plants and monitoring emissions are reviewed in 2010. The subject of this thesis was wide and the special requirements are presented in general level. Further studies can use this thesis as a ground for more detailed research in monitoring and reporting emissions from power plants in EU. More research should be done because monitoring of local environmental legislation of Member States is ongoing process. /Kir 1...|$|R

The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants.The Executive Body adopted the Protocol on Heavy Metals on 24 June 1998 in Aarhus (Denmark). It targets three particularly harmful metals: cadmium, lead and mercury. According to one of the basic obligations, Parties will have to reduce their emissions for these three metals below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The Protocol aims to cut emissions from industrial sources (iron and steel industry, non-ferrous metal industry), combustion processes (power generation, road transport) and waste incineration.

The identification of new non-invasive and informative biomarkers would therefore represent a substantial step to adequately treat melanoma patients.

MiRNAs do not circulate freely in biological fluids but they are incorporated into extracellular vesicles or form complexes with lipids and proteins.
