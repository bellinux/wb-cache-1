5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe's {{management}} announced his signing to Adidas {{for an undisclosed}} six-figure sum, stating that he would race in their new <b>bodysuit.</b> This presented a dilemma, as the national team was sponsored and wore outfits designed by Speedo, leading to months of protracted discussions and uncertainty. To compound his commercial difficulties, Thorpe had an uncertain end to the sporting year when, in October, he broke a bone in his ankle whilst jogging. However his performance throughout the year was recognised when he was again named as the World Swimmer of the Year by Swimming World, and by Swimming Australia as its Swimmer of the Year. In a wider arena, he was named Young Australian of the Year, ABC Sports Star of the Year, and Male Athlete of the Year at the Australian Sports Awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} purple liquid forming the word 'JANET'. Jackson is then shown {{sitting on top of}} a planet in outer space, wearing a <b>bodysuit</b> adorned with jewelry, long ponytail, and mask. Various asteroids and dancers {{mounting}} planets in black latex attire and helmets are shown. Jackson flips her ponytail, revealing her face as cosmic dust is tossed about. Several dancers leap to other planets as Jackson descends to a cratered surface, performing abstract choreography with two dancers. Jackson jumps to another setting, shown in slow motion as the audio is filtered, landing on a white liquid surface with a crimson atmosphere. Backed by eight dancers, Jackson performs the song's choreography as various objects crash into the liquid. Jackson and the dancers fall into the liquid, with Jackson reemerging in a red catsuit. Jackson then performs a dance routine with six glowing spheres. The final sphere ascends upward as fourteen white liquid objects explode.|$|E

5|$|To further aid {{athletes in}} gliding as aerodynamically as possible, they wear a {{one-piece}} fabric <b>bodysuit</b> {{more similar to}} a wingsuit than a ski suit. It is composed of five layers and is both loose-fitting and porous enough to allow up to 52litres of air to enter and 40litres to pass through. This generates yet more lift, but the amount of slack is stringently regulated by the FIS so as to not allow for excessive bagginess and thereby reducing its wingsuit-, sail- or parachute-like properties. In the early 2000s, bodysuits had reached exceptionally baggy proportions, resulting in humorous comparisons to flying squirrels. A ban on these baggy suits came into effect soon after, and today the level of slack for bodysuits is measured by FIS scrutineers before and after each jump: if the amount is exceeded, that athlete is disqualified due to an 'equipment violation'.|$|E
5|$|The single premiered on Chris Moyles's breakfast show on 7 September on BBC Radio 1. On Sunday 18 October 2009 {{the song}} was {{released}} for digital download in the UK. Cole took to the stage of The X Factor Live Results Show later that evening to perform the song for the first time. She adorned a military-themed outfit by Welsh fashion designer Julien MacDonald. It consisted of a sheer <b>bodysuit,</b> a red military jacket with black epaulettes {{as well as other}} details, black harem trousers and Alexander Wang boots. The outfit itself was subject to media attention, with some reporting that online debates had drawn comparisons to the outfit worn by 1992 video game antagonist M. Bison from the Street Fighter series. Media also considered Cole's outfit and performance inspired by Janet Jackson. Media speculated that the performance was mimed, something that Cole denied though she admitted to having some pre-recorded vocals to help the live performance. The show, which also featured the first UK performance by Whitney Houston in six years, drew a record audience of 14.8million, making it the most watched episode in the show's history at that time.|$|E
5|$|Verena Dietzel, {{creator of}} the fashion label V-Couture, who specializes in {{different}} kinds of corsets, were enlisted to create clothing for the video, {{as well as a}} Grammy Awards performance. Dietzel explained that she had initially thought Madonna's e-mail as spam, however after confirmation from the singer's assistant stylist, B. Åkerlund, she started working on the designs. Within 48 hours she sewed a new corset, as well as created two new ones, by basing them on the only information provided to her, that of Madonna's bra-size. She had to search on Google for deducing the rest of the singer's proportions. In total four different corsets were shipped off to Madonna. Lebanese designer Shady Zeineldine was also contacted by Åkerlund, who visited the designer's press conference in Los Angeles, and asked him to send his ideas and sketches for the video. After the deal was finalized, he created a custom made matador jacket which Madonna wore in the video. Another dress was a <b>bodysuit,</b> featuring a nude satin-stretch corset covered in three different types of lace, a black chiffon silk top and a satin tie. There was also a red velvet bolero jacket.|$|E

In 2008, when casual jumpsuits became increasingly popular, the press started discrediting them as [...] "adult onesies," [...] and the name seems to have eroded to a generic word, dropping the final s in the process.|$|R

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands hanging off the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black <b>bodysuit</b> behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is sitting on top of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly into the camera.|$|E

Alessandro Michele working for Gucci designed a sequinned <b>bodysuit</b> for Beyoncé, incorporating a geometric print and a red mink fur coat. London based designer Atsuko Kudo designed and produced a more simple <b>bodysuit</b> for the tour, creating an all red latex outfit with shoulder pads and a ruffled neckline. Kudo also stated that {{in order to make the}} outfit, a life sized cast of Beyoncé was used in order to fit the latex accurately to her body. Beyoncé also requested to Kudo that the outfit was in sync with the antebellum theme which runs through the tour's supporting album Lemonade, which influenced the inclusion of frills across the chest and scooping neckline. It was also noted how Beyoncé performed barefoot in water during one performance, whilst wearing a simple sequinned <b>bodysuit.</b> Beyoncé also sported a Givenchy haute couture by Riccardo Tisci bronze <b>bodysuit,</b> showing an exposed midriff.|$|E

One of the more prominent designers for the tour was Versace, in which Beyoncé wore both a fishnet and leather Atelier black <b>bodysuit</b> (complete with a plunging neckline, a fishnet head mask and high heel combat boots), {{as well as a}} colourful Atelier <b>bodysuit</b> from the designer. The leather Atelier black <b>bodysuit</b> took approximately 200 hours to craft and was used for the opening number of the tour, [...] "'03 Bonnie & Clyde". The colourful <b>bodysuit</b> was commented on by Versace who stated that the team had their inspiration from the street for the colour and added various crystals and stripes to show a [...] "baseball vibe" [...] while also trying to capture Beyoncé's energy. Beyoncé's tour shoes were designed by Stuart Weitzman and Joker's Closet. Other outfits included a denim jumpsuit and a bedazzled leotard <b>bodysuit</b> that [...] "showed off her derrière". Beyoncé also sported more thematic and dramatic pieces of clothing, including a full bridal veil and a sweeping train made of a black-and-white American flag. The American flag outfit was designed by Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy and took over 500 hours to create. The American flag train was 16.4 feet long but weighed around 500 grams allowing it to fly in the wind. The individual stars on the outfit were hand-embroidered and its inspiration was said to be [...] "American Danger: Bonnie & Clyde with a modern twist." [...] For the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm", Beyoncé returned to designer Vrettos Vrettakos (with whom she collaborated with notably on her previous solo tour).
