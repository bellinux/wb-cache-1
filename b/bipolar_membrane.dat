40|$|Compared to {{steady-state}} current¿voltage curves, chronopotentiometric measurements {{allow us}} to distinguish the contributions to the overall electric potential difference across a <b>bipolar</b> <b>membrane.</b> In this paper, the characteristic values of the electric potential difference across the <b>bipolar</b> <b>membrane</b> at different times are correlated to the corresponding concentration profiles in the <b>bipolar</b> <b>membrane</b> layers and the ion-transport processes are identified. For over-limiting current densities (i. e. current densities above the limiting current density), {{it is possible to}} distinguish the reversible and irreversible contributions to the steady-state electric potential difference. The irreversible contribution is attributed to the energy required to overcome the electric resistance whereas the reversible contribution corresponds to the electrochemical potential due to concentration gradients in the membrane layers. Further, the ohmic resistance of the membrane in equilibrium with the surrounding solution has been compared to the resistance in the transport state. For low current densities, the equilibrium resistance is lower than the transport resistance stemming from internal concentration polarisation. In contrast, the large numbers of hydroxide ions and protons produced at high current densities result in a reduced ohmic transport resistance due to their high ionic mobility. This reduced resistance is not enough to stop the increase of the irreversible contribution with higher current densities. With the possibility to split the steady-state potential into its contributions, <b>bipolar</b> <b>membrane</b> chronopotentiometry is a useful tool to identify transport limitations and to improve bipolar membranes for a reduced overall electric potential...|$|E

The <b>bipolar</b> <b>membrane</b> facilitated coupling between two electrodes and electrolytes, one for the CO_ 2 R reaction {{and one for the}} OER, that typically operate at mutually different pH values and produced a lower total cell overvoltage than known single-electrolyte CO_ 2 R systems while exhibiting ∼ 10 % solar-to-fuels energy-conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{application}} of bipolar electrodialysis (BPED) for the simultaneous removal of inhibitory acetate and pH control during fermentation was investigated. A two cell pair electrodialysis module, consisting of cation exchange, anion exchange and <b>bipolar</b> <b>membranes</b> with working area of 100  cm each, was integrated {{with a standard}} 7  l stirred tank bioreactor. Results showed that BPED was beneficial in terms of in situ removal of inhibitory acetate {{and a reduction in}} the amount NHOH used for pH control. In batch and fed-batch BPED fermentations, base additions were decreased by up to 50 % in both cases compared to electrodialysis (ED) fermentations with pH controlled at 6. 7  ±  0. 1. Consequently, the final biomass (34. 2  g DCW l) and recombinant protein (5. 5  g l) concentrations obtained were increased by up to 37 and 20 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{fermentation}} {{of organic}} waste streams by mixed culture generates {{a mixture of}} short chain carboxylic acids. To avoid inhibitory effects of the acids or their consumption in internal conversion reactions in the mixed culture environment, in-situ recovery of acids can be beneficial. In this study, electrodialysis with <b>bipolar</b> <b>membranes</b> (EDBM) was applied to a mixed culture fermentation on organic waste streams using a novel EDBM stack with “direct contact” operation mode. We could demonstrate simultaneous recovery of carboxylates from the fermenter by the EDBM stack while in-situ generation and transport of hydroxyl ions to the fermenter allowed direct pH control. Experiments showed productivity increase after EDBM coupling to the fermenter, and complete elimination of external base consumption. It was also observed that EDBM was able to drive the mixed culture fermentation towards acetate and propionate type of carboxylates. </p...|$|R
40|$|Separation electromembrane {{processes}} such as electrodialysis or electro-electrodialysis {{are being}} applied to bioindustries and {{to the treatment of}} industry waste waters. For these purposes, the selectivity of ion transport has to be improved in order to obtain performances of the process which are compatible with the technico-economical conditions. In this paper, we examine four particular cases where the analysis of the ion transport selectivity has been developed in relation with better performances of the electromembrane processes : (i) Reduction of the proton leakage through anion exchange membranes in contact with acidic solutions. (ii) Specific transport of protons through cation exchange membranes in contact with solutions containing both an acid and a bivalent metallic ion. (iii) Reduction of cation leakage through <b>bipolar</b> <b>membranes.</b> (iiii) Loss of permselectivity of cation exchange membranes due to the poisoning of the membrane by organic ion...|$|R
