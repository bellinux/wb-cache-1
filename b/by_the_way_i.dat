500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by arbitrageur Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>I</b> want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq called The Way I See It [...] "the {{culmination}} of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." [...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{said that he was}} [...] "blown away" [...] <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>I</b> See It, citing it as [...] "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." [...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... The Way I See It showed them that yes, I could put the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{financial}} success of Red Dust and Hold Your Man, MGM cast Harlow with Clark Gable in two more successful films: China Seas (1935), with Wallace Beery and Rosalind Russell, and Wife vs. Secretary (1936), with Myrna Loy and James Stewart.

2500|$|Occasionally, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>I</b> get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything".

[...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never get an answer. On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always get an answer. I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E

'It's not what I mean <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Way.</b> <b>I</b> will show you my Way.' Thereupon he tuned two zithers. He placed {{one of them in}} the hall and the other in an inner chamber. When he plucked the note do [...] on one, do resonated [...] on the other, and when he plucked the note mi [...] on one, mi resonated [...] on the other. It's because their harmonies were the same. If he had retuned one of the strings so it didn't match any note in the pentatonic scale, and had then plucked it, all twenty-five strings on the other zither would have resonated [...] , not because there was any fundamental difference in the sound, but because it was the note that dominated all the rest. May it be that you thinkers are all like this?" [...] (23, tr. Mair 1994: 243) ...|$|E
