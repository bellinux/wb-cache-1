5|$|Zinfandel vines {{are quite}} {{vigorous}} and grow best in climates that are warm {{but not too}} hot, because grapes may shrivel in hot weather. Zinfandel's thin-skinned grapes grow in large, tight bunches that are sometimes prone to <b>bunch</b> <b>rot.</b> The fruit ripen fairly early and produce juice with high sugar content. If weather conditions permit, the grapes may be late-harvested to make dessert wine. Zinfandel is often praised {{for its ability to}} reflect both its terroir and its winemaker's style and skill.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{responsible}} for <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> of grape berries are filamentous fungi, {{the most common}} of these being Botrytis cinerea (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi {{responsible for}} the rotting of grapes such as Aspergillus spp., Penicillium spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., Colletotrichum spp. (ripe rot) and Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, Phomopsis viticola). Compounds found in <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} 21st century, growers {{have been}} working with Greek wine {{authorities}} to produce new virus-free clones of Agiorgitiko that have the potential to resist most grape disease, including botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot,</b> and produce small berries with thicker skins that could ripen to higher sugar levels with most consistent yields. In 2012, several of these new clones were released to Greek wine growers who have slowly begun replanting their Agiorgitiko vineyards.|$|E
50|$|Recognised by many {{today as}} a noble red variety (particularly in {{southern}} Iberia), Alicante Bouschet {{is known for its}} deep dark color, more than 15 times the color of Aramon and twice the darkness of the Grand Noir de la Calmette. Under specific conditions, the grape can produce high yields of up to 80 hl/ha. It buds and ripens early-to-mid season to produce wines high in alcohol, particularly where jamminess is valued and extended 'hang-time' is practiced. The wines tend to be short on primary aromas and can lack character and complexity when young. Alicante Bouschet performs best under specific conditions and where tertiary aromas are allowed to predominate through ageing. The grape vine is thought to be prone to grape diseases like anthracnose, downy mildew and occasionally <b>bunch</b> <b>rots</b> in rare instances where bunches are tight at harvest. Alicante Bouschet leaves turn a beautiful purple hue in late autumn.|$|R
5000|$|Zinfandel is a thin-skinned grape {{that needs}} dry {{conditions}} to avoid <b>rotting.</b> <b>Bunches</b> ripen unevenly, requiring careful picking to ensure the true character is available to be further developed by the winemaker. Zinfandel is spicy in character without being particularly heavy.|$|R
50|$|The labor-intensive {{process of}} {{producing}} this wine poses significant {{risk for the}} development of various wine faults. Wet and rainy weather during harvest may cause the grapes to rot before drying out, requiring winemakers to be diligent in removing <b>rotted</b> <b>bunches</b> that can cause moldy flavors in the wine.|$|R
25|$|Merlot {{thrives in}} cold soil, {{particularly}} ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of Botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot.</b> If bad weather occurs during flowering, the Merlot vine {{is prone to}} develop coulure. The vine can also be susceptible to downy mildew (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by leafhopper insect varieties.|$|E
25|$|The grape is a late budding and {{ripening}} {{variety that}} {{is prone to}} produce high yields if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting. In addition to its susceptibility to numerous grapevine viruses, Agiorgitiko is also very sensitive to fungal infection from botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot,</b> downy and powdery mildew. The vine also responds adversely to water stress which may require some irrigation in regions where the practice is permitted. In order to limit yields, Agiorgitiko is often densely planted in poor vineyard soils but growers need {{to be mindful of}} the variety's sensitivity to potassium deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Carginan's {{tendency}} to produce short shoots with clusters that grow {{closely to the}} trunk of the vine means that it is difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot,</b> downy mildew, and phomopsis.|$|E
40|$|Composting is {{nowadays}} {{a general}} treatment method for agriculture waste such as empty fruit bunch. This research article reported {{the composting process}} of the empty fruit bunches. The effect of addition of white rot fungi (Phanerochaete Chrysosporium) as an activator on composting product was studied. Experiment results indicated that white rot fungi is a good activator to improve degradation process of the empty fruit bunch become an organic fertilizer. White rot fungi has capable to increase composting period become shorter in compare with original composting without addition of white rot fungi. The organic fertilizer product as regulation issued by the Standar Nasional Indonesia (NSI) can be achieved in duration of 3 months, while for original process without addition of white rot fungi longer degradation time is necessary.

40|$|While Queensland wine {{industry}} development has relied upon adoption of viticultural practices from established winegrowing regions, such procedures {{are not necessarily}} best practice under local conditions. The wine grape growing regions of Queensland are climatically distinct from other Australian regions with relatively wet growing seasons, and at times with severe peak heat loads. Queensland also hosts the most northerly {{and some of the}} highest altitude vineyards in Australia, with higher ultra violet radiation exposure than any other Australian grape growing region. Furthermore, fruit exposure may be exacerbated by regional management practices (e. g. leaf plucking, shoot thinning) used to minimise risk of fungal infection (e. g. botrytis, <b>bunch</b> <b>rots).</b> The Queensland {{wine industry}} had identified fruit exposure management as a critical issue to be addressed. We set up demonstration sites to show the impacts of canopy management options on exposure of Chardonnay and Shiraz over the 2009 / 10 vintage in the Granite Belt, South Burnett and Scenic Rim. Demonstrated options included sprawl, VSP, fruit zone leaf removal at pea size and véraison (easterly or both sides of canopy), bird netting, or commercial sunscreen products (calcium carbonate or kaolin clay). Differences in fruit exposure, grape and wine quality were noted. Growers inspected the demonstration sites prior to harvest and provided feedback on fruit quality. Fruit was harvested, analysed and wines made and analysed, and results presented and discussed at the 2010 Queensland Viticulture Seminar. At this seminar / workshop, industry participants were also able to conduct sensory evaluation of the wines to determine any impacts of alternative management practices on wines produced, to supplement their evaluation of fruit quality prior to harvest. Conclusions from this project were confounded by problematic seasonal conditions with diverse severe events including frost, hail, heat and water stress and fungal disease pressures. Recommendations from this study are that while they may be useful in cooler seasons, in hotter seasons practices such as leaf plucking and shoot thinning are not advised due to potential to exacerbate overexposure and sunburn of fruit. ...|$|R
25|$|A {{mechanical}} grape harvester {{works by}} beating the vine with rubber sticks {{to get the}} vine to drop its fruit onto a conveyor belt that brings the fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and unripe or <b>rotted</b> <b>bunches</b> which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|R
25|$|Pedro Ximénez is a {{mid to late}} {{ripening}} grape {{variety that}} also tends to bud at {{the midpoint of the}} budding period of the vine growing season. The vine can be very vigorous and productive, producing large clusters of berries of irregular sizes (occasionally the result of millerandage). Despite having thin skinned berries, Pedro Ximénez is highly susceptible to the viticultural hazard of botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> as well as downy mildew, esca and eutypa dieback. The vine has some resistance to the fungal disease powdery mildew but is also very prone to damage caused by termite infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{research}} in Hunter Valley vineyards {{discovered that a}} wide range of pathogens caused various occurrences of <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> in the vineyards. These other pathogens included Colletotrichum acutatum (ripe rot), Greeneria uvicola (bitter rot) and other fungi from the genera of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Alternaria. Susceptibility of certain wine grape varieties were found to increase as the grapes reached higher Brix sugar levels. Further research in the 2000s, showed that some of the open canopy techniques used to prevent Botrytis grey rot may actually promote the development of some of these other types of rot. Ripe rot, in particular, seemed to thrive at the higher ultraviolet B (280–320nm) light exposure that open canopies allow. To compound the potential problem for Hunter Valley wine growers is that, as of 2010, there wasn't any fungicides registered for use for this disease.|$|E
25|$|The Grenache vine is {{characterized}} by its strong wood canopy and upright growth. It has good wind tolerance (which is useful with the northerly Cierzo and Mistral winds that influence the regions of Aragon and the Rhone) and has shown itself to be very suited for the dry, warm windy climate around the Mediterranean. The vine buds early and requires a long growing season in order to fully ripen. Grenache is often {{one of the last}} grapes to be harvested, often ripening weeks after Cabernet Sauvignon. The long ripening process allows the sugars in the grape to reach high levels, making Grenache based wines capable of substantial alcohol levels, often at least 15% ABV. While the vine is generally vigorous, it is susceptible to various grape diseases that can affect the yield and quality of the grape production such as coulure, <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> and downy mildew due to the vine's tight grape clusters. Marginal and wet climates can increase Grenache's propensity to develop these viticultural dangers. The vine's drought resistance is dependent on the type of rootstock it is planted on but on all types of rootstocks, Grenache seems to respond favorably to some degree of water stress.|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of the grapevine but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that the grapevine can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and vine shoots will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and vine shoots on the vine but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Meredith used a DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{technique to}} confirm that Primitivo and Zinfandel are clones of the same variety. Comparative field trials have found that [...] "Primitivo selections were generally superior to those of Zinfandel, having earlier fruit maturity, similar or higher yield, and similar or lower <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> susceptibility." [...] This {{is consistent with the}} theory that Primitivo was selected as an early-ripening clone of a Croatian grape.|$|E
2500|$|The chief viticultural hazard in the Hunter Valley is {{the threat}} posed by vintage season rains. Site {{selection}} on well drained soils are considered of vital importance and much effort is put into ensuring the canopy is open so air flow can help dry the grapes off. [...] Of particular concern is <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> often caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. In the production of late harvest wines, such as Semillon, Botrytis can be desirable and is known as noble rot. But for other grape varieties, particularly red wine grapes, the fungus is unwelcome with its infection described as grey rot.|$|E
2500|$|The {{leaves of}} Pinot Noir are {{generally}} smaller {{than those of}} Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah. The Pinot vine is typically less vigorous than either of these varieties. The grape cluster is small and conico-cylindrical; shaped like a pine cone. Some viticultural historians believe this shape similarity may {{have given rise to}} the name. In the vineyard Pinot Noir is sensitive to wind and frost, cropping levels (it must be low yielding for production of quality wines), soil types and pruning techniques. In the winery it is sensitive to fermentation methods, yeast strains and is highly reflective of its terroir with different regions sometimes producing very different wines. Its thin skin makes it susceptible to <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> and similar fungal diseases. The vines themselves are susceptible to powdery mildew, especially in Burgundy infection by leaf roll and fanleaf viruses causes significant vine health problems. These complications have given the grape a reputation for being difficult to grow: Jancis Robinson calls Pinot a [...] "minx of a vine" [...] and André Tchelistcheff declared that [...] "God made Cabernet Sauvignon whereas the devil made Pinot Noir." [...] It is much less tolerant of harsh vineyard conditions than the likes of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot or Grenache.|$|E

50|$|Botrytis complicates {{winemaking}} {{by making}} fermentation more complex. Botrytis produces an anti-fungal that kills yeast and {{often results in}} fermentation stopping before the wine has accumulated sufficient levels of alcohol. Makers of fine German dessert wines {{have been known to}} take fermenting tubs of wine into their homes to nurture the yeast through the night to assure that the alcohol level reaches legal minimums for the product to be called wine.Botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> is another condition of grapes caused by Botrytis cinerea that causes great losses for the wine industry. It is always present on the fruitset, however, it requires a wound to start a <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> infection. Wounds can come from insects, wind, accidental damage, etc. To control botrytis <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> {{there are a number of}} fungicides available on the market. Generally, these should be applied at bloom, bunch closure and veraison (the most important being the bloom application). Some winemakers are known to use the German method of fermentation and prefer having a 5% <b>bunch</b> <b>rot</b> rate in their grapes and will usually hold the grapes on the vine a week longer than normal.|$|E
