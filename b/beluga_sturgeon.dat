40|$|Abstract: The Lower Danube River (LDR) still {{supports}} three naturally self-sustaining {{species of}} anadromous <b>sturgeons.</b> <b>Beluga</b> <b>sturgeons</b> (Huso huso) and stellate sturgeons (A. stellatus) are still common while Russian sturgeons (Acipenser gueldenstaedti) became very rare. Studying their swimming behaviour {{is essential for}} understanding (i) the impact of construction works aiming to improve conditions for navigation; (ii) sturgeon behaviour in relation to Iron Gate hydropower and navigation systems; (iii) behaviour of young sturgeons during downstream migration towards the Black Sea. A significant number of wild adult sturgeons (N= 103; 39 beluga, 1 Russian and 63 stellate) was implanted with acoustic transmitters, with depth and temperature sensors, and their movements were tracked using arrays of submerged automatic receivers installed in the LDR (R Km 60 – 863) during 2009 – 2014. For some of these fish additional swimming depth data were obtained by manual tracking. Wild born young of the year (YOY) <b>beluga</b> <b>sturgeons</b> (N= 27) were captured in the LDR (R Km 123), implanted with acoustic transmitters and released during routine monitoring (June 2010). YOY <b>beluga</b> <b>sturgeons</b> of hatchery origin (N= 33) were implanted with acoustic transmitters and stocked in the LDR at R Km 300 and R Km 102 (August 2010). Their movements were tracked and recorded by arrays of submerged acoustic receivers installed on the main Danube (R Km 101) and the three branches of the delta. This paper analyses {{for the first time}} on the LDR consistent data (over 70, 000 recordings) on swimming speed (upstream and downstream) and swimming depth behaviour of adult <b>sturgeons</b> (<b>beluga</b> and stellate), during spring and autumn migration season, and YOY <b>beluga</b> <b>sturgeons</b> of wild and hatchery origin...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates bio-accumulation {{of heavy}} metals in tissues of {{sturgeons}} of the North-Western Black Sea and Lower Danube River (LDR). Samples (10 – 30 gr) of liver, muscle, fat, gonads and skin tissues collected in October 2003 from 21 adult specimens of three sturgeon species: Acipenser stellatus (10), A. gueldenstaedtii (2), and Huso huso (9) were analysed for content in Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb, Mn, Fe and Ni, using VARIAN Spectra A 100. The highest concentrations of Zn, Cu and Cd {{were found in}} liver and the smallest in muscles of sturgeons. The highest heavy metal content was detected in tissues of stellate sturgeons, followed by Russian sturgeons. In all three species Cd and Cu content of the liver {{as well as of}} the stellate sturgeon muscle surpassed the admitted limits for human consumption (Cd – 0. 05; Zn - 50; Cu – 5. 0; Pb – 0. 3 [mg / kg wet weight]). In view of a future re-opening of the commercial fishing of wild sturgeons it is strongly recommended testing the heavy metal level prior delivering sturgeon products to the market. Avoiding human consumption of liver of sturgeons captured in the LDR is strongly recommended as well. In the case of Cd a bio-accumulation with age of sturgeons was visible. In all species males seem to accumulate more heavy metals in their tissues. We explain this as effect of more frequent spawning migration of males in the LDR, the major contamination source. <b>Beluga</b> <b>sturgeons</b> show less heavy metal bio-accumulation of tissues...|$|R

40|$|Sturgeon {{populations in}} the Danube River have {{experienced}} severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the poorly regulated fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. This study focuses on gaining better understanding of sturgeon life history primarily by addressing the assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons. Analysis was performed on pectoral fin samples of three anadromous Danube <b>sturgeon</b> species (<b>beluga,</b> Russian <b>sturgeon</b> and stellate sturgeon) {{by the use of}} a Nuclear Microprobe technique. The most frequent pattern in analyzed samples was represented by a low Sr:Ca ratio in the innermost annuli, followed by an increased ratio in the middle annuli segment, and often with a decreased ratio in the outermost annuli. Probability density estimate has revealed three distinguished maxima of the Sr: Ca ratio, 7. 08 x 10 (- 3), 8. 98 x 10 (- 3) and 9. 90 x 10 (- 3), which might correspond, respectively, to fresh, brackish and saltwater.

40|$|Populations of six {{sturgeon}} {{species in}} the Danube River (<b>Beluga,</b> Russian <b>sturgeon,</b> Stellate sturgeon, Sterlet, Ship sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon) have experienced severe decline during the last several decades, mostly due to the unsustainable fishery, river fragmentation and water pollution. In the present study, the question of viability of Danube sturgeon populations and the poor knowledge of their ecology have been addressed through three different research activities: 1) statistical methods that infer extinction based on sighting records {{have been used to}} assess probability of extinction of the Ship and Atlantic sturgeon, whose presence n the Danube basin is uncertain; 2) assessment of microelement accumulation in sturgeon pectoral fin rays, especially of strontium and calcium, has been conducted as a method that can reveal migration patterns of anadromous sturgeons; 3) population viability analysis in a Vortex simulation model has been conducted in order to assess the state of the six Danube sturgeon species, their future risk of extinction and to determine the most suitable conservation and management measures. Methods for inferring extinction based on sighting records provided a significant probability that the Atlantic sturgeon is extinct, with extinction occurring somewhere between 1966 and 1970, and that the Ship sturgeon is probably still present in the Danube basin, but that extinction may occur within a few decades. A new model has been also developed within the present study, able to infer probability of extinction based on the trends in sighting intervals, since this issue was not adequately considered in the existing models. Although the analysis of the strontium to calcium ratio in sturgeon pectoral fin rays has revealed changes that might indicate probable migration of juvenile fish from the river to the sea, further studies are needed for improvement of this method. Population viability analysis has revealed a large sensitivity of the Danube sturgeon populations to changes in the natural mortality, fecundity, age at maturity and spawning frequency. It was also confirmed that the sturgeons are highly susceptible to even moderate levels of commercial fishery, and that their recovery is a multi-decadal affair. Stocking with adult individuals was shown to produce considerably greater effect on population persistence than stocking with juveniles, but the latter approach is probably still preferable since it avoids many inherent problems of aquaculture cultivation.

5000|$|The Caspian Sea had {{not always}} been {{the only source of}} caviar. <b>Beluga</b> <b>sturgeon</b> were common in the Po river in Italy in the 16th century, and were used to produce caviar.Cristoforo da Messisbugo in his book Libro novo nel qual si insegna a far d'ogni sorte di vivanda, Venice, 1564, at page 110, gave the first {{recorded}} recipe in Italy about extraction of the eggs from the roe and caviar preparation [...] "to be consumed fresh or to preserve".The writer and voyager Jérôme Lalande in his book [...] "Voyage en Italie", Paris, 1771, vol. 8 page 269, noted that many sturgeon were caught in the Po delta area in the territory of Ferrara.In 1753 a diplomatic war broke out between the Papal States, governing the Ferrara territory, and the Venetian Republic about sturgeon fishing rights in the Po river, the border between the two states. From about 1920 and until 1942 there was a shop in Ferrara, named [...] "Nuta" [...] from the nickname of the owner Benvenuta Ascoli, that processed all the sturgeons caught in the Po river for caviar extraction, using an elaboration of the original Messisbugo recipe, and shipped it to Italy and Europe. Production was sporadically continued by a new owner until 1972, when sturgeon stopped swimming up the Po river. Since 2015, some sturgeon have reappeared in the Po.|$|E
50|$|The film {{is based}} upon the true story of Ioannis Varvakis, a Greek caviar {{merchant}} and eventual benefactor from Psara who was formerly a pirate. He was born in Psara, and from an early age he learned to navigate the seas, an occupation revered and steeped in tradition on the island where he grew up. At the age of 17 he built his own ship, which he would later offer to the Russians during the Orlov Revolt. Ultimately, his ship was destroyed, and he turned to Saint Petersburg to ask for an audience with Catherine the Great. He was given compensation for the loss of his ship and granted authorization to fish freely in the Caspian Sea. Due to his superb navigational skills and excellent seamanship abilities, he dominated the Caspian Sea and soon became substantially wealthy. When he initially discovered the superior caviar of the <b>Beluga</b> <b>Sturgeon,</b> he quickly discerned that there could be an incredible market trading for this product. From the caviar trade he eventually became a millionaire and later donated part of his fortune for important works that improved the life of Russians and Greeks on the Black Sea coasts. In his later years, he {{became a member of the}} Filiki Eteria, which would contribute to the overthrow of the Ottoman rule of Greece. He died in 1825 in Zante, during the Greek War of Independence. After his death, his entire estate went to the Ioannis Varvakis Foundation which would offer up important grants throughout Greece. The script follows the entire life of Varvakis, but the film's narration begins with his final moments in Zante.|$|E
