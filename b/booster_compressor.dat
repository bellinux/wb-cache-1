The reasons are higher evaporation temperatures, lower internal and external superheat and higher total efficiency of <b>booster</b> <b>compressors.</b> Another important factor is gas removal from the intermediate vessel which leads to higher COP of low temperature level. Comparing the older and newer installed systems, a trend in energy efficiency improvement has been seen. The study shows this improvement originates from both changes in the system design (e. g. two stage expansion) and components efficiency improvement (e. g. higher total efficiency of compressors - lower internal superheat and higher evaporation temperatures of cabinets).

5|$|The CFM56 is a {{high-bypass}} {{turbofan engine}} (most {{of the air}} accelerated by the fan bypasses {{the core of the}} engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having bypass ratios ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000lbf (80kN to 150kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure.

40|$|Implementing {{distributed}} utility can {{strengthen the}} local distribution system and help avoid or delay {{the expense of}} upgrading transformers and feeders. The gas turbine-generator set is an attractive option based on its low front-end capital cost, reliable performance at unmanned stations, and environmental performance characteristics. This report assesses gas turbine utilization issues from a perspective of fuel supply pressure requirements and discusses both cost and operational factors. A primary operational consideration for siting gas turbines on the electric distribution system is whether the local gas distribution company can supply gas at the required pressure. Currently available gas turbine engines require gas supply pressures of at least 150 {{pounds per square inch}} gauge, more typically, 250 to 350 psig. Few LDCs maintain line pressure in excess of 125 psig. One option for meeting the gas pressure requirements is to upgrade or extend an existing pipeline and connect that pipeline to a high-pressure supply source, such as an interstate transmission line. However, constructing new pipeline is expensive, and the small volume of gas required by the turbine for the application offers little incentive for the LDC to provide this service. Another way to meet gas pressure requirements is to boost the compression of the fuel gas at the gas turbine site. Fuel gas <b>booster</b> <b>compressors</b> are readily available as stand-alone units and can satisfactorily increase the supply pressure to meet the turbine engine requirement. However, the life-cycle costs of this equipment are not inconsequential, and maintenance and reliability issues for boosters in this application are questionable and require further study. These factors may make the gas turbine option a less attractive solution in DU applications than first indicated by just the $/kW capital cost. On the other hand, for some applications other DU technologies, such as photovoltaics, may be the more attractive option...|$|R

The support vehicle, normally a truck, holds diesel and water tanks for resupplying the rig. It also holds other supplies needed for maintenance on the rig.

40|$|Since {{the recent}} {{publication}} of a practical recipe to create ¿pancake¿ electron bunches which evolve into uniformly filled ellipsoids, {{a number of papers}} have addressed both an alternative method to create such ellipsoids as well as their behavior in realistic fields. So far, the focus has been on the possibilities to preserve the initial ¿thermal¿ transverse emittance. This paper addresses the linear longitudinal phase space of ellipsoidal bunches. It is shown that ellipsoidal bunches allow ballistic compression at subrelativistic energies, without the detrimental effects of nonlinear space-charge forces. This in turn eliminates the need for the large correlated energy spread normally required for longitudinal compression of relativistic particle beams, while simultaneously avoiding all problems related to magnetic compression. Furthermore, the linear space-charge forces of ellipsoidal bunches can be used to reduce the remaining energy spread even further, by carefully choosing the beam transverse size, in a process that is essentially the time-reversed process of the creation of an ellipsoid at the cathode.

40|$|The project High Temperature Heat Pump {{has been}} {{completed}} in 2 phases.

This type of heat pump reaches the extreme running conditions for the retrofit of existing fuel boilers at air (a) - 12 °C and water (W) 65 °C with very satisfying performances (Final Report, Phase 1). In this report a second improved compressor could be tested: with a COP of 2. 74 (was 2. 58) at A 2 W 50 r. h. 93 % (normalized conditions) and at A- 12 W 65 (without defrosting) the COP has reached 2. 07 (was 1. 91) with a base heat output of 10 kW. The setup for the intermediate injection was continuously improved by implementing a capillary tube (sect. 3. 3. 5) and by reconnecting the economizer heat exchanger (chap. 4). Continuous tests including multiple frosting cycles and 24 h tests with modulated external conditions were also conducted on the same test fascility (chap. 6 and 7). A second approach studied in this project is the implementation of a <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> (open scroll type) mounted at the suction line of the main compressor (chap. 8, fig. 8. 3). Test at A- 12 W 65 show the large improve of heat output raising from 9. 7 kW (heat pump with intermediate injection) up to 15. 7 kW! For this configuration, the existing heat exchangers are not properly designed anymore and slight losses in COP are seen, even if the performances of the compressor are acceptable (fig 8. 6). In the second part of this report a thermo-economic analysis has been undertaken in order to compare the proposed concepts for a monovalent heating case (heat pump only) and by optimizing the size of an electric direct heating device. Zurich was chosen for the climatic conditions of the heating season. The heat pump characteristics are calculated for a heat curve (passing through the point A- 12 W 60 and a heating limit at Text= 15 °C), losses of defrosting and auxiliaries (ventilator and pump) are included. Cost functions for the heat pump and its main elements have been proposed. The economic performance (cost price per kWh heat output) has been calculated for different electric prices and residence sizes. The optimization gives the best choice of relative the size of the <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> and the electrical heat supply. For the monovalent heating a seasonal COP of 2. 71 (one-stage HP), 287 (HP with intermediate injection) and 3. 09 (booster type HP).

The electric supply covers > 50 % of the base heat output and will consume 10 % - 13 % of the electricity during the heating period.

40|$|Background: Iran {{is located}} in the seventh rank in terms of CO 2 {{emissions}} resulting from the fuel combustion in the world. Gas <b>compressor</b> <b>booster</b> stations, due to the several sources of contaminants, are causing the release of large amounts of CO 2 and CH 4, which will cause climate change; therefore, estimating the emissions of the gases from oil and gas, different processing units are necessary. Methods: In this study, the emissions factor method, provided by various organizations, was used for determining emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 from different sources. Results: According to the results obtained, the total amount of CO 2 emissions in selected units is from the selected unit and is a significant contribution to the CH 4 emissions, so that the whole amount of CO 2 emissions is equal to 7739. 027 tons per day and the total amount of CH 4 emissions is 4 tons per day. Conclusion: Burner has the highest amount of CO 2 emissions among the sources of pollutants in the fixed combustion sources; and, the highest emissions of CH 4, among the exit gas sources, belong to the process of removing water. Among the exit gas sources-compressors maintenance activities the highest emissions belong to CH 4. The amount of CO 2 emissions from indirect sources, including electrical equipment in the studied units, are from natural gas fuel which are much more than those from fuel oils for burning. CH 4 gas from volatile sources in the gas compressors have the highest emissions compared to other sources. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} efficiency losses in a vaporcompression refrigeration system, especially in a transcritical CO 2 cycle, is caused by the throttling process. The most promising solution is an application of a two-phase ejector as a <b>compressor</b> <b>booster.</b> The schematic diagram of this solution is presented in Figure 1. Efficient ejector operation is mostly dependent on ejector geometry, where the converging-diverging motive nozzle plays an important role. In this nozzle, the pressure potential energy of the fluid is partly converted into kinetic energy. The lower pressure at the motive nozzle outlet, the higher motive stream velocity and the better potential of momentum exchange with the secondary stream farther downstream. For given operating conditions (inlet, outlet pressure) the maximum achievable velocity for a simple converging nozzle is fixed by the propagation velocity (the speed of sound). For a converging-diverging nozzle, the velocity at the nozzle outlet could be larger and depends on the divergent design. For two-phase flows this issue is additionally complicated by an occurrence of non-equilibrium effects: although the fluid pressure decreases below the saturation pressure, a phase change process does not occur and the flow remains single-phase (metastable liquid flow). After the pressure reaches an enough low value the phase change (flashing) starts but the formed two-phase flow is still far from equilibrium. In case of the CO 2 transcritical cycle, the described flow is even more complicated because of the fluid transition from supercritical to subcritical state. All those phenomena significantly influence the motive mass flow rate, which is a key parameter for an ejector performance. Therefore, an accurate prediction of a local speed of sound in non-equlibrium two-phase flows is a crucial issue for an ejector motive nozzle design. Aforementioned circumstances were a motivation for research of a relatively simple and accurate way to describe the sound speed in two-phase flows. For this purpose, three approaches were analysed and compared, namely: homogenous equilibrium model, relaxation equilibrium model and delayed equilibrium model. Authors found that the absence of equilibrium can be relatively simply included in speed of sound predictions by usage of the relaxation models. Moreover, calculations performed on the base of an own implementation of mentioned models were compared to available experimental data...|$|R
30|$|When {{developing}} gas reservoirs, {{three stages}} (periods) are distinguished. The {{first one is}} a period of incrementally increasing production (a period of drilling up the reservoir, construction of related facilities, and transition of the reservoir to constant production level). Duration of the stage is up to 7 – 10 years, and gas extraction rate reaches 20 – 25 % of initial reserves. The second period is characterized by constant production level (drilling of the reservoir continues to maintain a constant production capacity and a <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> station is being built or its capacity is increased). During this period, up to half of the initial gas reserves is extracted and a gas recovery factor reaches 60 – 70 %. The period of constant production depends on a gas extraction rate achieved: the higher it is, the shorter is the period. The third period is characterized by declining production, a {{decrease in the number of}} producing wells, their production rates, the appearance of water in wells and a significant decrease in reservoir pressure. When a reservoir enters the period of declining production, there comes an issue of an optimal choice and the most effective use of the technologies for additional development of the reservoir that makes it possible to conduct cost-effective production of low-pressure gas (Ping et al. 2014; Curtis 2003). The problem of daily production optimization in the exploration and production of oil and gas was also studied by Samuelson (2008).

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{analysis}} of an integrated reforming combined cycle (IRCC) with natural gas as fuel input. This IRCC consisted of a hydrogen-fired gas turbine (GT) with a single-pressure steam bottoming cycle for power production. The reforming process section consisted of a pre-reformer and an air-blown auto thermal reformer (ATR) followed by water-gas shift reactors. The air to the ATR was discharged from the GT compressor and boosted up to system pressure by an air <b>booster</b> <b>compressor.</b> For the CO[subscript 2] capture sub-system, a chemical absorption setup was modeled. The design case model was modeled in GT PRO by Thermoflow, and in Aspen Plus. The Aspen Plus simulations consisted of two separate models, one that included the reforming process and the water-gas shift reactors. In this model were also numerous heat exchangers including the whole pre-heating section. Air and CO[subscript 2] compression was also incorporated into the model. As a separate flow sheet the chemical absorption process was modeled as a hot potassium carbonate process. The models were linked by Microsoft Excel. For the CO[subscript 2] capture system the model was not directly linked to Excel but instead a simple separator model was included in the reforming flow sheet with inputs such as split ratios, temperatures, and pressures from the absorption model. Outputs from the potassium model also included pump work and reboiler duty. A main focal point of the study was off-design simulations. For these steady-state off-design simulations GT MASTER by Thermoflow in conjunction with Aspen Plus were used. Also, inputs such as heat exchanger areas, compressor design point, etc., were linked in from the Aspen Plus reforming design model. Results indicate a net plant efficiency of 43. 2 % with approximately a 2 %-point drop for an 80 % part load case.

At anyone time one or more plants can be down for maintenance and the others online and delivering to the pipe line that distributes their product to nearby steel plants, and to the liquid reservoirs (perlite insulated tanks) of 160, 160 and 200 E 6 SCF. At {{the time of our}} visit two plants were down and two were on line. The following describes the characteristics of one of the four plants. The cycle requires a base compressor (Brown Boveri, 22, 600 hp) that pumps to 90 - 100 psig, and a <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> (Clark, 14, 000 hp) that pumps to 300 psig. Filter houses (ca. 20 -ft x 20 -ft) feed the suctions and the discharge is scrubbed by dual, molecular sieve, beds 0 300 psi (6 - 8 hour cycle time). The beds are provided with dust blow down and down stream filter provisions. The scrubbers remove CO 2, the heavy HC, and water. The effectiveness of the scrubbers is measured by the record 6 years one of the plants ran w/o the need for thawing. The thaw operation takes about 4 days. It was interesting to learn that a plant can be brought on line in two and one half hours from a warm start. Major swings from N 2 rich to O 2 rich production take about an hour. Argon is a small constituent in air (0. 61) and thus not a major product. It comes off the main column at 761 Ar balance air components and is further purified in another column to 2 % N 2, 2 % O 2. The stream is then warmed, H 2 added, and run though a palladium deoxo to combine the O 2 to water. The water is removed in a dryer and the product reliquified to seperate the nitrogen. The final product is either drawn off and pumped to storage, or, in the case of case of the high purity product, pressure transfered directly from the final column to a properly cooled and purged truck backed right up to the column. The high purity product can be as low as 0. 3 ppm 02 by proper application of these procedures. Liquid Argon is the only product for which standing, loaded, trailers are provided vent recovery lines.

40|$|The Laboratory of Industrial Energy {{systems has}} {{evaluated}} {{a series of}} high performance air-water heat pump concepts with the aim to retrofit existing fuel fired boilers for residential hydronic heating systems. The results are published {{within the framework of}} the Swiss Retrofit Heat Pump project, which is conducted by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy. The two-stage heat pump cycle has shown the best efficiency prospects. Oil migration between the upper stage and lower stage compressors is the main obstacle for commercialization in the low heat rate range. The oil mass concentration is measured by the Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrospopy (FTIR) method with an attenuated total reflection cell (ATR). This method was calibrated on a separated test loop and compared to measurements of mass-sampling and of density by a Coriolis effect densitymeter. Infrared analysis gives a precision of < 0. 1 % of oil concentration and the detection limit was identified at about 0. 3 %. Density measurements cannot be used in the ordinary temperature range of the liquid line in the heat pump. Mass sampling and the FT-IR measurements give corresponding results. An air-water heat pump (10 kWth, R- 407 C) was build in the laboratory to perform comparison tests in the single-stage and two-stage heating modes. The main elements of the heat pump are: two scroll type compressors, a brazed plate condenser, a finned tube evaporator, an economizer heat exchanger and two electronic expansion valves. Defrosting is done by cycle inversion with a 4 -way reversing valve. Measured improvements on the two-stage heating mode of 30 % for the COP and 24 % for the heat output comparing to the corresponding test point (A- 7 /W 50) in the single stage configuration have been shown. Important reductions of the maximum system temperature at the outlet of the compressors enable an extended range of application (including the point A- 12 /W 65). In the two-stage heating mode an oil transfer rate of 5 - 10 g/min from the high pressure stage to the low pressure stage compressor was detected in all tested conditions, which is strongly limiting the continuous service of the heat pump. For long term running tests an additional balancing system composed of an oil pump and an oil vessel has been installed. The circulating oil concentration is between 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % for the two-stage configuration as measured with the FT-IR method. In single-stage mode the concentration is lower than 0. 2 % and only the mass sampling technique provided reliable results. Sensibility analysis in changing the regulation parameters did not give concluding results in order to design a stable configuration of the two-stage heat pump. In absence of integrated two-stage scroll compressors intermediate solutions have to be considered. These consist in the implementation of a <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> or the implementation of an oil separator at the outlet of the high pressure stage compressor coupled with a oil return management or a periodic shut down of the heat pump with external balancing of the oil level in the crankcase. An adapted heat transfer model for refrigerant-oil mixtures was developed, in order to investigate the theoretical impact of oil in the evaporator...|$|E

Objectives for the thesis work were process design and integration of NG pre-combustion CO 2 capture plants, and evalution, through process simulation, of the concepts. An {{important aspect of the}} evaluation was investigation of plant flexibility, specifically off-design analysis. Contributions comprised detailed heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) design for NG pre-combustion cycles and off-design behavior of the integrated reforming combined cycle (IRCC). Additional contributions were quantification of the efficiency potential of a process, subsystem efficiency losses, and model uncertainties. The IRCC with pre-combustion CO 2 capture is a process for generating power with very low CO 2 emissions, typically below 100 g CO 2 /net kWh electricity. This should be compared to a state-of-the-art natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) with CO 2 emissions around 365 g CO 2 /net kWh electricity. The IRCC process reforms natural gas to a syngas, converts the CO to CO 2 in the shift reactors, separates the CO 2 in the capture subsystem, and the resulting hydrogen-rich fuel is used for the gas turbine (GT) in a combined cycle setup. For the reforming of natural gas, an air-blown autothermal reformer was selected for the processes studied. Included {{in the study of the}} IRCC were process design and integration, reliability analysis, thermodynamic analyses through process simulation, analysis of efficiency losses and efficiency potential, and uncertainty analysis. As part of the design process, HRSG design proved important. The design of an HRSG for an IRCC plant requires the ability to operate on both a hydrogen-rich fuel and on NG. Also, since a significant amount of steam is produced from the heat generated in the autoreforming process, the HRSG design differs from a design in an NGCC plant. For an IRCC with a lot of high-pressure saturated steam generated in the process, a single-pressure steam cycle can actually perform in parity with a dual- or triple-pressure system (with or without reheat). Preheating of process streams further add to the complexity. The complexity of selecting an HRSG design increased when also considering that steam could be superheated and low-pressure and intermediate-pressure steam could be generated in the reforming process heat exchangers. For the concept studied it was also of importance to maintain a high net plant efficiency when operating on NG. Therefore the selection of HRSG design had to be a compromise between NGCC and IRCC operating modes. Duct burning proved positive for plant flexibility and the option to switch between a hydrogen-rich fuel and NG for the GT. Functional analysis and FMECA are important steps in a system reliability analysis, as they can serve as a platform and basis for further analysis. Also, the results from the FMECA can be interesting for determining how the failures propagate through the system and their failure effects on the operation of the process. From the FMECA performed in this work, it is clear that the gas turbine is the most critical equipment in an IRCC plant. One of the reasons for this is the process integration between the power island and the pre-combustion process. For example, the gas turbine feeds air to the ATR and receives fuel from the pre-combustion process. This integration has an effect on the overall reliabilityof the system. In addition to the integration issues, the gas turbine technology is less mature for hydrogen fuels than for natural gas fuels. It should also be mentioned that even in an NG-fired combined cycle plant the gas turbine is the most critical equipment. The need for part load analysis and consideration to dual fuel capability were important conclusions from the reliability analysis since many of the failures resulted in IRCC plant shutdown (if no backup fuel) or operation at reduced load. Thermodynamic analyses through process simulation were conducted as part of the thesis work. By combining simulation tools for chemical engineering and power plant engineering analyses respectively, a representation of the overall system could be accomplished for an IRCC process. The reforming and CO 2 capture processes were simulated in Aspen Plus; the power island was simulated in GT PRO/GT MASTER. The IRCC process involved process integration between the power cycle and the reforming process meaning an efficient way of linking the softwares were important. The Aspen SimulationWorkbook and Thermoflow’s E-link proved capable of performing this task for an IRCC process. Design simulations showed net plant efficiencies between 41. 9 % and 45. 3 % with net plant power output in the range of 350 – 420 MW. The CO 2 capture rate ranged between 85. 1 % and 93. 4 % for the IRCC processes studied. The off-design simulations, as part of the plant flexibility analysis, showed the possibility to operate an IRCC plant at part load conditions down to approximately 60 % gas turbine load with capture efficiency penalties at part load similar to full load operation. Also, it can be concluded that considering off-design conditions, such as part load steam turbine extraction pressures and air <b>booster</b> <b>compressor</b> pressure ratio, are important during the design stage of a plant. Analysis of the contribution to efficiency losses in the IRCC process showed that the reforming losses were almost twice as high as the CO 2 capture losses. From the analysis,it was evident that to decrease the efficiency losses in an IRCC process, efforts should be concentrated towards improving (1) the reforming process to decrease fuel conversion losses and needed steam mass flow, (2) the CO 2 capture process to decrease the reboiler duty, (3) the gas turbine technology to allow for a higher firing temperature, and (4) the CO 2 compression process. When investigating the efficiency potential of the type of IRCC concepts studied in the thesis work, net plant efficiencies of 49 % was achieved and based on these results it is conceivable that efficiencies up towards 50 % could be realistic in a 5 – 10 years time horizon. Challenges to overcome to reach these high efficiencies include attenuating or eliminating process limitations due to metal dusting and reduced GT turbine inlet temperature. For the IRCC setup studied in the uncertainty analysis, results showed that there was considerable uncertainty in the predicted net power output whereas net plant efficiency, CO 2 capture rate, and CO 2 emitted were less affected by input uncertainties. Parameters with the largest impact on uncertainties of power output and efficiency predictions proved to be gas turbine inlet temperature, and compressor and turbine efficiencies. For the CO 2 emissions, the equipment pressure drop and the steam-to-carbon ratio proved important. Therefore, the focus of future work should be to reduce uncertainties in these parameters in order to improve the confidence in the IRCC model.
