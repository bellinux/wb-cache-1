Grid 1 (Pin 3) can receive either a Negative Bias or a Positive Bias. Pin-2 is the brightness voltage, and pin-3 is the video signal which rides on top of DC, and pin-2 is a DC Level which varies with the Brightness Control.

30|$|From Fig.  10 a, {{it can be}} {{observed}} that all the normalized hamming distances are less than the predetermined threshold distance, i.e., 0.18. It can also {{be observed}} that for ± 20 Photoshop scale the normalized hamming distance is larger as compared to that for Photoshop scale of ± 10. It {{may be due to}} the pixel values of the image slightly more disturbed with ± 20 Photoshop scale. The SVD coefficients of an image may slightly vary with these changes. It can also be observed that for same Photoshop scale the normalized hamming distances are different. The reason may be a variation of color sensitivity of image contents. But for the Photoshop scale range [− 20 + 20], all the normalized hamming distances are less than the selected threshold; hence, the proposed method is robust to <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The R-Zone Headgear (1995) {{was largely}} {{different}} from later units {{in that the}} game cartridge was inserted into a device that was strapped onto the user's head. The user would flip down a transparent lens {{that was designed to}} reflect the game images into the user's right eye. The head unit held the game being played and was connected to a controller with a cable approximately 2.5 ft long. The controller required 4 AAA batteries, sported a cartridge storage slot (for keeping an additional game protected and available), volume adjustment dial, and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustment</b> dial. This unit as a whole is sometimes thought to have been designed to compete against the Virtual Boy. The very first game to be distributed with this console was Batman Forever, based on the 1995 movie of the same name, followed by Sega's [...] arcade racing game Indy 500.|$|E
5000|$|The New Nintendo 3DS family {{features}} various {{changes from}} prior models. The systems feature a slightly refined design, featuring colored face buttons resembling the Super Famicom's and PAL version Super Nintendo Entertainment System's color scheme. The New Nintendo 3DS's screen is 1.2 {{times the size}} of the original Nintendo 3DS, while the screen of the XL variant is the same size as its predecessor. Some models are produced with an IPS screen for the upper display, but some still retain the old TN screen for upper display. There is no known correlation between model number or production date and display type. Nintendo has also not publicly addressed the discrepancies in production. A new feature known as [...] "Super Stable 3D" [...] improves the quality of the systems' autostereoscopic 3D effects by using a sensor to detect the angle that the player is viewing the screen at, and adjusting the effects to compensate.

40|$|A {{digital image}} {{analysis}} system has been developed to allow advanced quantitative measurement of microstructural features. This capability is maintained {{as part of the}} microscopy facility at Sandia, Livermore. The system records images digitally, eliminating the use of film. Images obtained from other sources may also be imported into the system. Subsequent digital image processing enhances image appearance through the contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The system measures a variety of user-defined microstructural features [...] including area fraction, particle size and spatial distributions, grain sizes and orientations of elongated particles. These measurements are made in a semi-automatic mode through the use of macro programs and a computer controlled translation stage.

40|$|Classic curvature-minimizing active contour {{models are}} often {{incapable}} of extracting complex shapes with points of high curvature. This paper presents a new active contour model which overcomes {{this problem and}} which {{can be applied to}} image segmentation as well as shape description in order to allow for quantitative and qualitative studies of shape measurements at multiple scales. Multiscale differential operators, which are invariant to linear intensity transformations such as contrast or <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments</b> and independent of coordinate transformations, are integrated into the model's spline energy functional. Whereas the image intensity gradient attracts the spline contour to image features, the isophote curvature of the image intensity function is used for matching the contour curvature. This novel curvature matching approach appears to be very useful for the extraction of very complex and strongly curved objects such as brain contours, results of which will be presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The PICture Unsupervised Classification with Human Analysis (PICUCHA) {{refers to}} a hybrid human-artificial {{intelligence}} methodology for pavement distresses assessment. It combines the human flexibility to recognize patterns and features in images with the neural network ability to expand such recognition to large volumes of images. In this study, the PICUCHA performance was tested with images taken with area-scan cameras and flash light illumination over a pavement with dark textures. These images are particularly challenging for the analysis because of the lens distortion and non-homogeneous illumination, generating artificial joints that happened at random positions inside the image cells. The chosen images were previously analyzed by other software without success because of the dark coluor. The PICUCHA algorithms could analyze the images with no noticeable problem and without any image pre-processing, such as contrast or <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Because of the special procedure used by the pavement engineer for the key patterns description, the distresses detection accuracy of the PICUCHA for the particular image set could reach 100 %...|$|R

40|$|The CRT is {{commonly}} used to display digital medical image data. The brightness {{as a function of}} input signal is different for each CRT, is nonlinear and poorly matched to the human eye's perception of brightness change, decreases over time, and is easily changed with hardware contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Previous studies have suggested display brightness functions which are based on human visual experiments and which produce the same contrast perception for small display value changes at all brightness levels. The best scale depends on CRT luminance and scene dependent variables. We have developed an X Window based client server approach to maintain perceptually linear display scales using unique transformation tables for many display devices.

30|$|An {{additional}} {{aspect of}} VLCs is that visible LEDS are also {{required to provide}} lighting at a constant power level and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustment</b> options. The human eye is not capable of distinguishing between power variations at the bit level for typical transmission speeds under consideration in VLC systems (tens to hundreds of Mb/s). However, long series of ' 1 's and ' 0 's lead to long-term power variations that are perceived as flickering. Flickering is harmful for the human eye and several approaches, which aim at maintaining a constant DC-component in the emitted VLC signals, {{have been taken to}} mitigate its effect. The most common mitigation technique is to use PPM, in which transmitted symbols maintain a pre-determined percentage of ' 1 's and ' 0 's. A performance analysis of PPM variants may be found in [134, 146]. Another approach involves using DC-balanced line coding such as modified 4 b 5 b, 5 b 6 b or 8 b 10 b over OOK [147]. As far as <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustment</b> is concerned, it is accomplished by combining line coding with pulse-width-modulation (PWM) variants [147, 148]. Under this scheme, line coding provides a DC-component whose amplitude can be adjusted by varying the duty cycle of the PWM.|$|E
40|$|Adjusting {{photographs}} to obtain compelling renditions requires skill and time. Even contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments</b> are challenging because they require {{taking into account}} the image content. Photographers are also known for having different retouching preferences. As the result of this complexity, rule-based, one-size-fits-all automatic techniques often fail. This problem can greatly benefit from supervised machine learning but the lack of training data has impeded work in this area. Our first contribution is the creation of a high-quality reference dataset. We collected 5, 000 photos, manually annotated them, and hired 5 trained photographers to retouch each picture. The result is a collection of 5 sets of 5, 000 example input-output pairs that enable supervised learning. We first use this dataset to predict a user’s adjustment from a large training set. We then show that our dataset and features enable the accurate adjustment personalization using a carefully chosen set of training photos. Finally, we introduce difference learning: this method models and predicts difference between users. It frees the user from using predetermined photos for training. We show that difference learning enables accurate prediction using only a handful of examples. 1...|$|R

White plasterboards were set behind the display. The window blinds were pulled down and fluorescent lights in the ceiling were turned on, confirming no reflection glare was on the display screen and rim.

40|$|The U. S. Army's CECOM Center for Night Vision and Electro-Optics, C 2 NVEO, {{has been}} {{conducting}} a series of Human Perception tests. These tests score military observers {{on their ability to}} identify and recognize thermal images. The results of these tests are used to develop and refine the Night Vision FLIR Performance Model (FLIR 9 O/ACQUIRE). The Thermal Image Training Package is a useful byproduct of these tests. It was originally developed to train military observers for the Perception Tests, but the soldiers we were testing pointed out its value for general training. Since that time, the package has been used by several Army units and {{has been found to be}} a valuable asset for training. The Thermal Image Training Package consists of software and imagery designed to quickly teach an observer how to recognize and identify thermal images. It runs on an IBM- PC/AT compatible computer with VGA graphics and a hard disk. It loads into a computer in about 15 minutes and a complete training session is self paced and usually takes less than two(2) hours. It is effective, inexpensive and simple to use. The package uses actual thermal images, simulated ranges, allows contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments,</b> black or white hot polarity, red, green or gray screen coloring and provides output files of scores for progress checking and analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a comparative analysis of 34 measures published in the scientific literature and used for evaluation of the image quality without a reference image. In English literature, they are called no-reference (NR) measure or measures NR-type. The first article, the term no-reference, was published in 2000 and each year {{a growing number of}} publications on new measures NR-type. However, comparative studies of such measures is not practically conducted. Such measures are very important for a) just made photo quality evaluation, b) assessment of image enhancement transformations and selection of their parameters (such as contrast and <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments,</b> tone-mapping, decolorization and others). Publicly available image quality databases used for study no-reference quality measures (TID 2013, etc.), contain 4 - 5 variants of images distorted by predefined transformations with unknown parameters. We presented six types of experiments to analyze correlation of the computed numerical quality values with visual estimates of the test images quality. Four of the experiments are new: comparison of images after gamma-correction and contrast enhancement with different parameters, as well as analysis of the retouched images and photos taken with different focal length. It was shown experimentally that no one of the known no-reference quality assessment measure is universal, and the calculated value cannot be converted to a quality scale, excluding factors influencing the distortion of the image. Most of the studied measures calculates local estimates in small neighborhoods, and their arithmetic mean is the quality index of the image. If the image contains large areas of uniform brightness, the measures of this type can give incorrect quality assessment, which will not correlate with the visual assessments. </p...|$|R
30|$|Recently the {{researchers}} in an image hashing area have proposed some good hashing methods. Tang et al. [24] have enhanced the earlier work [2] by incorporating security of hash and replacing NMF by invariant vector distance. This method is robust to many content-preserving operations, but {{the limitation of}} corner forgery detection has not been solved. The FMT and CS have been combined to design hashing technique by Sun and Zeng [25]. This method is robust to scaling, and transition attacks, but limited to large angle rotation. Wang et al. [26] proposed an image hashing by concatenating the features from image blocks and key points. This method is robust to some digital image manipulation, identifies the forged area, but sensitive for large angle rotation. The quaternion discrete Fourier transform has been combined with the log-polar transform to design a hashing technique [27]. In this method, a three-color channel has been used and the method is robust to rotation of large degree, but unable to locate forged area. Li et al. [28] proposed a hashing method using selective quaternion. It is robust to some content-preserving operations but is variant to brightness and contrast changes. The adaptive local features have been considered for a hash generation by Yan et al. [29]. This method is robust to digital image manipulations, but is insensitive to color forgery. Qin et al. [30] presented an image hashing algorithm by using block truncation coding (BTC). It is not robust to <b>brightness</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The concept of ring partition and color vector angle {{has been used to}} design image hash by Tang et al. [31]. It is robust to content-preserving operations, but with the cost of around 20 % image content loss.|$|R
