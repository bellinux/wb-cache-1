5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the <b>budget</b> <b>debate,</b> which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E

Reports emerged of Kennedy's ill-health in 2003 {{at the time of}} crucial debates on the Iraq War and after the 2004 Budget along with linked rumours of a drinking problem which were strenuously denied at the time by both Kennedy and his party. The Times published an apology over a report it had made stating Kennedy had not taken part in that year's <b>Budget</b> <b>debate</b> because of excessive drinking.|$|E
25|$|Young was {{an outspoken}} {{advocate}} for large Detroit construction projects, {{and his administration}} saw {{the completion of the}} Renaissance Center, Detroit People Mover, the General Motors Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Plant, the Detroit Receiving Hospital, the Chrysler Jefferson North Assembly Plant, the Riverfront Condominiums, the Millender Center Apartments, the Harbortown retail and residential complex, 150 West Jefferson, One Detroit Center & the Fox Theater restoration, among other developments. During Young's last two administrations there was opposition among some neighborhood activists to these large construction projects. This opposition typically manifested itself in rigorous <b>budget</b> <b>debate</b> rather than in serious electoral challenges against Young. Most of the time Young prevailed over this opposition, seeking jobs and economic stimulus as a way to help rebuild Detroit's neighborhoods.|$|E
5000|$|Bruce was a vocal {{critic of}} the {{proposed}} state <b>budget</b> <b>debated</b> during the 2008 legislative session, characterizing the budget's $3,500 in expenditures per Colorado resident as [...] "fiscal child abuse." [...] During <b>budget</b> <b>debates,</b> Bruce offered unsuccessful amendments to eliminate 524 new employees at colleges and universities, to cut a federally funded program for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and to prevent the transfer of 165 contract corrections employees to state payrolls.|$|R

500|$|On March29, in the {{aftermath}} of the insurgent victory on Brown's adjournment motion, Aberhart gave notice of closure on the <b>budget</b> <b>debate.</b> Belatedly realizing that this move would be risking his government in a vote that he might very well lose, he then announced that he would seek the consent of the legislature to withdraw his closure motion and move an interim supply motion instead. The unanimous consent needed to withdraw the closure motion was refused, and the motion itself was defeated. That evening, Aberhart negotiated with the insurgents for four hours until a compromise was accepted: the insurgents would support the supply bill, in exchange for which the cabinet would introduce a bill amending the Social Credit Measures Act to establish a board of MLAs empowered to appoint a commission of [...] "experts" [...] to implement social credit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to his critics, including Steve Poizner, Maldonado said, [...] "Since the budget was passed, you have gone around the state criticizing it and the role six Republicans played in its passage. Your recent statements condemning Propositions 1A-1F are very frustrating. During the <b>budget</b> <b>debate,</b> which lasted over 100 days, I heard from thousands of Californians who {{took the time to}} give me their input on the state budget.

2500|$|Time is {{allocated}} for {{discussion of the}} annual budget after it is tabled by the Minister of Finance; however, most MPs spend {{much of the time}} questioning the government on other issues. Shad contends that although about 20 days are given for discussion of the budget, [...] "the <b>budget</b> <b>debate</b> is used to hit the government on the head about everything else other than the budget. From potholes to education policy to illegal immigrants." [...] If Parliament votes to reject the budget, it is taken as a vote of no-confidence, forcing the government out of office. The government will then either have to reform itself with a new cabinet and possibly new Prime Minister, or call for a general election. As a result, Shad states that [...] "MPs may criticize, they may have their say but the government will have its way" [...] {{when it comes to the}} budget.|$|E

I focused on the debating strategies and the political opinions formulated by both parties. First, it will be explained what populism is.

2500|$|The {{project is}} the largest and costliest {{transport}} infrastructure project ever proposed by the provincial government but was never discussed in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature or submitted to any significant public debate before it was approved and put out to tender. [...] Initial cost estimates came in at some R3.5 - 4 billion in 2000 when the project was announced by Premier Shilowa. This figure was revised upwards to R 7 billion {{for the purposes of}} the EIA process in 2003 and was finally revealed as being R20 billion (US$3.7 billion) in 2005, after the successful bidder for the project was announced and a contract came into existence. National and provincial government will contribute R20 billion in equal proportions and Bombela will contribute the balance of direct project costs. Loan funding will constitute a large part of these amounts but the financing costs involved have not been stated. [...] The sunk costs for the project will be more than R20 billion. In March 2008, Jeremy Cronin, chairman of the National Assembly's transport portfolio committee and deputy secretary-general of the SACP, complained that the cost had apparently quietly crept up to R35 billion. Cronin has long opposed the project and told the SA Parliament's lower house during a <b>budget</b> <b>debate</b> that his information was that the project's cost was escalating “quietly and below the radar screen”, though MPs “were told, hand on heart, here in Parliament just a few years ago, what the written-in-stone absolute upper limit was [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|NMPs are {{supposed}} to be non-partisan but after it had been announced on 7 July 2009 that Calvin Cheng {{would be one of the}} nine people nominated to be NMPs it was disclosed by Today newspaper that he was a member of Young PAP, the youth wing of the People's Action Party. The following day, Cheng wrote to the newspaper stating that he had formally resigned from Young PAP on 8 July, and that in any case he had been an inactive member, having never collected his membership card or attended any PAP branch activities. This led to a journalist commenting that his attitude had been [...] "cavalier" [...] and [...] "whimsical", and a Young PAP member writing on the Forum page of The Straits Times that his remarks had raised doubts about the Young PAP's credibility. The Constitution does not explicitly bar NMPs from being members of political parties, and Gerard Ee was also a PAP member when he was an NMP. He did not feel he had to resign, as since he was not subject to the party whip he would not be prevented from expressing independent views in Parliament. Despite these initial criticisms, The Straits Times reported that Cheng [...] "left the strongest impression on many elected Members of Parliament", following speeches he made during his maiden <b>budget</b> <b>debate</b> in Parliament in 2010. In his final speech during Budget 2011 before Parliament was dissolved for the general election that year, Cheng argued for the Government to educate the Internet generation instead of regulating the Internet to deal with threats such as [...] "misinformation and disinformation", calling it [...] "pointless". He went on to say that the Internet might be a [...] "wild card" [...] during the general election.|$|E

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis, budgetary discipline has taken centre stage in politics. More than ever a country's budget mirrors the true policy preferences of the legislative majority beyond all political discourse and cheap talk. The paper sheds light on mandate fulfilment in the field of public spending and fiscal policy in general. Based on previous work on pledge fulfilment in Switzerland the paper compares publicised pre-electoral statements of MPs on public spending and the development of the public finances with their post-electoral legislative behaviour during <b>budget</b> <b>debates</b> and votes. The findings of the paper confirm the results of the aforementioned earlier studies and point to the potential of budgetary statements for future mandate fulfilment research...|$|R
40|$|After {{watching}} the <b>budget</b> <b>debates</b> {{for a few}} weeks, I am a little clearer on where we are, the short term options, and the long term choices. We know that CSU faces at least a 683 M permanent cut, about 13 %. We have participated in various legislative charades like selling the lottery to offset the shrinking general fund on which we rely. Like the Beverly Hillbillies we have dreamt of bubbling crude oozing cash into our coffers. And now we fantasize of federal stimulus lubricating fiscal dysfunction. But a temporary potion won???t restore our power permanently. While we try to avoid long-term reality with short-term fixes, reality returns to haunt us.
