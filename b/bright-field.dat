50|$|In STEM, <b>bright-field</b> {{detectors}} {{are located}} {{in the path of the}} transmitted electron beam. Axial <b>bright-field</b> detectors {{are located in}} the centre of the cone of illumination of the transmitted beam, and are often used to provide complementary images to those obtained by ADF imaging. Annular <b>bright-field</b> detectors, located within the cone of illumination of the transmitted beam, have been used to obtain atomic resolution images in which the atomic columns of light elements such as oxygen are visible.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bright-field</b> {{microscopy}} is {{the simplest}} of all the optical microscopy illumination techniques. Sample illumination is transmitted (i.e., illuminated from below and observed from above) white light, and contrast in the sample is caused by attenuation of the transmitted light in dense areas of the sample. <b>Bright-field</b> microscopy is {{the simplest of}} a range of techniques used for illumination of samples in light microscopes, and its simplicity makes it a popular technique. The typical appearance of a <b>bright-field</b> microscopy image is a dark sample on a bright background, hence the name.|$|E
50|$|While the {{dark-field}} image may first {{appear to}} be a negative of the <b>bright-field</b> image, different effects are visible in each. In <b>bright-field</b> microscopy, features are visible where either a shadow is cast on the surface by the incident light or a part of the surface is less reflective, possibly by the presence of pits or scratches. Raised features that are too smooth to cast shadows will not appear in <b>bright-field</b> images, but the light that reflects off the sides of the feature will be visible in the dark-field images.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bright-field</b> {{microscopy}} may use critical or Köhler illumination {{to illuminate}} the sample.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bright-field</b> {{microscopy}} is {{a standard}} light-microscopy technique, and therefore magnification {{is limited by the}} resolving power possible with the wavelength of visible light.|$|E
5000|$|The {{light path}} of a <b>bright-field</b> {{microscope}} is extremely simple, no additional components are required beyond the normal light-microscope setup. The light path therefore consists of: ...|$|E
5000|$|Methyl {{green is}} used {{commonly}} with <b>bright-field,</b> {{as well as}} fluorescence microscopes [...] to dye the chromatin of cells {{so that they are}} more easily viewed.|$|E
5000|$|Annular <b>bright-field</b> imaging detects {{electrons}} transmitted {{directly through}} the sample, and measures the wave interference produced by {{their interactions with}} the atomic nuclei. This technique can detect light atoms with greater sensitivity than annular dark-field imaging methods. In fact, oxygen, nitrogen, lithium, and hydrogen in crystalline solids have been imaged using annular <b>bright-field</b> electron microscopy. Thus, it is theoretically possible to obtain direct images of the atoms in the DNA chain; however, the structure of DNA is much less geometric than crystalline solids, so direct imaging without prior labeling may not be achievable.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bright-field</b> {{microscopy}} typically has low {{contrast with}} most biological samples, as few absorb light {{to a great}} extent. Staining is often required to increase contrast, which prevents use on live cells in many situations. <b>Bright-field</b> illumination is useful for samples that have an intrinsic color, for example chloroplasts in plant cells.Image:Paper_Micrograph_Bright.png|Bright-field illumination, sample contrast comes from absorbance {{of light in the}} sampleImage:Paper_Micrograph_Cross-Polarised.png|Cross-polarized light illumination, sample contrast comes from the rotation of polarized light through the sampleImage:Paper_Micrograph_Dark.png|Dark-field illumination, sample contrast comes from light scattered by the sampleImage:Paper_Micrograph_Phase.png|Phase-contrast illumination, sample contrast comes from interference of different path lengths of light through the sample ...|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, in a {{diffused}} <b>bright-field</b> setup (see Fig. 2) the illumination {{of the film}} is provided through a translucent slab (diffuser), and each point of the film receives light from all the directions.|$|E

50|$|The {{directed}} <b>bright-field</b> (see Fig. 1) has extremely strong {{directional characteristics}} {{by means of}} a point source and an optical system (condenser); in this case, each point of the photographic film receives light from only one direction.|$|E
50|$|Parfocal {{microscope}} objectives stay in focus when magnification is changed; i.e., if the microscope is switched from {{a higher power}} objective (e.g., 40×) to a lower power objective (e.g., 10×), the object stays in focus. Ideally, most <b>bright-field</b> microscopes are parfocal.|$|E
5000|$|Most LOM {{observations}} are conducted using <b>bright-field</b> (BF) illumination, where {{the image of}} any flat feature perpendicular to the incident light path is bright, or appears to be white. But, other illumination methods can be used and, in some cases, may provide superior images with greater detail. Dark-field microscopy (DF), is an alternative method of observation that provides high-contrast images and actually greater resolution than <b>bright-field.</b> In dark-field illumination, the light from features perpendicular to the optical axis is blocked and appears dark while the light from features inclined to the surface, which look dark in BF, appear bright, or [...] "self-luminous" [...] in DF. Grain boundaries, for example, are more vivid in DF than BF.|$|E
5000|$|Unstained {{biological}} structures appear mostly transparent under <b>Bright-field</b> microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable {{quantities of}} light. Nevertheless, {{the variation in}} the materials that constitutes these structures also corresponds to {{a variation in the}} refractive index. The following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude differences: ...|$|E
50|$|CISH {{has some}} {{advantages}} over FISH in the {{reagents and equipment}} it uses. As noted above, CISH is much cheaper and is easier to use because it uses <b>bright-field</b> microscopes instead of fluorescence microscopes. In addition, the CISH reagents are more stable than the FISH reagents so {{it is possible to}} store the samples and examine the same sample multiple times. FISH reagents fade overtime due to photobleaching so a sample can only be examined once. Apart from the expensive fluorescence microscope, FISH also requires a high-resolution digital camera to capture micrographs of the sample before the fluorescence fades. Another advantage of using <b>bright-field</b> microscopy is that the tissue or cell sample as a whole can be visualized through CISH whereas cell morphology is difficult to assess using fluorescence microscopy in FISH.|$|E

50|$|In case of high {{scattering}} fraction, the attenuance {{provided by}} the image particles changes considerably with the degree of collimation of the illumination. In Figure 3 the same silver-based film is reproduced in directed and diffused <b>bright-field</b> setups. The global contrast also changes: the contrast {{on the left is}} much stronger than that on the right.|$|E
50|$|Men with sperm {{motility}} defects often have {{high levels of}} sperm DNA fragmentation.The degree of DNA fragmentation in sperm cells can predict outcomes for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and its expansion intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The sperm chromatin dispersion test (SCD) and TUNEL assay are both effective in detecting sperm DNA damage. Using <b>bright-field</b> microscopy, the SCD test appears to be more sensitive than the TUNEL assay.|$|E

The larger spheres are expanded polystyrene beads which were compressed and fused together. The bright, star-shaped hole {{at the center of}} the image is an air-gap between the beads where the bead margins have not completely fused. Each bead is made of thin-walled, air-filled bubbles of polystyrene.|$|E
5000|$|Probe {{design for}} CISH {{is very similar}} to that for FISH with {{differences}} only in labelling and detection. FISH probes are generally labelled with a variety of different fluorescent tags and can only be detected under a fluorescence microscope, whereas CISH probes are labelled with biotin or digoxigenin [...] and can be detected using a <b>bright-field</b> microscope after other treatment steps have been applied.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of scattering, the attenuance {{provided}} by the emulsion is independent of the collimation of the illumination; a dense point absorbs a big portion of light and a less dense point absorbs a smaller portion, irrespective of the directional characteristics of the incident light. In Figure 4 are reported the images of a dye-based film acquired in directed and diffused <b>bright-field</b> setups; the global contrast of the two images is about the same.|$|E
50|$|The main {{limitation}} of dark-field microscopy is the low light levels {{seen in the}} final image. This means that the sample must be very strongly illuminated, which can cause damage to the sample. Dark-field microscopy techniques are almost entirely free of artifacts, {{due to the nature}} of the process. However, the interpretation of dark-field images must be done with great care, as common dark features of <b>bright-field</b> microscopy images may be invisible, and vice versa.|$|E
50|$|Microscopic {{demonstration}} of the large typically shaped oocysts {{is the basis for}} diagnosis. Because the oocysts may be passed in small amounts and intermittently, repeated stool examinations and concentration procedures are recommended. If stool examinations are negative, examination of duodenal specimens by biopsy or string test (Enterotest) may be needed. The oocysts can be visualized on wet mounts by microscopy with <b>bright-field,</b> differential interference contrast (DIC), and epifluorescence. They can also be stained by modified acid-fast stain.|$|E
5000|$|An annular dark field {{detector}} collects electrons from {{an annulus}} around the beam, sampling far more scattered electrons than can pass through an objective aperture. This gives {{an advantage in}} terms of signal collection efficiency and allows the main beam to pass to an EELS detector, allowing both types of measurement to be performed simultaneously. Annular dark field imaging is also commonly performed in parallel with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy acquisition, and can be also done in parallel to <b>bright-field</b> (STEM) imaging.|$|E
50|$|Traditional phase-{{contrast}} methods enhance contrast optically, blending {{brightness and}} phase information in single image. Since {{the introduction of}} the digital camera in the mid-1990s, several new digital phase-imaging methods have been developed, collectively known as quantitative phase-contrast microscopy. These methods digitally create two separate images, an ordinary <b>bright-field</b> image and a so-called phase-shift image. In each image point, the phase-shift image displays the quantified phase shift induced by the object, which is proportional to the optical thickness of the object.|$|E
