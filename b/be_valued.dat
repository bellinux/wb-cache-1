5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should <b>be</b> <b>valued</b> {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to the ideals of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1876, several {{bills were}} {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives {{in an effort to}} resume the free coinage of silver. One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876. Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision. This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver certificates {{for the first time in}} United States history. The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes. The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878. What came to be known as the Bland–Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would <b>be</b> <b>valued</b> the same as sixteen ounces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Books were expensive, {{since each}} copy {{had to be}} written out {{individually}} on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed to the trade. The codex—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty {{in the time of}} the poet Martial (1st century AD), {{but by the end of}} the 3rd century was replacing the volumen and was the regular form for books with Christian content. Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France). The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies, as well as plagiarism or forgery, since there was no copyright law.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{valuation}} of accounting variables, growth opportunities, and insider retention for {{a sample of}} 1, 625 IPOs from three time-periods: 1986 - 1990, January 1997 through March 2000 (designated as the boom period), and April 2000 through December 2001 (designated as the crash period). Specifically, we test for valuation differences in the boom and crash relative to the more stable 1980 s. Additionally, we investigate whether accounting variables, growth, and insider retention of technology IPOs and internet IPOs <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> differently. Our major findings are as follows. For profitable non-tech firms in the 1980 s, income, sales, R&D, industry price-to-sales comparables, and insider retention are positively related to offer values. In the boom period, relative to the 1980 s, income, industry comparables, and insider retention <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> more. Sales, book value of equity, and R&D <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> less. The finding on income is surprising and contrary to claims made in the financial press. In the crash period, relative to the 1980 s, income <b>is</b> <b>valued</b> more, but R&D and industry comparables <b>are</b> <b>valued</b> less.
