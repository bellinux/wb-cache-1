5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to <b>be</b> <b>silent,</b> communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong is a {{loud and}} vocal species, {{and makes a}} variety of calls. Its main call is {{markedly}} different from the pied or grey currawongs and {{has been described as}} a combination of alternating kar and wheek sounds, killok killok, or even akin to part song and part human laughter. Although often noisy when flying in flocks, it can <b>be</b> <b>silent</b> when seeking prey or thieving food. Before or around dawn and at nightfall appear to be periods of increased calling, and birds are reported to be more vocal before rain or storms. Parents also make a long fluting whistle to summon their young.|$|E

5000|$|The world, Kossak-Szczucka wrote, <b>was</b> <b>silent</b> in {{the face}} of this atrocity.

[...] Those who <b>are</b> <b>silent</b> {{in the face}} of murder, she wrote, become accomplices to the crime. Kossak-Szczucka saw this largely as an issue of religious ethics. [...] "Our feelings toward Jews have not changed," [...] she wrote. [...] "We do not stop thinking of them as political, economic and ideological enemies of Poland." [...] But, she wrote, this does not relieve Polish Catholics of their duty to oppose the crimes being committed in their country.|$|R

25|$|A {{large part}} of Ghalib's poetry focuses on the praise and veneration of Prophet Muhammad, which shows that Ghalib was a devout Muslim.

25|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in {{attendance}} of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The {{introduction to the}} poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to <b>be</b> <b>silent,</b> and says that he knows all about herthat Freyja is not lacking in blame, {{for each of the}} gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to <b>be</b> <b>silent,</b> calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjectshe says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.|$|E

Viktoria asks him to <b>be</b> <b>silent</b> and appears on the stage during the competition, where she wins. The last scene of the movie is ambiguous, as it seems she loses her voice completely after the competition, yet the final chord is the victory at the competition.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} is {{a powerful}} transcriptional repressor, at least in CpG dense contexts. Transcriptional repression of protein-coding genes appears essentially limited to very specific classes of genes that need to <b>be</b> <b>silent</b> permanently and in almost all tissues. While DNA methylation {{does not have the}} flexibility required for the fine-tuning of gene regulation, its stability is perfect to ensure the permanent silencing of transposable elements. Transposon control is one the most ancient function of DNA methylation that is shared by animals, plants and multiple protists. It is even suggested that DNA methylation evolved precisely for this purpose.|$|E

25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed {{to clean out the}} rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to <b>be</b> <b>silent,</b> had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, it, no doubt, caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E
25|$|Throughout European and American history, {{upper class}} and upper-middle-class {{families}} had a prevailing attitude of ignoring their servants {{until they were}} needed for labor. Servants were expected to <b>be</b> <b>silent</b> and they had little opportunity to report criminal behavior within their own living/work environment. The American system of slavery, even in the post-emancipation era, took expectations of invisibility and powerlessness of servants to the extreme. Enslaved Africans {{found themselves in a}} position in which they were left to deal, without support of the law or society, the immoral slavery in the United States.Thus, due to lack of food and no pay, servants would often resort to petty theft. After enslaved blacks were emancipated, they made efforts to move beyond domestic work and manual labor, but many came to the realization that the only work available to them was domestic work or manual labor (both positions paid very little). Barbara Neely draws upon these societal oppressions to be the foundation of Blanche on the Lam.|$|E
25|$|Freyr himself {{interrupts}} at this point, {{and says}} that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until Ragnarök. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort Gerðr with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at Ragnarök. Byggvir (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says {{that if he had}} as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, {{and says that}} Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to <b>be</b> <b>silent,</b> that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and dais when men go to battle.|$|E
