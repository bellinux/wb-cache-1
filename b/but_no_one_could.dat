When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> tell them where Wyatt was buried, not even his closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E

25|$|Rather {{like their}} Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, {{but this was}} not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were {{sponsored}} and financed by the KGB, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> say that openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.|$|E

25|$|The {{house had}} a major roof leak that forced {{an end to the}} house tours in 1998. An {{architectural}} assessment was performed on the house and the cost to reconstruct the house was estimated between $116,020 and $126,220. Before the roof was repaired, there was a broken pipe in the dining room. The break happened in January 1999. It dumped 500,000 gallons of water through the first floor and into the basement. The rising basement waters extinguished the furnace, causing the water in the pipes and the radiators to freeze, then burst. City water meters knew there was a problem somewhere in the city, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> find the source of the leak. A volunteer at the house discovered the leak. The volunteer arranged for a heating repairman to stop the flooding. When the repairman left, he slammed the door closed. The door frame was so swollen that the volunteer was stuck inside. She had to go upstairs and call for help through a front window.|$|E
25|$|Once buffalo were located, hunting did {{not begin}} until the tribal priests {{considered}} the time propitious. The hunt began by the men stealthily advancing together toward the buffalo, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> kill any buffalo until the warriors of the tribe gave the signal, {{in order not to}} startle the animals before the hunters could get in position for the attack on the herd. Anyone who broke ranks could be severely beaten. During the chase, the hunters guided their ponies with their knees and wielded bows and arrows. They could incapacitate buffalo with a single arrow shot into the flank between the lower ribs and the hip. The animal would soon lie down and perhaps bleed out, or the hunters would finish it off. An individual hunter might shoot as many as five buffalo in this way before backtracking and finishing them off. They preferred to kill cows and young bulls, as the taste of older bulls was disagreeable.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{uses her}} skills to foil the Knights of the Round Table, {{especially}} Sir Lancelot, whom she alternately tries to seduce and to expose as Guinevere's adulterous lover. Some sources have King Nentres of Garlot as a suitor of young Morgan before marrying her sister Elaine. Her many lovers include Corrant, Gui of Carmelide (Cameliard), Guyanor, Helians of Gomeret, and Kaz of Gomeret, {{as well as}} Sir Huneson the Bald (also known as Hemison or Onesun). Huneson is mortally wounded when he attacks Tristan out of his jealously for Morgan's attention and dies after returning to her, and the anguished Morgan buries him in a tomb. In one version, she then takes possession of the lance {{that was used to}} kill Huneson, enchants it, and sends it Mark, who years later uses it to slay Tristan. In one of her castles, Tugan in Garlot, Morgan hid a magic book given to her by Merlin and that prophesied the deaths of Arthur and Gawain and who would kill them, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> read this passage without dying instantly. In the Prose Tristan, Morgan delivers by Sir Lamorak to Arthur's court a magical drinking horn from which no unfaithful lady can drink without spilling, hoping to reveal the infidelity and disgrace Guinevere. With same intent, she also gives Sir Tristan (Tristam) a shield depicting Arthur, Guinevere and Lancelot.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{working in}} the House of Commons as Paddy Ashdown's {{research}} assistant Cahill claims {{to have had a}} number of conversations with the security staff there. The most frequent remark was that [...] "everyone knew" [...] the story behind Neave's death <b>but</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> talk about it in detail because it would have been too dangerous. Cahill claims they did not believe INLA murdered Neave but that it was an [...] "inside job".|$|R

500|$|Lord Denning's {{report was}} awaited with great {{anticipation}} by the public. Published on 26 September, it {{concluded that there}} had been no security leaks in the Profumo affair and that the security services and government ministers had acted appropriately. Profumo had been guilty of an [...] "indiscretion", <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> doubt his loyalty. Denning also found no evidence to link members of the government with associated scandals such as the [...] "man in the mask". He laid most of the blame for the affair on Ward, an [...] "utterly immoral" [...] man whose diplomatic activities were [...] "misconceived and misdirected". Although The Spectator considered that the report marked the end of the affair, many commentators were disappointed with its content. Young found many questions unanswered and some of the reasoning defective, while Davenport-Hines, writing long after the event, condemns the report as disgraceful, slipshod and prurient.|$|E
500|$|According to Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon, [...] "since the beginning, one of {{the things}} that's {{separated}} us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak." [...] When asked if Capcom's Street Fighter series would ever do a crossover game with Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter producer Yoshinori Ono called Mortal Kombat a very different game from Street Fighter. Capcom's senior director of communications compared Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat by asking if the interviewer preferred the [...] "precision and depth" [...] of Street Fighter or the [...] "gore and comedy" [...] of Mortal Kombat; he also stated that the Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat rivalry was considered similar to the Coke and Pepsi rivalry in the 1990s. Senior producer of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, Hans Lo, himself also called Street Fighter [...] "a little more cartoonic fantasy" [...] in comparison to Mortal Kombat. In 2013, Boon named the hypothetical [...] "MKvsSF" [...] as his dream crossover game. In 2014, Boon said his team has remained in touch with Capcom, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> resolve the incompatibility problem of Mortal Kombat being much more brutal than Street Fighter.|$|E
500|$|While Trimmer {{was highly}} {{respected}} for her charity work during her lifetime {{and for her}} books long after her death, her reputation began to wane {{at the end of}} the 19th century and plummeted during the 20th century. One reason for this is that her textbooks, so widely used during the first half of the century, were replaced by secular books in the second half of the century. The tone of her books was no longer seen as consonant with British society. An early scholar of children's literature, Geoffrey Summerfield, describes her this way: [...] "Of all the morally shrill women active in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, she was probably the shrillest. Unbalanced, frenetic, paranoid, she may have been, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> deny her energy and perseverance in defending the souls of the children of England from the assaults of the devil." [...] Recently, however, children's literature scholars have attempted to view 18th-century children's literature within its historical context rather than judge it against modern tastes; scholars such as Grenby, Ruwe, Ferguson, Fyfe and Cosslett have reassessed Trimmer's work. Because Trimmer does not fit the mold of 20th-century feminism â€” that is, since she did not rebel against the social mores of her society as did Mary Wollstonecraft â€” she did not attract the attention of early feminist scholars. However, as Ruwe points out, [...] "by the confluence of political, historical, and pedagogical events at the turn of the century, a woman such as Trimmer was able to gain a greater visibility in the realm of public letters than was perhaps typical before or after"; Trimmer was a [...] "role model for other women authors", and these later authors often acknowledged their debt explicitly, as did the author of The Footsteps to Mrs. Trimmerâ€™s Sacred History.|$|E

50|$|Cicero {{mentions}} {{him several}} times and {{seems to have been}} familiar with some of his writings: Mnesarchus himself, said, that those whom we call orators were nothing but a set of mechanics with glib and well-practised tongues, <b>but</b> that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> be an orator but a man of true wisdom; and that eloquence itself, as it consisted in the art of speaking well, was a kind of virtue, and that he who possessed one virtue possessed all, and that virtues were in themselves equal and alike; and thus he who was eloquent possessed all virtues, and was a man of true wisdom.|$|R

Cao Chong said, [...] "Place the elephant on a boat and mark the water level. Then replace the elephant with other objects until the boat is submerged to the same level. The weight of the elephant can be found by summing up the weights of all the objects." [...] Cao Cao was delighted and he had Cao Chong's idea implemented.|$|E
2500|$|When first published, Don Quixote {{was usually}} {{interpreted}} as a comic novel. After the French Revolution, it was popular for its central ethic that individuals can be right while society is quite wrong and seen as disenchanting. In the 19th century, it {{was seen as a}} social commentary, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> easily tell [...] "whose side Cervantes was on". Many critics came to view the work as a tragedy in which Don Quixote's idealism and nobility are viewed by the post-chivalric world as insane, and are defeated and rendered useless by common reality. By the 20th century, the novel had come to occupy a canonical space as one of the foundations of modern literature.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "hypernormalisation" [...] {{is taken}} from Alexei Yurchak's 2006 book Everything was Forever, Until it was No More: The Last Soviet Generation, about the paradoxes {{of life in the}} Soviet Union during the 20 years before it collapsed. [...] A {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, he argues that everyone knew the system was failing, <b>but</b> as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> imagine any alternative to the status quo, politicians and citizens were resigned to maintaining a pretence of a functioning society.

60|$|All told {{then we had}} {{a rather}} nondescript and poor pack of hounds; and the fact {{discouraged}} me.

And with this pack of hounds I doubted that we <b>could</b> hold <b>one</b> of the vicious fighting species. But there was now nothing to do <b>but</b> try. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> tell.

2500|$|Ireland {{lost their}} debut One Day International, but England's win {{described}} by Cricinfo as [...] "unspectacular", with Marcus Trescothick making 113 after England chose to bat first. Irish native Ed Joyce opened the innings for England, scoring 10 {{before he was}} caught by Kevin O'Brien, but a 142-run partnership between Trescothick and Ian Bell for the fourth wicket brought 200 up for England. England scored 84 off the last ten overs, with Bell making an ODI career high of 80. Ireland did bat out 50 overs, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> match the scores of Trescothick and Bell; Andre Botha made the best attempt, but his 52 lasted 89 balls, well below the required run rate of six an over. Steve Harmison took three wickets, but conceded 58 runs after bowling an opening spell described by The Times as [...] "a curate's egg". Ireland's highest-scoring partnership was for the seventh wicket, with Andrew White adding 64 with O'Brien.|$|E
2500|$|The Church of England was {{at first}} also {{extremely}} hostile to the activities of Booth and The Salvation Army. The philanthropist, politician and evangelist Lord Shaftesbury {{even went so far}} as to describe Booth as the [...] "Anti-Christ". One of the main complaints against Booth was his [...] "elevation of women to man's status". Many found him dictatorial and hard to work with. Some of his own children denounced him as their leader and turned their backs on The Salvation Army, including his daughter Kate Booth and his sons Herbert and Ballington Booth, the latter founding a separate organisation, the Volunteers of America with himself as [...] "General". The evangelist Rodney [...] "Gipsy" [...] Smith left him because of his rigidity and D.L.

[...] Plutarch tells the story of how, in 344 BC, at twelve or thirteen years of age, Alexander won the horse by making a wager with his father: [...] A horse dealer named Philonicus the Thessalian offered Bucephalus to King Philip II for the remarkably high sum of 13 talents, <b>but</b> because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>could</b> tame the animal, Philip was not interested.
