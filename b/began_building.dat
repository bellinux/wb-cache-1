5|$|In 16th century England, Henry VIII <b>began</b> <b>building</b> Device Forts between 1539 and 1540 as {{artillery}} fortresses {{to counter}} the threat of invasion from France and Spain. They were built by the state at strategic points for the first powerful cannon batteries, such as Deal Castle, which was perfectly symmetrical, with a low, circular keep at its centre. Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Banks {{worked for}} Seaway National Bank in the {{off-season}} and enrolled in a banking correspondence course. He bought into several business ventures, including a gas station, during his playing career. Though he had been paid modestly in comparison to other baseball stars, Banks had taken the advice of Wrigley and invested much of his earnings. He later spent time working for an insurance company and for New World Van Lines. Banks <b>began</b> <b>building</b> assets that would be worth an estimated $4million {{by the time he}} was 55 years old.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda was proclaimed a town on 31 July 1893 {{with sales}} of the first allotments made on the same day.

Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the Northern Isles and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.|$|E

5|$|Walter <b>began</b> <b>building</b> {{a castle}} within the manor of Stanton Lacy; the {{fortification}} was originally called Dinham Castle, before it acquired its later name of Ludlow. Ludlow {{was the most}} important of Walter's castles: as well as being at the heart of his new estates, the site also lay at a strategic crossroads over the Teme River, on a strong defensive promontory. Walter died in a construction accident at Hereford in 1085 and was succeeded by his son, Roger de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|A replica Arrow {{built by}} Allan Jackson {{was used in}} The Arrow, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) production. He <b>began</b> <b>building</b> a {{full-scale}} replica of the Arrow in 1989, and was approached by the producers of the Arrow miniseries in 1996, then about 70% complete, who made an offer to complete the construction if the replica {{could be used for}} the production. It was used on the miniseries and several public appearances at air shows. The replica was later donated to the Reynolds-Alberta Museum in his home town of Wetaskiwin, Alberta. While in a temporary outdoor collection, it was damaged in a wind storm in 2009. It has since been repaired, but is no longer on public display.|$|E
5|$|Balabushka's {{first job}} {{was as a}} wooden toy {{designer}} and maker, working for the Educational Equipment Company, then located at 71 West 23rd St., in Manhattan, which made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Thereafter he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company located on Greenwich Village's Jane Street. While on the job, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger of such craftsmanship that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills deepened he <b>began</b> <b>building</b> accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. In 1949, Balabushka applied for patent on a folding leg bracket mechanism he invented, which was granted in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitler's request, Heydrich and Himmler <b>began</b> <b>building</b> a dossier on Sturmabteilung (SA) leader Ernst Röhm in {{an effort}} to remove him as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi {{paramilitary}} organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitler's direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be liquidated, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot without trial, along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA's new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, a state that had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army <b>began</b> <b>building</b> fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E

In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to resolve a dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders <b>began</b> <b>building</b> Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E
