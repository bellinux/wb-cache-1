5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the story as a film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E
5|$|With {{the spiders}} distracted, Finn and Jake {{try to escape}} from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he {{presents}} to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked,</b> not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that she will have to eat him instead. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous egg sack emerges from her epigyne. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.|$|E

5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, {{whom he met}} as a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but he enjoyed the script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike The Wizard of Oz, which he would not bother remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director felt he had to symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E
5|$|Metallica {{released}} {{their debut}} album Kill 'Em All on the independent label Megaforce Records in July 1983. The album helped to establish thrash metal, a heavy metal subgenre defined by its brisk riffs and intense percussion. After finishing its promotional tour, Metallica began composing new material and from September began performing {{the songs that}} were to make up Ride the Lightning at concerts. Because the band had little money, its members often ate one meal a day and stayed at fans' homes while playing clubs across the US. An incident occurred when part of Metallica's gear was stolen in Boston, and Anthrax lent Metallica its equipment to complete the remaining dates. When not gigging, the band stayed in a rented house in El Cerrito, California, called the Metallica Mansion. Frontman James Hetfield felt uneasy about performing double duty on vocals and rhythm guitar so the band offered the job to Armored Saint singer John Bush, who turned down the offer because Armored Saint was doing well at the time. Hetfield gradually built confidence as lead vocalist and kept his original role. Metallica started recording on February 20, 1984 at Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album was produced by Flemming Rasmussen, founder of Sweet Silence, {{who went on to}} produce the band's next two albums. Drummer Lars Ulrich chose Rasmussen <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> his work on Rainbow's Difficult to Cure (1981) and was keen to record in Europe. Rasmussen, who had not heard of Metallica, agreed to work on the album, even though his studio employees questioned the band's talent. Rasmussen listened to Metallica's tapes before the members arrived and thought the band had great potential. Metallica rehearsed the album's material at Mercyful Fate's practice room in Copenhagen.|$|E
25|$|Coppola hired Michael Smuin, a {{choreographer}} and {{co-director of}} the San Francisco Ballet, to stage the fight scene between Rusty James and Biff Wilcox <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the way he choreographed violence. He asked Smuin to include specific visual elements: a motorcycle, broken glass, knives, gushing water and blood. The choreographer spent a week designing the sequence. Smuin also staged the street dance between Rourke and Diana Scarwid, modeling it after one in Picnic featuring William Holden and Kim Novak.|$|E

25|$|Fortunately, he {{realized}} that he was ruining his life, and took up new interests. He began to draw. Then he took up blacksmithing, so he could repair the iron farm implements that had recently been introduced to the area. Self-taught as usual, he made his own tools, forge and bellows. He was soon doing a good business either repairing items or selling items he had created himself. His spurs and bridle bits were in great demand <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> to decorate them with silver. Although he maintained his store, he not only stopped drinking but stopped selling alcohol.|$|E
25|$|In Aliens, {{the adult}} creatures {{have a more}} {{textured}} head rather than a smooth carapace. In the commentary for Aliens, it was speculated that {{this was part of}} the maturation of the creatures, as they had been alive far longer than the original Alien, although James Cameron stated that he simply left the carapace off <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> them better that way. The smooth design of the carapace would be used again in Alien 3 and Alien: Resurrection, although made narrower with a longer muzzle and more prominent chin. This design would be kept in Alien versus Predator, and abandoned in Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in favor of the ribbed design.|$|E
25|$|Sony {{was born}} Warrick Swinney in Port Elizabeth on 12 September 1958. He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who. He was influenced by Indian music and cuisine and by the work of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. He learned to play tabla at the Hindu Sarat school in Durban. In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army {{to get in touch with}} him for camps; he chose Sony <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him a whole lot of punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself in a lot of the post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E

500|$|During the show's run, the {{characters}} of House and Wilson have been compared to [...] Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson. Wilson's portrayer, Robert Sean Leonard, has stated that his character and Dr. House were originally supposed to play these roles; but Dr. House's diagnostic team has taken over Dr. Watson's part. Leonard also read the script of the pilot episode of CBS' Numb3rs and was planning to audition. He auditioned for House instead because he felt he would more enjoy playing the character that House went to for help and <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> The Odd Couple dynamic of the relationship.|$|E
500|$|Ryo {{chose to}} {{distribute}} his music on Nico Nico Douga <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the website {{along with its}} response system, which enables user's comments to appear overlaid on the video screen. Ryo did not originally intend to use Hatsune Miku as the vocalist for his songs, and most members of Supercell {{did not even know}} of Miku until after [...] "Melt" [...] gained popularity. [...] Since Ryo did not know any singers, he was recommended by his friends to use Miku, which he thought was a good idea since videos using Miku were already widely being distributed on Nico Nico Douga at the time.|$|E
500|$|At Loyola, Shaughnessy {{retained}} {{his emphasis}} on the forward pass. In 1930, the Wolves beat larger but unprepared Iowa State and Detroit teams in consecutive weeks with the same passing play. During his tenure, he was called [...] "the greatest one man coaching staff in football." [...] He also brought to Loyola his {{modified version of the}} Minnesota shift, which he claimed no opponent had been able to completely counteract. In 1931, California considered Shaughnessy as a candidate for its head coaching job. Despite opportunities to coach elsewhere, Shaughnessy remained in New Orleans <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the city and it was his wife's hometown. He compiled a 38–16–6 record at Loyola from 1927 to 1932.|$|E

500|$|In {{a display}} of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and {{treatment}} of women, [...] "e went to bed with his ministers' wives, not only <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> these ladies {{but because it was}} a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. Mainly the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque roleand they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death." [...] Trujillo's sexual conquests and public humiliations of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In Niessa's words, [...] "The implication is that maximum virility equals political dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale also adapted Sharpe's Gold for ITV in 1995, as part {{of their}} series of adaptations of Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe novels. This was an {{assignment}} that surprised his agent; [...] "We didn't think he'd want to bother with them but he did. That was probably <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> the producer." [...] He returned to writing for radio {{for the first time since}} the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary The Quatermass Memoirs for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three Quatermass serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV Quatermass serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of Quatermass and the Pit, as the Professor.|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} during production, including [...] "Shot Down in Flames" [...] and [...] "IV". The former was rejected because Martin thought {{it sounded like}} a title The Beta Band would use. Taylor supported the name [...] "IV" [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> [...] "giving people the wrong impression all the time", and defended his opinion, saying [...] "if [...] give us any time, they would see that we're very serious about comedy ... and serious things as well". The album was called [...] "Made in the Dark" [...] because it was a title the band agreed on. Taylor considered the eponymous track to be one of his favourite songs, and thought it was nice to name the album after a thoughtful song, in contrast to Coming on Strong and The Warning, which he described as being [...] "big, slightly jokey, macho phrases".|$|E

500|$|Artist Dave Gibbons, who had {{collaborated with}} Moore on {{previous}} projects, recalled he [...] "must have {{heard on the}} grapevine {{that he was doing}} a treatment for a new miniseries. I rang Alan up, saying I’d like to be involved with what he was doing." [...] and Moore sent him the story outline. Gibbons told Giordano he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved. Gibbons brought colorist John Higgins onto the project <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> his [...] "unusual" [...] style; Higgins lived near the artist, which allowed the two to [...] "discuss [...] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean". Len Wein joined the project as its editor, while Giordano stayed on to oversee it. Both Wein and Giordano stood back and [...] "got out of their way"; Giordano remarked later, [...] "Who copy-edits Alan Moore, for God's sake?" ...|$|E
500|$|The only {{character}} {{developed with}} a racial description in mind was Dr. Miranda Bailey, who is portrayed by Chandra Wilson. Her character was written as a tiny blonde with curly hair, but when Wilson began speaking, Rhimes reported: [...] " [...] is exactly who Miranda is." [...] James Pickens Jr. {{was selected to}} appear as Dr. Richard Webber in the series' pilot and first season. Katherine Heigl wanted to portray Dr. Izzie Stevens as a brunette, but was requested to retain her natural blonde for the part. Isaiah Washington, who portrayed Dr. Preston Burke, initially read {{for the role of}} Shepherd, but was cast as Burke, because the original actor to play Burke had to withdraw. T. R. Knight signed on for the pilot as Dr. George O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> that the character was multi-faceted. Rounding out the season one cast was Justin Chambers as Dr. Alex Karev.|$|E
500|$|T. R. Knight {{signed on}} for the pilot as O'Malley, expecting that the role might be short-lived, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> that the {{character}} was multi-faceted. In October 2006, news reports surfaced that Washington had insulted Knight with a homophobic slur, during an argument with Patrick Dempsey (Derek Shepherd). Shortly after, {{the details of the}} argument became public, and Knight later disclosed that the slur made him come out as gay. [...] "I was under no delusions," [...] Knight said at the time. [...] "My friends on the set knew. We talked about it. Publicly it's not my thing to call up People magazine and be like, 'Hey, you want to know something about me?'...I could've just let it slide and not said anything, but it became important. It became important to make the statement." [...] The situation seemed somewhat resolved when Washington issued a statement, apologizing for his [...] "unfortunate use of words during the recent incident on-set".|$|E
