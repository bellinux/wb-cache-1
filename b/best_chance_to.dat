5|$|Arsenal {{began the}} match the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams, dominating in possession {{and the number of}} chances created. Tottenham created their <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> score in the first half, but struggled to find a breakthrough in the second half, hardly troubling the Arsenal defence. With neither team able to score after 90 minutes, the match ended in a draw, meaning each team held the trophy for six months each.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern that Republicans were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> overcome the obstacles.|$|E
5|$|The Judy Garland Show was an American musical variety {{television}} series that aired on CBS on Sunday nights during the 1963-1964 television season. Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, {{who for years}} had been reluctant to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> pull herself out of severe financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Weather {{conditions}} allowed both teams' defenses {{to dominate}} {{in the first}} half. Virginia Tech had the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> score of either team {{in the first half}} when it drove to a first down inside the Cincinnati two-yard line late in the first quarter. On four straight running plays, however, the Bearcats' defense held, and Virginia Tech was denied a scoring opportunity.|$|E
5|$|While {{there were}} many {{violations}} of the ceasefire, the incidents were relatively minor. The two governments immediately started complex diplomatic manoeuvres to bring world opinion on their side in case, as was widely expected, the conflict was resumed. However, the two sides were also careful to leave {{the door open for}} a peaceful solution. The latter course was promoted by France and most African states, while the Reagan Administration saw a resumption of the conflict as the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> unseat Gaddafi.|$|E
5|$|OK Computer was {{nominated}} for Grammy Awards as Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards in 1998, winning the latter. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the 1998 Brit Awards. The album was shortlisted for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognising the best British or Irish album of the year. The day before the winner was announced, oddsmakers had given OK Computer the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win among ten nominees, but it lost to New Forms by Roni Size/Reprazent.|$|E

Solar sails {{have one of the}} <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> be the next gossamer spacecraft flown in space. In the gossamer spacecraft community thus far, solar sails have always been considered a "low precision" application compared with, say, radar or optical devices. However, as this paper shows, even low precision gossamer applications put extraordinary demands on structural measurement systems {{if they are to be}} traceable to use in space...|$|R
40|$|Localization {{effects in}} the light {{scattering}} from random fluctuations of matter fields and space-time metric near the black hole horizon are shown to produce a pronounced peak in the angular distribution of second harmonics {{of light in the}} direction normal to the horizon. Such second harmonic light has the <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> escape the vicinity of the black hole. This phenomenon is similar to the well -known strong enhancement of diffuse second harmonic emission from a randomly rough metal surface in the direction normal to the surface...|$|R
50|$|The Vikings' two <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> score {{came later}} in the first quarter. Troy Walters {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 24 yards to give the Vikings good field position at the 39 yard line, but a false start penalty pushed them out of field goal range and they punted. On the next drive, Kerry Collins threw an interception to Robert Tate, and the Vikings attempted to capitalize with Daunte Culpepper throwing to the end zone, but Emmanuel McDaniel stole the pass from Carter for an interception.|$|R
5|$|The 2011–12 Columbus Blue Jackets {{season was}} the team's 12th {{season in the}} National Hockey League (NHL). The Blue Jackets' record of 29–46–7 was the worst record in the NHL for 2011–12 {{and the first time}} in {{franchise}} history they finished in last place. It also marked the third straight year that they missed the playoffs. Consequently, they had the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> receive the first overall selection in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft lottery, but lost out to the Edmonton Oilers and received the second pick instead.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt's record against Georgia was 6–1; {{its only}} loss was 4–0, in 1898, and the all-time score was 184–4 {{in favor of}} the Commodores. The Bulldogs were favored to win their first meeting since 1912. In the first quarter, both teams were evenly matched. The Commodores had their <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> score when Thomas Ryan beat the defense, but he dropped Neely's pass. Vanderbilt also had a chance to score when a Georgia field goal was blocked by Lynn Bomar and picked up by Tot McCullough, who was caught from behind before he could score.|$|E
5|$|In May 1878, Weaver {{accepted}} the Greenback nomination for the House of Representatives in the 6th district. Although Weaver's political career up to then {{had been as}} a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Since the start of the Civil War, Democrats had been in the minority across Iowa; electoral fusion with Greenbackers represented their <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> get their candidates into office. Hard-money Democrats objected to the idea, but some were reassured when HenryH. Trimble, a prominent Bloomfield Democrat, assured them that if elected Weaver would align with House Democrats on all issues other than the money question. Democrats declined to endorse any candidate at the 6th district convention, but soft-money leaders in the party circulated their own slate of candidates that included Democrats and Greenbackers. The Greenback–Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{not include}} the 1985 winner, Bernard Hinault. An El Mundo Deportivo writer believed LeMond, Moser, and Saronni to be the favorites to win the overall crown. In addition, the writer felt that Pedro Muñoz had the <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> win the race, out of all the Spanish riders entering the event. Atala-Ofmega sports director Franco Criblori believed that Saronni's results would depend on what form he could maintain in the mountains. In addition, Criblori thought Dutchman Johan van der Velde and Swiss rider Niki Rüttimann were two foreigners to consider for a high place in the general classification.|$|R
50|$|Leparoux {{had one of}} his <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> win the Kentucky Derby in 2012 {{with the}} talented colt Union Rags but could only finish seventh after a troubled trip. Leparoux told the horse's trainer {{that he had heard}} a pop (indicative of a {{possible}} injury) with three-eighths of a mile remaining in the race, but no problem was found the day after. The trainer called the race a disaster and replaced Leparoux for the Belmont Stakes with John Velazquez. Union Rags won the Belmont but never raced again due to an injury to his suspensory ligament.|$|R
25|$|In December 1996, Coleman {{announced}} he was leaving the DFL party to join the Republican Party.

25|$|The win was {{not without}} controversy, however. Many, {{including}} rival trainers, suggested the track watering amounted to bad sportsmanship employed to give Makybe Diva the <b>best</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> win the race. However, the track condition was upgraded to good straight after the Cup, and the winning time of 3:19.18 was consistent with that rating.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of the workshop and the reports of the working groups on sharing vulnerability data. We divided the obstacles to sharing vulnerability data into technical, motivational and consequential issues. We summarize and expand on the discussions of fundamental issues such as nomenclature, vocabulary, and the contents of vulnerability databases. There was considerable goodwill expressed at the workshop in favor of sharing vulnerability data. We discuss the respective advantages of the Open, Centralized, Federated, and Balkan data sharing models and the motivational obstacles to such sharing. We observe that no single proposition satisfies all parties involved; therefore, the parallel pursuit of two that cover the maximum number of interested parties, with minimal overlap, has the <b>best</b> <b>chances</b> <b>to</b> achieve success. p. ...|$|R
