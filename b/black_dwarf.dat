5|$|Over time {{intervals}} of around 30 trillion years, the Sun will undergo a close encounter with another star. As a consequence, {{the orbits of}} their planets can become disrupted, potentially ejecting them from the system entirely. If Earth is not destroyed by the expanding red giant Sun in 7.6 billion years and not ejected from its orbit by a stellar encounter, its ultimate fate will be that it collides with the <b>black</b> <b>dwarf</b> Sun due to the decay of its orbit via gravitational radiation, in 1020 (100 quintillion) years.|$|E
5|$|The post-asymptotic-giant-branch {{evolution}} is even faster. The luminosity stays approximately constant {{as the temperature}} increases, with the ejected half of the Sun's mass becoming ionised into a planetary nebula as the exposed core reaches 30,000 K. The final naked core, a white dwarf, will have a temperature of over 100,000 K, and contain an estimated 54.05% of the Sun's present day mass. The planetary nebula will disperse in about 10,000 years, but the white dwarf will survive for trillions of years before fading to a hypothetical <b>black</b> <b>dwarf.</b>|$|E
5|$|Warwick Davis as Nikabrik, a <b>black</b> <b>dwarf.</b> He is {{descendant}} of Ginarrbrik, who served the White Witch, and bears {{one of his}} rings, which was passed down from each generation. Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type: Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics, to allow Davis {{to ward off the}} audience's perceptions of him. Nikabrik's nose was based on Berger. Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic, because the grass is filled with ticks, so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs. Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the 1989 BBC production of Prince Caspian.|$|E

2500|$|Dwarfs {{are native}} to Narnia. They are called Sons of Earth by Aslan, {{as opposed to}} humans, who are called Sons of Adam or Daughters of Eve. Dwarfs exist {{in at least two}} varieties: <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs</b> and Red Dwarfs, {{distinguished}} by the colour of their hair. While many Red Dwarfs are kind and loyal to Aslan, <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs</b> appear to be more selfish and hostile. Dwarfs appearing in the books are male and live together in communities, although they are known to mingle with and reproduce with humans. For example, Prince Caspian's Tutor Cornelius is a half-dwarf, and Caspian's former nurse is described as [...] "a little old woman who looked as if she had dwarf blood in her".|$|R
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold <b>black</b> <b>dwarf.</b> Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is stable once formed and will {{continue}} to cool almost indefinitely, eventually to become a <b>black</b> <b>dwarf.</b> Assuming that the Universe continues to expand, it is thought that in 1019 to 1020 years, the galaxies will evaporate as their stars escape into intergalactic space.,§IIIA. White dwarfs should generally survive galactic dispersion, although an occasional collision between white dwarfs may produce a new fusing star or a super-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf which will explode in a Type Ia supernova.,§IIIC,IV. The subsequent lifetime of white dwarfs is thought to be on the order of the lifetime of the proton, known to be at least 1034–1035 years. Some grand unified theories predict a proton lifetime between 1030 and 1036 years. If these theories are not valid, the proton may decay by complicated nuclear reactions or through quantum gravitational processes involving a virtual black hole; in these cases, the lifetime is estimated to be no more than 10200 years. If protons do decay, the mass of a white dwarf will decrease very slowly with time as its nuclei decay, until it loses enough mass to become a nondegenerate lump of matter, and finally disappears completely.,§IV.|$|E
5|$|Most {{observed}} white dwarfs {{have relatively}} high surface temperatures, between 8,000K and 40,000K. A white dwarf, though, spends {{more of its}} lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures, so we should expect {{that there are more}} cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs. Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter, more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe, we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs. This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4,000K, and one of the coolest so far observed, WD 0346+246, has a surface temperature of approximately 3,900K. The {{reason for this is that}} the Universe's age is finite; there has not been enough time for white dwarfs to cool below this temperature. The white dwarf luminosity function can therefore be used to find the time when stars started to form in a region; an estimate for the age of our Galactic disk found in this way is 8 billion years. A white dwarf will eventually, in many trillions of years, cool and become a non-radiating <b>black</b> <b>dwarf</b> in approximate thermal equilibrium with its surroundings and with the cosmic background radiation. No black dwarfs are thought to exist yet.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{the death}} of his father, Krunch [...] "went into a rage the likes of which I've never seen before", {{according}} to Ray'd's recounting - tearing apart several of the attacking <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarves</b> (Builders). For some time it was believed that Krunch, along with {{the other members of the}} [...] "Northern Alliance", had either taken refuge in the Sister's fortress or been killed. Benny, Cale and Pella managed to rescue Ray'd from the <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarves</b> and traveled to Mechastone, where it was hoped that any survivors may have fled after the fall of Bloodrage Island. It was there that Krunch was found alive, and tearfully reunited with his adopted daughter and older brother.|$|R
25|$|King Tirian of Narnia {{calls on}} Aslan for help, and Jill and Eustace arrive in Narnia. They help Tirian and the {{remaining}} loyal Narnians battle the Calormenes and their allies, but are all forced through the stable door along with several <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs.</b> They find themselves not {{within the confines of}} a stable, but in a paradise: Aslan's Country. Aslan is there, with King Peter and the other Pevensies (except for Susan, who no longer believes in Narnia) with other characters from previous books, and they watch through the stable door as the world of Narnia is destroyed with the dragons and the salamanders ripping up the trees and Father Time crushing the sun. All of the people and animals (including those who had previously died) gather outside the barn and are judged by Aslan. The animals who have been loyal to Aslan or the morality upheld by Narnians join Aslan in Aslan's Country. The animals who have opposed or deserted him become ordinary animals and vanish to an unknown place that not even C.S. Lewis knows where they went. The <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs</b> (who unlike the Red Dwarfs have lost faith in Aslan) are unable to see Aslan's Country, certain that they are still inside an ordinary stable. When Lucy asks Aslan to help them, he tells her that he will show her what he can and what he cannot do. He then growls at the <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs,</b> and makes food magically appear in their hands. This fails to convince them: they think that the growling is a machine and that the food is only what would normally be found in a stable. Aslan tells the children that the <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarfs</b> shut themselves out from him, and therefore cannot be reached, much like Uncle Andrew in The Magician's Nephew.|$|R
50|$|The stars called {{white or}} {{degenerate}} dwarfs {{are made up}} mainly of degenerate matter: typically carbon and oxygen nuclei {{in a sea of}} degenerate electrons. White dwarfs arise from the cores of main-sequence stars and are therefore very hot when they are formed. As they cool they will redden and dim until they eventually become dark <b>black</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> White dwarfs were observed in the 19th century, but the extremely high densities and pressures they contain were not explained until the 1920s.|$|R

500|$|Paine's new rhetoric came to {{dominate}} popular nineteenth-century radical journalism, particularly that of freethinkers, Chartists and Owenites.

A century after the publication of The Age of Reason, Paine's rhetoric was still being used: George Foote's [...] "Bible Handbook (1888) [...] [...] [...] systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's Age of Reason."

2500|$|The objects {{now called}} [...] "brown dwarfs" [...] were theorized {{to exist in}} the 1960s by Shiv S. Kumar and were {{originally}} called black dwarfs, a classification for dark substellar objects floating freely in space that were not massive enough to sustain hydrogen fusion. However: a) the term <b>black</b> <b>dwarf</b> was already in use to refer to a cold white dwarf; b) red dwarfs fuse hydrogen, and c) these objects may be luminous at visible wavelengths early in their lives.

2500|$|After the Napoleonic Wars, the Corn laws (in force between 1815 and 1846) and bad harvests fostered discontent. The {{publications}} of William Cobbett were influential, and at political meetings speakers like Henry Hunt complained that only three {{men in a}} hundred had the vote. Writers like the radicals William Hone and Thomas Jonathan Wooler spread dissent with publications such as The <b>Black</b> <b>Dwarf</b> in defiance {{of a series of}} government acts to curb circulation of political literature. Radical riots in 1816 and 1817 were followed by the Peterloo massacre of 1819 publicised by Richard Carlile who then continued to fight for press freedom from prison. The Six Acts of 1819 limited the right to demonstrate or hold public meetings.

50|$|First, it must {{explain the}} intergalactic redshift. Second, it must explain the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation. Third, it must have a mechanism to re-create matter (particularly hydrogen atoms) from radiation or other sources in order to avoid a gradual 'running down' of the universe due to the conversion of matter into energy in stellar processes.

During the Civil War, Barnum's museum drew large audiences seeking diversion from the conflict. He added pro-Unionist exhibits, lectures, and dramas, and he demonstrated commitment to the cause. For example, in 1864 Barnum hired Pauline Cushman, an actress who had served as a spy for the Union, to lecture about her [...] "thrilling adventures" [...] behind Confederate lines. Barnum's Unionist sympathies incited a Confederate arsonist to start a fire in 1864. On July 13, 1865, Barnum's American Museum burned to the ground from a fire of unknown origin. Barnum re-established the Museum at another location in New York City, but this too was destroyed by fire in March 1868.
