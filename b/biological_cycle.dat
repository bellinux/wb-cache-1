50|$|Strawberry foliar {{nematode}} {{is a disease}} common in strawberries and ornamental plants that can greatly affect plant yield and appearance, resulting {{in a loss of}} millions of dollars of revenue. Symptoms used to diagnose the disease are angular, water soaked lesions and necrotic blotches. Aphelenchoides fragariae is the nematode pathogen that causes the disease. Its <b>biological</b> <b>cycle</b> includes four life stages, three of which are juvenile. The nematode can undergo multiple life cycles in one growing season when favorable conditions are present. They can infect the crowns, runners, foliage, and new buds of the plant via stylet penetration or through the stomata. The best management practices for this disease are sanitation, prevention of induction of the pathogen to the environment, and planting clean seed or starter plants.|$|E
50|$|The second-stage juvenile, or J2, {{nematode}} is {{the only}} life stage that can penetrate roots. (The first-stage juvenile occurs in the egg, and third- and fourth-stages occur in the roots). The J2 enters the root moving through the plant cells to the vascular tissue where it feeds. The J2 induces cell division in the root to form specialized feeding sites. As the nematode feeds, it swells. The female swells so much that her posterior end bursts out of the root and she becomes {{visible to the naked}} eye. In contrast, the adult male regains a wormlike shape, and he leaves the root in order to find and fertilize the large females. The female continues to feed as she lays 200 to 400 eggs in a yellow gelatinous matrix, forming an egg sac which remains inside her. She then dies and her cuticle hardens forming a cyst. The eggs may hatch when conditions in the soil are favorable, the larvae developing inside the cyst and the <b>biological</b> <b>cycle</b> repeating itself. There are usually three generations in the year. In the autumn or in unfavorable conditions, the cysts containing dormant larvae may remain intact in the soil for several years. Although soybean is the primary host of SCN, other legumes can also serve as hosts.|$|E
50|$|The King {{approached}} Agastya seeking {{his advice}} for the marriage of his daughter. However, Agastya {{who was responsible for}} her beautiful creation for begetting a son for him, asked the king for her hand in marriage. This caused anguish to the king and queen as to how their daughter who was brought up in princely comforts could be married to an ascetic, a forest dweller. They were also scared of the power of Agastya who they felt could curse them if they refused to give Lopamudra in marriage to him. Looking at the worried status of her parents, Lopamudra volunteered to marry Agastya and requested her father to perform the wedding. Once married and taken to the forest to live with him, Agastya told Lopamudra to discard all her royal attire and ornaments and wear clothes fit for an ascetic’s wife. She obeyed her husband and wore rags, deer skins and bark for her clothes. She dutifully, respectfully, lovingly and willingly served Agastya in his religious practices and penance. Her asceticism through tapas matched Agstya’s. Agastya was then not attracted to her beauty and did not cohabit with her and remained detached though she was beautiful and was his own creation. However, after a long lapse of time, Lopamudra was taking swimming in a naked state and her seductive figure attracted Agastya who then wanted to have sex with her to beget a son who would full fill his promise to his ancestors and relieve them of their curse. However, Lopamudra was not willing as she put a condition that she would sleep with him only if she got all the riches and the princely comforts that she enjoyed at her father’s place. Agastya countered pleadingly that as he was an ascetic he could not break the laws of asceticism otherwise all his spiritual achievements of so many years of penance which were meant for the benefit of human beings would be lost. But Lopamudra persistently argued that with great acetic qualities Agastya could achieve anything in this world. As her child bearing <b>biological</b> <b>cycle</b> would not last long she urged him to agree to her conditions and go in search of riches.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStudies on {{continuously}} improving {{records of}} geological, biological, and astronomical events and processes led to {{increased awareness of}} common cycles in the records. Here we enhance the analytical scope of earlier discoveries by showing {{that most of these}} cycles occur in unison, as a harmonic series. Furthermore, we consider them universal because extra-terrestrial cycles involving quasar and star formation exhibit comparable periods to terrestrial cycles involving volcanism, extinction patterns, and genetic development. The cycles oscillate in multiples of three, cascading into a period-tripled set of cycles. We provide one equation combining the characteristics of 32 theoretical cycles, with periods ranging from 57. 3 years to 1. 64 billion years. Our statistical tests show that the astronomical and geological cycles are phase-locked synchronously, while the <b>biological</b> <b>cycles</b> lag. This synchrony suggests a common astronomical cause for geological and <b>biological</b> <b>cycles.</b> Along with the synchrony, the extensiveness of the observed period-tripling indicates that self-similar patterns develop at a universal scale.

40|$|Abstract. Even if amphidromous {{fish species}} {{contribute}} most to {{the diversity of}} fish communities in the tropical insular rivers, their <b>biological</b> <b>cycle</b> remain poorly known. For the first time, the otolith elemental composition andmicrostructure of two ancestral gobioids, Rhyacichthys guilberti and Protogobius attiti, were investigated to describe their <b>biological</b> <b>cycle</b> and pelagic larval duration (PLD). The otolith analysis using a femtosecond laser ablation coupled to an inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometer (fs-LA-ICP-MS) revealed an amphidromous life history for R. guilberti and it suggested a progressive habitat shift from a marine habitat to a freshwater environment for P. attiti. For the first time, an endemic species, P. attiti, showed longer and more variable PLD (55. 2 13. 5 days) than did a widespread one (R. guilberti:, 30 days). These results need to be confirmed by analysing more samples but suggest that factors other than the PLD control endemism and dispersal processes.
