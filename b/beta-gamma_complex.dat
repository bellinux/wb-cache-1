50|$|EP3 is {{classified}} as an inhibitory type of prostanoid receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to inhibit the activation of adenyl cyclase stimulated by relaxant types of prostanoid receptors viz., prostaglandin DP, E2, and E4 receptors (see Prostaglandin receptors). When initially bound to PGE2 or other of its agonists, it mobilizes G proteins containing various types of G proteins, depending upon the particular EP3 isoform: EP3α and EP3β isoforms activate Gi alpha subunit (i.e. Gαi)-G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complexes</b> (i.e. Gαi)-Gβγ) complexes) as well as Gα12-Gβγ complexes while the EP3γ isoform activates in addition to and the Gαi- Gβγ complexes Gαi- Gβγ complexes. (G protein linkages for the other EP3 isoforms have not been defined.) In consequence, complexes dissociate into Gαi, Gα12, Gs and Gβγ components which proceed to activate cell signaling pathways that lead functional responses viz., pathways that activate phospholipase C to convert cellular phospholipids to diacylglycerol which promotes the activation of certain isoforms of protein kinase C, pathways that elevated cellular cytosolic Ca2+ which thereby regulate Ca2+-sensitive cell signaling molecules, and pathways that inhibit adenyl cyclase which thereby lowers cellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to reduce the activity of cAMP-dependent signaling molecules.|$|R
50|$|EP2 is {{classified}} as a relaxant type of prostanoid receptor based on its ability, upon activation, to relax certain types of smooth muscle (see Prostaglandin receptors). When initially bound to PGE2 or any other of its agonists, it mobilizes G proteins containing the Gs alpha subunit (i.e. Gαs)-G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complexes</b> (i.e. Gβγ). The Gαs- Gβγ complexes dissociate into their Gαs and Gβγ subunits which in turn regulate cell signaling pathways. In particular, Gαs stimulates adenyl cyclase to raise cellular levels of cAMP thereby activating PKA; PKA activates various types of signaling molecules such as the transcription factor CREB which lead to different types of functional responses depending on cell type. EP2 also activates the a) GSK-3 pathway which regulates cell migratory responses and innate immune responses including pro-inflammatory cytokine and interleukin production and b) Beta-catenin pathway which regulates not only cell-cell adhesion but also activates the Wnt signaling pathway which, in turn, stimulates the transcription of genes responsible for regulating cell migration and proliferation. In many of these respects, EP2 actions resemble those of another type of relaxant prostanoid receptor, EP4 but differs from the contractile prostanoid receptors, EP1 and EP3 receptors which mobilize G proteins containing the Gαq-Gβγ complex. EP2 also differs {{from all the other}} prostaglandin receptors in that it fails to undergo homologous desensitization. That is, following agonist-induced activation, the other prostaglandin (as well as most types of G protein coupled receptors) quickly become desensitized, often internalized, and whether or not internalized, incapable of activating their G protein targets. This effect limits the duration and extent to which agonists can stimulate cells. EP2, by failing to become desensitized, is able to function over prolong periods and later time points than other prostaglandin receptors and therefore potentially able to contribute to more delayed and chronic phases of cellular and tissue responses.|$|R
40|$|Adenosine receptors (ARs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) {{mediating}} the neuromodulatory {{actions of}} adenosine that influence emotional, cognitive, motor, and other {{functions in the}} central nervous system (CNS). Previous studies show complex formation between ARs and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in heterologous systems and close colocalization of ARs and mGluRs in several central neurons. Here we explored the possibility of intimate functional interplay between Gi/o protein-coupled A 1 -subtype AR (A 1 R) and type- 1 mGluR (mGluR 1) naturally occurring in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Using a perforated-patch voltage-clamp technique, we found that both synthetic and endogenous agonists for A 1 R induced continuous depression of a mGluR 1 -coupled inward current. A 1 R agonists also depressed mGluR 1 -coupled intracellular Ca 2 + mobilization monitored by fluorometry. A 1 R indeed mediated this depression because genetic depletion of A 1 R abolished it. Surprisingly, A 1 R agonist-induced depression persisted after blockade of Gi/o protein. The depression appeared to involve neither the cAMP-protein kinase A cascade downstream of the alpha subunits of Gi/o and Gs proteins, nor cytoplasmic Ca 2 + that is suggested to be regulated by the <b>beta-gamma</b> subunit <b>complex</b> of Gi/o protein. Moreover, A 1 R did not appear to affect Gq protein which mediates the mGluR 1 -coupled responses. These findings suggest that A 1 R modulates mGluR 1 signalling without the aid of the major G proteins. In this respect, the A 1 R-mediated depression of mGluR 1 signalling shown here is clearly distinguished from the A 1 R-mediated neuronal responses described so far. These findings demonstrate a novel neuromodulatory action of adenosine in central neurons...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two classes}} of G proteins. The first {{function}} as monomeric small GTPases, while the second function as heterotrimeric G protein complexes. The latter class of complexes {{is made up of}} alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ) subunits. In addition, the beta and gamma subunits can form a stable dimeric complex referred to as the <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "G protein" [...] usually {{refers to}} the membrane-associated heterotrimeric G proteins, {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "large" [...] G proteins (as opposed to the subclass of smaller, monomeric small GTPases) [...] These proteins are activated by G protein-coupled receptors and are made up of alpha (α), beta (β) and gamma (γ) subunits, the latter two referred to as the <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex.</b>|$|E
50|$|The G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex</b> (Gβγ) is {{a tightly}} bound dimeric protein complex, {{composed}} of one Gβ and one Gγ subunit, {{and is a}} component of heterotrimeric G proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins, also called guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins, consist of three subunits, called alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, or Gα, Gβ, and Gγ. When a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) is activated, Gα dissociates from Gβγ, allowing both subunits to perform their respective downstream signaling effects. One of the major functions of Gβγ is the inhibition of the Gα subunit.|$|E
40|$|Phosducin (Phd) is a soluble phosphoprotein, {{selectively}} binding to the <b>beta-gamma</b> (βγ) <b>complex</b> of G-proteins, {{playing a}} role in intracellular signaling processes. We have molecularly identified 3 Phd isoforms expressed in the human retina. Based on their ability or inability to interact in our assay system with Gβγ proteins, we named them Phosducin-Like Protein 1 (PhLP 1) or Phosducin-Like Orphan Proteins (PhLOP 1 & PhLOP 2), respectively. To further study these Phd isoforms and their potential involvement in normal and abnormal visual processes through genetic alterations, we identified and characterized an 85 kb P 1 -PhLP human genomic clone that contains PhLPl and PhLOP 1. With fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to human metaphase chromosomes, this P 1 -PhLP genomic clone was mapped to human chromosome 1 q 25. 3. Previous work identified a gene locus for phosducin (PDC) to 1 q 25 -q 31. 1 by somatic cell hybridization and in situ hybridization. Within the P 1 -PhLP genomic clone, the previously characterized complete PDC gene was identified; furthermore, the 5 '-flanking region and a potential promoter region of PhLOP 1 was identified between Exon 2 and Exon 3 of the PDC gene. Initial transfection experiments with luciferase activity reporter PhLOP 1 constructs, ranging in size from 386 to 852 basepairs (bp), suggest that no tissue specific retinal promoter activity is contained in this 5 '-flanking region of the PhLOP 1 when compared to the high retinal specific promoter activity observed for a 123 bp construct for Interphotoreceptor Retinoid-Binding Protein (IRBP). Alternatively, a represser element is still present and preventing promoter activity in the PhLOP 1 constructs. These results correspond to the low levels of mRNA of the PhLOP 1 observed in the retina compared to Phd. These data suggest that both PhLP 1 and PhLOP 1 are created through alternative splicing of the Phd gene and that a single PDC gene at 1 q 25. 3 is responsible for these three retinal isoforms...|$|R
50|$|When {{initially}} {{bound to}} PGE2 or other stimulating ligand, EP1 mobilizes G proteins containing the Gq alpha subunit (Gαq/11)-G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex.</b> These two subunits in turn stimulate the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway that raises cellular cytosolic Ca2+ levels thereby regulating Ca2+-sensitive cell signal pathways which include, among several others, those that promote the activation of certain protein kinase C isoforms. Since, this rise in cytosolic Ca2+ can also contract muscle cells, EP1 has been {{classified as a}} contractile type of prostanoid receptor. The activation of protein kinases C feeds back to phosphorylate and thereby desensitizes the activated EP1 receptor (see homologous desensitization but may also desensitize other types of prostanoid and non-prostanoid receptors (see heterologous desensitization). These desensitizations limit further EP1 receptor activation within the cell. Concurrently with the mobilization of these pathways, ligand-activated EP1 stimulates ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, and CREB pathways that lead to cellular functional responses.|$|E

[...] OXER1 couples to the G protein complex composed of the Gi alpha subunit (Gαi) and G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex</b> (Gβγ); when bound to a 5-(S)-HETE family member, OXER1 triggers this G protein complex to dissociate into its Gαi and Gβγ components with Gβγ appearing to be the component responsible for activating the signal pathways which lead to cellular functional responses. [...] The cell-activation pathways stimulated by OXER1 include those mobilizing ionic calcium and activating MAPK/ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, cytosolic phospholipase A2, PI3K/Akt, and protein kinase C beta and epsilon.|$|E
5000|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as DP2 are {{integral}} membrane proteins that, when bound by their cognate ligands (or, in some cases, even when not ligand-bound and thereby acting continuously in a constitutive manner {see Receptor (biochemistry)#Constitutive activity}), mobilize {{one or more}} types of Heterotrimeric G proteins. DP2 is classified as a [...] "contractile" [...] prostanoid receptor in that it can cause the contraction of smooth muscle. As evidenced by its initial discovery as a receptor for PGD2 in T-helper type 2 cells, activated DP2 triggers Gi alpha subunit-linked heterotrimeric G proteins to dissociate into their component a) Gi alpha subunits (also termed Giα subunits) which simulate phospholipase C to cleave phosphatidylinositol triphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) and b) G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex</b> of subunits (Gβγ) which inhibit adenyl cyclase. IP3 raises cytosolic Ca2 levels thereby regulating Ca2-sensitive signal pathways; DAG activates certain protein kinase C enzymes [...] )PKCs) that phosphorylate and thereby regulate target proteins involved in cell signaling; and adenyl cyclase converts AMP into cyclic AMP (cAMP) thereby down-regulating cAMP-responsive proteins involved in cell signalling. Concurrently with the mobilization of these pathways, activated DP2 also mobilizes G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GPKs, GPK2, GPK5, and/or GPK6) and Arrestin-2 (also termed Arrestin beta 1 or β-arrestin). The GPKs, along with the DAG-activated PKCs, phosphorylate DP2 to promote its internalization while arrestin-2 inhibits DP2 from further activating heterotrimeric G proteins while also linking DP2 to elements, clathrin and clathrin adaptor AP2, of the receptor internalization machinery. These pathways render DP2 unable to mobilize heterotrimereic G proteins thereby rendering the cell less sensitive or insensitive to further stimulation by DP ligands. The process, termed Homologous desensitization, serves as a physiological limiter of cell responses to DP2 activators.|$|E
5000|$|Studies {{in human}} {{neutrophils}} first detected a plasma membrane-localized site which reversibly bound 5-oxo-ETE {{and had the}} attributes of a Gi alpha subunit-linked G protein-coupled receptor based {{on the ability of}} 5-oxo-ETE to activate this class of membrane G proteins by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. [...] Subsequently, this receptor was cloned by several groups who termed it the oxoeicosanoid receptor 1 (OXER1), OXE, OXE-R, hGPCR48, HGPCR48, or R527 (its gene is termed OXE1 or OXER1), and found it coupled with and activated the G protein complex composed of the Gi alpha subunit (Gαi) and G <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex</b> (Gβγ). Based on the presence of its mRNA, the OXER1 mRNA is highly expressed in human blood eosinophils, neutrophils, spleen, lung, liver and kidney and at lower levels in human basophils, monocytes, lung macrophages, various cancer cell lines, and an adrenocortical cell line. Orthologs of OXER1 are found in various mammalian species including cats and opossums as well as several species of fish; however, mice and rats lack a clear ortholog of OXER1. When bound by 5-oxo-ETE or other 5-HETE family member, OXER1 triggers this G protein complex to dissociate into its Gαi and Gβγ components, with Gβγ being responsible for activating many of the signal pathways that lead to the cellular functional responses elicited by the 5-HETE family of agonists. [...] The cell-activation pathways stimulated by OXER1 include those evoking rises in cytosolic calcium ion levels as well as those activating MAPK/ERK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, cytosolic Phospholipase A2, PI3K/Akt, protein kinase C beta (PKCβ), and (PKCε). [...] Most actions of the 5-HETE family of agonists appear mediated by OXER1. Some of their actions, however, appear to be OXER1-independent, as indicated below.|$|E
40|$|We {{transfected}} COS {{cells with}} cDNAs for the alpha subunits of stimulatory and inhibitory GTP-binding proteins, alpha s and alpha i 1, respectively, and immunoprecipitated the metabolically labeled products with specific peptide antibodies. Cells were separated into particulate and soluble fractions before immunoprecipitation; [35 S]methionine-labeled alpha s and alpha i were both found {{primarily in the}} particulate fraction. [3 H]Myristate was incorporated into endogenous and transfected alpha i but could not be detected in alpha s {{even when it was}} overexpressed. We converted the second residue, glycine, of alpha i 1 into alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Upon transfection of the mutant alpha i 1 into COS cells, the [35 S]methionine-labeled product was localized primarily to the soluble fraction, and, also unlike normal alpha i 1, the mutant failed to incorporate [3 H]myristate. The unmyristoylated mutant alpha i 1 could still interact with the <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex,</b> since purified beta gamma subunits promoted pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of both the normal and mutant alpha i 1 subunits. These results indicate that myristoylation is critical for membrane attachment of alpha i but not alpha s subunits...|$|E
40|$|The 140 kDa insulin-like {{growth factor}} (IGF) -binding protein complex in human serum {{consists}} of three subunits: an acid-labile, non-IGF-binding glycoprotein (alpha-subunit), an IGF-binding glycoprotein known as BP- 53 or IGFBP- 3 (beta-subunit), and IGF-I or IGF-II (gamma-subunit). This study investigates the regulation, by salt and glycosaminoglycans, of ternary (alpha-beta-gamma) complex formation, measured by incubating radioiodinated alpha-subunit {{with a mixture of}} IGF-I and IGFBP- 3 and precipitating bound radioactivity with an anti-IGFBP- 3 antiserum. Increasing NaCl concentrations progressively decreased ternary complex formation without any effect on binary (<b>beta-gamma)</b> <b>complex</b> formation. In 0. 15 M-NaCl, the association constant for the ternary complex was 0. 318 +/- 0. 092 nM- 1, 100 -fold lower than that for the binary complex. Glycosaminoglycans also inhibited ternary complex formation without affecting the binary complex. Heparin [50 % inhibition at 0. 27 +/- 0. 08 units/ml (1. 5 +/- 0. 4 micrograms/ml) ] was more potent than heparan sulphate (50 % inhibition at 15 +/- 7 micrograms/ml), with chondroitin sulphate even less potent. The inhibition by heparin was due principally to a decrease in binding affinity, from 0. 604 +/- 0. 125 to 0. 151 +/- 0. 024 nM- 1 in the presence of 0. 25 units of heparin/ml, with a slight {{decrease in the number of}} apparent binding sites from 1. 05 +/- 0. 08 to 0. 85 +/- 0. 15 mol of alpha-subunit bound/mol of beta-subunit. Since the ternary IGF-binding protein complex cannot cross the capillary barrier, it is proposed that a decrease in the affinity of the complex, mediated by circulating or cell-associated glycosaminoglycans, may be important in the passage of IGFs and IGFBP- 3 to the tissues...|$|E
40|$|The heterotrimeric G protein, transducin, and its cognate effector, cyclic GMP (cGMP) {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) 6 in the vertebrate rod photoreceptors play {{a pivotal}} role in visual signal transduction. Rhodopsin, upon activation by light, catalyzes the exchange of GTP for the bound GDP on the [alpha]-subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein, transducin. Upon GTP binding, transducin dissociates into the GTP-bound alpha subunit ([alpha]T-GTP) and the accessory <b>beta-gamma</b> <b>complex</b> ([beta][gamma]). [alpha]T-GTP activates PDE by removing the inhibition of its catalytic activity by its regulatory gamma subunit (PDE[gamma]). The activated PDE is able to hydrolyze cGMP, a second messenger that is essential for regulating transmembrane ion channels. Due to the hydrolysis of cGMP, an ionic gradient is generated across the cell membrane that enables the photoreceptor to transduce visual signals to the secondary visual nervous cells. Although the photo-transduction signaling pathway has been studied for a few decades, the structural basis by which [alpha]T- GTP stimulates its effector, the PDE, still remains unclear. To investigate the molecular basis of PDE activation by [alpha]T-GTP, we generated a number of point mutants of chimeric [alpha]T and characterized them based on their ability to stimulate PDE. Using techniques that include environmentally-sensitive fluorescence emission and fluorescence polarization from extrinsic probes, we examined the binding affinity of each [alpha]T mutant for PDE, and identified the [alpha]G/[alpha] 4 loop as a previously unappreciated region in [alpha]T that is required for full stimulation of PDE activity. 	   	   We then examined the Switch regions in [alpha]T in detail to determine if they impact PDE function. GTP binding to the [alpha] subunit of heterotrimeric G protein (G[alpha]) results in a conformational change in three regions of G[alpha], designated Switch I, II, and III, respectively. In G[alpha]-GTP, an ionic interaction network that consists of five conserved residues establishes a link between Switch II and III. Mutating a conserved glutamate residue (E 241) in this network to alanine yields a dominant-negative [alpha]T mutant, which is capable of binding to PDE but unable to stimulate it. This finding suggests that the [alpha] 3 helix, where the glutamate residue is located, is likely to be an important structural element that translates effector binding to effector activation. With the previous discoveries from our lab and other research groups, {{the results of this study}} identifies a potential PDE-interacting surface on [alpha]T, which is comprised of the [alpha] 3 helix, the [alpha] 3 /[beta] 5 loop, Switch II, Switch III, the [alpha]G/[alpha] 4 loop, the [alpha] 4 helix and the [alpha] 4 /[beta] 6 loop. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E
