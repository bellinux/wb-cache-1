News crews at the Pike Place Market {{discovered}} the fish market and its performances with customers, and they filmed them. Soon afterwards, the fish market appeared on Good Morning America, leading to the business and its employees being filmed by various film crews, and being featured in numerous magazines. Now, during the summer tourist season, the fishmongers will perform now in front {{of as many as}} 10,000 visitors daily. The success of the <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cited to its human resources and employee attitudes. The employees of the fish market will often speak to businesses, civic groups, and schools on ways to be successful, and has led to their being featured in motivational books.|$|E

25|$|In the {{commercial}} {{development of an}} LNG value chain, LNG suppliers first confirm sales to the downstream buyers and then sign long-term contracts (typically 20–25 years) with strict terms and structures for gas pricing. Only when the customers are confirmed {{and the development of}} a greenfield project deemed economically feasible, could the sponsors of an LNG project invest in their development and operation. Thus, the LNG liquefaction <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> limited to players with strong financial and political resources. Major international oil companies (IOCs) such as ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, BG Group, Chevron, and national oil companies (NOCs) such as Pertamina and Petronas are active players.|$|E

Now, as an old man, Simonides has sold all his ships but one, and that one has returned for probably its final voyage. Learning that the Christians in Rome are suffering {{at the hands of}} Emperor Nero, Ben-Hur and his friends decide to help. Ben-Hur, Esther and Malluch sail to Rome, where they decided to build an underground church. It will survive through the ages and comes {{to be known as the}} Catacomb of Callixtus.|$|E

25|$|Business {{regulations}} have been overhauled along liberal lines, especially since 1999. Most {{barriers to the}} flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> becoming increasingly difficult {{over the past decade}} due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption. This can be confirmed by the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index report degrading its ratings for Pakistan each year since September 2009 when it ranked Pakistan (at 85th) well ahead of neighbours like China (at 89th) and India (at 133rd).|$|E
25|$|San Diego's {{cruise ship}} {{industry}} {{used to be}} the second-largest in California. Each cruise ship call injects an estimated $2million (from the purchase of food, fuel, supplies, and maintenance services, not counting the money spent by the tourists) into the local economy. Numerous cruise lines, including Carnival, Holland America, Celebrity, Crystal and Princess, operate out of San Diego. However, cruise ship <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> in steady decline since peaking in 2008, when the Port hosted over 250 ship calls and more than 900,000 passengers. By 2011 the number of ship calls had fallen to 103 (estimated). Holland America and Carnival Cruises operated weekly cruises to the Mexican Riviera for many years, but both ended their regular scheduled service in spring 2012, which was an economic loss to the region of more than $100 million. The decline is blamed on the slumping economy as well as fear of travel to Mexico due to well-publicized violence there.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} the {{congestion}} charge zone on local businesses is a contested issue. The TfL estimates that the effect on <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> overall neutral. However the effect on business differs significantly between stores. Some shops and businesses are reported to be heavily affected by the charge, {{both in terms of}} lost sales due to reduced traffic and increased delivery costs, as recognised by the London Chamber of Commerce. In August 2003, the John Lewis Partnership, a large department store, announced that {{in the first six months}} of the charge's operation, sales at their Oxford Street store fell by 7.3% whilst sales at other stores in the Greater London area but outside the Congestion Charge Zone rose by 1.7%. To partly compensate for the loss of revenue they extended opening hours and introduced regular Sunday opening for the first time. However London First's own report indicated that business was broadly supportive. Subsequently, another report stated that there had been a reduction in some employment in the charging zone. TfL criticised the reports as unrepresentative and that its own statistics reported no effect on business.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1997–1998 summer season, Tranz Scenic have {{provided}} day trips for passengers from cruise ships docked at Lyttelton out to Arthur's Pass. Initially, these passengers {{were collected by}} coach from Lyttelton and transferred to Christchurch from whence they departed on the TranzAlpine service. From 2000, Tranz Scenic have run special trains which collect the passengers from Lyttelton railway station and take them direct to Arthur's Pass using spare carriages from the TranzAlpine/TranzCoastal fleet. This operation has required the use of some office space in the station building, {{as well as the}} station precinct to transfer passengers between trains and buses. Some tour groups travel by train to Arthur's Pass and return to Lyttelton, while other groups only make half the journey by train and complete the trip by coach. As the track adjacent to the station's platform has been removed, passenger trains stop outside the station building on the track nearest the platform, where passengers board or alight from the train. Buses are used to transfer passengers between the trains and the wharf at which their ship is docked for security reasons. Though the number of these special trains varies from season to season, <b>business</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> generally improving, with 43 services booked for the summer of 2008–2009.|$|E

30|$|The {{debate over}} firm size in {{technology}} R&D offers {{a number of}} arguments highlighting the role of small businesses, emphasizing their willingness to assume more technical risk.

Small <b>businesses</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> credited with producing twice as many significant innovations as large businesses (p. 36 in Litvak 1992; p. 20 in Anderson 2004), and small <b>businesses</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recognized for their contributions to technological advancement due to their flexible organizational structures allowing them to achieve greater focus due {{to their ability to}} operate with little more than good ideas and a few highly skilled people. Their smallness allows them to avoid the size constraints associated with internal political hurdles and bureaucratic barriers (p. 456 in Miles 1995; p. 5 in Baumol 2004).|$|R
