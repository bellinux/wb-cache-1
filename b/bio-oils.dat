40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} feasibility of biohydrogen production via two <b>bio-oil</b> processing pathways: <b>bio-oil</b> gasification and <b>bio-oil</b> reforming. Both pathways employ fast pyrolysis to produce <b>bio-oil</b> from biomass stock. The two pathways are modeled using Aspen PlusÂ® for a 2000 t d- 1 facility. Equipment sizing and cost calculations {{are based on}} Aspen Economic EvaluationÂ® software. Biohydrogen production capacity at the facility is 147 t d- 1 for the <b>bio-oil</b> gasification pathway and 160 t d- 1 for the <b>bio-oil</b> reforming pathway. The biomass-to-fuel energy efficiencies are 47 % and 84 % for the <b>bio-oil</b> gasification and <b>bio-oil</b> reforming pathways, respectively. Total capital investment (TCI) is 435 million dollars for the <b>bio-oil</b> gasification pathway and is 333 million dollars for the <b>bio-oil</b> reforming pathway. Internal rates of return (IRR) are 8. 4 % and 18. 6 % for facilities employing the <b>bio-oil</b> gasification and <b>bio-oil</b> reforming pathways, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that biohydrogen price, biohydrogen yield, fixed capital investment (FCI), <b>bio-oil</b> yield, and biomass cost have the greatest impacts on facility IRR.

The problems with environmental degradation due to industrial wastes can be reduced by converting some of them into <b>bio-oil.</b> In the present work, the waste from fish processing industry is converted to <b>bio-oil</b> by catalytic cracking. Experiments were conducted in a direct injection diesel engine of 4. 5 kW at 1500 rpm. The different test fuels of diesel, fish oil at 75 C, <b>bio-oil</b> UD (undistilled <b>bio-oil),</b> B 20 D 80 (20 % <b>bio-oil</b> in fossil diesel), B 80 D 20 (80 % <b>bio-oil</b> in fossil diesel) and neat <b>bio-oil</b> were tested to assess the suitability in diesel engines through combustion, emission and performance characteristics. Experimental {{results show that the}} brake thermal efficiency is marginally higher with neat <b>bio-oil</b> over other test fuels. It is lower with preheated fish oil and it is almost same for both <b>bio-oil</b> and <b>bio-oil</b> UD. NOx, HC, CO and PM emissions are higher with <b>bio-oil</b> UD compared to <b>bio-oil.</b> PM, CO and HC emissions are lower with <b>bio-oil</b> over diesel. NOx emissions are lower with <b>bio-oil</b> compared to <b>bio-oil</b> UD but it is still higher than diesel fuel. Addition of diesel with <b>bio-oil</b> reduces the NOx emissions marginally.

40|$|<b>Bio-oil,</b> {{a mixture}} of complex oxygenated hydrocarbons, is {{obtained}} through fast pyrolysis of solid biomass. As biomass is low in energy density and not easily transportable, a novel approach is to convert biomass to <b>bio-oil,</b> transport <b>bio-oil</b> to a centralized facility, gasify <b>bio-oil</b> to syngas, and upgrade syngas to transportation fuels and other high-value chemicals. In this study, a comprehensive numerical model was developed to simulate the gasification of <b>bio-oil</b> at different operating conditions and different reactor geometries. The present model considers spray, atomization, vaporization, and chemical reactions of <b>bio-oil.</b> <b>Bio-oil</b> was modeled as a multi-component fuel, consisting of ten major components. The Joback method, a group contribution method, was {{used to calculate the}} <b>bio-oil</b> thermophysical properties, including enthalpy, latent heat, and vapor pressure. With the <b>bio-oil</b> thermophysical properties, vaporization of single <b>bio-oil</b> drop was simulated, and results show that the heaviest component, i. e., levoglucosan, is the last component which remains in the drop. A thermodynamic equilibrium approach was used to account for chemical reactions. Gasification of methanol was first simulated for model validation. The numerical simulations of <b>bio-oil</b> gasification at different operating pressures and equivalence ratios were also conducted. Comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data show that the current model can predict gasification process reasonably well. Results show that syngas yield is independent of the ambient pressure while sensible to equivalence ratio. The simulation results show that conversion of <b>bio-oil</b> to syngas occurs gradually along the gasifier. Using the current model, <b>bio-oil</b> gasification was studied for large reactors with high gasification capacity. It was found that a reactor with 30 cm in diameter and 300 cm in length can gasify <b>bio-oil</b> at a rate of 6 ton/day and the gasification products can reach their equilibrium state at the reactor outlet. It is estimated that a gasifier with 200 cm in diameter and 300 cm in length can allow the use of 20 injectors to gasify 120 ton/day of <b>bio-oil.</b> Therefore, it is suggested that 10 such gasifiers can be assembled in a biorefinery to achieve the capacity of 1200 tons of <b>bio-oil</b> per day.

40|$|This study aims at {{increasing}} char yield by recycling <b>bio-oil</b> without {{negative impact on}} char qualities, i. e. carbon content and heating value.

The experiments were carried out by introducing sample into the reaction zone with the flow of N 2 and at the temperature range of 300 to 600 ˚C. Pyrolysis of the <b>bio-oil</b> impregnated woodchip gave higher char yield than the pyrolysis of raw woodchip. By the 20 % (m/m) <b>bio-oil</b> impregnation, char yield increased by 18. 9 % (spruce) and 19. 1 % (birch) on average from the raw woodchip pyrolysis. In addition, the char yield from <b>bio-oil</b> impregnated woodchips was higher than the interpolated char yield of raw woodchips and <b>bio-oil,</b> indicating that synergy effect exists by <b>bio-oil</b> impregnation compared with mere recycling of <b>bio-oil.</b> However, high heating rate corresponded to high temperature pyrolysis, i. e. above 400 ˚C, created cavities and breakages on woodchips, which minimized the secondary reaction. Neither carbon content nor heating value of char was influenced by <b>bio-oil</b> impregnation. Energy yield also showed improvement by increasing <b>bio-oil</b> recycling ratio.

Recently when microalgae become a hot research topic as the third generation of biofuel, pyrolysis has drawn more attention as a potential conversion method for algal biofuel production. Pan et al. (2010) investigated slow pyrolysis of Nannochloropsis sp. residue with and without the presence of HZSM-5 catalyst and obtained <b>bio-oil</b> rich in aromatic hydrocarbons from catalytic pyrolysis.

Toxicity and genotoxicity were respectively measured as root growth inhibition and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), in the in vivo Allium cepa test system. The hypotheses were: 1. Small differences in chemical composition or concentration of <b>bio-oils</b> may cause highly different toxicological responses in A. cepa, 2. It might be possible to identify differences in chemical composition influencing the toxicological effect of <b>bio-oils</b> by comparing the results with provided chemical data. The results for toxicity showed that the five <b>bio-oils</b> caused a significant reduction in onion root growth with increasing concentrations. The toxic effect varied between the different <b>bio-oils,</b> and was ranked in the following order, according to the obtained EC 50 -values: Pine > Beech > Wood > Poplar > Spruce. The obtained results for measurement of DNA DSBs indicated that <b>bio-oils</b> produced from fast pyrolysis of wood can cause severe DNA damage at concentrations of about 0. 0004 ml bio-oil/ml solution and higher.

Considering that further upgrade of <b>bio-oils</b> is needed to obtain applicable <b>bio-oils,</b> the toxicological effects of the finished upgraded products is likely to be altered compared to the effects seen for the crude <b>bio-oils.</b> Further studies should thus focus on the upgraded bio-oil products, as these {{are most likely to be}} of environmental concern in the future...|$|E

Chemical composition of <b>bio-oil</b> was examined by GC/MS and C- 13 NMR analyses. <b>Bio-oil</b> produced from pretreated eucalyptus wood exhibited lower contents of ketones and acids, while much higher levoglucosan content than <b>bio-oil</b> produced from original eucalyptus wood, which would help to improve thermal stability of <b>bio-oil</b> and extract levoglucosan from <b>bio-oil.</b> Hydrothermal pretreatment also improved bin-oil fuel quality through lowering water content and enhancing heating value.

40|$|<b>Bio-oil</b> {{produced}} from the thermochemical treatment of lignocellulosic biomass is increasingly {{recognized as a}} potentially abundant source of renewable chemicals and fuels. Single ring phenolics and low molecular weight carboxylic acids are significant constituent compound groups found in <b>bio-oil</b> and are important end products or intermediate commodity chemicals. Fractionation of <b>bio-oil</b> using supercritical fluids (usually with CO 2 as a solvent) {{is a relatively new}} process being investigated worldwide at both laboratory and pilot scales. Solubility data associated with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) and the many chemical compounds in the complex <b>bio-oil</b> mixture are required to predict the extraction behavior of different <b>bio-oil</b> compounds. This article starts with a review of the composition of <b>bio-oil</b> in terms of the phenolic and low molecular weight carboxylic acid fractions which are potentially of commercial interest. Binary solubility data of major compounds in these <b>bio-oil</b> fractions with supercritical CO 2 are summarized and discussed. Results from previously reported studies in which scCO 2 is used as a solvent to recover <b>bio-oil</b> fractions are reviewed and collated. Density and temperature-based Chrastil type models are developed using available data for the solubility in scCO 2 of some of the major <b>bio-oil</b> compounds. Finally, extraction of compounds from the complex <b>bio-oil</b> mixture is discussed in terms of the trends predicted by the respective individual binary solubility models...|$|R

40|$|Pyrolysis {{is one of}} the {{effective}} ways to convert biomass into energy and value added products. Till date, no comparative study has been done on the characteristic of <b>bio-oils</b> of oil palm shell (OPS) and empty fruit bunch (EFB) from various fast pyrolysis techniques. This includes fluidized bed, fixed bed, rotating cone, microwave and others. Thus, the main objective of this paper was to analyze the characteristics of OPS and EFB <b>bio-oils</b> obtained from these processing techniques. Temperature was found to be the key parameter for the quality of <b>bio-oils.</b> Besides the various pyrolysis techniques, the lignocellulosic constituents of oil palm biomass also influence the chemical composition of the <b>bio-oils.</b> Overall, chemical analysis of OPS and EFB bio-oil through GC-MS has shown variation in the amount of phenol and its derivatives...|$|E
40|$|Most {{bituminous}} adhesives or binders {{that are}} used for pavement materials are derived primarily from fossil fuels. With petroleum oil reserves becoming depleted and the drive to establish a bio-based economy, there is a push to produce binders from alternative sources, particularly from biorenewable resources. However, until now, no research has studied the applicability of utilizing <b>bio-oils</b> as a bitumen replacement (100 % replacement) in the pavement industry. The main objective {{of this research was}} to test various properties of <b>bio-oils</b> {{in order to determine the}} applicability of using <b>bio-oils</b> as binders in the pavement industry. The overall conclusions about the applicability of using <b>bio-oils</b> as bio-binders in the pavement industry can be summarized as follows: <b>Bio-oils</b> cannot be used as bio-binders/pavement materials without any heat pre-treatment/upgrading procedure. Current testing standards and specifications, especially Superpave procedures, should be modified to comply with the properties of bio-binders. The temperature range of the viscous behavior for <b>bio-oils</b> may be lower than that of bitumen binders by about 30 °– 40 ° C. The rheological properties of the unmodified bio-binders vary in comparison to bitumen binders, but the rheological properties of these modified bio-binders change significantly upon adding polymer modifiers. The high-temperature performance grade for the developed bio-binders may not vary significantly from that of the bitumen binders, but the low-temperature performance grade may vary significantly...|$|E

40|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) resin {{is a kind}} of {{excellent}} exterior-grade wood structural adhesive, which can be conveniently cold-set for various applications. In order to decrease the production cost, pyrolysis <b>bio-oil</b> from renewable bioresources was used to replace resorcinol to synthesize the bio-oil-resorcinol-aldehyde (BRF) resin. The effect of replacing resorcinol with <b>bio-oil</b> on the properties, bonding performance, and characterization of resorcinol-aldehyde resin was comparatively investigated. A higher solid content and viscosity, albeit a lower shear strength, was found when the replacement ratio of <b>bio-oil</b> increased. The bonding performance of BRF with 10 and 20 wt % <b>bio-oil</b> was close to that of the pure RF resin. However, the trends of being less cross-linked, more easily decomposed, but more porous were found when the substitution ratio of <b>bio-oil</b> was higher than 20 wt %. Interestingly, {{it was found that the}} wood failure values of the BRF resins with <b>bio-oil</b> of no more than 20 wt % were slightly higher than that of the pure RF resin. On the whole, BRF resins with 20 wt % <b>bio-oil</b> is recommended as a wood structural adhesive, comprehensively considering the <b>bio-oil</b> substitution ratio and resin properties. The results obtained here showed that pyrolysis <b>bio-oil</b> is a promising green raw material for the production of RF resin with lower cost...|$|R

40|$|Hydrothermal {{liquefaction}} (HTL), a {{thermochemical conversion}} {{process for the}} production of <b>bio-oil</b> from lignin, is described in this thesis. <b>Bio-oil</b> {{is considered to be a}} viable source of aromatic compounds as well as a general energy carrier. Nonetheless degradation of lignin during HTL is currently not fully understood due to the complexity and heterogeneity of lignin. This study aims to investigate HTL of lignin under subcritical water conditions (270 °C, 290 °C and 310 °C) and three time levels 10 min, 20 min and 30 min to identify the quantitative formation and qualitative composition of <b>bio-oil.</b> The isolated <b>bio-oil</b> fraction contained a mixture of low molar mass lignin degradation products. A general characterization of this fraction was accomplished by applying a set of analytical methods including Gel Permeation Chromatography, Photoacoustic Infrared spectra, the Folin Ciocalteu method, Karl Fischer titration and elemental analysis. The results from Gel Permeation Chromatography measurement indicated the formation of monomers, dimers and trimers (Mw from 260 to 310 g/mol). The carbon content of <b>bio-oil</b> was slightly higher (65. 03 %) and its oxygen content slightly lower (28. 33 %) than in the original lignin sample (C content 64. 14 % and O content 29. 88 %) as revealed by elemental analysis. Based on its elemental composition a higher heating value (27. 98 kJ/g) for <b>bio-oil</b> than for organosolv lignin (26. 33 kJ/g) was calculated, emphazing the potential of <b>bio-oil</b> for being a future energy carrier. The Folin Ciocalteu method indicated a coherency between increasing retention times of HTL and increasing phenolic contents in <b>bio-oil</b> (0. 157 g GAE/ g <b>bio-oil</b> (10 min), 0. 159 g GAE/g <b>bio-oil</b> (20 min) and 0. 191 g GAE/ g <b>bio-oil</b> (30 min)), especially at moderate temperatures (290 °C), outlining <b>bio-oil’s</b> high potential as aromatic source for chemical industry. These achievements indicated a valorization of lignin occurring during hydrothermal liquefaction...|$|R
