This internal pressure is confined radially by a belt of pre-stressed steel bands. The anvils also serve as electrodes providing electric current to the compressed cell. A variation of the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> uses hydraulic pressure, rather than steel belts, to confine the internal pressure. <b>Belt</b> <b>presses</b> are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|R

25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|R
2500|$|The {{belt filter}} (sometimes called a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter, or <b>belt</b> filter <b>press)</b> is an {{industrial}} machine, used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the dewatering of sludges in the chemical industry, mining and water treatment. <b>Belt</b> filter <b>presses</b> {{are also used}} {{in the production of}} apple juice, cider and winemaking.

25|$|The {{input to}} a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|R
40|$|Separation of solids from liquid swine {{manure and}} {{subsequent}} thermo-chemical conversion (TCC) of the solids fraction into oil {{is one way}} of reducing the waste strength and odor emission. Such processing also provides a potential means of producing renewable energy from animal wastes. Gravity settling and mechanical separation techniques, by means of a centrifuge and <b>belt</b> <b>press,</b> were used to remove the solids from liquid swine manure. The solid fractions from the above separation processes were used as the feedstock for the TCC process for oil production. Experiments were conducted in a batch reactor with a steady temperature 305 oC, and the corresponding pressure was 10. 34 Mpa. Gravity settling was demonstrated to be capable of increasing the total solids content of manure from 1 % to 9 %. Both of the mechanical separation systems were able to produce solids with dry matter around 18 % for manure, with 1 % to 2 % initial total solids. A significant amount of volatile solid (75. 7 %) was also obtained from the liquid fraction using the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> process. The oil yields of shallow pit manure solids and deep pit manure solids with <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> separation were 28. 72 % and 29. 8 % of the total volatile solids, respectively.

2500|$|The {{efficiency}} of a <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter is often assessed {{based on the}} dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt.

It is important that the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filter has an effective belt washing section so that blinding does not decrease the permeability of the belt.

40|$|There are {{relatively}} high amounts of ammonia {{returned to the}} headworks of a municipal wastewater plant that are extracted from the dewatering process. This ammonia load contributes to a significant oxygen demand in the secondary treatment, requiring greater air blower energy costs. This goal {{of this research was}} to evaluate the feasibility of the recovery of an ammonium sulfate product from <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filtrate. The objectives of this research were to: (1) analyze wastewater treatment average monthly data flows and constituents with respect to ammonia nitrification, (2) the evaluate the technical performance of a two sage gas-separation membrane for recovering ammonia separation, and (3) evaluate the economic feasibility of wastewater plants operating ammonium sulfate production. Results showed that, for the years 2012 – 2013, the Bustamante Wastewater Treatment Plant had a monthly average of 1197 lb/day of ammonia (as N), which required an average energy cost of $ 60, 868 per year. The ammonia separation process was observed to operate optimally at a pH of 9. 8 in the <b>belt</b> <b>press</b> filtrate influent, which maximizes the ammonia speciation without causing calcium carbonate precipitation. At a filtrate feed flowrate of 2. 0 gpm in the pilot system, 68 % of the ammonia was removed, producing approximately 11 lb/day of ammonium sulfate.

The pilot-scale impulse dryer was able to increase the sludge solids level 23. 2 % greater than belt pressing alone. The pilot scale equipment was not optimized, and fiuther gains are expected. Laboratory-scale demonstrations suggest that impulse drylng is effective {{on a wide variety of}} sludge types: primary (high and low ash), secondary, and mixed sludges.
