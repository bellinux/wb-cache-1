It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

For very large integers, bases232 or 264 (grouping <b>binary</b> <b>digits</b> by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.|$|E

25|$|A Fibonacci word is a {{specific}} sequence of <b>binary</b> <b>digits</b> (or symbols from any two-letter alphabet). The Fibonacci word is formed by repeated concatenation {{in the same way}} that the Fibonacci numbers are formed by repeated addition.|$|E
25|$|Binary is also easily {{converted}} to the octal numeral system, since octal uses a radix of 8, {{which is a}} power of two (namely, 23, so it takes exactly three <b>binary</b> <b>digits</b> to represent an octal digit). The correspondence between octal and binary numerals {{is the same as}} for the first eight digits of hexadecimal in the table above. Binary 000 is equivalent to the octal digit 0, binary 111 is equivalent to octal 7, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Hexadecimal numerals {{are widely}} used by {{computer}} system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four <b>binary</b> <b>digits</b> (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.|$|E

25|$|Whereas in {{elementary}} algebra expressions denote mainly numbers, in Boolean algebra they denote the truth values false and true.

25|$|The {{lines of}} the Fano plane may also be given {{homogeneous}} coordinates, again using non-zero triples of <b>binary</b> <b>digits.</b> With this system of coordinates, a point is incident to a line if the coordinate for the point and the coordinate for the line have an even number of positions at which they both have nonzero bits: for instance, the point 101 belongs to the line 111, because they have nonzero bits at two common positions. In terms of the underlying linear algebra, a point belongs to a line if the inner product of the vectors representing the point and line is zero.|$|E

In more advanced modems and data transmission techniques, a symbol may have more than two states, so it may represent more than one <b>binary</b> <b>digit</b> (a <b>binary</b> <b>digit</b> always represents one of exactly two states).

An important application of digit extraction algorithms is to validate new claims of record [...] computations: After a new record is claimed, the decimal result is converted to hexadecimal, and then a digit extraction algorithm {{is used to calculate}} several random hexadecimal digits near the end; if they match, this provides a measure of confidence that the entire computation is correct.|$|E

EZW, the original algorithm using zerotree, shows good performance and was successfully adapted to 3 D image compression. This paper focuses on the adaptation of EZW for the compression of hyperspectral images. The subordinate pass is suppressed to remove the necessity to keep the significant pixels in memory. To compensate the loss due to this removal, signed <b>binary</b> <b>digit</b> representations are used {{to increase the efficiency}} of zerotrees. Contextual arithmetic coding with very limited contexts is also used. Finally, we show that this simplified version of 3 D-EZW performs almost as well as the original one.
