5000|$|A <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> (United Kingdom/Australia) (colloquially a banker) or {{helper engine}} or pusher engine (North America) is a railway {{locomotive}} that temporarily assists a train that requires additional power or traction {{to climb a}} gradient (or bank). Helpers/bankers are most commonly found in mountain divisions (called [...] "helper districts" [...] in the U.S.), where the ruling grade may demand the use of substantially greater motive power than that required for other grades within the division.|$|E
50|$|Summit Tank still {{sees the}} {{occasional}} <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> with heavy steel trains regularly using the Unanderra to Moss Vale line {{to gain access}} to the Main South Line to Melbourne. Other traffic on the line includes container trains, bulk wheat and other grain trains, mostly from southern New South Wales; coal trains from Tahmoor; western coal trains using the line during Illawarra line trackwork; limestone trains from Medway, as well as the once-a-month Cockatoo Run to and from Sydney.|$|E
50|$|The {{possible}} {{travel time}} reductions {{were put into}} full effect in the winter 1966/67 timetable. Steam-driven express trains needed a total of 55 minutes between Karl-Marx-Stadt Hbf and Freiberg. After the electrification, the running time was reduced to only 35 minutes. Even more significant reductions in travel time for freight trains resulted from the discontinuation of <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> operations between Flöha and Oederan. The 1300 tonne Dg 7301 locomotives took 61 minutes on the same section compared with 122 minutes before electrification.|$|E

50|$|Since {{the bypass}} joins the Brenner Railway, which has slopes {{of up to}} 2.9%, {{virtually}} all goods trains need a <b>bank</b> <b>engine,</b> attached to the front. When train loads exceed 1,060 tonnes, a third locomotive is also attached to push the train. Due to local opposition {{to the construction of}} a facility for attaching and detaching locomotives in Baumkirchen. this operation has to be carried out in Wörgl terminal north or Wörgl station, requiring an additional journey of up to 44 kilometres per trip.|$|E
5000|$|They were {{fitted with}} multiple-unit train control systems, and could thus be joined {{together}} into larger sets and operated {{from a single}} control station. They were also retrofitted with a special multiple unit control system designed by an electrical engineer of The Milwaukee Road. This enabled the crew of a boxcab to control trailing diesel electric locomotives. However, the EF-4 [...] "Little Joes", which were also retrofitted, were more often seen leading diesel electrics than boxcabs, which had by then been largely relegated {{to the role of}} helper or <b>bank</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|South Geelong tunnel {{was built}} {{as part of}} the {{extension}} of the Geelong railway line towards Colac and runs for a distance of 422 metres underneath the edge of the town centre, between McKillop and Ryrie Streets. Construction was commenced on 15 October 1874 by contractors Overend and Robb. It has a typical horseshoe shape and is built of bluestone and brick. The first train ran though the tunnel on 13 January 1876 and official services commenced on 4 February the same year. Its steep grade limited haulage loads and sometimes required assistance from a <b>bank</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The {{route from}} Croes Newydd to Brymbo was double-tracked, and built to a {{standard}} designed to cope with heavy coal and freight trains {{to and from the}} steelworks. These trains were usually worked by traincrews from Croes Newydd shed using GWR 2800 Class locomotives based there; given the steep climb from Wrexham to Brymbo, which reached gradients of 1 in 36, a <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> (such as a GWR 5600 Class locomotive) was often used. The more lightly built section beyond Brymbo West to Minera was worked by smaller locomotives, such as the 5700 Class, with engine 9610 being used almost exclusively on this line.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{the train}} was hauled by a Merchant Navy class 'Bulleid Pacific' {{locomotive}} between Waterloo and Exeter Central, with Light Pacific locomotives handling the train west of that point. The normal formation was for four carriages to form the Plymouth portion, and eight to form the Ilfracombe portion, although longer trains were sometimes needed. The use of powerful locomotives was essential on the Ilfracombe Branch, due to the very steep gradients and sharp curves on that section of line. For the eastbound departure from Ilfracombe, it was usually necessary for assistance to be provided by a <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> for the 1 in 36 climb from the terminus to Mortehoe & Woolacombe station.|$|E
50|$|Since {{it was not}} {{possible}} to remotely control a steam locomotive, each helper had to have a full crew on board. Careful coordination was required between engine crews to assure that all locomotives were operated in a consistent manner. Standard whistle signals were employed to tell the helper crew when to apply power, drift or brake. A misunderstanding of signals by a pusher locomotive crew could result in a major wreck if the lead locomotive applied brakes while the <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> was still applying power. The usual result was that the train would experience a violent run-in (an abrupt bunching of train slack), resulting in the derailment of part or all of the train.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, The Mortehoe {{banks were}} much harsher. Northbound {{there was a}} 3½ mile {{continuous}} climb of 1 in 41, from Heddon Mill Crossing to Mortehoe. While southbound, from Ilfracombe to Mortehoe, the climb was 1 in 36 for 2½ miles, with severe S-curves past Lower Slade making the journey even harder. <b>Banking</b> <b>engines</b> were kept at Braunton and Ilfracombe, to assist when required. Mortehoe station provided a number of sidings for stabling the <b>banking</b> <b>engines</b> after assisting with the climb.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1947, {{engineer}} Eduard Gruner imagined a two-story base tunnel from Amsteg to Biasca, both rail and road, with {{a stop at}} Sedrun, to provide a faster and flatter passage through the Swiss Alps. Similarly to Gruner's idea, the GBT cuts through the Gotthard Massif some 600 m below the older tunnel. On the current track, the Gotthard Railway, only trains up to 1300 t when using two locomotives or up to 1500 t with an additional <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> {{at the end of}} the train are able to pass through the narrow mountain valleys and through spiral tunnels climbing up to the portals of the old tunnel at a height of 1151 m above sea level. When the GBT is in full service, standard freight trains of up to 3600 t will be able to pass this natural barrier.|$|E
5000|$|The Re 6/6 is {{equipped}} with multiple unit train control together with Re 4/4II, Re 4/4III, Re 4/4IV and RBe 540. In passenger traffic they pull heavy passenger trains over the Gotthard route (as an alternative to a double heading of Re 4/4). In freight traffic they are used all over Switzerland for heavy trains, on the Gotthard route very often together with an Re 4/4II or Re 4/4III. Such a couple, {{often referred to as}} [...] "Re 10/10" [...] (both locomotives are Re class, so the couple is Re class; 10/10 means that they overall have 10 driven axles out of 10), is capable of pulling the maximum train weight of 1300 t on 2.6% gradients of the Gotthard line. For heavier trains, up to 1600 tons are operationally feasible; an additional <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> has to help push the train in order not to overload the couplers.|$|E
50|$|Sulzer {{developed}} {{a series of}} rail traction engines in the 1930s and 1940s which were used extensively in diesel locomotives in the UK, Europe and South America. A small number were used in locomotives in Africa and Australia. The Sulzer LDA (prefixed {{by the number of}} cylinders, and with a suffix related to the cylinder bore) engine was widely used by British Rail and Romanian Railways. Many were built under licence by Vickers-Armstrong at Barrow as six-, eight- and twelve-cylinder form, and in Romania, by Reșița works for Electroputere Craiova. The twelve-cylinder engine was used in the British Rail Class 47, Romanian Railways Class 60/62, Polish Railways Class ST43, China Railways ND2, and several others. The 12LDA28 engine was a double <b>bank</b> <b>engine</b> having, in effect, two six-cylinder engines side by side, rather than a V-type as favoured by many other manufacturers. Sulzer V-type engines for rail use bore the type number LVA (with a 50-degree angle between the banks).|$|E
50|$|In {{countries}} where buffers-and-chain couplers are used, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> often cannot {{be added to}} the front of the train due to the limited strength of the couplers; In the case of standard UIC couplers and a maximum grade of 28‰ (which is common e.g. for lines through the Alps), the limit is a train weight of 1400 tons; if a train is heavier, <b>bank</b> <b>engines</b> have to be added in the middle or to the end of the train in order not to exceed the maximum load for any coupler.|$|R
