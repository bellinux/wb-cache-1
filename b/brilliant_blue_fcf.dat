40|$|There {{are several}} field methods and {{techniques}} for measuring Ks. In this study, double-ring (DI) and tension infiltrometer (TI) infiltration techniques were combined with dye tracer application and compared for estimating Ks and the mobile soil fraction on a structured sandy loam soil (Gleyic Luvisol), in Rostock, Germany. Water was infiltrated into soil by using three methods: DI, TI (without contact with sand), and TIsand (with contact with sand), until steady-state conditions were obtained. At different positions, three pulse depths of 25 mm, 50 mm, and 100 mm, with a 2 g L- 1 <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> (BB) <b>FCF</b> dye solution, were used. The results showed variable Ks values for DI of 820 - 2, 020 cm d- 1, which were 7 to 13 times higher, {{when compared to}} TI values, and 12 to 33 times higher than for TIsand. For the 25 mm and 50 mm BB applications, the mobile (dye-stained) soil regions constituted up to 60 % in the top 25 cm and varied little, when considered the infiltration methods. Only the 100 mm application, using the DI, yielded significant BB displacement into the subsoil. Hence, both Ks values and their corresponding dye pattern depended on the boundary conditions. For DI, more than 90 % of the dye was constrained below the infiltration area, revealing that flow was essentially vertical...|$|R

40|$|Temporal {{mapping of}} the {{three-dimensional}} {{spatial distribution of}} solute transport in soils is needed for an improved understanding of the underlying processes. Numerous studies have confirmed that <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> imaging provides spatially highly resolved information on solute transport In soils. A drawback of the method, however, is its destructive character, which prevents three-dimensional mapping of the temporal evolution of <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> plumes or fronts. In this study, we determined that the negative ionic charge of the <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> molecule for moderately acid and basic environments provides an electrical conductivity contrast that can be detected by means of time domain reflectometry (TDR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT).

40|$|Summary: The {{quantitative}} determination of proteins in biological fluids, using Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> G- 250, was evaluated. Compared with the biuret method, the Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> G- 250 method needs a much shorter time for analysis {{and has a}} greater sensitivity. The sensitivity of the dye for albumin is significantly greater than for globulins. The standard curves for the biuret method are more linear than those for the Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> G- 250 method. The Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> G- 250 method produces a precipitate, which sticks to {{the walls of the}} cuvet and results in an intolerable carry-over. Therefore, the use of the Coomassie <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> G- 250 method for the {{quantitative determination}} of proteins in urine and serum is not recommended.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} novel dyes to stain lens capsule (LC), internal limiting membrane (ILM), epiretinal membrane (ERM), and vitreous. DESIGN: Experimental study in animal and human donor eyes. METHODS: Thirteen dyes, methyl violet, crystal violet, eosin Y, sudan black B, methylene blue, toluidine blue, light green, indigo carmine, fast green, congo red, evans <b>blue,</b> <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue,</b> and bromophenol blue, were injected onto the LC and ILM of enucleated porcine eyes. the vitreous was stained with 2 mL of dyes for 1 minute. Six dyes (indigo carmine, evans blue, fast green, light green, bromophenol <b>blue,</b> and <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue)</b> were selected for experiments in human donor eyes and freshly removed ERM. RESULTS: in the porcine eyes, ILM staining with methylene blue, toluidine blue, indigo carmine, evans blue, bromophenol blue, and fast green was moderate, and methyl violet, crystal violet, <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue,</b> or sudan black resulted in strong staining. Methyl violet, crystal violet, sudan black, toluidine blue, and methylene blue caused histologic damage in porcine retinas. Vitreous examination revealed moderate staining with congo red, crystal violet, fast green, eosin Y, methylene <b>blue,</b> toluidine <b>blue,</b> <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue,</b> bromophenol blue, and methyl violet and strong staining with light green and evans blue. ERMs showed strong staining with 0. 5 % evans blue and moderate staining with 0. 5 % light green, fast green, <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue,</b> and bromophenol blue. Evaluation of donor eyes disclosed moderate staining with evans blue, light green, and bromophenol blue and strong staining with 0. 5 % <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue.</b> Moderate or strong staining of the vitreous occurred with most dyes. LC evaluation showed moderate staining with 0. 5 % evans blue, fast green, and <b>brilliant</b> <b>blue,</b> whereas 0. 5 % light green produced strong LC staining. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Brilliant</b> <b>blue</b> shows the best ILM staining, whereas bromophenol blue, evans blue, and light green also stain ILM. Most dyes bind well to LC, vitreous, and ERM.

50|$|Green {{colouring}} {{is often}} used to colour mushy peas. It is typically achieved by adding the yellow and blue additives, Tartrazine (E102) and <b>Brilliant</b> <b>Blue</b> <b>FCF</b> (E133), which together produce the green effect. The use of artificial colours results in bright green mushy peas. Pure mushy peas, with no colouring, tend to form a more grey-green end product. Sodium bicarbonate (E500) is often added to soften the peas to enhance the colour and to inhibit fermentation during soaking, which reduces later flatulence in consuming said foods. The British Food Standards Agency, on 28 April 2008, asked for a voluntary ban on artificial food colourings and suggested that the ban would be practical by the end of 2009. This would mean that certain foods, including mushy peas, would need to be free of the additive, otherwise the item might be removed from sale. Mushy peas present a particular problem since there is no alternative to tartrazine that gives it the bright green colour. Without the colourant the dish would be murky grey. Ministers have stated that they will pursue a ban through law if food manufacturers do not phase out the food colourings.|$|E
