At first glance Peter thought it was his old friend, Skimmer the Tree Swallow, and he was just on the point of asking what under the sun Skimmer was doing in such a place as that, when with a lively twitter of greeting the owner of that little hole in the bank flew out and circled over Peter's head. It wasn't Skimmer at all. It was Banker the <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow,</b> own cousin to Skimmer the Tree Swallow. Peter recognized him the instant he got a full view of him.|$|E
60|$|In this bank, {{above the}} clay, I {{counted in the}} summer, two hundred holes of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow</b> within a space six rods long, and {{there were at least}} one {{thousand}} old birds within three times that distance, twittering over the surf. I had never associated them in my thoughts with the beach before. One little boy who had been a-birds-nesting had got eighty swallows' eggs for his share! Tell it not to the Humane Society. There were many young birds on the clay beneath, which had tumbled out and died. Also there were many Crow-blackbirds hopping about in the dry fields, and the Upland Plover were breeding close by the light-house. The keeper had once cut off one's wing while mowing, as she sat on her eggs there. This is also a favorite resort for gunners in the fall to shoot the Golden Plover. As around the shores of a pond are seen devil's-needles, butterflies, etc., so here, to my surprise, I saw at the same season great devil's-needles of a size proportionably larger, or nearly as big as my finger, incessantly coasting up and down the edge of the bank, and butterflies also were hovering over it, and I never saw so many dorr-bugs and beetles of various kinds as strewed the beach. They had apparently flown over the bank in the night, and could not get up again, and some had perhaps fallen into the sea and were washed ashore. They may have been in part attracted by the light-house lamps.|$|E

40|$|The host, habitat preferences, {{and life}} {{histories}} of species of Protocalliphora were investigated in northern Utah. The effect of species of Protocalliphora on blood levels (hematocrit and hemoglobin) and weight gains of nestling birds also was studied. A total of 1, 819 bird nests were examined, representing 68 bird species from 10 habitats. Forty-eight percent (869) of the nests of 51 bird species found were infested. Eighteen species of Protocalliphora, including 11 undescribed, were collected. Birds experiencing {{a high rate}} of infestation included most colonial nesters (such as <b>bank</b> <b>swallows</b> and yellow-headed blackbirds), cavity nesters (such as starlings and tree swallows, excluding woodpeckers), and some solitary open nesters, such as magpies, warblers, and flycatchers. Many solitary open nesters (such as sparrows and robins) and one colonial nester (red-winged blackbirds) experienced lower rates of infestation.

40|$|Abstract. Male <b>bank</b> <b>swallows</b> {{pursue a}} mixed {{reproductive}} strategy. As previously documented, they form monogamous pair bonds with females {{with whom they}} will share parental duties of nest-building, incubation, and feeding of the young. In addi-tion, however, they routinely seek promiscuous copulations with otherfemales, {{both before and after}} pair-bonding. Trivers suggests that a monogamous male should be under selective pressure to pursue a “mixed ” reproductive strat-egy when conditions permit: “to help a single female raise young while not pass-ing up opportunities to mate with other females whom he will not aid ” (I, p. 145). As a corollary, in such species the male should sequester his mate, that is, protect her from insemination by othe...|$|R

50|$|Flickers may be {{observed}} in open habitats near trees, including woodlands, edges, yards, and parks. In the western United States, one can find them in mountain forests {{all the way up}} to tree line. Northern flickers generally nest in holes in trees like other woodpeckers. Occasionally, they have been found nesting in old, earthen burrows vacated by belted kingfishers or <b>bank</b> <b>swallows.</b> Both sexes help with nest excavation. The entrance hole is about 7.6 cm in diameter, and the cavity is 33 - 41 cm deep. The cavity widens at bottom to make room for eggs and the incubating adult. Inside, the cavity is bare except for a bed of wood chips for the eggs and chicks to rest on. Once nestlings are about 17 days old, they begin clinging to the cavity wall rather than lying on the floor.|$|R
50|$|What exactly {{constitutes}} a colony {{is a matter}} of definition. Tufted puffins, for example, are pelagic birds that nest on the steep slopes and rocky crevices on coastal cliffs, often on islands. Each pair excavates its own burrow. A congregation of puffin burrows on a marine island is considered a colony. Sand martins (called <b>bank</b> <b>swallows</b> in North America) are seldom, if ever, observed to nest in solitude; such a dependence on social nesting would term the bird a colonial nester. A more extreme example of colonial nesting is found in the weaverbird family. The sociable weaver of southern Africa constructs massive, multi-family dwellings of twigs and dry grasses, with many entrances leading to different nesting chambers, accommodating as many as a hundred nesting pairs. These structures resemble haystacks hanging from trees, and have been likened to apartment buildings or beehives.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF THE <b>BANK</b> <b>SWALLOW</b> ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER by Dawn Garcia Master of Science in Environmental Science California State University, Chico Summer 2009 The <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow</b> (Riparia riparia) in California {{was listed}} as a State {{threatened}} species in 1989 due to declining populations and continued habitat loss from bank armoring. As part of their <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow</b> Recovery Plan, the California Department of Fish and Game implemented annual surveys on the Sacramento River to evaluate yearly trends of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow.</b> I evaluated nine years of spatial and temporal trends in colony dynamics and incorporated local physical data possibly affecting colony parameters. I subset colonies based on size and years of persistence, and statistically analyzed differences in colony parameters. From 1998 - 2008, the Sacramento River population remained relatively stable but showed no increase since its decline from 1987 estimates. Colony numbers and total number of burrows were similarly distributed across the 100 -mile study area, with a tendency for larger colonies to {{be located in the}} x upstream reach and more colonies located in the downstream reach. Larger colonies persisted the longest (8 - 10 years). Colonies that were active 1 - 2 years and small and medium-sized colonies were most common. Erosion activity was associated with colonies that persisted longest. Riparian vegetation was the dominant overstory associated with all colonies. My study begins to elucidate some of the <b>Bank</b> <b>Swallow</b> colony trends and physical factors that may be associated with persistent colonies. It serves as a baseline for future research and comparative analysis. It contributes information necessary to inform the management of the species population dynamics as habitat loss continues by flood and erosion control projects on the Sacramento River.

40|$|Rivers are {{fundamentally}} linked to their adjacent terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, within river-floodplains, {{the emergence of}} adult aquatic insects constitutes a resource flux for local bird communities, {{and the structure of}} this emergence varies across the mosaic of aquatic habitats within these ecosystems. In our study, we are assessing the importance of habitat heterogeneity, through its influence on patterns of insect emergence, on the overall density, species richness, and biodiversity of insectivorous birds across seven unique habitats within a Snake River-floodplain. During summer 2017, we conducted three bird point-counts monthly at each habitat, separated by 50 -meter line transects. Overall, we observed higher bird abundance and richness at flowing-water habitats than standing-water habitats. In total, 16 species of insectivorous birds have been observed; several species, most notably <b>bank</b> <b>swallows,</b> song sparrows, and yellow warblers, have been ubiquitous, whereas others have been exclusively observed in specific habitats. A thought-experiment, whereby we sequentially and randomly aggregated species richness from seven habitats, revealed richness increasing curvilinearly with increasing habitat heterogeneity. We hypothesize that this pattern is linked to the asynchrony of insect emergence among habitats, such that the complexity of the mosaic sustains elevated bird diversity by providing more consistent and diverse prey resources...|$|R
