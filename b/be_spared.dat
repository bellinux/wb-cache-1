5|$|Also {{around age}} 16, Dalton's younger brother grew gravely ill. According to her autobiography, she fasted and prayed that her brother's life would <b>be</b> <b>spared,</b> {{and while she}} prayed this way he {{remained}} alive, although still ill. When Dalton's mother wished that her son's sufferings would end, Dalton stopped praying that his life would <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> and instead prayed that God's will be done. Her little brother died shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{soldiers}} eventually find Ip at {{the cotton}} mill. Ip tells Chow {{to take his}} wife and son away for protection. Miura tells Ip that his life will <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. Sato tells Ip that his life will <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> if he lets the general win.|$|E
5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.|$|E

Southcott lived {{to be a key}} witness, along with Casey, who <b>was</b> also <b>spared,</b> and their eyewitness accounts and testimony were key to the trials of many of the mutineers. Three petty officers joined the mutiny, one midshipman, Surgeon's Mate Cronin, and Master's Mate Turner.|$|R

5|$|Little to {{no major}} {{modifications}} {{were made to}} the two active Colorados in the opening months of the U.S.'s entry into the war; all of the battleships in the Pacific Fleet had a constant order to be ready to sail within 48 hours in case of a Japanese attempt to invade Hawaii or the West Coast and could not <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> for any major yard work. Colorado was hurried through the rest of her refit with the addition of essential items like radar, splinter protection, 14 Oerlikon 20mm and four 1.1in light anti-aircraft guns; Maryland received a similar treatment later, the only difference being 16 20mm's and no 1.1in. Although tower masts were constructed for Colorado and Maryland and a majority of the old cage masts were cut down by the ships' crews in the beginning of 1942, the ships could not <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> the time needed to install the new masts. The tower masts were placed into storage and not used until early 1944.|$|E

5|$|In the Synoptics, Jesus and {{his disciples}} {{go to the}} garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to {{identify}} him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword {{to cut off the}} ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, {{forestry}} authorities intensified their {{pest control}} methods and additionally started education campaigns, such as warning not to transport firewood over large distances or to store it too long. Through wood export, the wasp can spread to East Asia, West Australia {{and parts of}} Africa. Remote locations, such as the Horn of Africa, may <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> from the Sirex woodwasp, providing the area is controlled. The Invasive Species Specialist Group (ISSG) of the IUCN has graded the wasp as heavily invasive.|$|E
5|$|The drama {{ended on}} Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, {{when a group}} of {{officers}} and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king. His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama's head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.|$|E

She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, {{the values}} of the D-D and T-D had been revised upwards, raising hopes that a fusion {{reaction}} could be started at lower temperatures. Teller was sufficiently optimistic about the Super, and sufficiently concerned about reports that the Germans were interested in deuterium, to ask the Governing Board to raise its priority. The board agreed to some extent, but ruled that only one person could <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> to work on it full-time. Oppenheimer designated Konopinski, who would {{spend the rest of the}} war working on it. Nonetheless, in February 1944, Teller added Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, and Harold and Mary Argo to his T-1 Group. Ulam calculated the inverse Compton cooling, while Roberg worked out the ignition temperature of T-D mixtures. Maria Goeppert joined the group in February 1945.|$|E
5|$|England and France {{were in the}} {{concluding}} stages of the Hundred Years War. The French {{did not wish to}} lose their advantage in the fight by sending knights and the English were in no position to do so. Spain was {{in the final stages of}} the Reconquista. The Holy Roman Empire, never centralized enough behind the Hohenstaufen to unite the principalities, had exhausted what could <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> at Varna. Further fighting among the German princes and the Hussite wars seriously reduced the willingness of most to perform a crusade. Poland and Hungary were key participants at Varna and the defeat there along with the Polish–Teutonic Wars kept them busy and unwilling for further commitments.|$|E

The missile changes course and explodes over Panau's oilfields, killing Panay and destroying the island's oil reserves. Rico rejoins Sheldon, Kane and Jade, who are dismayed {{at the loss of}} billions of dollars' worth of oil. Rico explains that oil is not worth dying for; with its oil gone, interest in Panau will be lost, the superpowers will not war and the island's residents will <b>be</b> <b>spared.</b> Sheldon agrees, assuring Rico that a president friendly to the U.S. will be installed on Panau and the island will be closely monitored; the group raise their glasses, toasting friendship and a job well done.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{had been}} {{building}} among the base's staff in recent days, and most suspected that an attack would come {{against one of the}} border stations in the near future. Ample evidence of the coming attack was discovered by British patrols, but signs of enemy troop movements were disregarded and newly cleared positions were mistaken for ambush sites. Thus the base was continually left with the bare minimum number of men as the majority that could <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> went out on patrol. As a result of these conditions, only 36 men were present in the base {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 April 1965 when it came under ferocious attack by 150 to 400 Indonesian troops, supported by artillery and rocket fire. Immediately, the Indonesians swarmed into one segment of the trenches and destroyed one of the two mortars.|$|E
5|$|The {{crew members}} on the fore-mast {{initially}} reached {{an agreement with the}} Malagasy: the crew's lives were to <b>be</b> <b>spared</b> on condition that they sailed Meermin back to Madagascar; but this truce broke down, as a result of which most of those crew members were also killed, and all were thrown overboard. The crew in the gunroom were short of food and drink; Muller decided that they should attempt to regain control of Meermin. Neither Muller nor Gulik took part in the attack, as both were wounded. It was led by bosun Laurens Pieters; twelve crewmen left the gunroom, shooting as they went. Pieters and another of the attack party were killed on deck; the rest retreated back to the gunroom, where another crewman, who had been severely wounded, later died.|$|E

5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews to carry out the deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to <b>be</b> <b>spared,</b> and they refused to carry out the blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E
5|$|Urobuchi {{stated that}} Sayaka was his {{favorite}} character overall, and remarked that her plotline was the most enjoyable to write. Due to her grim fate {{by the end of}} the series, a destiny that Shinbo believed was slightly unfair, he asked Urobuchi if it was possible to change the plot so that Sayaka could <b>be</b> <b>spared.</b> Urobuchi declined, asserting that her death was too integral to the overarching story. Shinbo then inquired if there were any way that she could be brought back to life, admitting he had become very attached to the character. However, Urobuchi again refused, explaining that this would be impossible with regard to the already-established rules governing the story. Shinbo finally acquiesced to this, but remarked that he believed there may have been too large of a burden placed on the characters who were in essence young middle school girls.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of Norway and Denmark, {{followed by a}} warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi Meada that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain, {{it became clear to}} the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible. They started to fully prepare for war, both mentally and physically. Dutch border troops were put on greater alert. Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors. Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports. On 19 April a state of emergency was declared. However, most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might <b>be</b> <b>spared,</b> an attitude that has since been described as a state of denial. The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict. On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side, but were again refused.|$|E
