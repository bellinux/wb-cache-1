The former occurs with qingqiu 青虯 [...] "green horned-dragon"; (tr. Le Blanc 1987:144) [...] "When the red hornless dragon {{and the green}} horned dragon roamed the land of Chi 冀, the sky was limpid and the earth undisturbed." [...] The latter occurs with benshe 奔蛇 [...] "fast snake", (tr. Le Blanc 1987:162), the chariot of Fu Xi and Nüwa was [...] "preceded by white serpents and followed by speeding snakes." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Peering {{into the}} Obscure" [...] (6, 覽冥訓) {{describes}} Fuxi and Nüwa being transported by yinglong 應龍 and qingqiu 青虯 [...] "green qiu-dragons", while accompanied by <b>baichi</b> 白螭 [...] "white chi-dragons" [...] and benshe 奔蛇 [...] "speeding snakes". They rode the thunder chariot, using winged dragons as the inner pair and green dragons as the outer pair. They clasped the magic jade tablets and displayed their charts. Yellow clouds hung inter-woven (to form a coverlet over the chariot) and they (the whole retinue) were preceded by white serpents {{and followed by}} speeding snakes. (tr. Le Blanc 1985:161-2)Gao Yu's (2nd century CE) Huainanzi commentary glosses yinglong 應龍 as a [...] "winged dragon" [...] and qiu 虯 as a [...] "hornless dragon".|$|E
40|$|We {{developed}} a multi-scale OBIA (object-based image analysis) landslide detection technique to map shallow landslides in the <b>Baichi</b> watershed, Taiwan, after the 2004 Typhoon Aere event. Our semi-automated detection method selected multiple scales through landslide size statistics analysis for successive classification rounds. The detection performance achieved a modified success rate (MSR) of 86. 5 % with the training dataset and 86 % with the validation dataset. This performance level {{was due to}} the multi-scale aspect of our methodology, as the MSR for single scale classification was substantially lower, even after spectral difference segmentation, with a maximum of 74 %. Our multi-scale technique was capable of detecting landslides of varying sizes, including very small landslides, up to 95 m 2 . The method presented certain limitations: the thresholds we established for classification were specific to the study area, to the landslide type in the study area, and to the spectral characteristics of the satellite image. Because updating site-specific and image-specific classification thresholds is easy with OBIA software, our multi-scale technique is expected to be useful for mapping shallow landslides at watershed level...|$|E
