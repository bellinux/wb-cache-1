40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare selection costs in cattle populations of 1, 000 to 15, 000 females, with the constraint of 1 % of inbreeding per generation. Three selection schemes were analysed: no progeny test, with selection of sires on pedigree index (NPT); progeny test of sires of sires (PT 3); classical progeny test of sires of sires and sires of dams (PT 4). With the progeny test schemes, bulls were either culled after semen collection for progeny testing, or kept alive. Costs per year increased linearly with population size and showed divergent trends among strategies. PT 4 was the most expensive scheme, ranging from 125, 700 Euro (1, 000 females) to 318, 900 Euro (15, 000 females) with the alive <b>bull</b> <b>strategy,</b> and from 20, 200 Euro to 206, 300 Euro with the cull <b>bull</b> <b>strategy.</b> NPT was generally cheaper than PT 3 when bulls were culled.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{mathematical}} model {{was developed to}} simulate alternative selection and crossbreeding strategies for commercial beef production. Biological and economic constraints were selected to represent typical pasture production of calves in the Northwest. The crossbreeding study evaluated the relative economic efficiency of different 1) mating plans when sire breeds of several sizes were used, 2) maximum cow replacement ages, and 3) cow culling strategies based on measures of reproductive failure. Replacing open cows in the fall with a heifer increased economic efficiency, as did replacing cows without a live calf {{at the end of}} the calving season. Replacing cows for failure to wean a calf decreased economic efficiency. The use of a very large terminal breed in the criss-out-cross or the three-breed terminal cross surpassed the three-breed rotational cross in economic efficiency. The criss-out-cross was superior to the three-breed terminal cross at cow replacement ages less than twelve years. The cow replacement ages which maximized gross margin per cow were five, nine, and twelve years for three-breed rotational, criss-out-cross and three-breed terminal crossbreeding, respectively. This reflected the average utilization of individual and maternal heterosis for the various mating plans. The selection study evaluated the economic efficiency and selection response of alternative bull and cow culling strategies.

40|$|The use of {{national}} stereotypes will {{be examined in}} this chapter both in a contemporary and historical context. The timelessness of John Bull and Zé Povinho is confirmed with two examples. The first is the Birmingham Mail’s on-line article by Jon Griffin entitled “John Bull to stand as Mayor in Birmingham”, (December 8, 2010), which recounts how retired policeman and election candidate Ray Egan was running for mayoral office dressed as John <b>Bull,</b> a <b>strategy</b> designed to enhance his patriotic appeal. The second example is from the Público newspaper’s front page leading article for October 10, 2010. The headline reads – “PSD accuses PS of budget ‘blackmail’ but is simultaneously willing to negotiate”. The current economic crisis is succinctly correlated with that of two centuries earlier through the reproduction of an illustration showing a prostrate Zé Povinho literally ‘saddled’ with a plethora of useless politicians who, although rotating in office, have produced similar disastrous results to those attained by the recent political incumbents of São Bento. Using this type of stereotypical 'short-hand' can be useful but the risks endemic in any stereotype should not be forgotten, especially the inability to reflect nuance because of standardization. John Bull and Zé Povinho were also used around 1890 in a propaganda war of words and images concerning colonial aspirations in Africa.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 94 - 96. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the performance and risk characteristics of three market timing <b>strategies,</b> namely traditional, <b>bull</b> and bear timing, and how different market conditions affect these strategies. The market is segmented into bullish and bearish phases and three independent but corroborative studies test how each of the timing strategies perform under the identified market conditions by measuring the returns, the required predictive accuracy and the degree of risk taken. The results of the various studies are compared across the three timing strategies as well as across the different market conditions. This gives an indication of each strategy's performance and risk characteristics. The results of the three studies indicate that potential rewards from market timing are high if perfect forecasting is achieved. This return will also be achieved at a lower level of risk compared to that of the market. However as the forecasting ability falls the advantages of market timing are quickly eroded. The potential returns are not only lower but will generally be achieved at a higher level of risk compared to perfect timing, unless a <b>bull</b> timing <b>strategy</b> is employed. To be guaranteed success at market timing, predictive ability of approximately 80 % is required. For timing abilities below this threshold the success and risk profile of such a strategy will largely be dependent on which review periods are incorrectly predicted. For predictive ability below about 60 % investors are more likely to under perform the market than to beat it. On a risk adjusted basis this falls to 55 % suggesting that investors need at least some level of predictive ability to be successful at market timing. The results also suggest that it is generally more important to predict the bullish periods than the bearish ones. It is also evident that the market condition has a significant effect on all the market timing strategies analysed. When the market is in a bullish phase, extremely high levels of predictive accuracy are required just to have an even chance of beating the index, even to the extent that a <b>bull</b> timing <b>strategy</b> may not outperform the index regardless of the predictive ability. Only on a risk adjusted basis are returns above the market possible, albeit at high levels of predictive accuracy. Evidently, when the market is bullish, market timing is not a viable investment strategy. Nevertheless this study does highlight that there exists pockets of time where market timing may be viable. When the market turns bearish the required forecasting ability necessary to outperform the market falls drastically such that random guesses as to the next review period's performance are more than likely to produce a return above that of the market. Again, market timing during a bearish period achieves returns at a level of risk below that of the index. The studies also give insight as to how each of the strategies themselves perform under the different market conditions. It is clear that, for very high levels of predictive accuracy, traditional timing performs the best on both a nominal and on a risk adjusted basis. However, poor timing using this strategy performs the worst on a nominal basis. Only when risk is taken into account does poor traditional timing outperform poor bull timing...|$|R

Mutations in Pit- 1 have been found in growth hormone disorders of mice and humans. We studied the eventual association between Pit- 1 polymorphism using the HinfI enzyme and the milk yield and conformation traits of 89 Italian Holstein-Friesian <b>bulls.</b> A <b>strategy</b> employing polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a 451 -bp fragment from semen DNA. Digestion of polymerase chain reaction products with HinfI revealed two alleles: allele A was not digested (451 -bp fragment), and allele B was cut at one restriction site, generating two fragments of 244 and 207 bp. Three patterns were observed; frequencies were 2. 2, 31. 5, and 66. 3 % for AA, AB, and BB, respectively. Fixed and mixed linear models were fitted on daughter yield deviations for milk yields and on deregressed proofs for conformation traits. Predictions were weighted using the inverse of the estimated variance of records. The models used contained mean and gene substitution effects for Pit- 1 A allele as fixed effects and random sire effect for the mixed model. The A allele was found to be superior for milk and protein yields, inferior for fat percentage, and superior for body depth, angularity, and rear leg set, which is difficult to explain.

40|$|The {{increase}} and range extension of wolves (Canis lupus L) and brown bears (Ursus arctos L) in Scandinavia inevitably impacts moose (Alces alces L.) populations and, as a consequence, {{the size and}} composition of the hunter harvest must be adjusted. We used a sex- and age-structured moose population model to delineate optimal harvest strategies under predation and to compare the resulting harvest composition with the strategy commonly implemented in practice. We examined how much moose density or adult sex ratio needs to change to fully compensate for losses to predation. We found a harvest allocation pattern in commonly used practical management across calves, bulls and cows that indicated a trade-off strategy between maximising the number of shot moose, the yield biomass {{and the number of}} shot prime <b>bulls.</b> This <b>strategy</b> performed quite well with respect to all yield measures and yielded an age structure most similar to the strategies maximising harvest biomass and prime bulls. Unless predation pressure was very high, the harvest loss could be completely compensated for by allowing a higher moose density. In other situations the current hunting strategy was not possible to implement and the moose density needed to sustain predation even without hunting increases dramatically. An alternative option to balance the predation loss was to accept a more female-biased sex ratio in the winter population. Hence, {{it may be possible to}} keep 50 % calves in the harvest and still obtain the same total harvest if the proportion of bulls in the harvest is increased to compensate for predation. The increase of large carnivores competing with moose hunting creates conflicts and will inevitably reduce harvest yield unless hunting strategies change. We show how increased moose density and redistribution of the harvest towards bulls can mitigate this conflict and we provide a web-based tool, where stakeholders can compare the long-term effects of alternative management decisions and eventually adjust their hunting strategy accordingly.

40|$|Since {{its release}} in 1979, the Walkman has engendered new modes of musical {{experience}} {{for millions of}} listeners. Its portability and the apparent isolation offered by its headphones enable Walkman users {{to listen to music}} in situations where it would otherwise be impossible. They can also use Walkman Music to achieve outcomes for which other forms of music may not be suited. Eleven functions of Walkman Music, ten adapted from Michael <b>Bull's</b> (2000) <b>strategies</b> of Walkman use and one derived from this study's fieldwork results, are examined here. Following Timothy Rice's (1987) model for ethnomusicological study, the functions' origins in historical musical practice are investigated, as well as their maintenance in social interaction and listeners' individual experience of them. This study demonstrates Walkman listeners are focussed entirely on their Walkman Music in only two functions, either enjoying it or trying to learn it. Four functions involve Walkman listeners' interactions with their surroundings – namely, listeners use Walkman Music to control their environments' soundscapes, to ease their negotiation of places they consider unpleasant, to control personal interactions and, in combination with their surroundings, Walkman Music gives listeners the impression they are viewing or acting in a film for which their music is the soundtrack. Listeners use Walkman Music for its effects on themselves in five functions. They choose rhythmic music for motivation during exercise or music which will influence their mood. Listeners also use Walkman Music to simulate the presence of a companion or because they consider it a more enjoyable or productive use of time they would otherwise consider wasted. Finally, Walkman Music can prompt listeners' memories of past events. While similar observations have been made in previous studies and particularly by Bull, music's role has not been appropriately acknowledged. This study's examination of Walkman Music in terms of the functions it fulfils for listeners corrects this imbalance. Observations in the literature relating to Walkman use are tested for their resonance with Walkman listeners in ethnographic interviews conducted in Adelaide, Australia. Conclusions are drawn regarding the degree of isolation listeners actually achieve from their surroundings and also regarding the relative novelty or otherwise of the uses to which listeners put their Walkman Music.

Average daily gain (ADG) during the grazing season was greater (P < 0. 01) for HA than for LA. Consequently, HA bulls were 16 kg heavier at housing: 214 and 230 kg, respectively (P < 0. 05). During the finishing period, ADG tended (P = 0. 09) to be greater for LA than for HA. Carcass weight tended (P = 0. 08) to be greater for HA than for LA. Fat score was greater for HA.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The Red Bull brand {{has been}} in the {{international}} market since 1992 and entered the South African market in 1997. The company has seen phenomenal growth in the South African market, selling in excess of 39 million cans in South Africa during 2010. The brand created the energy drink category for the Western world. Red Bull grew the energy drink category in South Africa (SA) and with growth in profits and turnover, competitors entered the energy drink category. According to the brand strategy, the positioning of the Red Bull brand has always been premium. However, the economy and the fierce competitive environment in the energy drink category have become challenging for the brand both in terms of market share and value share. This begs the question: Is the Red Bull brand in South Africa sustainable? The brand remained premium in difficult economic times and during a time when many new brands entered the energy drink category. Hence, Red Bull’s loss of value and volume share in the energy drink category is the motivation for this study. The approach to the research includes conducting focus-group interviews with consumers and administering questionnaires. The research consists of three parts, namely Project Toro, Project Rojo and Project Matador, and was conducted by TNS Research SA for Red Bull. The research indicated that the brand is challenged in the area of pricing. Price remains the barrier of entry for new consumers purchasing Red Bull. Consumers agree that the brand must remain a premium brand. However, at some stage premium can become too premium. The price of Red Bull products will have to decrease to help ensure sustainability of the brand in South Africa. However, consumers did note that the brand must not decrease its prices too much because it will take away the status of the brand. The Red Bull brand is also challenged by the value proposition component. Competitor brands have larger cans which offer consumers value for money while Red Bull is known as the “small can” brand. As based on Red <b>Bull’s</b> international <b>strategy,</b> the efficacy and re-energising functional value of the brand are the main reasons why people still consume Red Bull. The focus that Red Bull once had on the entry-level consumer market that ensures sustainability of the brand has also been challenged by new brands in the category. Competitors have seen the opportunity created by investing in the entry-level consumer market. Red Bull SA has not been keeping up with international energy trends, which created an opportunity for competitors to launch bigger pack sizes and to be first-to-market. This has taken away value and volume share from the most valuable energy drink brand in South Africa. Renewed focus on the main findings of the research can give Red Bull the opportunity to once again be the leading brand in terms of value and volume...|$|R
40|$|Small {{populations of}} animals are {{vulnerable}} to the consequences of breeding within a closed group – inbreeding depression and genetic drift lead to reductions in genetic variability, which in turn can give rise to the amplification of deleterious traits. Traditionally, managers attempt to minimise these effects by controlling the genetic structure via a manipulation of the paternal line, {{in the case of}} rhinos usually by translocation of breeding and sub-adult <b>bulls.</b> This <b>strategy</b> depends on having access to detailed pedigree data, and, in particular, some knowledge of the parentage of the offspring within the population. This information is particularly difficult to obtain in long-lived, free-ranging populations (particularly for rare and endangered species) where the identity of the father must be inferred from behavioural observations, and often the identity of the mother cannot be determined once juveniles have dispersed. In this thesis I present the results of a study to determine the parentage within a free-ranging, enclosed population of southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) located on Ongava Game Reserve (OGR) in the north of Namibia. I used genetic techniques to obtain a genotype for each animal in the population, and then used detailed reserve management records from the period 1993 - 2009 to constrain the statistical process of parentage assignment. Using these different methods, I was able to assign both parents for 22 of 23 offspring with 80 % confidence (16 of 23 at 95 % confidence, mother only in 1 of 23), making this study the first to successfully complete a comprehensive parentage analysis in a free-ranging population of southern white rhinoceros. The key to the success of this study was a combination of accurate pedigree data and a complete set of genotype data. The parentage assignments allowed me to construct a complete lineage diagram for each of the founder matrilines, and further analyse the status and reproductive success of the population. OGR’s southern white rhinoceros population is expanding at close to 14 %, well over the expected maximum growth rate for rhinoceros metapopulations (9 %). The mean inter-calf interval is about 2. 2 years and average age at first parturition is 6 years, indicating good fecundity. Conception is strongly seasonal, occurring mainly (89 %) during the rainy season. The current management practice is to replace dominant bulls after their breeding tenure, and also to remove all young bulls from the population before they reach breeding age (with the aim to restrict potential inbreeding). Only one calf of seven in the F 2 generation is inbred. My analysis indicates that, at least in the 2006 cohort of eight calves, founder females bred only with the founder male, while offspring females (F 1 generation) bred only with introduced males. This suggests some form of mate selection leading to inbreeding avoidance within the population. Finally, {{there is some evidence that}} certain matrilines exhibit/experience different reproductive potential (daughters in one matriline exhibit longer inter-calving intervals and male bias in calf birth sex ratios). These details indicate that genetic data provide valuable information for management. When reviewing management decisions to date, I found that one of the founder bulls was the more successful in terms of calves sired (10 of 13). Management had, however, selected the other founder bull for removal by sale based on the assumption that he was behaviourally dominant and territorial and therefore likely to have been more successful at breeding. I also found that introduced bulls were breeding successfully before they appeared to have established territories. Thus these findings challenge the assumption that male white rhinoceros reproductive success is related to dominant, territorial behaviour. I conclude that in order to optimally manage small, free-ranging enclosed populations of southern white rhinoceros it is essential to have reliable and accurate pedigree data (this includes a methodology for identifying individual rhino), as well as genetic data for the entire population. I recommend that conservation management programmes for rhinoceros populations incorporate both genetic and demographic data. This will allow for the development of white rhinoceros population management strategies that attempt to optimize genetic diversity and population health, and benefit the establishment of new, robust populations. Translocations of animals are an important aspect of meta-population management of rhinoceros and data which provides accurate insight into the true mating system and reproductive success within a population allows for the correct selection of individuals for this process.

40|$|Selenium (Se 34 _ 79) is a {{trace element}} of {{importance}} to the body. Its importance is related to its anti-oxidative capacity, and its involvement in the synthesis of thyroid hormones and selenoproteins. These selenoproteins and some selenium compounds such as methylselenol are involved in reducing the accumulation of free radicals and {{in the prevention of}} myopathies and some cancers. The presence of selenium in the body ensures correct functioning of the immune system. Studies showed that selenium deficiency reduces phagocytic capacity and cell mobility. The presence of selenium in the body also ensures healthy reproduction, in terms of spermatogenesis or in the prevention of mastitis and metritis in cows. There is, subsequently a reduction of negative economic impact of these anomalies in the farms. The recommended daily intake of selenium in animals varies according to species and the animal type from 100 to 300 µg/kg dry matter (DM). Nutritional selenium requirements in cattle are often not met by locally produced feedstuffs, owing to the very small selenium content. This is mainly due to the types of soils naturally poor in selenium, but also to the low selenium accumulating capacity of forages alone with the pedoclimatic conditions (soil pH and precipitations) which limit the selenium bioavailability in the soil. Consequently, the selenium intake in humans is not met. In Belgium, for example, the average daily intake of selenium is estimated to be between 28 and 60 µg, while the recommended amount by the High Council of Health is 60 µg / day for women and 70 µg / day for men. An additional selenium supplement in feedstuffs for beef and dairy cattle may help to maintain the selenium status, improve cattle health and finally to increase the selenium content in meat and milk. Subsequently, this will help to ensure an adequate selenium supply in humans. The aim of this present research was to assess the effects of a dietary selenium supply in fattening Belgian Blue <b>bulls.</b> The <b>strategy</b> consisted in incorporating in the bulls feed cereals produced with selenium-enriched fertilizers. Instead of the usual addition of sodium selenite and selenized yeasts used as selenium supply, the present enrichment technique follows the soil-plant-animal axis. It aimed primarily to ensure an adequate dietary selenium intake in Belgian Blue bulls, with as effects, a bio fortification of meat in selenium. The first part of the present work is a review paper entitled “Selenium in the Environment, Metabolism and Involvement in Body Functions”. It reports key findings on selenium, its physicochemical properties, its production and presence in the environment, its implication into the organism and effects of its deficiencies in humans and animals. This first study is followed by a second review paper entitled “Selenium in cattle”. It focuses on the effects of selenium deficiency and supplementation in the bovine species (bull, cow and calf). It is thus a synthesis of current understanding about on selenium in cattle. The aim was to review the effects of selenium deficiency and selenium supplementation on growth, on reproduction and on the beef products mainly meat and milk. The experimental part of this work began with an epidemiological study on selenium status in cattle herds in Wallonia. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide an overview on/of the blood selenium content in/of cattle in Wallonia. The selenium content was evaluated through the measurement of glutathione peroxidase activity in red blood cells. Data were available on 114 heifers and 184 cows (82 dairy cows and 102 beef cows) distributed over 66 farms in Wallonia. Four agricultural regions were involved in this study namely, the Limoneuse region, the Condroz, the Ardennes and the Famenne region. It appeared from the study that 87 % of cattle herds in Wallonia presented a marginal or severe deficiency in selenium (81 µg/L). The lowest selenium status was recorded in the Ardennes region. The average selenium contents recorded in the Ardennes were 34 µg / L in heifers, 44 µg / L in dairy cows and 32 µg /L in beef cows. Compared to other agricultural regions, the highest contents of selenium in dairy cows (64 µg /L) and a beef cow (55 µg/L) were recorded respectively in the Limoneuse Region and in Famenne. The selenium content in beef herds was lower compared to dairy herds (35 vs 56 µg / L, p < 0. 01). The selenium deficiency could be a determining factor in increasing of frequency of mastitis, metritis and myopathies. Selenium deficiency can be prevented either by selenium dietary supplementation and selenium injections in deficient animals. The use of selenized fertilizers and selenium-enriched ingredients or feedstuffs with high selenium content has been shown to help correct deficiencies observed in cattle. Similar effects can be expected all over Belgium and in countries in which selenium deficiencies have been reported. “Meat composition and quality of young growing Belgian Blue bulls offered a fattening diet with selenium enriched cereals” was the second research of the experimental part of the present work. It consisted to feed growing fattening bulls diet in which spelt and barley were enriched in selenium. The selenium enrichment of the two cereals was obtained by a particular culture technique. The cereals were grown with fertilizers containing sodium selenate. An amount of 4 g of selenate was applied per hectare. These cereals were introduced in the experimental feedstuffs used in the feeding of the fattening Belgian Blue bulls. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effects of the use of these selenium fortified cereals on growth performance, quality and chemical composition of meat. A total of 23 young bulls were used. Twelve bulls received a control diet containing selenium at a rate of 58 µg/kg DM and the 11 others received a diet with selenium at 173 µg/kg DM. The results of this experiment indicated that the selenium enrichment of diet had no significant effect on growth performance. The final live weight gain, average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio were similar in both groups. Slaughter data were not influenced either by the addition of selenium. Since the carcass weight, yield, shrinkage and the percentage of muscles were similar in both groups. The meat quality measured by the pH drop, by color, by oxidative rancidity and by water loss was not affected by the addition of selenium. Similarly, in terms of chemical composition of meat, dry matter and protein content were not significantly affected. However, significant effects were recorded on the ether extract content (2. 1 vs 1. 7 % DM, p < 0. 05) of meat. The selenium content increased significantly in the plasma (31 vs. 66 ng/ml, p < 0. 001) and in the Longissimus thoracis muscle (177 vs. 477 ng/g DM, p< 0. 001). A high increase of selenium was also recorded in the organs: liver (474 vs. 1126 ng/g DM), kidneys (4956 vs. 5655 ng/g DM) and testes (2070 vs. 2309 ng/g DM). The use of selenium-enriched cereals appeared to be a good method of supplementing selenium in fattening bulls. Such a method of supplementation did not alter the physical and chemical qualities of the meat and induced a decrease in the fat content of meat. Furthermore, there were increased contents of selenium in the blood and organs of the bulls. The consumption of meat produced under such conditions would help to provide between 30 and 57 % of daily selenium requirements. In our knowledge, this method of supplementing selenium in cattle, in particular in Belgian Blue bulls, and selenium bio-fortification of meat, is original. The application of the technique used in the present work seems to be useful in helping to reduce selenium deficiency in regions and countries in which they are observed. A similar trial with different levels of selenium in the diet should be designed in order to test a "dose" effect on the same parameters as studied in this work. It would also be interesting in future to conduct a comparative study between the type of supplementation developed in this work and an addition of mineral and/or organic selenium in order to evaluate the "type and source of selenium" effects on the studied parameters. Finally, a technical and economical study should be undertaken to assess the cost of these selenium supplementation types...|$|R
