25|$|When {{the engine}} {{operator}} applies the brake by operating the locomotive <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> the train line vents to atmosphere at a controlled rate, reducing the train line pressure {{and in turn}} triggering the triple valve on each car to feed air into its brake cylinder. When the engine operator releases the brake, the locomotive <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> portal to atmosphere is closed, allowing the train line to be recharged by the compressor of the locomotive. The subsequent increase of train line pressure causes the triple valves on each car to discharge {{the contents of the}} brake cylinder to the atmosphere, releasing the brakes and recharging the reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|The power cars {{received}} new bogie {{frames and}} a new power supply for the air conditioning. The power cars of trainsets 01 to 20 were refitted with GTO power converters. Smaller measures included diagnosis and subsequent repair of the driver's <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> the installation of new relays into some safety circuits and some software changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully.
