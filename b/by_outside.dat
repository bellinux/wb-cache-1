However, the proposal demanded that many decision-making rights remain within the Bangladesh government, and the offer was ignored <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> airlines. A similar initiative in 1998 cost Biman $1.6million in consultancy fees with no positive results.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in their history, not clearly documented, horses bred in the western regions {{crossbred}} with horses that originated south of the Gulf of Finland. This made the western Finnish horse type larger and better suited to farming and forestry work. The characteristics of the original western Finnish type prevailed, however, even though influenced <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> blood and traces of outside influence could be detected for a long time. Later, this mixed type was further crossbred with larger horses from Central Europe during the Middle Ages. Foreign horses were also brought to Finland during military campaigns, and additional animals were imported to manor houses for driving. The crossbreed offspring of Central European and Finnish horses were larger than their Finnish parents, and even more suited for agricultural work.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy is a media {{franchise}} {{created by}} Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games, motion pictures, and other merchandise. There {{have been a}} number of compilation albums of Final Fantasy music produced by Square Enix, as well as several albums produced <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> groups, both officially and unofficially licensed. These albums include music directly from the games, as well as arrangements covering a variety of styles, such as orchestral, piano, vocal, and techno.|$|E
5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap {{and they tend to}} be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and nipping with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E
5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with {{an appearance of}} control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie compared to a 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E

5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design were replaced <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> steam pipes {{emerging from the}} smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} with the French military expedition to Egypt in 1798, which {{brought with it}} a corps of scholars to examine the surviving ancient monuments. The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe. In the early nineteenth century, growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt, both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities. Many temple artifacts, from small objects to enormous obelisks, were removed <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> governments and private collectors. This wave of Egyptomania resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel, but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness. The discoveries of the period made possible the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the beginnings of Egyptology as a scholarly discipline.|$|E
5|$|After 18 to 24 {{months of}} development, Maniac Mansion debuted at the 1987 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago. The game was {{released}} for the Commodore 64 and Apple II in October 1987. While previous Lucasfilm Games products {{had been published}} <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> companies, Maniac Mansion was self-published. This became a trend at Lucasfilm. The company hired Ken Macklin, an acquaintance of Winnick's, to design the game's packaging artwork. Gilbert and Winnick collaborated with the marketing department to design the back cover. The two also created an insert that includes hints, a backstory, and jokes. An MS-DOS port was released in early 1988, developed in part by Lucasfilm employees Aric Wilmunder and Brad Taylor. Ports for the Amiga, Atari ST and Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) followed, with the Amiga and Atari ST ports in 1989 and the NES port in 1990. The 16-bit versions of Maniac Mansion featured a copy protection system requiring the user to enter graphical symbols out of a code book include with the game. This was not present in the Commodore 64 and Apple versions {{due to lack of}} disk space, so those instead used an on-disk copy protection.|$|E

5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean for miles around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
5|$|Kurt Busch {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> polesitter Jeff Gordon. On the following lap, Smith began to assist Busch by drafting. On lap 3, NASCAR held {{a moment of silence}} to honor Dale Earnhardt, who was killed ten years earlier in the 2001 race. On lap4, A. J. Allmendinger and Mark Martin moved to the first and second positions. A lap later, the first caution was flown when Kyle Busch got turned sideways. Under caution, he made a pit stop to have his car's toe plate checked and to have the front end aligned. When the race restarted on lap8, Kevin Harvick led but after one lap, Martin and Allmendinger passed him. Three laps later, the second caution came out when J. J. Yeley had an engine failure. Most of the drivers made pit stops under the caution, except for Brad Keselowski. At the restart, he would lead and Bobby Labonte passed him for the lead on the next lap.|$|E

5|$|The Athenian {{politician}} Philocrates {{had suggested}} offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. However, the Athenian assembly had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, {{and by the}} time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands. Meanwhile, it was becoming clear that the Sacred War could only be ended <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> intervention. The Phocians had occupied several Boeotian cities, but were running out of treasure to pay their mercenaries; conversely, the Thebans were unable to act effectively against the Phocians. The Phocian general Phalaikos was removed from his command in 347 BC, and three new generals appointed, who successfully attacked Boeotia again. The Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. Philip sent force enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the war—he desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.|$|E
5|$|The British public {{first saw}} the Spitfire at the RAF Hendon air-display on Saturday 27 June 1936. Although {{full-scale}} production was supposed to begin immediately, there were numerous problems {{that could not be}} overcome for some time, and the first production Spitfire, K9787, did not roll off the Woolston, Southampton assembly line until mid-1938. The first and most immediate problem was that the main Supermarine factory at Woolston was already working at full capacity fulfilling orders for Walrus and Stranraer flying boats. Although outside contractors were supposed to be involved in manufacturing many important Spitfire components, especially the wings, Vickers-Armstrong (the parent company) was reluctant to see the Spitfire being manufactured <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> concerns, and was slow to release the necessary blueprints and subcomponents. As a result of the delays in getting the Spitfire into full production, the Air Ministry put forward a plan that production of the Spitfire be stopped after the initial order for 310, after which Supermarine would build Bristol Beaufighters. The managements of Supermarine and Vickers were able to convince the Air Ministry that the problems could be overcome, and further orders were placed for 200 Spitfires on 24 March 1938. The two orders covered the K, L and N prefix serial numbers.|$|E
5|$|When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised {{questions}} about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately 75 AU) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna's eccentric distant orbit. It is {{too far from the}} planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected <b>by</b> <b>outside</b> forces such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around 80 AU).|$|E
