5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little attention should <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} testing a specific integrin, alpha-six-beta-one, and the role it plays in the RMS. The study researched the principle that chemoattractive molecules may {{play an important role}} in neuroblast migration in the RMS. The study of this one particular integrin was conducted in mice. By using antibodies to bind to α6β1 integrin subunits, found on the neuroblasts, the researchers observed that the migration was disrupted. Furthermore, they investigated the mechanism through which α6β1 integrin functions and determined it was via the chemoattractant laminin. This was completed by injecting laminin perpendicular to the RMS and observing that doing so drew “neuroblasts away from their normal course of migration”. The researchers concluded with the idea that this research could prove useful for therapeutics purposes in that neuroblasts could potentially <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> locations of injury or disease.|$|E
5|$|Such large {{temperature}} variations have {{a destructive}} {{effect on the}} exposed rocky surfaces. The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter. Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night. Successive strata are exposed to further weathering. The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter. Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes. This {{is believed to be}} caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface. Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought. The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist. Ground water may <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation. Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means.|$|E

5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete again. If he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

The final would have been replayed if even after extra time. In the event, no replays or drawing of lots was necessary.|$|E

The example in Figure 4 demonstrates the effects of increasing {{the strength of the}} acid. In this case, the extent of protonation is the α-value in the Brønsted catalysis equation. The fact that the α-value remains unchanged explains the linearity of Brønsted plots for such a reaction.|$|E
25|$|Instead, it {{recommends}} {{building on}} the existing clusters of restaurants and home-furnishings stores.

Restaurants in particular could see more ethnic diversity, widening the existing focus on Latin fare. The plan also recommends both improving cultural offerings downtown, and promoting more residential and office use to increase foot traffic around the clock.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish {{government}} issued mobilization {{orders for}} Swedish Pomerania on 8 April 1711. 3,800 men aged between twenty and forty years were to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> serve a five years term.

25|$|Somatic {{cells are}} an {{additional}} resource {{which can be}} retrieved for gene banking, particularly {{in the cases of}} emergency wherein gametes cannot be collected or stored.

25|$|The {{existence}} of multiple distinct cultures in Spain allows an analogy to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the United Kingdom. Using the term Spanish for someone of Spanish descent {{would then be}} expected to be equivalent to using Briton to describe someone descending from some part of the United Kingdom. Cultures within the United Kingdom, such as English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh, would then correspond in this analogy to cultures within Spain such as Castilian, Catalan, Galician and Basque among others. In contrast with Spain, because of centuries of gradual and mutual consolidation across the Iberian Peninsula, such distinctions tend to be blurred. It is a subtle, yet important, distinction.|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{reported}} in the build-up to the final draw that seedings would be used, as had been the case at the previous two World Cup Finals, the FIFA Organising Committee ultimately announced {{that there would be no}} seeding of teams. Instead the sixteen teams were divided into four 'geographical groupings', which also took into account the teams' strengths and even political considerations; the system ensured that Israel and Morocco would not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> face each other after Morocco had earlier threatened to withdraw from the tournament, as they had done from the Olympic football tournament two years earlier, if that were the case.|$|E

25|$|The law of {{treasure}} trove in the United States varies {{from state to}} state, but certain general conclusions may <b>be</b> <b>drawn.</b> <b>To</b> be {{treasure trove}}, an object must be of gold or silver. Paper money is also deemed to be treasure trove since it previously represented gold or silver. On the same reasoning, it might be imagined that coins and tokens in metals other than gold or silver are also included, but this {{has yet to be}} clearly established. The object must be concealed for long enough so {{it is unlikely that the}} true owner will reappear to claim it. The consensus appears to be that the object must be at least a few decades old.|$|E
