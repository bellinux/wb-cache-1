First, they tortured the elderly, because they said the latter were guerrillas; then they threw two grenades and fired weapons… After executing the women, {{the men and the}} elderly, they took the children one by one, smashed them against the ground, and threw them into the flames. No one could escape because the Army had surrounded the entrance and exit of Plan de Sánchez, as well as the adjacent roads… [...] he <b>braced</b> <b>himself</b> to leave the place where he was hiding to go and examine the havoc that had been wrought. Together with his brothers, Juan, Buenaventura and Esteban, and with Eulalio Grave Ramírez, he put out the fire that was still consuming the corpses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{continued}} his work and training at Guy's, Keats devoted {{more and more time}} to the study of literature, experimenting with verse forms, particularly the sonnet. In May 1816, Leigh Hunt agreed to publish the sonnet [...] "O Solitude" [...] in his magazine, The Examiner, a leading liberal magazine of the day. It was the first appearance in print of Keats's poetry, and Charles Cowden Clarke described it as his friend's red letter day, the first proof that Keats's ambitions were valid. Among his poems of 1816 was To My Brothers. In the summer of that year, Keats went with Clarke to the seaside town of Margate to write. There he began [...] "Calidore" [...] and initiated the era of his great letter writing. On his return to London, he took lodgings at 8 Dean Street, Southwark, and <b>braced</b> <b>himself</b> for further study in order to {{become a member of the}} Royal College of Surgeons.|$|E
2500|$|A little-known {{example of}} Jones' heroic {{instincts}} in action {{is described by}} his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book, Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones' train approached Michigan City, Mississippi. He had left the cab in charge of fellow Engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the steam chest {{and then to the}} pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some [...] ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear {{at the sight of the}} oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and <b>braced</b> <b>himself</b> on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in The Brave Engineer, in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.|$|E

60|$|So {{passed the}} {{preceding}} week, {{and with it}} his twenty-first birthday, spent very differently from {{the way in which}} it would ordinarily be passed by a youth in his position.

60|$|For {{a little}} while Crispin sat quite still, {{stripped}} of his last rag of hope. Then suddenly <b>bracing</b> <b>himself,</b> he sprang up, despite his weakness.|$|R
