This is an {{experimental}} study aiming at: 1) investigating {{whether there is}} any significant difference in students’ sepak takraw <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> techniques between students who are taught by the partpractice method {{and those who are}} taught by whole practice method, 2) finding out whether there is any significant difference in sepak takraw <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> techniques between high motor educability learners and low motor educability learners, 3) investigating whether there is any interaction between the implementation of teaching methodsand students’ level of motor educability on students’ <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> techniques of sepak takraw. To achieve these objectives, factorial 2 x 2 designwas implemented in this study. 196 semester III male students of Physical Education, Health and Recreation, Sport Faculty and Health, Ganesha University of Education, Singaraja became the population of this study. By implementing proportional random samplingtechnique, 40 male students then was selected as the sample of the study. Three variables existedin this study, they wereindependent variable, attribute variable, and dependent variable. Teaching methods were treated as independent variable, students’ level of motor educability was treated as attributive variable and students’ <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> techniques of sepak takraw were treated as dependent variable. Two kinds of instruments were used in this study, namely test of students’ level motor educability called IOWA Brace Testand test of <b>basic</b> <b>skill</b> techniques of sepak takraw.
