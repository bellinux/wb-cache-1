FreeType is an open-source software development library, used to render text on to <b>bitmaps</b> and provides support for other font-related operations. The KernelEx project is an Windows-API extension and compatibility layer project, which provides open-source implementations of some Windows-APIs. Other contributing projects are MinGW, SYSLINUX, adns, ICU, GraphApp, Ext2, GNU FreeFont, DejaVu fonts, and Liberation fonts.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Molyneux {{decided to}} focus on the project full-time. According to Carter, the creatures were made from <b>bitmaps,</b> and there was around 90 {{megabytes}} of graphics data on screen as of April 1996. In July 1996, Alex Peters joined the project and ported the game to Windows 95. Dungeon Keeper was shown at the European Computer Trade Show in September 1996, and was scheduled for release in December. It became evident that the deadline would be missed, and release was pushed back to March 1997. The final testing began in April 1997, and Dungeon Keeper was signed off in June. Dungeon Keeper was released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for Windows 95 and MS-DOS. Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions were in development and due for release in 1997, but cancelled. An internet version was in development, and would have supported up to 250 players.|$|E

Typically, this display is a large LED sign. In a digital theater, open caption display capability {{is built into the}} digital projector. Closed caption capability is also available, with the ability for 3rd-party closed caption devices to plug into the digital cinema server.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bitmap</b> may be {{represented}} as 8 bytes of binary data, or as 16 hexadecimal characters 0-9, A-F in the ASCII or EBCDIC character sets.A message will contain {{at least one}} <b>bitmap,</b> called the Primary <b>Bitmap,</b> which indicates which of Data Elements 1 to 64 are present. The presence of an optional secondary <b>bitmap</b> is also indicated by bit 1 of of the Primary <b>Bitmap.</b> If present, the secondary <b>bitmap</b> indicates whether data elements 65 to 128 are present. Similarly, a tertiary <b>bitmap</b> {{can be used to}} indicate the presence of fields 129 to 192, although these data elements are rarely used.|$|R
50|$|Because {{of their}} fixed resolution, {{printing}} <b>bitmap</b> images can easily produce grainy, jaggy, or blurry results if the resolution is not {{ideally suited to}} the printer resolution. In addition, <b>bitmap</b> images become grainy when they are scaled larger than their intended resolution. A few <b>bitmap</b> file formats (such as Apple's PICT format) support alpha channels, which allow <b>bitmap</b> images to have transparent backgrounds or an image selection which uses antialiasing. Most common web-based file formats such as GIF, JPEG, and PNG are <b>bitmap</b> file formats. The GIF file format {{is one of the}} simplest, low-resolution <b>bitmap</b> file formats, only supporting 256 colors per image. As a result, however, GIF files can be extremely small in file size. Other common <b>bitmap</b> file formats are BMP (Windows <b>bitmap),</b> TGA, and TIFF. Most clip art is provided in a low resolution, <b>bitmap</b> file format which is unsuitable for scaling, transparent backgrounds, or good-quality printed materials. However, <b>bitmap</b> file formats are ideal for photos, especially when combined with lossy data compression algorithms such as those available for JPEG files.|$|R
50|$|The BMP file format, {{also known}} as <b>bitmap</b> image file or device {{independent}} <b>bitmap</b> (DIB) file format or simply a <b>bitmap,</b> is a raster graphics image file format used to store <b>bitmap</b> digital images, independently of the display device (such as a graphics adapter), especially on Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems.|$|R
25|$|Other file systems, e.g., HPFS or exFAT, use {{free space}} <b>bitmaps</b> that {{indicate}} used and available clusters, which {{could then be}} quickly looked up {{in order to find}} free contiguous areas. Another solution is the linkage of all free clusters into one or more lists (as is done in Unix file systems). Instead, the FAT has to be scanned as an array to find free clusters, which can lead to performance penalties with large disks.|$|E
25|$|Adobe's Fireworks saves larger PNG files {{than many}} {{programs}} by default. This {{stems from the}} mechanics of its Save format: the images produced by Fireworks' save function include large, private chunks, containing complete layer and vector information. This allows further lossless editing. When saved with the Export option, Fireworks' PNGs are competitive with those produced by other image editors, but are no longer editable as anything but flattened <b>bitmaps.</b> Fireworks is unable to save size-optimized vector-editable PNGs.|$|E
25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel {{can mean the difference}} between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable <b>bitmaps</b> at small sizes.|$|E
40|$|In {{this chapter}} we discuss various <b>bitmap</b> index {{technologies}} for efficient query processing in data warehousing applications. We review {{the existing literature}} and organize the technology into three categories, namely <b>bitmap</b> encoding, compression and binning. We introduce an efficient <b>bitmap</b> compression algorithm and examine the space and time complexity of the compressed <b>bitmap</b> index on large data sets from real applications. According to the conventional wisdom, <b>bitmap</b> indices are only efficient for low-cardinality attributes. However, we show that the compressed <b>bitmap</b> indices are also efficient for high-cardinality attributes. Timing results demonstrate that the <b>bitmap</b> indices significantly outperform the projection index, which is often {{considered to be the}} most efficient access method for multi-dimensional queries. Finally, we review the <b>bitmap</b> index technology currently supported by commonly used commercial database systems and discuss open issues for future research and development...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bitmap</b> {{indexing}} {{has been}} {{touted as a}} promising approach for processing complex adhoc queries in read-mostly environments, like those of decision support systems. Nevertheless, only few possible <b>bitmap</b> schemes have been proposed {{in the past and}} very {{little is known about the}} space-time tradeoff that they offer. In this paper, we present a general framework to study the design space of <b>bitmap</b> indexes for selection queries and examine the disk-space and time characteristics that the various alternative index choices offer. In particular, we draw a parallel between <b>bitmap</b> indexing and number representation in different number systems, and define a space of two orthogonal dimensions that captures a wide array of <b>bitmap</b> indexes, both old and new. Within that space, we identify (analytically or experimentally) the following interesting points: (1) the time-optimal <b>bitmap</b> index; (2) the space-optimal <b>bitmap</b> index; (3) the <b>bitmap</b> index with the optimal space-time tradeoff (knee); and (4) the ti [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Originally, sprites were {{a method}} of {{integrating}} unrelated <b>bitmaps</b> so that {{they appeared to be}} part of the normal bitmap on a screen, such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the data defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic circuitry or software. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a hardware construct that employs custom DMA channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.|$|E
500|$|At first, {{the journal}} {{articles}} available via ADS were scanned <b>bitmaps</b> created {{from the paper}} journals, but from 1995 onwards, the Astrophysical Journal began to publish an on-line edition, soon followed by the other main journals such as Astronomy and Astrophysics and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

[...] The service is distributed worldwide, with twelve mirror sites in twelve countries on five continents, with the database synchronized by means of weekly updates using rsync, a mirroring utility which allows updates to only the portions of the database which have changed.

2500|$|Since 2008, {{there has}} been {{discussion}} among professional users of SVG that either gradient meshes or preferably diffusion curves could usefully {{be added to the}} SVG specification.

[...] The current draft of SVG 2 includes gradient meshes.|$|E
2500|$|Files in most file systems {{used with}} DOS, Windows, Unix, or other {{operating}} systems {{have only one}} [...] "fork". By contrast, MFS and HFS give files two different [...] "forks". The data fork contains {{the same sort of}} information as a file in other file systems, such as the text of a document or the <b>bitmaps</b> of an image file. The resource fork contains other structured data such as menu definitions, graphics, sounds, or code segments that would be incorporated into a program's file format on other systems. An executable file might consist only of resources (including code segments) with an empty data fork, while a data file might have only a data fork with no resource fork. A word processor file could contain its text in the data fork and styling information in the resource fork, so that an application which doesn’t recognize the styling information can still read the raw text.|$|E
