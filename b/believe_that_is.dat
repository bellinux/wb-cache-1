5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to study the effects of the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{every one}} must buy this {{book for the}} {{following}} aesthetic reasons: First, because I know where there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street, and, also, if enough people buy it {{where there is a}} platinum ring with a complete circlet, and, also, if loads of people buy it my husband needs a new winter overcoat, although the one he has done well enough for the last three years... It seems to me that on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine which mysteriously disappeared shortly after my marriage, and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.|$|E
25|$|Most Shia {{scholars}} {{believe that}} 17 Rabi' al-awwal is {{the birthday of}} the Muhammad, while most Sunni scholars <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> 12 Rabi' al-awwal. This issue led to assigning these days (12–17 Rabi' al-awwal) as Unity Week by Islamic Republic of Iran to respect both viewpoints. So scholars and followers of these two sects emphasize on common ground against the common enemies, and an International Islamic Unity Conference is hosted each year.|$|E
5000|$|Mele formulates {{an example}} of the [...] "static" [...] paradox as the following:If ever a person A deceives a person B into <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> something, p, <b>is</b> true, A knows or truly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false while causing B to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. So when A deceives A (i.e., himself) into <b>believing</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true, he knows or truly <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false while causing himself to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. Thus, A must {{simultaneously}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> false and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> p <b>is</b> true. But how is this possible? ...|$|R

500|$|After {{stopping}} {{the beating of}} Czolgosz, McKinley's next concern was for his wife, urging Cortelyou to take care how she was told of the shooting. [...] The initial crowd reaction had been panic, and an attempt to flee the hall, which was frustrated by others surging inwards {{to see what had}} occurred. [...] As McKinley was carried out on a stretcher to an electric-powered ambulance, there was a moan from the crowd {{at the sight of the}} President's ashen face. [...] Foster rode with him on the way to the fair's hospital. [...] On the way there, McKinley felt in his clothing and came out with a metal object. [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a bullet." [...] McKinley had been shot twice; one bullet had deflected off a button and only grazed him; the other had penetrated his abdomen.|$|E

2500|$|Iran's actions, nuclear program, {{and threats}} {{have been viewed}} by Dr. Gregory Stanton, the founder and {{director}} of Genocide Watch, as having taken 6 out of 8 steps on the [...] "path to genocide." [...] Stanton urged the international community to take action against Iran and to isolate it, in order to [...] "curb its genocidal intent." [...] He said that [...] "one of the best predictors of genocide is incitement to genocide ... and I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> exactly what Iran is doing today." [...] Incitement to genocide is a crime under international law. He stressed that {{it is important not to}} dismiss [...] "the early signs" [...] as [...] "diabolical rhetoric or as a tactic meant to advance a different goal," [...] and doing so would [...] "enable the perpetrators." [...] Stanton also said that Iran has classified and symbolized Israel via hate speech and an ideology of exclusion, and has dehumanized Israel by portraying potential victim as [...] "cancer" [...] that should be wiped out. In addition, Stanton said that Iran has organized [...] "fanatical militas," [...] such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, while stifling dissent in Iranian society. [...] He added that by denying a previous genocide, the Holocaust, by working on weapons of mass destruction, and through global terrorism, Iran has prepared for genocide.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur C. Parker, Secretary of the Society of American Indians from 1911 to 1915, {{regarded}} McKenzie as the [...] "father of the movement." [...] McKenzie {{respected the}} Society's mantra of [...] "for Indians and by Indians" [...] and understood Indians' distrust of Whites. McKenzie downplayed {{his role as}} [...] "Local Representative" [...] for the Society and worked behind the scenes. He wrote to Parker, [...] "Whatever I may say is subject to two suspicions: First that my race prevents me understanding the situation. Second, that I may have some ulterior motive." [...] "I am always embarrassed by {{doubt in my mind}} as to whether I shall act and speak, or whether I shall contribute most by silence. Everyone who says anything to me tells me to proceed and that the Indians have confidence in me and I am glad and <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> so, even though doubtful as to what extent that confidence involves action." [...] While Parker was determined that the Society should be run by Indians, it did not diminish his desire for McKenzie's counsel and assistance in managing the organization. In short time, Parker was overwhelmed with the volume of Society work and contemplated resigning. McKenzie exhorted him to stay with the Society, noting [...] "it is not impossible that you are the only man who can save the situation and that you may have to do it by constant correspondence, keeping all in touch one with the other, and keeping all satisfied that equal justice is being arranged for." [...] Parker teamed with McKenzie to manage the Society and navigate politics. Responsibilities included publications, planning conferences, drafting and lobbying legislation and membership services.|$|E
