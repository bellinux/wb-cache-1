5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on a real life incident. Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down the Lemon trees beside his house, arguing that it could be used by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their trees had to be cut down. Riklis watched a news <b>blurb</b> about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} generic move {{structure}} of the <b>blurbs</b> of Electronic Socio-romantic novels published in Pakistan. It explores the move schema, the number of moves and their order in different <b>blurbs.</b> It also observes the most focused and the most neglected move in these <b>blurbs.</b> 20 book <b>blurbs</b> have been collected from online source and the model presented by Valor (2005) has been adapted for their analysis. The results reveal {{that there have been}} total 6 moves and 12 steps in the <b>blurbs</b> of Pakistani socio-romantic novels. Most of the moves have no fix order. The “Description ” move has been followed by all the <b>blurbs</b> where as “publisher’s info ” has been least attended by them. This suggests that this genre does not rely much on Publisher’s name for their promotion; rather the description of the story {{has been used as a}} tool to attract the potential readers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to analyse the nature of <b>blurbs,</b> short texts generally displayed on the back covers of books, which provide information about the book’s content and author, and praise the book by showing excerpts from experts’ favourable reviews, {{in order to promote}} the book and attract potential readers. These texts have existed {{for a long time and}} proliferated with the advent of paperbacks, but have only recently become the subject of critical and academic studies. Furthermore, in the last few decades the new means of communication provided by the World Wide Web has added new possibilities for advertising books, and <b>blurbs</b> have also become digital. This analysis is therefore based both on traditional <b>blurbs</b> and digital <b>blurbs,</b> or e-blurbs. I have gathered a corpus of 70 <b>blurbs</b> from personal books and 70 <b>blurbs</b> from Internet sites, namely Amazon. co. uk (www. amazon. co. uk) and the Penguin Books (www. penguin. co. uk) website. Therefore, my analysis will focus on generic, linguistic and semantic aspects of this particular kind of text. My first concern has been to offer a few definitions of the word “blurb”, taken from traditional and online dictionaries. Secondly, I have provided a brief overview of genre theory, taking into account Swales and Bhatia’s findings in this field, and its application to <b>blurbs</b> as a genre belonging to the colony of promotional genres. Then, I have analysed the rhetorical structure of <b>blurbs,</b> considering the previous suggestions made by Gea Valor, Marčiulionienė and Cacchiani. Moreover, I have investigated the lexico-semantic properties of the language of <b>blurbs</b> and have identified the main semantic fields of <b>blurb’s</b> vocabulary. Finally, I have dealt with linguistic and discourse conventions typical of advertising and journalistic discourse, such as the use of modifiers, elliptical syntactic patterns, and the use of the imperative...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{preliminary}} approach to the study of <b>blurbs,</b> brief texts traditionally displayed on bookcovers, and nowadays also on the Internet, which provide information about a book to potential readers. This study focuses on four of the most widelyknown publishing and bookselling companies in the English-speaking world: Penguin, Ballantine, Routledge, and Barnes & Noble, and analyses more than 60 <b>blurbs</b> displayed on their web sites. The study indicates that <b>blurbs</b> may constitute a genre characterised by a definite communicative purpose and by the use of specific linguistic and discourse conventions. <b>Blurbs</b> perform an informative function based on the description of the contents of a book. But this function is secondary to their persuasive purpose, characteristic of advertising discourse, because <b>blurbs</b> recommend the book by means of review extracts from various sources in an attempt to persuade the prospective reader to buy the "product. " In order to achieve their communicative purpose, <b>blurbs</b> make use of a wide range of linguistic and discourse conventions typical of advertising discourse: complimenting, elliptical syntactic patterns, the imperative, the address form "you," and what I have called "curiosity arousers," usually in the form of rhetorical questions and excerpts from the book...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, {{the year}} the novel Up in the Air was published, Sheldon Turner {{discovered}} the book and wrote a screenplay adaptation, which he sold to DreamWorks in 2003. Jason Reitman later came upon the novel (initially attracted by the Christopher Buckley <b>blurb</b> on the cover) while browsing in the Los Angeles bookstore Book Soup. Reitman persuaded his father Ivan Reitman to purchase the book's film rights, and the elder Reitman commissioned a screenplay from Ted and Nicholas Griffin, who used some elements from Turner's script in their own work. Jason Reitman then developed his own screenplay, incorporating some of the elements from the Griffins' script that had (unbeknownst to Reitman) originated with Turner. Some of Turner's inventions that were utilized in the final film include Ryan's boilerplate termination speech ("Anyone who ever built an empire or changed the world sat where you're sitting right now..."), a key plot point involving a suicide, and the character of Ryan's partner (written by Turner as male).|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{investigate}} evaluation in book <b>blurbs.</b> 2 Backcover <b>blurbs</b> of bestsellers by well-known writers and fictional debuts are mainly evaluative-persuasive texts. They summarize the main features of the book and provide a mostly subjective evaluation of the book using a restricted set of lexical, pragmatic and textual devices. As such they serve both an informative and a promotional function or, in terms of Kotler and Armstrong’s (1993) model of marketing strategies, they position and market the book. Description and evaluation are found to be used in various combinations in promotional genres like book <b>blurbs</b> (Bhatia, 2004 : 60), and are shown to be a feature of academic <b>blurbs</b> (Gesuato, 2004). However, this doesn’t seem to be true of book <b>blurbs</b> taken from lazy reads, in which positioning the product and informing customers about its quality is almost exclusively done by means of optional narratives and obligatory evaluations, most often in the form of quotations from book reviews, and subjective descriptions (if present at all) are functional to evaluate the book and promote it...|$|R

500|$|Mirroring the {{deliberately}} vague detail {{within the}} novel, the <b>blurb</b> {{on the book}} is unusually written, in {{that it does not}} name the characters or reveal the plot. It was written by a team at Sceptre led by marketing consultant Damian Horner, and has the approval of Cleave, who described it as [...] "genius". Cleave explained: [...] "I think readers are quite smart and don't really need the whole thing spelt out for them in a plot summary. It's nice to let them discover the book at their own speed. And the technique of the book is to release these dirty secrets gradually." [...] The content of the <b>blurb</b> varies between UK and American editions of the novel, but both begin: [...] "We don't want to tell you too much about this book. It is a truly special story and we don't want to spoil it." [...] and end: [...] "Once you have read it, you'll want to tell everyone about it. When you do, please don't tell them what happens either. The magic is in how it unfolds." [...] James Spackman, Sales and Marketing Director for Sceptre, was initially sceptical of the <b>blurb,</b> particularly disliking the use of [...] "we" [...] for the publisher to address the reader directly. Once the book became a best-seller, however, he revised his stance, and now believes that the reason the <b>blurb</b> works is because it makes a virtue of denying the reader information, with an unusual format and [...] "arrestingly direct" [...] tone. The <b>blurb</b> won Sceptre the [...] "Best Blurb" [...] award at the 2010 Book Marketing Society Awards.|$|E

Additionally, some <b>blurbs</b> were written by doctors, who would recommend the books on the basis of their value as case studies, suggesting that people would read the novels for their educational value and demonstrating the way in which lesbianism was pathologized at the time.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} generic {{structure}} and promotional {{elements of the}} online fiction <b>blurbs</b> accompanying the 95 best-selling books from Amazon United Kingdom and Okuoku Turkey (1999 - 2011), a company that sells books online that are written in Turkish or translated into Turkish, and adds to {{the growing number of}} investigations into this genre (Kathpalia, 1997; Bhatia, 2004; Cacchiani, 2007; Gea-Valor, 2007; Gesuato, 2007; Basturkmen, 2009). Based on the findings, a two-level schematic structure (moves and steps) is proposed for the <b>blurbs</b> following Swales (1990). The findings suggest that Amazon UK book <b>blurbs</b> have a six-move schematic structure: complimenting the author, book description, justifying the book by establishing a niche, book promotion, author’s background and author’s website/blog being the second, fourth and fifth obligatory moves. However, Okuoku book <b>blurbs</b> feature a five-move schematic structure with complimenting the author, book description, involving the reader in the text, book promotion and author’s background, the second and fourth being obligatory. Analysis of promotional elements in the corpora reveals that online fiction book <b>blurbs</b> employ the art of advertising through the use of favorable expressions (Bhatia, 2005) and innovative uses of rhetorical strategies to persuade the reader to read the book...|$|R

This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form {{may be the most}} overrated, under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time." [...] A critic from The Christian Science Monitor said, [...] "The concept is clever, suggesting a new way to build horror-movie suspense without much on-camera gore. The film would be better as a 30-minute short, though, since its shaky camera work and fuzzy images get monotonous after a while, and there's not much room for character development within the very limited plot."

[...] Newspapers outside Scotland started to notice the book, with glowing reviews in The Guardian, The Sunday Times and The Mail on Sunday, and in September 1997 Books for Keeps, a magazine that specialised in children's books, gave the novel four stars out of five. The Mail on Sunday rated it as [...] "the most imaginative debut since Roald Dahl"; a view echoed by the Sunday Times ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"), while The Guardian called it [...] "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit" [...] and The Scotsman said it had [...] "all the makings of a classic".|$|E
