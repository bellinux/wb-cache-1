40|$|Three-dimensional {{numerical}} investigations on {{the start-up}} side load physics for a regeneratively cooled, high-aspect-ratio nozzle were performed. The objectives {{of this study}} are to identify the three-dimensional side load physics and to compute the associated aerodynamic side load using an anchored computational methodology. The computational methodology is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, and a transient inlet condition based on an engine system simulation. Computations were performed for both the adiabatic and cooled walls {{in order to understand the}} effect of boundary conditions. Finite-rate chemistry was used throughout the study so that combustion effect is always included. The results show that three types of shock evolution are responsible for side loads: generation of combustion wave; transitions among free-shock separation, restricted-shock separation, and simultaneous free-shock and restricted shock separations; along with oscillation of shocks across the <b>lip.</b> <b>Wall</b> boundary conditions drastically affect the computed side load physics: the adiabatic nozzle prefers free-shock separation while the cooled nozzle favors restricted-shock separation, resulting in higher peak side load for the cooled nozzle than that of the adiabatic nozzle. By comparing the computed physics with those of test observations, it is concluded that cooled wall is a more realistic boundary condition, and the oscillation of the restricted-shock separation flow pattern across the lip along with its associated tangential shock motion are the dominant side load physics for a regeneratively cooled, high aspect-ratio rocket engine...|$|R

40|$|The {{estimation}} of scour downstream of a ski-jump bucket has remained inconclusive, despite analysis of numerous prototypes {{as well as}} hydraulic model studies in the past. It {{is partly due to}} the complexity of the phenomenon involved and partly because of limitations of the traditional analytical tool of statistical regression. This paper addresses the latter part and presents an alternative to the regression in the form of neural networks. The depth of the scour hole developed along with its width and length is predicted using neural network models. A network architecture complete with trained values of connection weight and bias and requiring input of grouped parameters pertaining to discharge head, tail water channel depth, <b>bucket</b> radius, <b>lip</b> angle, and median sediment size is recommended in order to predict the depth, the location of maximum scour, as well as the width of scour hole. The neural network predictions have been compared with traditional statistical schemes. Although the common and simple feed forward back propagation network took a very long time to train as compared to some advanced schemes, it was found to impart equally reliable training as the latter. Use of causative variables in grouped forms was found to be more rewarding than that of their raw forms probably due to lesser scaling effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Oscillating Water Column (OWC) {{is one of}} {{the wave}} energy device working on the {{principle}} of rise and fall of free surface water oscillation due to continuous impingement of waves that penetrates into a semi submerged chamber. It {{is one of the}} successful device that has been proved up to pilot stage in the field. There have been many studies on optimizing various parameters of the OWC device through laboratory modeling. In order to quantify the horizontal and vertical wave forces on a 1 : 12 OWC model, a series of experiments has been conducted in a wave flume, 72. 5 m long, 2 m wide and 2. 5 m deep. The chamber with dimensions of 1910 mm wide(w) (parallel to the wave crest) and 300 mm length (b) (along the wave direction) was made of 20 mm thick acrylic sheet. The total height of the chamber is 900 mm and the water depth (d) in front of the chamber is 500 mm. The bottom opening (o) in the front <b>lip</b> <b>wall</b> is 300 mm. An air vent of 0. 68 % of the plan area of the device was maintained. Custom made strain gauge based force transducer has been mounted to measure two force components namely vertical and horizontal. The test set-up was located at a distance of 45 m from the wave maker. The strain gauges in the load cell were placed in such a manner to nullify the effect due to moment in the measurement. The experiments were conducted for regular waves with the wave characteristics defined by Froude model scale law. The wave frequencies range between 0. 42 Hz and 1. 25 Hz with the wave steepness, H/L in the range of 0. 0107 to 0. 0524 and relative water depth, d/L in the range of 0. 09 to 0. 30 have been considered in the present study. It is observed that at natural frequency of system, the force on the structure is less dueto high-energy absorption by the OWC...|$|R

40|$|The Pelton turbine {{has been}} subject to a varying degree of {{research}} interest since the debut of the technology over a century ago. Despite its age there are gaps in the knowledge concerning the flow mechanisms effecting the flow through the turbine. A Pelton turbine has been designed at the Waterpower Laboratory at NTNU. This {{has been done in}} connection to a Ph. D. project focusing on the flow in Pelton turbine buckets. The design of the turbine has been conducted using in-house knowledge in addition to some comments from a turbine producer. To describe the geometry multiple Bezier curves were used and the design strategy aimed to give a smooth and continuous gradient along the main flow directions in the bucket. The turbine has been designed for the operational conditions of the Pelton test rig installed at the Waterpower Laboratory which is a horizontal single jet test rig with a jet diameter(ds) of 35 mm. The diameter(D) of the runner was set to 513 mm and the width(W) of a bucket 114 mm, leading to a D/W ratio of 4. 5. Manufacturing of the turbine has been carried out in aluminium and the turbine has undergone efficiency testing and visual inspection during operation at a head of 70 m. The turbine did not performed as expected and the maximum efficiency was found to be 77. 75 %. The low efficiency is mainly caused by a large amount of water leaving the <b>bucket</b> through the <b>lip</b> and hence transferring close to zero of its energy to the shaft. The reason for the large lip loss is discussed and two possible causes are found; the jet is located too close to the lip, and the inner surface of the bucket does not lead the water away from the lip.
