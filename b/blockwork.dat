5|$|The {{influence}} of more radical Expressionism and Modernism {{can be seen}} in buildings such as Basil Spence's Mortonhall Crematorium, Edinburgh (1964–67), with a series of irregular chapels, with smooth-faced <b>blockwork</b> and Wheeler & Sproson's Boghall Church, Bathgate (1965), influenced by Beaux-Arts architecture. The pioneering contribution from the Church of Scotland was St. Columbia's, Glenrothes (1960), which had seating for the congregation on three sides of a central platform, with the choir and elders on the fourth side behind the pulpit.|$|E
25|$|Random rubble {{stonework}} {{is largely}} exposed {{on the interior}} of the church, as are the <b>blockwork</b> quoins. The porch, nave and apse have unpainted timber ceilings. There are panels of painted timber under the window sills in the apse.|$|E
25|$|As loose-fill insulation: Exfoliated {{vermiculite}} {{treated with}} a water repellent is used to fill the pores and cavities of masonry construction and hollow <b>blockwork</b> to enhance fire ratings (e.g. Underwriters Laboratories Wall and Partition designs), thermal insulation, and acoustic performance. Expanded vermiculite has also been used as thermal insulation in the attics and walls of houses and in water heaters, fire safes, stoves, furnaces, and refrigerators.|$|E

50|$|Helgøya Church (Helgøya kirke) {{was inaugurated}} on 7 December 1870. The chapel {{was built in}} timber and <b>blockwork</b> in the Gothic Revival style. The church has about 200 seats. The chapel was {{restored}} and partially rebuilt in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The lower {{floor of}} the {{building}} is largely open for storage with early timber stumps visible. A training room has been enclosed in the north- east corner and a catering storage area formed by <b>blockwork</b> in the southern corner.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{widespread}} use of concrete, stone is rarely used as a primary structural material, often only appearing as a cladding, because of its cost and the high skills needed to produce it. Brick and concrete <b>blockwork</b> have taken its place.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} of the verandahs is enclosed with concrete <b>blockwork.</b> The parapet wall on the northern elevation rises to follow the gabled roof shape and is capped with a simple masonry mould. Early security bars remain in place on all external openings.|$|E
50|$|The {{front garden}} has an early path layout (extant by 1923) but s {{planting}} and garden elements, including a stone water fountain, stone-edged garden beds, concrete <b>blockwork</b> front fence, and perimeter bamboo planting which {{acts as a}} screen to Main Street and to neighbouring properties.|$|E

Of particular significance is the platypussary, the design for which, while modernised, is based on David Fleay's early, pioneering work.|$|E
50|$|Derived {{from the}} French, and meaning mono or single layer, Monocouche renders {{are the new}} {{generation}} of modern single coat renders which can be applied by hand or machine. Colour pigmented throughout, meaning no building painting, monocouche renders provide a low maintenance, weather resistant, hard wearing and attractive finish to a large range of external brick and <b>blockwork</b> properties.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{additions}} to both school complexes include a new painted <b>blockwork</b> and timber covered way and classroom block designed by Bruce Buchanan Architects Pty Ltd and built in 1991 {{at a cost}} of $400,000 at the Ipswich West State School, and a new block designed by David Pagenden Architects for the Special School, also built in 1991.|$|E
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 9.6 metres by 4.8 metres. It is an approximately 1.2 metres high semi-circular concrete <b>blockwork</b> structure open to the air except for a small reinforced concrete roofed area in the north-east corner. Reinforced concrete pipe tunnels are inserted {{in the east and}} west ends.|$|E
5000|$|The {{enclosure}} is a 12.6 metre by 6 metre by 4 metre high tubular, steel {{framed structure}} on a concrete <b>blockwork</b> base. The walls and roof {{are covered with}} chainwire except for the south-west corner, which is covered with shadowline asbestos cement sheeting. The earth floor has slate [...] "waterfall" [...] and [...] "creek" [...] water features.|$|E
50|$|The site rises {{sharply to}} the north, {{registering}} Gympie's hilly landscape. A concrete retaining wall stands {{to the rear}} of the building within which concrete steps rise steeply to a flat grassed platform which accommodates a small <b>blockwork</b> shed which is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. An early concrete surface drain is located on the eastern side of the building.|$|E
50|$|The {{enclosure}} measures 4.6 metres by 2.5 metres. It is an approximately 2.5 metres high {{structure with}} concrete <b>blockwork</b> base walls and tubular steel posts supporting upper level metal mesh and a super-6 corrugated asbestos cement skillion roof. Flat asbestos cement sheeting {{is located on}} the west wall. The enclosure has elaborate timber perches and a steel framed and sheeted gate.|$|E
50|$|The main {{building}} is 209.39m (687 ft) long by 124.35m (408 ft) wide and houses four 500 MW boiler-turbine units. The {{height of the}} boiler house is 65.22m (214 ft) and turbine house 34.44m (113 ft). The building is of steel construction with <b>blockwork</b> up to 10.66m (35 ft), above {{which there is a}} light-weight corrugated sheet cladding and windows.|$|E
50|$|As loose-fill insulation: Exfoliated {{vermiculite}} {{treated with}} a water repellent is used to fill the pores and cavities of masonry construction and hollow <b>blockwork</b> to enhance fire ratings (e.g. Underwriters Laboratories Wall and Partition designs), thermal insulation, and acoustic performance. Expanded vermiculite has also been used as thermal insulation in the attics and walls of houses and in water heaters, fire safes, stoves, furnaces, and refrigerators.|$|E
50|$|Like the Laing Easi-Form, a cast in situ {{concrete}} form of construction, first used in 1952 but {{mainly in the}} period 1962 to 1981. With a solid cavity wall, the poured concrete substitutes for the inner <b>blockwork</b> walls of traditional housing. Solid wall types 225 mm thick cast in lightweight concrete, rendered externally. Cavity wall types have an inner leaf of at least 100-125mm thick concrete.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{of larger}} city {{areas such as}} Damascus, Aleppo or Homs, {{residential}} areas are often clustered in smaller villages. The buildings themselves are often quite old (perhaps a few hundred years old), passed down to family members over several generations. Residential construction of rough concrete and <b>blockwork</b> is usually unpainted, and the palette of a Syrian village is therefore simple tones of grays and browns.|$|E
