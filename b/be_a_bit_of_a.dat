It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Johnson {{compared}} Dragon Warrior {{to modern}} RPGs and noted the game's {{complete lack of}} replay value, which is due {{as much to the}} requirement that almost everything in the game must be done to beat it as to its difficulty. Johnson noted the game's historical importance; he said: [...] " [...] a tough road to walk, but reaching its end will instill a new appreciation of what today's RPG's are all about." [...] The 2009 book Vintage Games contrasted Dragon Warrior to the 1986 NES title The Legend of Zelda; it said, while both titles share common RPG elements, Zelda features a fantasy setting and magic but no level or turn-based combat system, and Dragon Warrior features both. Nintendo Power said the game's historical significance is its greatest aspect, and noted that [...] "playing Dragon Warrior these days can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> chore". GamePro wrote that their favorite aspect of the game was the Elizabethan-English dialogue, and that they were disappointed by its removal in the GBC remake.|$|E

[...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have to give my best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] was filmed over {{three days in}} October 2003, at Silvercup Studios in Long Island City, New York. It was {{directed}} by Paul Hunter, who revealed that the concept was setting Spears and Madonna apart, hence Spears wore a black outfit whereas Madonna sported a white suit. Spears stated, [...] "The video is more sensual than I'm used to [...] It was my first time doing a collaboration and I got Madonna. It's really interesting to see the two different styles together." [...] Kevin Tancharoen was the choreographer of the video. The vehicle used in the video, a Mazda RX-8, was autographed by Spears on the hood and auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation. In 2009, Hunter talked to MTV News about the video, saying, [...] "Madonna is an icon of an earlier generation, and then Britney of the newer generation. She was at her peak at that point [...] So {{it was a challenge}} to kind of bring both of the worlds together. I wanted it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cat-and-mouse sort of game {{and a little bit of}} a foreplay between Britney and Madonna and just sort of tease the audience." ...|$|E

A year later, Feige noted, [...] "We have an idea , and it's gonna be very, very different," [...] but cautioned that Marvel would not be [...] "actively discussing anything past untitled Avengers" [...] besides dating the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming and that James Gunn would be working on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.

500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E

On October 20, 2010, TV Guide announced that Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd had been cast {{in an upcoming}} episode as [...] "Walter's musical hero". Noble explained Lloyd's role: [...] "We all know how much Walter loves music, right? Well this fellow {{was one of his}} icons. He adored this man. So Walter gets to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fanboy". Lloyd began shooting the episode in late October. Soon before the episode aired, Lloyd told reporters [...] "I was very excited for this role. My character is going through an experience he never expected to happen to him, and he's adjusting to that." [...] Lloyd also added he felt welcomed in {{as a part of the}} ensemble cast. In a conference call interview with journalists, John Noble explained that [...] "probably the best fun that I've had [...] was doing the stuff with Chris Lloyd, because it was two crazy old guys just trying desperately to communicate with each other. We had a lot of laughs. There was a common thread of trying to find the music again, because Chris' character had forgotten how to play the piano, so we go through this journey of bringing the music back to him, and [...] thrill to Walter.

500|$|Patrick Day of the Los Angeles Times found [...] "Eggtown" [...] {{to be set}} at {{a slower}} pace than other episodes of the season and said that [...] "the witness stand as forum for revelation … holds no appeal for me."

[...] She criticized the lack of plot twists, stating that [...] "that last-second 'reveal' of [...] turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dud". [...] Werts also critiqued the execution and acting, calling the trial [...] "blandly delivered" [...] and Lilly and Fox [...] "expressionless". [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger dubbed [...] "Eggtown" [...] "the weakest episode of the season", partially because he also was unimpressed with the lack of plot twists and does not find Kate to be a compelling character. [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson gave a mixed review, writing that [...] "last night's Lost was not amazing, until it slammed us upside the head with a plot curveball that left us unable to remember whatever doubts we may have had, say, one minute before." [...] Daniel of TMZ gave the episode a [...] "D", partially because the twist ending had been spoiled for him. [...] IGNs Chris Carabott rated it the worst of the first four by scoring it as a 7.6/10. [...] He wrote that the flashforward was [...] "out of place" [...] and that the [...] "final revelation was shocking … but Lost can't survive on shock value alone." [...] Daniel MacEachern of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B", the lowest grade for a fourth season episode from the website.|$|E

2500|$|When all-black {{minstrel}} shows {{began to}} proliferate in the 1860s, they often were billed as [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "the real thing".

This presumption of authenticity could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trap, with white audiences seeing them more like [...] "animals in a zoo" [...] than skilled performers.

It may, in fact, <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece." [...] Despite his applause, Bass also points out several imperfections of the book. First of all, the definition of extractive and inclusive institution is vague {{in a way that}} cannot be utilized in policymaking. Second, though Acemoglu and Robinson are ambitious in covering cases of all nations across history, this attempt is subjected to scrutiny of regional experts and historians. For example, their accusation of Ottoman Empire as [...] "highly absolutist" [...] might not be correct, given the level of tolerance and diversity inside the Empire as compared to its European counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|The first Russian {{produced}} four-wheel-drive vehicle, also in {{part for}} civilian use, was the GAZ-61, developed in the Soviet Union in 1938. [...] "Civilian use" [...] may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> misnomer, as {{most if not all}} were used by the Soviet government and military (as command cars), but the GAZ-61-73 version is the first four-wheel drive vehicle with a normal closed sedan body.

Soviet civilian life did not allow the proliferation of civilian products such as the Jeep in North America, but through the 1960s the technology of Soviet 4×4 vehicles stayed on par with British, German, and American models, even exceeding it in some aspects, and for military purposes just as actively developed, produced and used.|$|E

2500|$|The track has {{received}} polarized reviews.

Kennedy commented, [...] "don't let her age fool you; the song packs serious punch." [...] Capistrano said that the song's [...] "crazy" [...] beat works on the schoolyard and dancefloor.

Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence that goes into the scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early.
