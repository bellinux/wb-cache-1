5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the bilges. To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
25|$|A {{large-scale}} attack using anthrax {{would require}} the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5µm: larger particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract, while smaller particles would be exhaled <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. At this size, conductive powders tend to aggregate because of electrostatic charges, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the human lung. There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.|$|E

At the 1806 company meeting, officers decided to send Thompson <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior. Concern over the American-backed expedition of Lewis and Clark prompted the North West Company to charge Thompson with the task of finding a route to the Pacific to open up the lucrative trading territories of the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
25|$|Embedded in the {{thylakoid}} membranes {{are important}} protein complexes which {{carry out the}} light reactions of photosynthesis. Photosystem II and photosystem I contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy {{and use it to}} energize electrons. Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, decreasing the pH and turning it acidic. ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stroma—much like a dam turbine.|$|E
25|$|Confederate {{units that}} had {{suffered}} considerable loss or {{which had been}} fragmented {{in the course of}} the Civil War were aggregated and re-organized in the 16th Tennessee Cavalry Regiment. On October 27, Forrest's men attack the Steamboat Belle of St. Louis, Missouri from Fort Randolph. The Belle was on her way upstream from Memphis loaded with cotton bales, heading north to St. Louis. After the boat had landed at Randolph to pick up more payload, she was attacked by Confederate rebels. In the attack, one Union Army Major was killed on the vessel; 26 of the crew, who had gone ashore for freight, were captured by Confederate guerrillas when the captain had the steamboat push <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river in order to escape and save the boat from capture or destruction. The rebel forces suffered two casualties during the attack.|$|E

25|$|Like mitochondria, chloroplasts use the {{potential}} energy stored in an H+, or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy. The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water, and release them down an electron transport chain. The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space, creating a concentration gradient, with more hydrogen ions (up {{to a thousand}} times as many) inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma. The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient, flowing <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stroma through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma, the ATP is synthesized there, in position {{to be used in}} the dark reactions.|$|E
25|$|The book begins {{immediately}} {{following the death of}} Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that true holy men's bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. It comes as a great shock to the entire town that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost {{immediately following}} his death. Within the first day, the smell of Zosima's body is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.|$|E

50|$|This type of milking {{facility}} {{was the first}} development, after open-paddock milking, for many farmers. The building was a long, narrow, lean-to shed that was open along one long side. The cows were held in a yard at the open side {{and when they were}} about to be milked they were positioned in one of the bails (stalls). Usually the cows were restrained in the bail with a breech chain and a rope to restrain the outer back leg. The cow could not move about excessively and the milker could expect not to be kicked or trampled while sitting on a (three-legged) stool and milking into a bucket. When each cow was finished she <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> yard again. The UK bail, initially developed by Wiltshire dairy farmer Arthur Hosier, was a six standing mobile shed with steps that the cow mounted, so the herdsman didn't have to bend so low. The milking equipment was much as today, a vacuum from a pump, pulsators, a claw-piece with pipes leading to the four shells and liners that stimulate and suck the milk from the teat. <b>The</b> milk went <b>into</b> churns, via a cooler.|$|R

At 15:00 Rodney joined King George V and they maintained 22 knots – which was nearly maximum speed for Rodney.

500|$|Inspector Lomax then initiates a manhunt for {{the missing}} Carroon. After hiding out on a river barge, Carroon {{encounters}} a little girl, leaving her also unharmed through sheer force of willpower. Then, Carroon proceeds to a nearby pharmacy and kills the chemist, using his now-swollen, crusty, cactus-thorn-riddled hand and arm as a cudgel and leaving a twisted empty husk of the man to be found by police. Quatermass theorizes that Carroon has used select chemicals taken from the shelves to [...] "speed up a change going on inside of him". That night finds Carroon at a zoo, barely visible amongst some shadowed bushes with far less of his human form remaining. In the morning, twisted corpses of zoo animals are found, their life forces having all been absorbed, and a trail of slime leading <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> community. Among the bushes, Quatermass and Briscoe also find a small but living remnant {{of what was once}} Victor Carroon, and take it back to their laboratory. From his examination of this remnant, Quatermass concludes that some kind of alien life has completely taken over and will eventually release reproduction spores, endangering the entire planet ...|$|E
500|$|Investigators {{identified}} {{evidence of}} arcing in wiring of the {{in-flight entertainment system}} network, but this did not trip the circuit breakers. [...] The investigation was unable to confirm if this arc was the [...] "lead event" [...] that ignited the flammable covering on MPET insulation blankets that quickly spread across other flammable materials. The crew did not recognize that a fire had started and were not warned by instruments. Once they {{became aware of the}} fire, the uncertainty of the problem made it difficult to address. The rapid spread of the fire led to the failure of key display systems, and the crew were soon rendered unable to control the aircraft. Because he had no light by which to see his controls after the displays failed, the pilot was forced to steer the plane blindly; intentionally or not, the plane swerved off course and headed <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. Recovered fragments of the plane show that the heat inside the cockpit became so great that the ceiling started to melt. The recovered standby attitude indicator and airspeed indicators showed that the aircraft struck the water at 300 knots (560km/h, 348mph) in a 20 degrees nose down and 110-degree bank attitude, or almost inverted; the impact force of the aircraft crashing into the Atlantic Ocean was later calculated to be 350 times the force of gravity ("g"s). Death was instantaneous for all passengers and crew due to the impact forces and deceleration.|$|E
5000|$|From there, LST-510 {{crossed the}} Irish Sea and stopped briefly at Milford Haven, Wales before {{proceeding}} on to Plymouth, England where she delivered LCT-709. During May, 1944 LST-510 outfitted at Falmouth and Fowey {{for her next}} mission while [...] "scuttlebutt" [...] over {{the nature of that}} assignment flew furiously. Orders to load vehicles only heightened the excitement and accelerated the pace of work. Then, on 1 June 1944, LST-510 embarked 200 men and 70 vehicles of the 29th Infantry Division, and <b>the</b> ship <b>backed</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay and anchored. From that moment on, no one was allowed off the ship. At 0337 on 4 June, LST-510 weighed anchor and got underway, bound for the coast of France, but put about to return to Plymouth when foul weather compelled postponement. Finally, at 0355 on 5 June, LST-510 again shaped a course for France. By daybreak, LST-510 had formed up with Convoy B 1 of the 4,000-vessel Western Task Force. Neither LST-510 nor her embarked soldiers took part in the initial assault at Normandy. The invasion was already eight hours old when she began approaching Omaha Beach, near Vierville. She could not get all the way in to the beach itself, so LST-510 unloaded her cargo and disembarked her men via LCTs and [...] "Rhino" [...] pontoon barges. That night, LST-510 endured her first air raid, but her only loss proved to be sleep. The raids continued sporadically throughout the night. Even before all of LST-510s cargo had been unloaded, she began embarking wounded men for treatment. The three doctors on board performed their work in a [...] "magnificent" [...] manner, [...] "in the face of existing conditions," [...] laboring throughout the night on the ship's tank deck where an operating room had been set up.|$|R

Orpheus then becomes the subject of a cult and an oracle. Time flows backwards once more, and Orpheus' death is acted out again, and the opera ends with the Orpheus myth decaying.|$|R

It was agreed that the Rhodesians should return to Salisbury and consult their cabinet, then announce their answer. Despite expressing [...] "incredulity" [...] at {{what had happened in}} Pretoria, and showing deep reluctance, the politicians in Salisbury resolved that despite what they perceived as [...] "South African treachery" [...] the responsible course of action could only be to go on with the peace process, and that meant accepting Kissinger's terms, which they agreed were better than any they could get in the future should they refuse. Smith announced his government's answer on the evening of 24 September 1976: [...] "Yes." [...] South Africa's wavering financial and military assistance suddenly became available again, but the Frontline States then abruptly changed tact and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any interim period before majority rule was unacceptable. A new constitutional conference in Geneva, Switzerland was hastily organised by Britain to try to salvage something from the wreckage, with 20 October 1976 set as the start date.|$|E
