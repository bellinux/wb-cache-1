60|$|We {{were not}} long in getting ashore and astride horses, though the consummation of our pilgrimage {{had to be}} {{deferred}} for a day. Two months at sea, bare-footed all the time, without space in which to exercise one's limbs, {{is not the best}} preliminary to leather shoes and walking. Besides, the land had to cease its nauseous rolling before we could feel fit for riding goat-like horses over giddy trails. So we took a short ride to break in, and crawled through thick jungle to make the acquaintance of a venerable moss-grown idol, where had foregathered a German trader and a Norwegian captain to estimate the weight of said idol, and to speculate upon depreciation in value caused by sawing him in half. They treated the old fellow sacrilegiously, digging their knives into him to see how hard he was and how deep his mossy mantle, and commanding him to rise up and save them trouble by walking down to the ship himself. In lieu of which, nineteen Kanakas slung him on a frame of timbers and toted him to the ship, where, <b>battened</b> <b>down</b> under <b>hatches,</b> even now he is cleaving the South Pacific Hornward and toward Europe--the ultimate abiding-place for all good heathen idols, save for the few in America and one in particular who grins beside me as I write, and who, barring shipwreck, will grin somewhere in my neighbourhood until I die.

40|$|The Library, {{like the}} university, is {{adjusting}} {{to a situation}} in which steady-state funding actually means a decline in real support. In my last Report I indicated that impending disaster {{in the form of a}} dramatic reduction in periodical intake had been avoided for 198 G by an increase in the Senate grant for library materials. In fact the figures now show that the intake of periodicals is still being protected at the cost of a continuing decline in monograph purchases, which in 1980 were half the level of the peak years of 1974 ~ 76 and lower than at any time since the mid sixties.

60|$|We sat on {{the upper}} side-wall of the cabin, dangled our legs down {{the top of the}} cabin, leaned our backs against the deck, and played chess until the rising tide and the block and tackle on the boom-lift enabled us to get her on a respectable keel again.

In order to clean her copper, I had careened the Snark {{broadside}} on to the beach and outward. When the tide rose, she refused to rise.

30|$|And, finally, to {{the heart}} of the problem – the nature of {{biological}} organization, as it is within that special kind of organization that the essence of the animate - inanimate distinction presumably needs to be sought. How can biological organization as a phenomenon, characterized by inordinate dynamic (homeostatic) complexity and quite distinct to the static complexity of the inanimate world, be understood, an issue glossed over in the neo-Darwinian view? In response to these probing questions, directed toward clarifying the nature of the chemistry–biology connection, modern biology has taken a defensive posture and <b>battened</b> <b>down</b> the <b>hatches.</b> The unstated but implicit message in contemporary biology appears to be: yes, there are innumerable apparent contradictions when biology is directly confronted with physics and chemistry [2, 11 – 14]. However, since the physical sciences have not provided biology with the appropriate conceptual and methodological tools for resolving these contradictions, biology can avoid these awkward questions by fencing itself off from the physical sciences. The result: biology of the 20 th century has been overtaken by an ‘autonomy of biology’ philosophy, one openly endorsed by Ernst Mayr [15], one of the leading evolutionary biologists of the 20 th century, whereby biology is treated as a disparate science governed by a separate philosophy to the one underpinning the physical sciences. There are two kinds of matter, inanimate and animate, the physical sciences deal with the former, the biological sciences deal with the latter, and that’s that! Thus in the neo-Darwinian perspective, biology’s essence resides in the genome and the information coded therein, and from this vantage point, questions of origins – how did genomic information come about, how does information emerge from non-information – are conveniently brushed aside. But if, as is now widely believed, on planet Earth some 3.5 to 4 billion years ago chemistry did become biology [3 – 10], then the two subjects must in some sense be one, making it clear that the historical merging that took place in the distant past must be accompanied by a corresponding conceptual merging. The dissonance that continues to radiate from the glaring contradictions inherent in the biological and physical world views gives no respite.|$|R
