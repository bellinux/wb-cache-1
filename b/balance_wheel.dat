5|$|The {{study of}} {{vibrations}} in bikes includes its causes, such as engine <b>balance,</b> <b>wheel</b> balance, ground surface, and aerodynamics; its transmission and absorption; {{and its effects}} on the bike, the rider, and safety. An important factor in any vibration analysis is a comparison of the natural frequencies of the system with the possible driving frequencies of the vibration sources. A close match means mechanical resonance that can result in large amplitudes. A challenge in vibration damping is to create compliance in certain directions (vertically) without sacrificing frame rigidity needed for power transmission and handling (torsionally). Another issue with vibration for the bike is the possibility of failure due to material fatigue Effects of vibration on riders include discomfort, loss of efficiency, Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome, a secondary form Raynaud's disease, and whole body vibration. Vibrating instruments may be inaccurate or difficult to read.|$|E
25|$|Considering that {{accurately}} controlled {{rotational speed}} in analog fire-control computers was a basic element of their accuracy, {{there was a}} motor with its average speed controlled by a <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> hairspring, jeweled-bearing differential, a twin-lobe cam, and spring-loaded contacts (ship's AC power frequency was not necessarily accurate, nor dependable enough, when these computers were designed).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Hooke's law is an {{accurate}} approximation for most solid bodies, {{as long as the}} forces and deformations are small enough. For this reason, Hooke's law is extensively used in all branches of science and engineering, and is the foundation of many disciplines such as seismology, molecular mechanics and acoustics. It is also the fundamental principle behind the spring scale, the manometer, and the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> of the mechanical clock.|$|E
50|$|The {{railways}} {{based on}} the Ewing System are basically monorails using a <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> for <b>balancing</b> the train. The main load (almost 95%) is borne by the single rail while the rest is borne by the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> which runs on the ground. Further, in normal train systems, the rails {{have to be at}} almost exact level of other rail, failing which the train may go off the tracks. By using Ewing system, this problem is solved as the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> does not need exact level to maintain the balance of monorail. In addition the cost of laying tracks also goes down considerably since only one rail is used. Another benefit of using Ewing System was that the <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> could run on existing tarred roads as well as the macadam roads thus further reducing cost to lay down tracks.|$|R

In order toresearch this aim a teaching method composing of activities increasing attention control andpsycho-motor abilities was used. Participants were 3 male autistic children. In {{this research}}, directinstruction method was used in order to teach the ability of riding <b>balance</b> <b>wheeled</b> bicycle. Theautistic children were trained individually in an organized and controlled environment.

25|$|Mechanical clock {{mechanisms}} {{are sensitive to}} temperature changes which lead to errors in time keeping. A bimetallic strip is used to compensate for this in some mechanisms. The most common method {{is to use a}} bimetallic construction for the circular rim of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> As the spring controlling the balance becomes weaker with increasing temperature, so the balance becomes smaller in diameter to keep the period of oscillation (and hence timekeeping) constant.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, silicon {{has found}} a new use in {{mechanical}} watch movements. Several manufacturers of mechanical watch movements have incorporated silicon parts, mainly in the escapements and <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> regions. Silicon hair-springs are becoming more common as are silicon escapement wheels and forks. Silicon has several desirable properties when used in these contexts; It is thermally stable, shock resistant, and requires little to no lubrication. Ulysse Nardin pioneered these applications, with Omega, Breguet, Patek, Rolex, Cartier, and Damasko following. Most of these parts for watch movements are manufactured by deep reactive-ion etching (DRIE).|$|E
25|$|The balance {{consisted}} of a circular steel <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> with two bimetallic strips attached diametrically. Each bimetallic strip terminated with a screw thread mounted with a weight or balance nut. The further along the strip this nut was screwed, the greater the compensating effect. Another part of the patent concerned an addition to {{the form of the}} balance spring—a coil of smaller radius {{at each end of the}} helical spring, which offered increasing resistance to the rotating balance as it turned towards the end of each vibration. This was an important invention, as it largely eliminated the problem of the positional adjustment of balance controlled watches. This device, known as the Overcoil balance spring is still used today in most precision mechanical watches.|$|E

Since the space need to lay the tracks was less and <b>balancing</b> <b>wheel</b> could run on existing roads, PSMT succeeded in running through the congested urban areas of Patiala.

25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled hydraulic rams to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E
500|$|The first {{mechanical}} clocks, {{employing the}} verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around {{the start of}} the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. [...] The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> in the mid 17th century.|$|E

Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. [...] The addition of the balance spring made the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. [...] This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France.|$|E

500|$|In 1675, Huygens and Robert Hooke {{invented the}} spiral balance, or the hairspring, {{designed}} {{to control the}} oscillating speed of the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. [...] This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10minutes per day, similar {{to the effect of}} the pendulum upon mechanical clocks. The great English clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, {{was one of the first}} to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilised into the modern-day configuration.|$|E

2500|$|Arnold {{also appears}} to have been the first to think of the concept of the Tourbillon; this must have derived from his known work on the {{recognition}} and elimination of positional errors. In the Tourbillon device, the balance and escapement is continuously rotated and virtually eliminates errors arising from the <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> not being perfectly balanced whilst in vertical positions. Arnold appears to have experimented with this idea but died in 1799, before he could develop it further.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was writing}} about the inner being {{in all of these}} books and his goal was to get the single {{individual}} away from all the speculation that was going on about God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian or in an ethical/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God's love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a [...] "special type of religious conflict the Germans call Anfechtung" [...] (contesting or disputing). In Kierkegaard's view the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, the faith that God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. He wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as 1839, [...] "Fear and trembling is not the primus motor in the Christian life, for it is love; but it is what the oscillating <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> is to the clock-it is the oscillating <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> of the Christian life.|$|E

In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the £20,000 longitude prize. [...] His design used a fast-beating <b>balance</b> <b>wheel</b> controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring. [...] These features remained in use until stable electronic oscillators allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the Board of Longitude published a description of his work in The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper.|$|E

60|$|LIFE OF BUNYAN. Bunyan is an {{extraordinary}} figure; we must study him, {{as well as his}} books. Fortunately we have his life story in his own words, written with the same lovable modesty and sincerity that marked all his work. Reading that story now, in Grace Abounding, we see two great influences at work in his life. One, from within, was his own vivid imagination, which saw visions, allegories, parables, revelations, in every common event. The other, from without, was the spiritual ferment of the age, the multiplication of strange sects,--Quakers, Free-Willers, Ranters, Anabaptists, Millenarians,--and the untempered zeal of all classes, like an engine without a <b>balance</b> <b>wheel,</b> when men were breaking away from authority and setting up their own religious standards. Bunyan's life is an epitome of that astonishing religious individualism which marked the close of the English Reformation.|$|E
60|$|The uselessness of the terrific {{struggle}} on French soil {{is shown}} by the rapidity with which all its results were swept away. When Henry died in 1422, leaving his son heir to the crowns of France and England, a magnificent recumbent statue with head of pure silver was placed in Westminster Abbey to commemorate his victories. The silver head was presently stolen, and the loss is typical of all that he had struggled for. His son, Henry VI, was but {{the shadow of a}} king, a puppet in the hands of powerful nobles, who seized the power of England and turned it to self- destruction. Meanwhile all his foreign possessions were won back by the French under the magic leadership of Joan of Arc. Cade's Rebellion (1450) and the bloody Wars of the Roses (1455-1485) are names to show how the energy of England was violently destroying itself, like a great engine that has lost its <b>balance</b> <b>wheel.</b> The frightful reign of Richard III followed, which had, however, this redeeming quality, that it marked the end of civil wars and the self-destruction of feudalism, and made possible a new growth of English national sentiment under the popular Tudors.|$|E
