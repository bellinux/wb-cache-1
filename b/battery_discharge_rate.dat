This paper {{presents}} {{the stress and}} thermal analysis on the CubeSat structure to study the survivability of the CubeSat during the launching process or operating condition at the orbit is presented. Various design of mechanical structures were analyzed {{to determine the best}} design for different mission requirements. Analysis on the temperature of the batteries will be conducted as {{it is one of the}} most critical components that must operate in the required temperature to avoid failure of the CubeSat. ANSYS 13. 0 was used to simulate both the structural and thermal analysis. Static structural was used to study the impact of G-force on the CubeSat during the launching process and Icepak was used to study the internal temperature. All of the result will be compiled in the table and comparisons were made among different designs to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each design. Results from simulation such as: safety factor, weight, internal available space and <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> were analyzed. From the findings, there is no best design in the CubeSat structure but only the most suitable design for the mission purposes. <b>Battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> will play an important role to determine the requirement of heater in CubeSat...|$|E

The presented route recognition algorithm compares the GPS trajectory of the ongoing trip with stored commuting routes using the well known cross-correlation operation. If a route is recognized the energy management system switches from a charge depleting charge sustaining discharge strategy to a strategy where the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> is adapted to the length of the recognized route, thereby decreasing the average discharge current and the resistive losses. The proposed system is evaluated using simulations on one month of logged commuter driving data. The results for an energy management system based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy indicate an overall fuel cost reduction of 1. 5 % compared to an system that only utilize a charge depleting charge sustaining strategy...|$|E

We refer to a collection of system component states as system context and model the quantitative relation between system context attributes and the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> by multiple linear regressions. When the user changes applications or operations, we can dynamically predict the remaining battery lifetime as well as its variations by monitoring system context attributes.

40|$|In this work, a stochastic, physics-based {{model for}} Lithium-ion {{batteries}} (LIBs) {{is presented in}} order to {{study the effects of}} parametric model uncertainties on the cell capacity, voltage, and concentrations. To this end, the proposed uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach, based on sparse polynomial chaos expansions, relies on a small number of battery simulations. Within this UQ framework, the identification of most important uncertainty sources is achieved by performing a global sensitivity analysis via computing the so-called Sobol' indices. Such information aids in designing more efficient and targeted quality control procedures, which consequently may result in reducing the LIB production cost. An LiC$_ 6 $/LiCoO$_ 2 $ cell with 19 uncertain parameters discharged at 0. 25 C, 1 C and 4 C rates is considered to study the performance and accuracy of the proposed UQ approach.

The BAR consists of a rickshaw structure, a battery bank, a battery charge controller, a DC motor driver, and a DC motor whereas the proposed m-SBAR contains additional components like solar panel and microcontroller based DC motor driver.

40|$|AbstractIn energy {{constrained}} wireless sensor networks, maximizing {{network coverage}} lifetime while ensuring optimized coverage is important. The {{challenge is to}} determine an appropriate duty cycle for the nodes while maintaining sufficient count of active nodes for optimal network coverage. Most of the existing work, for coverage optimization based on duty cycle, does not consider the residual energy of the active nodes. This can result in suboptimal wake-up of sleeping nodes. RBSP considers the residual energy but ignores the active nodes’ <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> In this paper, we propose DCBSP (Discharge Curve Backoff Sleep Protocol), which considers the battery discharge curve of the active nodes to determine the duty cycle of the inactive nodes. Thus in DCBSP, inactive nodes wake-up close to death of the active nodes which leads to lesser energy consumption and increased network lifetime. NS- 2 simulations show the energy consumption of DCBSP is lesser than that of PEAS by 39 % and lesser by 25 % and 15 % as compared to RBSP and PECAS respectively. Further, the coverage ratio of DCBSP is higher than PEAS by 32 % and higher by 17 % and 6 % as compared to RBSP, PECAS respectively. Hence, DCBSP is effective in ensuring higher coverage while extending the network lifetime...|$|E

This look-up table has been developed through low discharge experiments of the battery modelled. Further, both the internal resistance and self-discharge resistance of the battery are subsequently expressed as functions of the open circuit voltage. By using an electrical model with these characteristics and a temperature compensation element to model different rates of charge and discharge, a relatively simple and accurate battery model has been developed. The new model takes into account battery storage capacity, internal resistance, self-discharge resistance, the electric losses and the temperature dependence of a lead acid battery.

40|$|Electric and hybrid {{electric}} vehicles are gaining momentum as a sustainable alternative to conventional combustion based transportation. The operating {{temperature of the}} vehicle will vary significantly over the vehicle lifetime and this variance in operating temperature will strongly impact the performance, driving range, and durability of batteries used in the vehicles. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, an experimental facility is developed to accurately quantify the effects of battery operating temperature on discharge characteristics through precise control of the battery operating temperatures, utilizing a water-ethylene glycol solution in a constant temperature thermal bath. A prismatic 20 Ah LiFEPO 4 battery from A 123 is tested using the developed method, and temperature measurements on the <b>battery</b> throughout <b>discharge</b> show a maximum variation of 0. 3 °C temporally and 0. 4 °C spatially at a 3 C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate,</b> in contrast to 13. 1 °C temperature change temporally and 4. 3 °C spatially when using the conventional air convection temperature control method under the same test conditions. A comparison of <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> curves using the two methods show that the reduction in spatial and temporal temperature change in the battery has a large effect on the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> characteristics. The developed method of battery temperature control yields more accurate <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> characterization due to both the elimination of state-of-charge drift caused by spatial variations in battery temperature, and inaccurate discharge characteristics due to battery heat up at various discharge and ambient conditions. <b>Battery</b> <b>discharge</b> characterization performed using the developed method of temperature control exhibits a reduction in battery capacity of 95 % when the operating temperature is decreased from 20 °C to - 10 °C at 3 C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> A reduction of 35 % in battery capacity is observed when for the same temperature decrease at a 0. 2 C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> The observed effect of operating temperature on the capacity of the tested battery highlights the importance of an effective thermal management system, the design of which requires accurate knowledge of the heat generation characteristics of the <b>battery</b> under various <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> and operating temperatures. In the second part of this thesis, a calorimeter capable of measuring the heat generation rates of a prismatic battery is developed and verified by using a controllable electric heater. The heat generation rate of a prismatic A 123 LiFePO 4 battery is measured for <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> ranging from 0. 25 C to 3 C and operating temperature ranging from - 10 °C to 40 °C. Results show that the heat generation rates of Lithium ion batteries are greatly affected by both battery operating temperature and <b>discharge</b> <b>rate.</b> At low <b>rates</b> of <b>discharge</b> the heat generation is not significant, even becoming endothermic at the battery operating temperatures of 30 °C and 40 °C.

40|$|The optimal {{management}} of plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) {{energy efficiency and}} range autonomy is strictly dependent on the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> which may expressed by its state of charge (SOC) time variation. In fact, vehicle efficiency is strongly influenced {{by the possibility of}} controlling the SOC discharge rate {{as well as of the}} trip distance and the availability of recharging facilities along the itinerary. In the given scenario, the accurate control of SOC discharge rate to complying with trip-based target values of the SOC (which allow for taking into account the availability of external recharge station opportunities) appears as a key aspect to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient optimised control strategy, implementable in a state of the art ECU. The power-split strategy may be defined for any given trip also taking into proper account the vehicle speed over the route. The main target demonstrated in this paper is the request of reaching a target SOC (SOCL) at the end of the trip although the application to other objectives (e. g., minimisation of emissions) is also theoretically feasible.

30|$|Spatial {{correlation}} can {{be expressed}} as data similarity between adjacent nodes in a region. The nodes with adjacent spatial correlation often lead to massive redundancy in data transmission. Accordingly, the common technique is to put some sensors in the sleep or active mode dynamically for sensing and communication. It can save energy by scheduling the sensors into appropriate state, and also reduce communication range and control messages. In [19], a sleeping scheduling scheme based on AHP is proposed. Some factors, such as the distance to CH, the residual energy, and sensing coverage ratio {{are taken into account}} to achieve the optimal nodes scheduling decision. In [20], a cross-layer organizational approach based on sleep scheduling is proposed, which can increase the monitoring coverage as well as the operational lifetime in wide-area surveillance applications. By defining the residual energy level of the nodes, More et al. [21] proposed a random backoff sleep protocol (RBSP) to increase the network lifetime and balance the energy consumption among the nodes. RBSP can ensure that the probability of neighbor nodes becoming active is inversely related to the residual energy level of the current active node. They also proposed Optimized Discharge-Curve-based Coverage Protocol (ODCP) to resolve the problem of coverage gaps within the sensing area as the sudden failure of nodes happens [22]. Their scheme can determine optimal sleep schedules for redundant nodes using their neighboring active nodes’ <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate,</b> failure probability, and coverage overlap information.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} three main parts that {{are concerned with}} the propagation of uncertainty across high-dimensional coupled problems with applications to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In all three parts, spectral methods involving polynomial chaos expansions (PCEs) are employed to quantify the effects of propagating the input uncertainties across the system. In the first part, a stochastic model reduction approach based on low-rank separated representations is proposed for the partitioned treatment of the uncertainty space in coupled domain problems. Sequential construction of the sub-domain solutions with respect to the stochastic dimensionality of each sub-domain enabled by the classical FETI method drastically reduces the overall computational cost and provides a well suited framework for parallel computing. Two high-dimensional stochastic problems, a 2 D elliptic PDE with random diffusion coefficient and a stochastic linear elasticity problem, have been considered to study the performance and accuracy of the proposed stochastic coupling approach. A sampling-based UQ framework to study the effects of input uncertainties on the performance of LIBs using a full-order physics-based electrochemical model is presented in the second part. Developed based on sparse PCEs, the proposed UQ technique enables one to study the effects of LIB model uncertainties on the cell performance using a fairly small number of battery simulations. An LiC 6 /LiCoO 2 cell with 19 random parameters has been considered to study the performance and accuracy of the proposed UQ approach. It was found that the <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> is a key factor affecting not only the performance variability of the cell, but also the determination of most important random inputs. The third part provides a comprehensive review of the sampling techniques for the regression-based PCEs.

In addition, hybrid sampling methods referred to by the alphabetic coherence-optimal techniques which are a combination of the alphabetic optimality criteria and the coherence-optimal sampling method are proposed. It was observed that the alphabetic-coherence-optimal techniques outperform other sampling methods, specially when high-order PCEs are employed and/or the oversampling ratio is low...|$|E
40|$|Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are {{emerging}} as a promising technology to foster the design and the implementation of self-configuring, self-healing, and cost-effective monitoring infrastructures. In the last decade, they {{have been used in}} several pilot research applications, such as detection of fires [1], object tracking [2, 3], security monitoring [4], supply chain monitoring [5] and stability monitoring of civil engineering structures, such as buildings [6], bridges [7], railroad tunnels [8], and dams [9, 10]. The commercial use of WSN is expected to grow dramatically in the next few years. However, industries in the field of wired sensing and monitoring infrastructures are still questioning the adoption of WSN in critical applications, despite attracted by their interesting features and by the possibility of reducing deployment and management costs of more than one order of magnitude [8]. This gap between research achievements and industrial development is mainly due to the little trust that companies repose in the reliability of WSNs. One of the causes of this distrust is represented by the lack of work defining critical application requirements forWSN and by the absence of effective approaches to be used at design time for assessing non functional properties, such as WSN dependability. Indeed, dependability assessment plays a central role in raising the level of trust of WSNs for critical applications. WSNs are exposed to several faults due to both wireless medium characteristic, the limited energy budget they are equipped with, harsh environment [11], and cheap adopted hardware. Even if digital signals are less prone to electromagnetic interference, packets might be lost or delivered with errors, sensors may be frozen to wrong fixed values and nodes may periodically reset due to malfunctioning. In these systems, data sensed by WSN nodes has to be properly delivered to the sink node (i. e., the node responsible of data collection), in spite of ”changes” introduced during WSN operation (e. g., a node failure). The situation is finally exacerbated by the highly dynamic nature of WSN and their proneness in manifesting transient failures [11], and self-reconfigurations. Such a complex behavior introduces several challenges for WSN developers. The design of WSNs is hardened by the lack of effective methods and approaches to master the intrinsic complexity of WSN assessment, especially when aiming to design WSNs able to perform with a persistent level of dependability while withstanding to manifesting changes, i. e. able to perform with a given level of resiliency [12]. As discussed in Chapter 2, past research efforts have been devoted to define the concept of connection (or network) resiliency for computer networks [13] and ad-hoc networks [14], i. e., the number of “changes”, in terms of node failures, that can be accommodated while preserving a specific degree of connectivity in the network. However, while these concepts still apply to WSNs, they are not enough to characterize the data-driven nature of WSNs. The service delivered by the WSN does not encompass only the connection, but also the computation, i. e., even when sensor nodes are potentially connected (a path exists between nodes and the sink node), data losses can still occur. To overcome this limit, this thesis defines the concept of data delivery resiliency and qualifies the concept of WSN resiliency as a non functional properties composed by both connection resiliency and data delivery resiliency. Data delivery resiliency is defined in this thesis as the number of changes in terms of node failure that the WSN can accommodate while preserving packet delivery efficiency greater than a threshold. The concept of connection resiliency and data delivery resiliency are not interrelated. While the concept of connection resiliency relates to the WSN topology, i. e. the degree of path redundancy in the network, the concept of data delivery resiliency is related to i) the computational load on nodes which may causes packet losses due to buffer overrun, ii) application requirements, e. g. at least a given amount of produced measurements must be delivered to the sink node, iii) routing and MAC protocols impacting on the data delivery features and packet error rate, and iv) radio interferences and packet loss/corruption phenomenon on the propagation medium. Hence, assessing the data delivery resiliency as well as the connection resiliency is a crucial task in designing dependable WSNs, since it could help to i) anticipate critical choices e. g., concerning node placement, running software, routing and MAC protocols, ii) mitigate risks, e. g., by forecasting the time when the WSN {{will not be able to}} perform with a suitable level of resiliency, and iii) prevent money loss, e. g., providing a criteria to plan and schedule maintenance actions effectively. It is easy to figure out that resiliency assessment ofWSNs is dramatically exacerbated by the complexity of potential changes that may take place at runtime. The workload impacts on the number of packets sent on the network. The path followed by packets depends on the routing algorithm, on the topology, and on the wireless propagation profile (packets can be lost). The energy profile is affected by the workload, by the number of forwarded packets, and by the battery technology. All above factors impact on the failure behavior, e. g., a node can fail due to battery exhaustion. A node can also fail independently, due to faults in the sensing hardware. In turn, a failure of a node may induce a partition of the network into two or more subsets, involving a large set of nodes to be unavailable, i. e., isolated, since they are no more able to deliver data to the sink. Clearly, such high degree of inter-dependence complicates the assessment task, by dramatically increasing the number of variables and dynamics to encompass. Finally, but not less important, resiliency assessment cannot neglect actual hardware/software platforms features and the sensing hardware being used: different power consumptions and failure rates are indeed experienced when varying the underlying platforms, such as sensing hardware, radio chip and node operating system. Resiliency assessment cannot deviate from the use of models. State-of-art techniques for the assessment of non-functional properties, such as power consumption or dependability are mostly based on behavioral simulators and analytical models, as deeply discussed in Chapter 2. WSN Behavioral simulators, such as ns- 2 [15] or TOSSIM [16], are close to real WSNs. They typically belong to the the final user (e. g. the deployer) domain of knowledge and allow to reproduce the expected behavior of single WSN nodes on the basis of the real application planned to execute. However, they are not designed to express and to evaluate non-functional properties. Such an analysis requires to evaluate statistical estimators and hence it needs several simulations runs in order to achieve results with an acceptable confidence. This in turn increases the time needed for the simulation by order of magnitudes, given the low-level of detail of these approaches. Analytical models, such as Petri nets and Markov chains, are the reference for resiliency assessment techniques. They have been successfully used for decades for the assessment of computer systems, including WSNs [17, 18]. However, the highly dynamic nature of WSNs requires the definition of detailed and complex models which are difficult to develop and hardly re-usable for different scenarios For instance, if a modeling team would invest for a fine grain model of a WSN, taking into account software, routing issues and hardware platforms, even a tiny change in the design parameters of the considered WSNs, such as the software or the topology, would probably require a modeling phase ex-novo, incurring in unaffordable design costs, while such aspects are well and easily reproduced in behavioral models. As matter of fact, the assessment of WSN resiliency following a mere analytical approach requires strong simplifying assumptions that often lead to rather abstract results. To overcome the limitation of available approaches, this thesis proposes a novel and holistic approach for the resiliency assessment of WSNs. Key focus of the approach is the holistic resiliency assessment, i. e., the comprehensive assessment performed by taking into account all subsystems and inter-related factors concurring to the behavior of the WSN. Hence, an important step toward the resiliency assessment of a WSN is to evaluate: i) how the node workload, hardware platforms, topology and routing protocols impact on the failure proneness of nodes and of the network, and, vice-versa, ii) how node and network failures impacts on the nominal behavior of the WSN (e. g., how the failure of a node mutates the behavior of running workload or routing protocols). It is clear that the failure of a single node may impact on the behavior of the overall network in an unmanageable number of ways. Conversely, different user choices (e. g., the node workload and the routing algorithm) influence the nominal behavior as well as the failure behavior of every single node. To master this complexity, the approach separates the assessment of the failure behavior from the evaluation of the nominal behavior by considering i) a set of parametric analytical failure models, and ii) a WSN behavioral model, respectively. Initially, the behavioral model is exploited to configure the WSNs in terms of hardware platform, topology, routing and MAC protocols, and to study the nominal behavior of the software, included the OS, and the power consumption of the nodes. Evaluations performed with the behavioral models are used to gather values for failure model parameters of the WSN under study, such as the packet forwarding rate of each node. Then the power of the analytical failure model is exploited to evaluate a set of metrics of interest such as the resiliency. However, it is not difficult to realize that some parameters are dynamic over time, i. e., their values need to be dynamically updated during the assessment, driven by the failure model. To exemplify consider a node X that stops working, due to battery exhaustion. After this failure, the routing tree needs to be updated, and traffic patterns in the network change consequently. Different traffic patterns in turn cause a different nodes <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> which finally affects the lifetime of individual nodes, and likely, of the WSN. A possible solution would be to stop the failure model at each change event, and to step back to the behavioral simulation in order to re-compute network parameters coherently with new working condition, however, at the price of unaffordable simulation costs. For this reason, the proposed approach delegates the effort of computing the variation of dynamic parameters to an additional component, here referred as External Engine which orchestrates the evolution of the failure model. The external engine can be regarded as a supervision entity encapsulating and managing aspects that are generally difficult to express at the level of abstraction of analytical models. Hence, the engine is essential to keep models simple, general and reusable. The use of the External Engine decouples analytical models from “changes“ management issues, allowing to simplify the failure model which can adapt to each manifesting change, transparently. Moreover, the assessment is more realistic since it encompasses all network/application related parameters which are likely to change during WSN lifetime, without the need of strong simplifying assumption. The proposed approach is also conceived to reduce the modeling effort of final users by automating the creation of failure models, metrics to be estimated, and experiments to be performed. To this aim, information collected after the behavioral model simulation, concerning adopted node and sensing platform, radio chip, batteries workload and topology are exploited to specialize a specific set of templates from a Failure Model Template Library. Failure Model Templates are skeletons of failure models, described by means of XML files, which are produced una tantum by a domain expert. They are composed of i) a well defined interface, ii) a part depending on the specific WSN, and iii) a fixed part. Well defined interface are used to compose complex models by joining different sub-models together. Template parts depending on the specific WSNs are the objective of the automated failure model generation since they need to be generated according to the considered WSN. For instance, after the behavioral simulation, a model is generated for each sensor node with as many output links to other node failure models as its neighbors in the topology configured by the user. Generated models are then populated with parameters which values reflect the WSN studied in the behavioral simulation, e. g., for each nodes, generated output links models are populated with packet loss probabilities which values have been evaluated during the behavioral simulation. The generation phase ends by producing a XML description for each generated models, which are completed with a XML description of metrics and experiments of interests to perform (e. g., selected by the user, consistently with his/her interests). Finally, a parser translates the XML descriptors in a format compliant to the selected analytical model formalism, i. e., specializing the produced XML for the modeling framework chosen for performing experiments of interest. Relying on an automated modeling phase, the proposed approach allows final users (i. e., WSN developers) to work within their knowledge domain, without requiring specific modeling and/or programming skills. In other terms, developers interact with artifacts that are related to their domain, such as behavioral simulators. Finally, interested industries may release failure model libraries upon the release of WSN hardware, following the same approach as for HDL libraries. In the context of this thesis, Stochastic Activity Networks (SAN) formalism [19] and the Mobius [20] framework are adopted to develop and simulateWSNs failure models, due to their flexibility and extensibility features. The effectiveness of the approach is shown by means of a resiliency assessment campaign based on a set of hypothetic, real-world WSNs. As it will detailed later, the approach allows to anticipate design choices by evaluating the resiliency under different failure conditions and scenarios, workload behavior, and adopted routing algorithms, using the same set of parametric SAN models. The approach can be adopted by a hypothetic user, who can exploit simulation results to fine-tune his applications, for instance, selecting an appropriate routing algorithm and/or application workload which make the WSN able to fulfill given requirements, e. g. in terms of resiliency. The proposed approach may help also in the case of already deployed WSN, for instance, by forecasting the time when the WSN will exhibit a degraded behavior by deviating from its specifications helping to schedule maintenance actions in advance. This thesis is organized in 7 chapters as it follows. Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of WSNs and their applications, stressing their requirements and the importance of resiliency in the considered scenarios. Chapter 2 analyzes the state of the art in the field of WSN simulation and dependability assessment. Chapter 3 provides the definition of both connection and data resiliency. Chapter 4 is focused on the holistic approach, objective of this thesis, and it presents challenges and solutions for the orchestration of the behavioral and analytical simulation and for the automated failure model generation. Chapter 5 presents the behavioral models and the parameters needed to generate the failure model. Chapter 6 presents the failure models and the followed modeling approach. Chapter 7 finally provides a set of case studies aiming at showing the effectiveness of the approach concerning different WSN deployments...|$|E

Ease-of-use, safety and security have been sighted as key problems to be resolved before the scale and duration of their deployment can be extended. We focus on 4 performance factors that influence these issues: (i) Semantic Fidelity - The diagnostic quality of data measured by BANs is critical to system safety; (ii) Low-Power Operation - Reducing power consumed by BANs will result in light-weight systems with small form-factors and extended lifetimes, owing to reduced <b>battery</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the use of}} smaller batteries; (iii) Fault-Tolerant Operation - Faulty sensor measurements can severely impact diagnostic quality of the data produced by the system, thereby impacting system safety; (iv) Data Sharing Security - Sharing large BAN collected medical datasets exacerbates problems related to secure control over medical data as it is shared between data owners and consumers. Here, we study low-power sampling techniques for multi-sensor remote health monitoring BANs, where medical diagnostic metric accuracy is maximized while the number of samples taken simultaneously is constrained. Power usage is reduced both due to the decrease in number of sensors that are active at a time, and due to the reduced bandwidth required to transmit the measured signals. The techniques are extended to admit fault tolerance and fault detection capabilities while maintaining low-power operation and high semantic-fidelity requirements. We study low-power sampling for the continuous monitoring and anomaly detection use-cases. The use of a novel energy harvester technology in scavenging energy from foot-strikes and powering BANs in a self-sustaining manner is also studied. Several optimizations are considered to maximize the energy output of a proposed foot-strike energy harvester platform based on this novel harvester, while adhering to user-comfort requirements. Finally, we study a robust watermarking technique to address secure data control requirements related to sharing BAN generated datasets. Three use-cases are addressed - proof-of-ownership, data tracking and content authentication. It is shown that robust and imperceptible watermarking of biomedical signals is achievable without compromising semantic fidelity of the datasets...|$|R

50|$|SOC or State {{of charge}} is the {{equivalent}} of a fuel gauge for a battery. SOC cannot be determined by a simple voltage measurement, because the terminal voltage of a battery may stay substantially constant until it is completely discharged. In some types of battery, electrolyte specific gravity may be related to state of charge but this is not measurable on typical battery pack cells, and is not related to state of charge on most battery types. Most SOC methods take into account voltage and current as well as temperature and other aspects of the discharge and charge process to in essence count up or down within a pre-defined capacity of a pack.

2500|$|The C-rate is {{a measure}} of the rate at which a <b>battery</b> is being <b>{{discharge}}d.</b> It is defined as the discharge current divided by the theoretical current draw under which the battery would deliver its nominal rated capacity in one hour. A 1C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> would deliver the battery's rated capacity in 1 hour. [...] A 2C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> means it will discharge twice as fast (30 minutes). A 1C <b>discharge</b> <b>rate</b> on a 1.6 Ah <b>battery</b> means a <b>discharge</b> current of 1.6 A. A 2C rate would mean a discharge current of 3.2 A. Standards for rechargeable batteries generally rate the capacity over a 4-hour, 8 hour or longer discharge time. Because of internal resistance loss and the chemical processes inside the cells, a battery rarely delivers nameplate rated capacity in only one hour. Types intended for special purposes, such as in a computer uninterruptible power supply, may be rated by manufacturers for discharge periods much less than one hour.|$|R
