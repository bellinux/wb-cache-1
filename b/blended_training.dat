40|$|Once a {{workshop}} or seminar is finished, {{it is truly}} (and unfortunately) finished. The trainer and participant part ways — sometimes never to meet again. Thus, the application burden falls directly {{on the shoulders of}} the participant—and the organization. However, frequently the trainer is held accountable by the participant and the organization when application does not occur. The CK Communication, Training, and Learning System now offers a tool that will allow training professionals to assist the participants to better apply the training content and to assist the organization in its efforts to motivate and support their workforce development efforts.

In this study, we tested the effectiveness of an innovative <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> program combining face to face and web-based activities in enhancing self-efficacy and emotion regulation among young basketball players. The training program lasted seven weeks and was based on the four sources of self-efficacy information identified by Bandura. In a twogroup pre-test and a post-test design, 37 basketball players received either a web-based or a control text-based training program. The results indicated that the athletes receiving the web-based interactive training reported higher levels of self-efficacy compared to the baseline assessment, while no significant differences emerged in the control group. Concerning emotion regulation, both groups reported less emotional suppression {{at the end of the}} training, while no significances emerged for cognitive reappraisal.

40|$|The {{project was}} {{developed}} {{as one of}} the six final projects in the <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> on Project Management (PM) by the end of 2003. It was aimed to offer to the agency’s man-agers and project leaders – distributed in twenty-six offices around Brazil- a more flexible way to learn about PM. In view of the opportunity to advance in the direction of distance education, a group of four employees from different areas, with a common interest in dis-tance education, engaged in the design and development of a teaching-learning process to be delivered exclusively at a distance, which resulted in a prototype to be tested. In {{spite of the fact that}} technology was the agency’s business, there were several cul-tural barriers that hindered the implementation of distance events in various organiza-tional levels.

40|$|When HRD {{professionals}} {{try to move}} training online {{there is}} considerable resistance to face. The resistance does not just come from the learner, it is often the experienced trainer who puts up the biggest fight. Trainers {{are well aware of}} the immediacy of face-to-face learning events, the performance criteria, the reading of atmosphere and facial expression, the adjustment of content based on a continuous checking of understanding. But faced with tight budgets, increased mandatory demands and mobile and distributed working, the case for using technology is convincing. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the opportunities which <b>blended</b> <b>training,</b> applying Web 2. 0 affordances to face-to-face interaction, might offer small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This working paper is the initial stage of a research project which aims to explore the effectiveness of a blended approach to training and development in small businesses. Such businesses rarely have in-house trainers: either principals in the business will carry out their own development activities with staff, or local training providers will be approached for help with chronic or acute business problems. In difficult trading circumstances, such organisations often cut training expenditure first, a reasonable approach based on the economics of the situation, but a short-sighted one given the longer term effect on human capital development, and its impact on competitive advantage. In order to determine the effectiveness of a blended approach to training, we have to establish low cost or no cost affordances of Web 2. 0 technologies which may add value to small-scale training sessions, and develop a case for their use. If the case is convincing, and can overcome the traditional resistance of face-to-face trainers to the use of online media for learning, then we have a baseline with which to present a business case and develop proposals to test the effectiveness of <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> in SMEs. The author conducted an extended focus group with professional trainers who work in SMEs to test out some of the objections to online media for learning and develop hypotheses concerning the potential value of <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> to such organisations...|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{establish}} the preferred modality for professional continuing education (CE) {{among members of}} three library associations. The primary hypothesis was that face-to-face training is the preferred modality, and the secondary hypothesis was that younger librarians {{are more likely to}} favour online or <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> modalities. In addition, the authors sought to investigate which factors influence participants’ decisions to take up training. Design – Online questionnaire. Setting – Three library associations based in the United States of America. These were the American Library Association (ALA), the Special Libraries Association (SLA), and the Medical Library Association (MLA). Subjects – A random sample of 328 members of the ALA (86 participants), SLA (63 participants), and MLA (291 participants). Some participants were members of more than one association. Methods – Participants were recruited to complete an online survey via direct e-mail contact (MLA), messages on email discussion lists (SLA) and social networks (ALA). The survey asked about participants’ experience of, and preference for, five different training modalities for CE. These were: face-to-face (classroom instruction), web-based synchronous (with real-time participant-instructor interaction), web-based asynchronous (with instructor involvement, but not in real time), blended (a combination of different modalities), and webcasts (live online presentations with limited participant-instructor interaction). Participants were then asked to rank factors which would influence their decision to undertake CE courses. The factors were cost, opportunity to socialize/network, time away from work, learning at their own pace, and having immediate access to either the class instructor or other participants. Participants were also given space to comment on both CE modalities and influencing factors. Main Results – There was a statistically significant preference for face-to-face instruction in this sample, being preferred by at least 73. 1 % of participants in all age ranges. Younger librarians did not display a preference for online or <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> modalities. There was a significant difference in second preference between ALA and MLA members, who both preferred Web based asynchronous training, and SLA members, who preferred the web-based synchronous format. Participants’ preferences for all modalities apart from face to face were significantly different depending on whether or not they had experienced the particular modality. Cost was ranked as the most influential factor in the decision to undertake CE by members of all three library associations (significant at P Conclusion – The results confirm the hypothesis that face to face is the preferred training modality for this sample of members of the ALA, MLA and SLA. However, the secondary hypothesis, that younger librarians are more likely to prefer online or <b>blended</b> <b>training</b> methods was disproved in this sample. Since this is the case, and there is a strong influence of cost on the uptake of CE courses, the authors suggest that providers of CE should consider these results when planning training to suit the needs of their members...|$|E

Data were collected {{with the help of}} a questionnaire from about 500 engineering college teachers. These teachers had attended a blended synchronous distance mode workshop, conducted by IIT Bombay, on "Computational fluid dynamics" in June 2012. The research model was tested using the SEM approach and was found to have a good fit. Ten hypotheses were tested using path analysis. The variable that had the largest effect on Satisfaction (SAT) was Technology effectiveness (TE). The variables that had medium effect on Satisfaction (SAT) were, Behaviour intention to use (BIU), Perceived usefulness (PU), Instructor effectiveness (IE) and Extrinsic motivation (EM). The result on the role of TE in <b>blended</b> synchronous teacher <b>training</b> supports the existing body of literature. Moreover, we found that IE was fully mediated through PU and BIU and thereby implying that TE has a significant role if supported by IE, PU and BIU.
