5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, so they can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b> Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, {{to break down the}} cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|In large doses, {{silver and}} {{compounds}} containing it can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the circulatory system and become deposited in various body tissues, leading to argyria, {{which results in}} a blue-grayish pigmentation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Argyria is rare, and so far as is known, does not otherwise harm a person's health, though it is disfiguring and usually permanent. Mild forms of argyria are sometimes mistaken for cyanosis.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish {{contains}} {{chemical substances}} which can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the skin, or inhaled. When handling shoe polish, one should ideally wear gloves, {{and stay in}} a well-ventilated area. Shoe polish should be kept {{out of reach of}} children and animals. It can stain the skin for a protracted period of time, and will cause irritation to the eye if there is direct contact.|$|E
50|$|This new {{incarnation}} was short-lived, however. On 20 November 1919 Y Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in A Battery, on 7 January 1920 Z Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in B Battery and on 11 February 1920 AA Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in M Battery, all of I Brigade, RHA. Finally, on 14 February 1920 the Headquarters <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> {{into the}} HQ of I Brigade.|$|R
50|$|In 1901, part of {{the civil}} parish <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol, and further parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol between then and 1933. In 1935, the civil parish was abolished, when the {{remaining}} parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the civil parishes of Pilning and Severn Beach, and Almondsbury.|$|R
50|$|The Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Cambrian Railways which, {{with the}} other companies, <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the GWR.|$|R
5|$|Some {{methods of}} {{fixation}} for unstable lesions include countersunk compression screws and Herbert screws or pins made {{of stainless steel}} or materials that can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the body. If loose bodies are found, they are removed. Although each case is unique and treatment is chosen on an individual basis, ACI is generally performed on large defects in skeletally mature people.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several blood-borne substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed,</b> modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
50|$|Although 95% {{of medium}} chain {{triglycerides}} <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein, only 25-30% of lauric acid <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein.|$|R
25|$|The Dingwall & Skye <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Highland in 1880, and the Sutherland, Duke of Sutherland's and Sutherland & Caithness Railways <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> in 1884.|$|R
50|$|In clear open waters, {{visible light}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the longest {{wavelengths}} first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> at higher water depths, {{and blue and}} violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> last {{compared to the other}} wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.|$|R
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{introduces}} a new ability system, Tactical Soul system, to the Castlevania series. It involves absorbing {{the souls of}} enemies {{in order to gain}} additional abilities. Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, all souls can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the player. The rate at which enemies' souls are obtained varies between enemies. Players can trade souls between two Aria of Sorrow cartridges using two Game Boy Advance consoles and a link cable.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b> For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934, Hitler {{and other}} Nazi leaders became {{concerned}} that Röhm was planning a coup d'état. Röhm had socialist and populist views, {{and believed that}} the real revolution had not yet begun. He felt that the SA—now numbering some three million men, far dwarfing the army—should become the sole arms-bearing corps of the state, and that the army should <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the SA under his leadership. Röhm lobbied Hitler to appoint him Minister of Defence, a position held by conservative General Werner von Blomberg.|$|E
5000|$|Strike Command {{was formed}} on 30 April 1968 by {{the merger of}} Bomber Command and Fighter Command, which became No. 1 Group and No. 11 Group respectively. Signals Command <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 1 January 1969, Coastal Command <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 28 November 1969 and Air Support Command (formerly Transport Command) <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> on 1 September 1972.|$|R
50|$|When an EUV photon <b>is</b> <b>absorbed,</b> photoelectrons and {{secondary}} electrons are generated by ionization, much like {{what happens when}} X-rays or electron beams <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> by matter.|$|R
5000|$|When {{an object}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the PC version, it disappears {{abruptly}} and generates {{a number of}} [...] "energy rings" [...] which quickly disappear. In the PS1 version, it disassembles into rotating polygons, while a seed (when a tree <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> or 2/3 [...] "energy clusters" [...] (when a boulder, a synthoid or a sentry <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> fly to the player's POV.|$|R
5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded {{underground facilities}} such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III {{for the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Many sunscreens use {{nanoparticles}} of {{zinc oxide}} (along with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide) because such small particles do not scatter light and therefore {{do not appear}} white. There has been concern that they might <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the skin. A study published in 2010 found a 0.23% to 1.31% (mean 0.42%) of blood zinc levels in venous blood samples could be traced to zinc from ZnO nanoparticles applied to human skin for 5 days, and traces were also found in urine samples. In contrast, {{a comprehensive review of}} the medical literature from 2011 says that no evidence of systemic absorption {{can be found in the}} literature.|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic {{example is the}} molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1935 Misterton was {{the centre}} of the Misterton Rural District, which <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the East Retford Rural District. This in turn <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Bassetlaw in 1974.|$|R
50|$|In 1815 Omalur taluk <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Salem taluk, but was recreated in 1819. It <b>was</b> again <b>absorbed</b> by Salem taluk in 1860, {{and again}} recreated in 1910. In 1916 Omalur taluk {{bifurcated}} into Omalur and Mettur, and in 1941 Mettur Taluk <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Omalur.|$|R
5000|$|Many of {{the older}} factions have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into their larger Houses or Clans, {{starting}} with the Firepower expansion in May 2005. For example, the Swordsworn <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Davion, and the Stormhammers <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> by House Steiner. The Steel Wolves faction [...] "evolved" [...] into their own mercenary group known as Wolf Hunters {{with the introduction of}} Clan Wolf into the game.|$|R
5|$|Rocks mined for {{phosphate}} fertilizers contain varying {{amounts of}} cadmium, {{resulting in a}} cadmium concentration {{of as much as}} 300mg/kg in the fertilizers and a high cadmium content in agricultural soils. Coal can contain significant amounts of cadmium, which ends up mostly in flue dust. Cadmium in soil can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by crops grown on the land such as in rice. Chinese ministry of agriculture officials have measured in 2002 that 28% of rice it sampled had excess of lead and 10% had an excess of cadmium above limited defined by law. Some plants such as willow trees and poplars have been found to clean both lead and cadmium from soil.|$|E
5|$|Scales play an {{important}} part in the natural history of Lepidoptera. Scales enable the development of vivid or indistinct patterns which help the organism protect itself by camouflage, mimicry and warning. Besides providing insulation, dark patterns on wings allow sunlight to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> and are probably involved in thermoregulation. Bright and distinctive colour patterns in butterflies which are distasteful to predators help communicate their toxicity or inedibility, thus preventing predation. In Batesian mimicry, wing colour patterns help edible lepidopterans mimic inedible models, while in Müllerian mimicry, inedible butterflies resemble each other to reduce the numbers of individuals sampled by inexperienced predators.|$|E
5|$|The {{city and}} {{government}} {{decided to change}} the type of development allowed near the river. The floodplain bordering the Red River was converted into a large park known as the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. This provided new recreation space for city residents, as well as space for future floodwaters to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> naturally by trees and other plants, without damage to infrastructure. East Grand Forks developed a related greenway park on its side of the river, as it has also suffered extensive flooding that year.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} July 1941, the Fourth Army {{began to}} dissolve. The Fourth Army's staff members <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the general staff of the Central Front, and the troops <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into other armies.|$|R
50|$|Besides the conglomoration {{of minor}} clans {{that makes up}} the Mantis, there are other minor clans that have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by great clans. The Falcon Clan has <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Crab (as Toritaka family).|$|R
5|$|By July 11, dry air and {{unfavorable}} {{wind shear}} prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated {{as it turned}} to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45miles (75km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|However, Elton ends {{up being}} cornered in a dead end alley. As he resigns himself to being absorbed, the TARDIS materializes and the Doctor and Rose emerge from within. The Abzorbaloff {{attempts}} to ransom Elton {{in exchange for the}} Doctor, but the Doctor feigns disinterest in Elton's fate, while dropping a hint to the absorbed members of LINDA. In response, the absorbed members collectively use their willpower to suppress the Abzorbaloff, who ends up dropping his cane. At Ursula's prompting, Elton breaks the cane, which causes the Abzorbaloff to melt into the ground. The Doctor explains that the cane created a limitation field to suppress the alien's power, but with it broken, he lost control and his power caused him to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the ground. The Doctor then recalls his first encounter with Elton, and explains that he was at Elton's house years ago tracking an elemental shade, but he was too late and the shade killed Elton's mother.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b> Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
