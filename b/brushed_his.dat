5|$|Gardstein's {{body was}} removed {{to a local}} {{mortuary}} where his face was cleaned, his hair <b>brushed,</b> <b>his</b> eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions {{of those who had}} helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she {{had been one of the}} people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured.|$|E
5|$|In another case, 28-year-old British student Nathan Layton was {{bitten by}} a black mamba and {{died of a heart}} attack in less than an hour in March 2008. The black mamba had been found near a {{classroom}} at the Southern African Wildlife College in Hoedspruit, where Layton was training to be a safari guide. Layton was bitten by the snake on his index finger while it was being put into a jar, but he didn't realize he'd been bitten. He thought the snake had only <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> hand. Approximately 30 minutes after being bitten Layton complained of blurred vision. He collapsed and {{died of a heart attack}}, nearly an hour after being bitten. Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at the scene.|$|E
25|$|After Australia's innings ended for 558, the Indian openers had a task of batting out 11 overs more. But {{they lost}} their way soon. Aakash Chopra lost his wicket to Nathan Bracken, wrongly adjudged caught behind when the ball had only <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> pads. Sehwag also got out, {{offering}} a catch, flicking Lee uppishly. Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly(who came in place of Sachin Tendulkar) carried them {{through to the end}} of the day without any major mishaps, ending on 6 not out each respectively.|$|E

25|$|Play started 15 {{minutes early}} again on day 4, but Buttler lasted {{less than four}} overs into the day's play, stumped by Ramdin off Bishoo, but Root and Jordan managed a quick 39-run {{partnership}} for the eighth wicket before Jordan was deemed to have been just run out by Holder for 16, followed by Broad for a duck after a review found the ball <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> glove on the way through to slip. Root continued to farm the strike opposite Anderson for the final wicket, only for the innings {{to be brought to}} an abrupt end when Anderson was run out, having failed to ground his bat behind the crease when he could have easily saved himself. The wicket denied Root the chance of a double-century, as he finished not out on 182, with England all out for 464. England made an early breakthrough yet again as the West Indies began their second innings, Anderson bowling Devon Smith for 2 runs, but a 142-run partnership between Brathwaite and Bravo restored the West Indies to 145/2 following the dismissal of Bravo by Broad. The home side were on 202/2 at stumps, helped by a century from Brathwaite, leaving them 37 runs ahead of England going into {{the final day of the}} match.|$|E
2500|$|Travis {{could open}} doors using keys, dress himself, water plants, feed hay to his owners' horses, eat {{at a table}} {{with the rest of the}} family, and drink wine from a stemmed glass; he was so fond of ice cream that he learned the {{schedules}} of passing ice cream trucks. He logged onto the computer to look at pictures, watched television using a remote control, and <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> teeth using a Water Pik. [...] He enjoyed watching baseball on television. [...] Travis had also driven a car on several occasions.|$|E
2500|$|Helen Mitchell was {{a militant}} Catholic, {{and the young}} José {{was raised in a}} strict authoritarian environment, where he read little of the popular literature, never went to the theater, {{attended}} mass daily and similarly read Imitação de Cristo daily in preparation of the [...] "ultimate sacrifice". [...] Similarly, his life was quite regimented: he went to sleep at 11 and woke at 6 in the morning, fenced for an hour, went to mass, had two hours training on horseback daily, and regularly shined his boots, <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> suits and cleaned most of his personal items. Helena Mitchell instilled in her son a religious zeal and military regime; at the age of 11 she gave him a copy of the History of the Crusades, Ivanhoe and he read and re-read a copy of Don Quixote, while fostering ethos of the medieval knight: austerity, valor, abstinence, [...] service to God and to country.|$|E

2500|$|The 2nd Test match {{witnessed}} many controversial umpiring decisions {{from the}} two umpires - Steve Bucknor and Mark Benson and even the third Umpire. Three of Steve Bucknor's gaffes occurred {{when he did not}} give Andrew Symonds out caught behind at 30 when TV Replays clearly showed that the ball had passed through the bat's edge. The second one occurred when Bucknor did not refer a stumping call against Andrew Symonds to the third umpire. Replays showed the Australia all-rounder’s foot wasn't grounded inside the crease when the bails came off. This was a major boost for Australia as Symonds went on to make 162 not out and brought Australia back into the Game. After these incidents, Andrew Symonds said, [...] "I was very lucky. I was out when I was 30, given not out. That's cricket though, I can sit here and tell you about my bad decisions as well - but I won't." [...] On the fifth day, Bucknor declared Rahul Dravid out caught behind though television replays later showed the ball had <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> pad without touching his bat.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2006, Pietersen {{played in}} the three Tests against India, which England drew 1–1. In the first innings on 15, another rash shot brought his downfall. He pulled a ball from Sreesanth onto his stumps. His 87 in the second innings of the first match came during England's {{acceleration}} period, helping push the required target over 300. England then declared overnight, and India successfully batted out the final day to secure a draw. This half-century was followed by another in the first innings of the second Test. Again, he gave his wicket away on 64 when he offered Munaf Patel a return catch. The second innings was not so good, facing just 13 balls before being given out caught behind off a Harbhajan Singh delivery. The unhappy Pietersen was later fined 30 percent of his match fee for shaking his head and showing signs of dissent. [...] "Replays demonstrated that the ball that had dismissed him had <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> forearm, not his glove, before ballooning up {{into the hands of}} Rahul Dravid at slip. But umpire Darrell Hair gave him out for 4 as England collapsed on the fourth afternoon." [...] Pietersen posted a score of 39 in the first innings of the third test before he got a beauty from Sreesanth which moved and took the edge of the bat before being caught by Mahendra Singh Dhoni. In the second innings, he posted 7 again being caught and bowled, this time by Anil Kumble via a leading edge. Despite a quiet match for him, England won comfortably after a dismal 100 all out in India's second visit to the crease.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi {{had never}} <b>brushed</b> <b>his</b> teeth or tied his own {{shoelaces}} {{once in his}} life, and {{now for the first}} time was forced to perform the simple tasks that always had been done for him, which he found very difficult to do. The prisoners often laughed how Puyi struggled with even brushing his teeth. Much of Puyi's [...] "remodeling" [...] consisted of attending [...] "Marxist-Leninist-Maoist discussion groups" [...] where the prisoners would discuss their lives before being imprisoned for hours on end. As part of his [...] "remodeling", Puyi was confronted with ordinary people who had suffered under the [...] "Empire of Manchukuo", including those who had fought in the Communist resistance, both to prove to him that resistance to the Japanese had been possible and to show him what he had presided over. When Puyi protested to Jin that it had been impossible to resist Japan and there was nothing he could have done, Ji confronted him with people who had fought in the resistance and had been tortured while Ji asked him why ordinary people in Manchukuo resisted while an emperor did nothing. As part of confronting war crimes, Puyi had to attend lectures where a former Japanese civil servant spoke about the exploitation of Manchukuo while a former officer in the Kempeitai talked about how he rounded up people for slave labor and ordered mass executions. At one point, Puyi was taken to Harbin and Pingfang to see where the infamous Unit 731, the chemical and biological warfare unit in the Japanese Army had conducted gruesome experiments on people. Puyi noted in shame and horror: [...] "All the atrocities had been carried out in my name". Puyi by the mid-1950s was overwhelmed with guilt and often told Jin that he felt utterly worthless to the point that he considered suicide. Puyi was told by Jin to express his guilt in writing, which Puyi later recalled he felt [...] "that I was up against an irresistible force that would not rest until it found out everything". Sometimes, Puyi was taken out for tours of the countryside of Manchuria, where he met a farmer's wife whose family had been evicted to make way for Japanese settlers and had almost starved to death while working as a slave in one of Manchukuo's factories. When Puyi asked for her forgiveness, she told him [...] "It's all over now, let's not talk about it", causing him to break down in tears. At another meeting, a woman described the mass execution of people from her village by the Japanese Army, and then declared that she did not hate the Japanese and those who had served them as she retained her faith in humanity, which greatly moved Puyi. On another occasion, Ji confronted Puyi with his former concubine Li in meetings in his office, where she attacked him for seeing her only as a sex object, and saying she was now pregnant by a man who loved her.|$|E
