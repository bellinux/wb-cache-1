40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to find out the effects of {{explosive}} strength and strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training on speed performance. To achieve the {{purpose of the}} study, thirty boys’ student in the age group 13 to 14 were selected as subjects at random. The selected subjects were from RCM High School, Natarajapuram, Sivagangai(DT), Tamilnadu. The study was formulated as pre and post-test random group design, in which thirty students were divided into three equal groups. The experimental group- 1 (n= 10, ESbCT) underwent explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training, the experimental group- 2 (n= 10, SEbCT) underwent strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training and group 3 served as control group (n= 10, CG) did not undergo any specific training. In this study, two training programme were adopted as independent variables, i. e., explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training and strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training. The speed was selected as dependent variables. The speed was tested by 50 meters run recoded in seconds. The selected two treatment group namely explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training and strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training were performed five days in week for the period of six weeks, as per the stipulated training programme. The speed performance was collected before and after the training period. The collected pre and post test data was critically analyzed with apt statistical tool of one way analysis of co variance, for observed the significant adjusted post-test mean difference of three groups. The Scheffe’s post hoc test was used to find out pair-wise comparisons between groups. To test the hypothesis 0. 05 level of significant was fixed in this study. The nature of speed highly improved in explosive strength <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training than the strength endurance <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> training...|$|R

40|$|The success {{probability}} in an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> generally decreases exponentially in {{the number}} of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> A new version of the amplitude amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine two or more ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> However, this type of the amplification only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow close to a unitary. In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary matrices on ancilla <b>based</b> quantum <b>circuits</b> in which the success probability is maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> design along with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified probabilities are generally around 0. 75 and the fidelity of the final state is mostly high and around 0. 95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis and show that combining two such ancilla <b>based</b> <b>circuits,</b> a matrix product can be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers...|$|R

It operates through one-by-one tunneling of electrons through the channel, utilizing the Coulomb blockade Phenomenon.

SET is very much advantageous than CMOS in few points. And in few points CMOS is advantageous than SET. So it has been seen that Combination of SET and CMOS is very much effective in the nanoscale, low power VLSI circuits.

40|$|Design of {{switched}} capacitor circuits in scaled CMOS technologies is becoming {{difficult because of}} low device intrinsic gain and reduced power supply voltage. To solve these problems, comparator-based switched-capacitor (CBSC) <b>circuits</b> and zero-crossing <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> (ZCBC) were suggested as a possible solution to the op-amp <b>based</b> <b>circuits.</b> In this thesis, we explore zero-crossing <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> (ZCBC) in high-order differential switched-capacitor filters to replace area inefficient op-amps-based continuous-time baseband filters. For the prototype for the zero-crossing based high-order {{switched capacitor}} filter, a low-pass ladder filter network will be used which is less sensitive to component variations. Several transformation steps from this low-pass passive ladder filter network to a differential high-order switched capacitor filter will be explored. To verify this architecture, SWITCAP will be used. And then ZCBC circuit implementation in Cadence will be explored. by Sungah Lee. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|In {{the case}} of a class B/AB amplifier, {{crossover}} distortion can be reduced by using a slight forward bias in the <b>base</b> <b>circuit</b> such that the transistors are idling at a small output current. The forward bias causes the circuit to operate in class-AB mode, so both transistors are slightly on during crossover. This can reduce or eliminate the characteristic kink of crossover distortion, although other types of crossover distortion will remain.|$|E
5000|$|Consider a positive-going swing: As long as {{the input}} {{is less than the}} {{required}} forward VBE drop (≈ 0.65 V) of the upper NPN transistor, it will remain off or conduct very little - this is the same as a diode operation as far as the <b>base</b> <b>circuit</b> is concerned, and the output voltage does not follow the input (the lower PNP transistor is still off because its base-emitter diode is being reverse biased by the positive-going input). The same applies for the lower transistor but for a negative-going input. Thus, between about ±0.65 V of input, the output voltage is not a true replica or amplified version of the input, and we can see that as a [...] "kink" [...] in the output waveform near 0 V (or where one transistor stops conducting and the other starts). This kink is the most pronounced form of crossover distortion, and it becomes more evident and intrusive when the output voltage swing is reduced.|$|E

Continuing {{research}} throughout, the teams had become interested in the causes of [...] "static" [...] radio signals, and found that much {{could be explained by}} distant signals located over the horizon being reflected off the upper atmosphere. This was the first direct indication of the reality of the Heaviside layer, proposed earlier but at this time largely dismissed by engineers. To determine the altitude of the layer, Watt, Appleton and others developed the 'squegger' to develop a 'time base' display, which would cause the oscilloscope's dot to move smoothly across the display at very high speed. By timing the squegger so that the dot arrived {{at the far end of}} the display at the same time as expected signals reflected off the Heaviside layer, the altitude of the layer could be determined.

40|$|Silicon <b>based</b> {{integrated}} <b>circuit</b> (IC) {{technology is}} approaching its physical limits. For sub 10 nm technology nodes, the carbon nanotube (CNT) based {{field effect transistor}} {{has emerged as a}} promising device because of its excellent electronic properties. One of the major challenges faced by the CNT technology is the unwanted growth of metallic tubes. At present, there is no known CNT fabrication technology which allows the fabrication of 100 % semiconducting CNTs. The presence of metallic tubes creates a short between the drain and source terminals of the transistor and has a detrimental impact on the delay, static power and yield of CNT based gates. This thesis will address the challenge of designing robust carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes. For a small percentage of metallic tubes, circuit level solutions are proposed to increase the functional yield of CNT based gates in the presence of metallic tubes. Accurate analytical models with less than a 3 % inaccuracy rate are developed to estimate the yield of CNT <b>based</b> <b>circuit</b> for a different percentage of metallic tubes and different drive strengths of logic gates. Moreover, a design methodology is developed for yield-aware carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> in the presence of metallic tubes using different CNFET transistor configurations. Architecture based on regular logic bricks with underlying hybrid CNFET configurations are developed which gives better trade-offs in terms of performance, power, and functional yield. In the case when the percentage of metallic tubes is large, the proposed circuit level techniques are not sufficient. Extra processing techniques must be applied to remove the metallic tubes. The tube removal techniques have trade-offs, as the removal process is not perfect and removes semiconducting tubes in addition to removing unwanted metallic tubes. As a result, stochastic removal of tubes from the drive and fanout gate(s) results in large variation in the performance of CNFET based gates and in the worst case open circuit gates. A Monte Carlo simulation engine is developed to estimate the impact of the removal of tubes on the performance and power of CNFET based logic gates. For a quick estimation of functional yield of logic gates, accurate analytical models are developed to estimate the functional yield of logic gates when a fraction of the tubes are removed. An efficient tube level redundancy (TLR) is proposed, resulting in a high functional yield of carbon nanotube <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> with minimal overheads in terms of area and power when large fraction of tubes are removed. Furthermore, for applications where parallelism can be utilized we propose to increase the functional yield of the CNFET <b>based</b> <b>circuits</b> by increasing the logic depth of gates...|$|R
