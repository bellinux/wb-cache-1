5|$|A non-competitive {{inhibitor}} binds {{to a site}} {{other than}} where the substrate binds. The substrate still binds with its usual affinity and hence Km remains the same. However the inhibitor reduces the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme so that Vmax is reduced. In contrast to competitive inhibition, non-competitive inhibition cannot <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> with high substrate concentration.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} discovery Wigner {{made during}} the project was the Wigner effect. This is a swelling of the graphite moderator caused by the displacement of atoms by neutron radiation. The Wigner effect was a serious problem for the reactors at the Hanford Site in the immediate post-war period, and resulted in production cutbacks and a reactor being shut down entirely. It was eventually discovered that it could <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by controlled heating and annealing.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as idle capacity. So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will <b>be</b> <b>overcome.</b> However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E

5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with his belief in religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E
5|$|Ominously, PAVN and the Pathet Lao did not {{withdraw}} to North Vietnam {{during the rainy}} season. Previously during the conflict, air mobility by STOL aircraft into the Lima Sites had provided the Hmong with an advantage over the road-bound PAVN and Pathet Lao forces. This advantage was now going to <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by road improvement and the prepositioning of supplies which allowed the communists to maintain year-round use of their lines of communication.|$|E

5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to {{the enzyme}} {{at the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of the enzyme. For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. If the money income were low, the problem could easily <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical tunneling could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which would have to <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed tunneling mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|In {{competitive}} inhibition, {{the substrate}} and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme {{at the same}} time, {{as shown in the}} figure on the right. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site. This type of inhibition can <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by sufficiently high concentrations of substrate (Vmax remains constant), i.e., by out-competing the inhibitor. However, the apparent Km will increase as it takes a higher concentration of the substrate to reach the Km point, or half the Vmax. Competitive inhibitors are often similar in structure to the real substrate (see examples below).|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom on 10 June 1940. Bordering on the Italian colony of Libya was the Kingdom of Egypt. Although a neutral country, Egypt was occupied by the British {{under the terms of}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, which allowed British military forces to occupy Egypt if the Suez Canal was threatened. A series of cross-border raids and skirmishes began on the frontier between Libya and Egypt. On 13 September 1940, an Italian force advanced across the frontier into Egypt, reaching Sidi Barrani on 16 September, where the advance was halted until logistical difficulties could <b>be</b> <b>overcome.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or metastable allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E
5|$|Lutheran theologian Rudolf Bultmann {{proposed}} that the Bible contains existential content which is expressed through mythology; Bultmann sought to find the existential truths behind the veil of mythology, a task known as 'demythologising'. Bultmann distinguished between informative language and language with personal import, the latter of which commands obedience. He believed that God interacts with humans as the divine Word, perceiving a linguistic character inherent in God, which seeks to provide humans with self-understanding. Bultmann believed that the cultural embeddedness of the Bible could <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> by demythologising the Bible, a process which he believed would allow readers to better encounter the word of God.|$|E
5|$|Pas de Calais, {{the closest}} point in {{continental}} Europe to Britain, was {{the location of}} launch sites for V-1 and V-2 rockets, then still under development. The Germans regarded it as the most likely initial landing zone, and accordingly made it the most heavily fortified region. It offered the Allies few opportunities for expansion, however, as the area is bounded by numerous rivers and canals, whereas landings on a broad front in Normandy would permit simultaneous threats against the port of Cherbourg, coastal ports further west in Brittany, and an overland attack towards Paris and eventually into Germany. Normandy was therefore chosen as the landing site. The most serious drawback of the Normandy coast—the lack of port facilities—would <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> {{through the development of}} artificial harbours.|$|E

5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom that is important for monitoring progress of the illness.

5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{obstacles}} had to <b>be</b> <b>overcome</b> in {{the handling}} of both fluorine and UF6. Before the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant could be built, it was first necessary to develop non-reactive chemical compounds {{that could be used}} as coatings, lubricants and gaskets for the surfaces which would come into contact with the UF6 gas (a highly reactive and corrosive substance). William T. Miller, professor of organic chemistry at Cornell University, was co-opted to develop such materials, because of his expertise in organofluorine chemistry. Miller and his team developed several novel non-reactive chlorofluorocarbon polymers that were used in this application.|$|E
