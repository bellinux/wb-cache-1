40|$|The {{biotechnology}} industry has grown rapidly, doubling {{in size from}} 1993 ($ 8 billion in revenue) to 1999 ($ 20 billion) (Ernst and Young LLP, 2001). Given {{the rapid growth of}} the {{biotechnology industry}}, this sector {{has been the focus of}} numerous state economic development strategies. However, the location of <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> has not been evenly dispersed in the U. S. The Ernst and Young LLP report (2001) shows that the state of California has approximately 42 percent of the nation’s <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> in 2001. However, the state of Nevada has barely one percent of the nation’s <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms.</b> It seems that agglomeration may impact the location of <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> and therefore interdependencies between <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> may impact these location decisions. Therefore the primary objective of this proposal is to estimate factors and potential interdependencies that influence the location of <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms.</b> For this paper, four locational variables that generally influence industry location will be analyzed. These traditional locational factors are taxes, public services provided, business...|$|R
40|$|This research, {{conducted}} via interviews at 32 <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms,</b> {{which provide}} rare information on actual firm interactions, elucidates {{the factors that}} influence the location and growth of the biotechnology sector in a typical American metropolitan area. Results indicate that most of the <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> within the Cincinnati region are there because of entrepreneurial ties with universities and research hospitals in the area, not because the region has specific advantages for <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> compared to other metropolitan areas of similar size. The authors find that interfirm linkages range from extremely weak to nonexistent. No specialized labor force exists to support <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms,</b> nor are there specialized infrastructure and business services. No biotechnology-dedicated government office exists. In summary, the authors see more colocation than interactive clustering of <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms,</b> implying that economic development efforts to enhance interfirm linkages are likely to be less effective than support for hospital and university research and education...|$|R

40|$|Through their websites, <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> {{communicate}} {{information about}} themselves and their products to other members of their networks. These networks {{are made up of}} an array of organisations with which <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> collaborate on product development projects, and on whom they rely for funding, and/or marketing and production. Therefore, {{it is important that the}} information communicated by firms' websites portrays them in the light they wish to be perceived by others. Despite its importance, <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms,</b> however, do not prioritise branding or the development of a brand personality. By using demonstrated content analysis methodologies, our study shows that <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> are nonetheless portraying brand personalities online, even if unintentionally. We show that, by using the same methodologies, managers in <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> can monitor and manage their firms' brand personalities to ensure that the words they communicate online present an appropriate and attractive image of the firm to their communities. We extend previous research in the area of brand personality and show its application in and importance for the biotechnology industry. <br/...|$|R

40|$|In the {{biotechnology}} industry today, {{there are many}} business models for project commercialization. These models range from independent vertical integration to certain forms of collaboration with pharmaceutical companies to complete acquisitions of projects by the big pharmaceutical companies. In this thesis, we wanted to study commercialization strategies of several biotechnology companies. We wanted to investigate the rational for commercialization decisions and the consequence of these decisions on biotechnology firms'. Thus, we conducted interviews with either founders or senior managers of business development of nine <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> to address these issues. Our results demonstrate that <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> reluctantly enter partnership agreements with pharmaceutical companies. In addition, there are delays in the negotiation process before agreements are reached, which can have negative impact on <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms.</b> Furthermore, concentration on core competencies {{and the presence of}} champions at the pharmaceutical partners are two essential elements of successful commercialization for <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms.</b> by Mouris Saghir.

40|$|Modern {{biotechnology}} is {{a driving}} force and a full grown industry in the international economy with ongoing and rapid innovations. The emphasis of this dissertation is on the valorization of red biotech, i. e. pharmaceutical and healthcare applications. Belgium has firmly established itself as an international red biotechnology country, with a world class biotechnology industry in the Flanders and Wallonia bioRegions. Developing a domestic biotechnology industry - and hence new <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> - can be influenced by regional policy. The pharmaceutical-biotechnology regional and sectoral innovation system is characterized as an international and dynamic network architecture involving numerous players engaged in drug discovery. Regional governments and dedicated public and private network organizations have supported emerging new <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> by providing critical resources and by promoting an institutional environment that has enabled partnerships between universities, highly specialized research centers, small science based academic spin-offs and corporate spin-outs and large global pharmaceutical companies. Both policy and big firms {{look at the new}} <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> from a strategic point of view. The policy objective is the emergence of new and sustainable firms in the region; the big firms objective is the filling or renewal of the pipelines of products. New <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> are both beneficiaries and targets of strategic partnering alliances with large and global (bio) pharmaceutical companies. A number of the Belgian new <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> hold a nodal position as “ most preferred partner ” with multiple alliances in dynamic R&D networks. They have a high degree of integration into global technological networks through strategic alliances. Strategic alliances and open innovation are commonly leveraged. Despite their small size and relative immaturity, some of the new <b>biotechnology</b> <b>firms</b> are able to adopt innovative business models by providing R&D and services to large biopharmaceutical companies and by cooperating with them through open innovation...|$|R
