5|$|After Spain were {{surprisingly}} {{eliminated from}} the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup by a defeat to the United States, Alonso and Spain faced South Africa in the third-place match. After 90 minutes, the game was deadlocked at 2–2, so extra time was added, where Alonso scored a free-kick in to the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> of the goal to help Spain win third.|$|E
5|$|Boucaud scored {{his first}} goal for York with a 12-yard {{shot into the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> in a 5–1 victory away to Kettering on 23 August 2011. He was handed a three-match {{suspension}} after being red carded during a 0–0 draw away to Barrow on 19 November 2011 after being adjudged by the referee to have raised his arms during the melee following the sending off of teammate Jason Walker during stoppage time. York's Conference Premier rivals Fleetwood Town made an offer for Boucaud during January 2012, which was rejected by manager Gary Mills.|$|E

5|$|Courtney {{signed a}} new two-year {{contract}} with Tamworth on 22 June 2011, keeping {{him at the}} club until the summer of 2013. On 1 January 2012, he scored his first goal for the club with a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> in a 2–2 draw with Alfreton Town. Courtney made 44 appearances and scored 1 goal in 2012–13 and won the club's Players' Player of the Year, Manager's Player of the Year and Supporter's Player of the Year awards. He made 23 appearances and scored 2 goals for Tamworth in 2013–14, which finished with the club's relegation to the Conference North, and he missed a number of matches due to hamstring problems.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{week after}} Cox's {{appointment}} as manager of Mansfield Town, Meikle followed him to the Conference Premier club on 24 May 2011 after signing a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut as a 76th-minute substitute for Matt Green in a 1–1 home draw with Bath City on 13 August 2011. His first goal for the club was the 81st-minute winner in a 3–1 away win over Barrow, which came after he paced past two defenders before he calmly finished with a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner.</b> Meikle played a vital role in Mansfield reaching the play-offs in third place, playing in both semi-final matches against York City, which the team lost 2–1 on aggregate. He finished 2011–12 with 7 goals in 47 appearances and was offered a new contract by the club in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Six {{minutes into}} the match, Ronny Johnsen fouled Bayern striker Carsten Jancker just outside the area, and Mario Basler placed a low free kick around the United wall to score the first goal. Contrary to popular belief, the free kick was not a deflection, but rather swerved into the far <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> of Peter Schmeichel's goal. Despite the bad start, United began to {{dominate}} possession but failed to create any clear cut chances despite David Beckham's tireless running. They seemed to be badly missing influential midfielders Paul Scholes and Roy Keane. The Bayern defence remained strong and well organised, as Andy Cole found out when his close-range effort was quickly closed down by three defenders. As Bayern began to look increasingly more dangerous on the counter-attack than their opponents did in possession, Jancker repeatedly tested the United back four {{with a number of}} clever runs, some of which were flagged offside.|$|E

5|$|The {{skull of}} Dinocephalosaurus {{is low and}} narrow, with a long premaxilla and maxilla {{compared}} to those of Tanystropheus. Both the premaxilla and the maxilla meet at the anteroventral (front <b>bottom)</b> <b>corner</b> {{and contribute to the}} border of the nostril, which is located at the anterior (front) end of a long recess that extends along the snout in front of the eye socket (the antorbital depression). The bottom margins of the two snout bones are respectively lined with five and twelve long and nail-like teeth; the third premaxillary and fourth and fifth maxillary teeth are distinctly fang-like. The lower jaw has fifteen preserved teeth, with three of them being fang-like. By comparison, the teeth in adult Tanystropheus are sharp pegs, while they are tricuspid (bearing three cusps) in juveniles.|$|E
5|$|United won {{a corner}} {{just as the}} fourth {{official}} indicated three minutes of injury time, and with so little time left for an equaliser, Peter Schmeichel ventured up to Bayern's penalty area. Beckham flighted the corner in just over Schmeichel's head, Dwight Yorke put the ball back towards the crowded area, and after Thorsten Fink failed to clear sufficiently, the ball arrived {{at the feet of}} Ryan Giggs {{on the edge of the}} area. His right-footed snap-shot was weak and poorly struck, but it went straight to Sheringham, who swiped at the shot with his right foot, and nestled the ball in the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> of the net. The goal was timed at 90+0:36'. It looked as if, having been behind for most of the match, United had forced extra time.|$|E
5|$|Barrett {{signed for}} Ebbsfleet's Conference Premier rivals York City on a free {{transfer}} on 29 June 2009. He made his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Oxford on 8 August 2009, before scoring his first {{goal for the}} club with the opener in a 1–1 draw with Luton Town on 20 October with {{a shot in the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>corner.</b> He scored the opening goal in a 3–1 defeat to Premier League team Stoke City in the FA Cup third round on 2 January 2010, with a header from an Alex Lawless free kick. He picked up a hamstring injury during March 2010, missing one match before making his return in a 1–0 victory over Mansfield Town later that month. He played in both legs of York's play-off semi-final victory over Luton, which finished 2–0 on aggregate. He signed a new one-year contract with York on 13 May 2010. He started in the 2010 Conference Premier play-off Final at Wembley Stadium on 16 May, being substituted on 81 minutes, with York losing 3–1 to Oxford. He finished 2009–10 with 51 appearances and five goals for York.|$|E

5|$|Mills {{took over}} as player-manager at King's Lynn in September 1998 and was sent off on his playing debut, a 3–2 away defeat to Worcester City in the Southern League Premier Division on 26 September. His first goal for the club came after {{shooting}} into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> from a Lee Wilson back-heel in a 3–3 home draw with Salisbury City on 6 March 1999. He made 30 appearances and scored one goal in 1998–99, as his team finished 10th in the Southern League Premier Division. King's Lynn improved on their league performance in 1999–2000, finishing in fifth place in the table. Mills continued to appear frequently in the team, playing in 34 matches and scoring one goal. He resigned as King's Lynn manager on 8 November 2000 due to major financial problems at the club, and had made 16 appearances and scored one goal {{up to that point}} in 2000–01. He returned to playing just three days later by signing for Football Conference club Boston United, making his debut the same day in a 2–2 home draw with Scarborough.|$|E
5|$|The New Year {{began with}} a second defeat of the season to Burton, this time being beaten 3–1 at home, in which Brodie scored {{in the first half}} with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. Wrexham defender Kyle Critchell was signed on a one-month loan, who Foyle knew while he was a coach at the club. Adam Smith {{returned}} to Gainsborough following the conclusion of his loan, while a permanent move had been stalled as Gainsborough were holding out for a fee. Progression to the third round of the FA Trophy was ensured with a 2–1 away victory over Oxford, with goals from McBreen and Brodie. Further signings from Wrexham took place when striker Simon Brown and midfielder Christian Smith signed on loan and permanently respectively. Hirst was released having failed to break into the first team. Lewes were beaten 3–0 at home; Brodie opened the scoring with a volley into the top corner from outside the penalty area, and Christian Smith scored from 30yards before Brodie finished the scoring with a low shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner.</b> Henderson was released having fallen out of the reckoning for a first-team place.|$|E
5|$|York {{achieved}} {{their first}} away win {{of the season}} after beating bottom-of-the-table Newport County 3–0. Berrett opened the scoring {{in the first half}} with a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner,</b> and in the second half Thompson scored a header before Oliver scored with a close-range finish. York drew 2–2 away to Stevenage, and took the lead in the 39th minute with a Nolan shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. Chris Whelpdale and Charlie Lee scored for Stevenage in quick succession early in the second half, and Summerfield equalised with a curling shot on 74 minutes, before Flinders saved a late Brett Williams penalty. Striker Rhys Turner joined on a one-month loan from Oldham Athletic, and made his debut in York's 2–2 home draw with Carlisle United. York were 2–0 down at half-time, before Oliver was sent off for an off-the-ball incident early in the second half. However, within a two-minute period, Summerfield scored a penalty and Carson converted an Emile Sinclair cross to bring the score to 2–2.|$|E

5|$|Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month {{loan from}} Oxford, as {{cover for the}} injured Nolan and Summerfield. Michael Coulson scored with a low shot to give York a 50th-minute lead at home to Cambridge United, and John McCombe scored four minutes later with a curling shot to make the score 2–0. However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, before hitting the ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E
5|$|York {{moved to}} being nine points from safety after drawing 1–1 {{at home to}} Orient, in which York {{took the lead in}} the 17th minute when Fewster {{converted}} Summerfield's cross from threeyards. Boyle was sent off on 74 minutes after receiving a second yellow card for diving, before Orient equalised a minute later through Lloyd James. Sinclair's loan at Guiseley was extended {{to the end of the}} season. York moved closer to relegation after a 1–1 home draw with Wycombe, which left them nine points from safety with five fixtures remaining. York took the lead when Oliver scored his first goal since December 2015 with a 10-yard shot into <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> on 35 minutes, before Matt Bloomfield equalised for Wycombe in the 88th minute. Alessandra's loan was extended to the end of the season, after scoring once in six appearances. York were left on the verge of relegation from League Two after a 2–1 away defeat to Hartlepool, with the team 11 points adrift of safety with four fixtures remaining. York went behind on 24 minutes to Nathan Thomas's goal, and 11 minutes later Winfield was sent off for a second yellow card. Cameron equalised for York in first-half stoppage time with a header from Summerfield's corner, before Michael Woods scored Hartlepool's winning goal on 72 minutes.|$|E
5|$|York {{were beaten}} 3–2 away by Leyton Orient, {{who took a}} two-goal lead through Mathieu Baudry and Jay Simpson before Oliver {{equalised}} in first-half stoppage time. Orient restored their two-goal advantage through Simpson in the second half, and Oliver scored a consolation goal with a header in the 86th minute. York were beaten 6–0 away by Portsmouth, in which Greening was sent off before half-time for catching Michael Doyle with his elbow, before Ben Davies and Marc McNulty gave the home team the lead {{early in the second}} half. McNulty scored two more goals before Ben Tollitt and Conor Chaplin finished the scoring for Portsmouth; this result saw York drop into the relegation zone {{for the first time in}} 2015–16. York signed five players before the deadline for loan transfers: defenders Mark Kitching from Middlesbrough and Stefan O'Connor from Arsenal, midfielders Jordan Lussey from Bolton Wanderers and Kenny McEvoy from Tottenham Hotspur, and striker Bradley Fewster from Middlesbrough. Winger Danny Galbraith, released by Gillingham at the end of last season, was signed before the deadline for free transfers. Collins, Morris, Turner and Tutonda were sent back to their parent clubs. York suffered another heavy defeat after losing 5–1 at home to Accrington, who were two goals up at half-time with goals from Matty Pearson and Billy Kee. Josh Windass scored a penalty for Accrington after O'Connor tripped Tom Davies, and Kee scored their fourth before Fewster scored for York with a shot into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner</b> on 75 minutes. Shay McCartan finished the scoring for Accrington late into the match, and the result meant York equalled a club record of eight straight defeats.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Carrick for the second season in a row was a shock starter at Wembley for the 2011 FA Community Shield. After {{initially}} being ruled out through injury by Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the pre-match build up, Carrick was named in the starting eleven for the game on 7 August 2011. In the first half, United fell behind to a Joleon Lescott header and a long range Edin Džeko strike to trail 2–0 at half time. Carrick was then substituted at the interval and replaced by youngster Tom Cleverley. However United went on to turn the game around and prevail 3–2 winners. The day after the Shield match, Carrick pulled out of England's friendly match against the Netherlands to rest a niggling injury. He was replaced in the squad by Tom Cleverley. On 18 December, Carrick scored his first goal for United for 70 games when he advanced from his own half of the pitch after cutting out Joey Barton's square ball, past a couple of defenders and firing low past the keeper. He eventually won the Man of the Match award. On 4 January 2012, Carrick played his 250th match for Manchester United in all competitions in a 3–0 away defeat to Newcastle United. He celebrated his Jubilee in a 3–2 away victory against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the FA Cup third round. On 14 January 2012, Carrick scored for United in a 3–0 home win against Bolton. In the 83rd minute, Carrick notched his first goal at Old Trafford since January 2010. He curled a left-footed effort past Ádám Bogdán into the <b>bottom</b> <b>corner.</b> On 16 February 2012, in a Europa League 2–0 away win against Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena, Carrick played his 500th match in all competitions. Carrick also showed his class when he thundered a shot from 30 yards against the post in a 2–0 win against QPR on 8 April.|$|E
