5|$|Indonesian {{law does}} not require that arrested people be {{immediately}} charged with an offence, and by 22 April 2005 no charges had yet been laid. Police indicated that the five arrested at the airport would <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> drug trafficking, which carries the death penalty, while those arrested in the hotel would <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the lesser offence of drug possession, which carries a maximum penalty of ten years' imprisonment. It was suggested that Andrew Chan recruited the other eight to act as drug mules – couriers who would not arouse suspicion while carrying heroin to Australia – and offered them A$10,000 to A$15,000 each {{to carry out this}} task, and given A$5000 spending cash.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a Yemen Congress of fifty, representing all factions, which would <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> forming a transitional regime and establishing procedures for a national plebiscite to determine Yemen's future government.|$|E
5|$|In November, {{the three}} {{principal}} Bundy investigators—Jerry Thompson from Utah, Robert Keppel from Washington, and Michael Fisher from Colorado—met and exchanged information with 30 detectives and prosecutors from five states in Aspen, Colorado. While officials left the meeting (later {{known as the}} Aspen Summit) convinced that Bundy was the murderer they sought, they agreed that more hard evidence would be needed before he could <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> any of the murders.|$|E
50|$|Eight of the Lakonias {{officers}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> negligence. Captain Zarbis, {{his first}} officer and the ship’s security officer <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> gross negligence. The other five men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> simple negligence.|$|R
25|$|On Monday, 2 May 1983, both Larson and Lee <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Swift's murder. They <b>were</b> also <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the {{unlawful}} imprisonment of Anita Charlotte Swift and Paul Andrew Swift, {{and having}} committed a robbery while {{armed with a}} rifle. Prior to the trial, the unlawful imprisonment <b>charges</b> <b>were</b> dropped, and both men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> murder and both <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> armed robbery.|$|R
25|$|The {{three men}} <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{involvement}} in 29 separate incidents, including 21 murders and eight more attacks where victims survived. Suprunyuk <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 27 of the cases, including 21 counts of capital murder, eight armed robberies, and {{one count of}} animal cruelty. Sayenko <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 25 instances, including 18 murders, five robberies and one count of animal cruelty. Hanzha <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> two counts of armed robbery stemming from a 1 March 2007 incident in Dniprodzerzhynsk.|$|R
5|$|Police re-opened {{the murder}} inquiry in 1992 {{and again in}} 2003. Ten men were arrested in 2010 on {{suspicion}} of murder, and in 2013 one of them, Nicholas Jacobs, became the seventh person to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Blakelock's murder, based largely on evidence gathered during the 1992 inquiry. He {{was found not guilty}} in April 2014.|$|E
5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody was going to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} for the case to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking for the case to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, {{they would not be}} investigating the matter.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{offers several}} iPad accessories, {{most of which}} are {{adapters}} for the proprietary 30-pin dock connector, the iPad's only port besides the headphone jack. A dock holds the iPad upright at an angle, and has a dock connector and audio line-out port. Each generation of iPad requires a corresponding dock. A dock that included a physical keyboard was only supported for the original iPad, but all generations are compatible with Bluetooth keyboards that also work with Macs and PCs. The iPad can <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a 10 W standalone power adapter, which is also compatible with iPods and iPhones.|$|E
50|$|Seven men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{first-degree murder}} and home {{invasion}} robbery, and an eighth suspect <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> being an accessory after the fact.|$|R
50|$|Martin, a 15-year veteran {{with the}} police department, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{conspiracy}} to distribute cocaine. Blythe, with three years of service, <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> transferring a firearm.Bell, Jones and Middlebrook <b>were</b> all <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> conspiracy to distribute cocaine, and Middlebrook for Money Laundering.|$|R
50|$|Two teenage men, James O'Connor and Gavin Alker, <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the murder. Christopher Douglas <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> witness {{intimidation}} {{in relation to}} the case.|$|R
5|$|In 1969, the Kosovar Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a red star, since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation. Even without this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a red star, outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E
5|$|On August 26, 2008, a {{government}} working group presented New Brunswick Education Minister Kelly Lamrock with eight recommendations for extracurricular transportation. The recommendations included that guidelines for transporting students to school-related extracurricular activities be strengthened, that {{a school bus}} be used when transporting ten or more students, that vehicles be equipped with snow tires if travelling between October 15 and April 30, and that the district superintendent <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> responsibility for ensuring safe transportation of students to and from extracurricular activities. Lamrock initially suggested that schools voluntarily follow the recommendations, though they were later made into enforceable policy.|$|E
5|$|According to Daniel Domscheit-Berg, {{a former}} WikiLeaks spokesperson, {{part of the}} WikiLeaks {{security}} concept was {{that they did not}} know who their sources were. The New York Times wrote in December 2010 that the U.S. government was trying to discover whether Assange had been a passive recipient of material from Manning, or had encouraged or helped her to extract the files; if the latter, Assange could <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> conspiracy. Manning told Lamo in May 2010 that she had developed a working relationship with Assange, communicating directly with him using an encrypted Internet conferencing service, but knew little about him. WikiLeaks did not identify Manning as their source. Army investigators found pages of chats on Manning's computer between Manning and someone believed to be Julian Assange. Nicks writes that, despite this, no decisive evidence was found of Assange's offering Manning any direction.|$|E
50|$|According to BBC, {{police in}} Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport {{have participated in}} a series of these scams, robbing {{tourists}} of thousands of dollars each time. A British couple <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing a wallet, an Irish woman <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing eye-liner, and an Australian man <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> stealing a doughnut, all in July 2009.|$|R
50|$|In December 1996, Darin Mazzarella <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the 1994 {{murder of}} Louis Balancio and Anthony Santorelli <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{throwing}} the bloody clothes into the dumpster.|$|R
50|$|Moscatiello and Ferrari <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> first-degree murder, {{conspiracy}} to commit murder, and solicitation to commit murder. Fiorillo <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> first-degree murder and {{conspiracy to}} commit murder.|$|R
5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting {{that he had been}} neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|However, the court's {{role was}} to rule on whether {{publication}} was legal, not whether it was wise. In keeping with the usual practice of keeping {{a temporary restraining order}} in effect for as short a time as possible, Warren ordered that hearings be held on a preliminary injunction in one week's time, on March 16. At the request of both parties, this was postponed to March 26 so they would have time to file their briefs and affidavits. The parties were therefore back in court again on March 26 for a hearing on the government's request for a preliminary injunction. Warren decided not to hold an evidentiary hearing at which the opposing teams of experts could be cross examined. He also declined a suggestion by the Federation of American Scientists in its amicus curiae brief that a panel of experts <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> examining the issue. The case relied on written affidavits and briefs, and the opposing counsels' oral arguments.|$|E
50|$|No {{one else}} <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> the bombings, or {{supplying}} the material; three police officers <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> conspiracy to pervert {{the course of}} justice, and found not guilty.|$|R
50|$|The {{three men}} who gave sworn {{statements}} were Veverka, Hanlon and Meier. Hanlon <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> felonies, while Veverka <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a civil rights violation, but was acquitted.|$|R
50|$|The men <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> rape, and Morgan <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{aiding and}} abetting the others to commit rape. He <b>was</b> not <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> rape {{because at the time}} it was {{believed}} that a husband has an absolute defence in law by virtue of being married to the victim.|$|R
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
5|$|In June 1893, {{when the}} Australasian Federal League was formed {{at a meeting}} in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined {{immediately}} and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 Bathurst Conference, informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the Australian Natives' Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all other}} US states, New Jersey sets a 0.08 percent {{weight by volume}} blood alcohol content (BAC) as the {{threshold}} for intoxication when operating a motor vehicle (e.g. automobile, boat). It is possible to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{driving under the influence}} (DUI) with a BAC level below 0.08%, but there is a presumption in that situation that the driver is not intoxicated. State law prohibits those under 21 from driving if their BAC is 0.01% or more, prohibits the operation of a commercial vehicle with a BAC of 0.04% or more, and mandates that drivers submit a breath sample if requested by a police officer. To be convicted of DUI in New Jersey, a person must be operating or attempting to operate a motorized vehicle; thus activities such as sleeping in a car while intoxicated or bicycling while drunk are not illegal.|$|E
50|$|In January 2006, KSS members Edward Robert Locke and Todd Clair Sager <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> {{multiple}} {{counts in}} connection with a violent bar fight in March 2005 in New Stanton. Police claim Locke stabbed two men. Locke <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> attempted homicide and four counts of aggravated assault while Sager <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> criminal solicitation to commit homicide and criminal solicitation to commit aggravated assault.|$|R
50|$|Fitzgerald's {{report was}} {{submitted}} on 3 July 1989. Based on the inquiry's final report, {{a number of}} high-profile politicians <b>were</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> crimes; notably Queensland Police Commissioner (Sir) Terry Lewis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> corruption.|$|R
50|$|Armenian-Turkish writer, Sevan Nişanyan, <b>is</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 58 {{weeks in}} jail for an alleged insult to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad in a blog post, under similar charges to those Fazil Say <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with.</b>|$|R
5|$|The iPad uses an {{internal}} rechargeable lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) battery. The batteries {{are made in}} Taiwan by Simplo Technology (60%) and Dynapack International Technology. The iPad is designed to <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> a high current of 2 amperes using the included 10 W USB power adapter and USB cord with a USB connector {{at one end and}} a 30-pin dock connector at the other end. While it can be charged by a standard USB port from a computer, these are limited to 500 milliamperes (0.5 amps). As a result, if the iPad is running while powered by a normal USB computer port, it may charge very slowly, or not at all. High-power USB ports found in newer Apple computers and accessories provide full charging capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will <b>be</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
50|$|Monis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> 12 counts under s 471.12 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. In addition, Amirah Droudis <b>was</b> <b>charged</b> <b>with</b> eight {{counts of}} {{aiding and abetting}} Monis in the {{commission}} of those offences.|$|R
