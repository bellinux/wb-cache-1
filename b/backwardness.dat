5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{cause of}} Argentina’s historical <b>backwardness</b> {{appears to be}} its institutional framework. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the}} most stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable.|$|E
5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader who always wore a suit and tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian <b>backwardness</b> of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
5|$|While the {{merchant}} marine was technologically outdated, and slower {{than that of}} the First World, it still attracted a consistent volume of cargo. The reason for the technological <b>backwardness</b> of {{the merchant}} marine were First World induced boycotts of Soviet shipping. This led the Soviet Union to become isolated from the international shipping industry, and skip over such important innovations as shipping containers. Under Mikhail Gorbachev's rule the Soviet Union became the largest buyer of new ships in the world. Because of the size of its navy, the Soviet Government advocated for the traditional freedoms of the sea.|$|E
5|$|In general, 20th-century historians from Palestine and the Arab world, and Palestinian and Arab nationalists, communists and leftists of all stripes, held a {{negative}} {{view of the}} Ottoman era, which they associated with <b>backwardness,</b> corruption and tyranny. According to historian Adel Manna, this uniformly negative perception of the Ottomans and the high regard for Muhammad Ali as a modernizer and a liberator of Arab lands from the Ottomans, which he sought to unite under his rule, influenced the later historiography of the 1834 revolt. Another factor that influenced the historians of the 20th century was the limited availability of primary sources from Palestine {{at the time of}} the revolt. Most primary Arabic accounts of the events were kept by Egypt's bureaucracy at the time. Other accounts were from European travelers or consuls in the area, while there were no known written 19th-century accounts by people living in Palestine's towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting a new revolutionary {{era in the}} European history {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating the corruption of the church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome <b>backwardness</b> and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time.|$|E
5|$|Young Bosnia's activists {{regarded}} {{literature as}} indispensable to revolution, {{and most of}} them wrote poems, short stories, or critiques. Stojanović wrote poems, and read the works of Petar Kočić, Aleksa Šantić, Vladislav Petković Dis, Sima Pandurović, Milan Rakić, and later the works of Russian authors. In his final years at the gymnasium, he read Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, Bakunin, Nietzsche, Jaurès, Le Bon, Ibsen, and Marinetti. National Unity held meetings at which its members presented lectures and discussed current issues concerning the Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. All members of the association were Serbs. Generally, Stojanović's lectures were about educating people on practical issues of health and the economy. During the summer break of 1911, Stojanović travelled across Bosanska Krajina lecturing in villages. One of the aims of Young Bosnia was to eliminate the <b>backwardness</b> of their country.|$|E
5|$|Gathering, {{hunting and}} fishing were still {{essential}} as sources of food and materials such as hide or fur. The forest was also exploited {{as a source of}} building materials such as wood. In addition, wild forest bees were kept there, and the forest {{could be used as a}} place of refuge. Until the 9th century, the population was separated from the main centers of civilization and self-sufficient with primitive, local community and household-based manufacturing. Specialized craftsmen existed only in the fields of iron extraction from ore and processing, and pottery; the few luxury items used were imports. From the 7th century on, modestly decorated ceramics were made with the potter's wheel. 7th– to 9th-century collections of objects have been found in Bonikowo and Bruszczewo, Kościan County (iron spurs, knives, clay containers with some ornamentation) and in the Kraków-Nowa Huta region (weapons and utensils in Pleszów and Mogiła), among other places. Slavic warriors were traditionally armed with spears, bows and wooden shields. Axes were used later, and still swords of the types popular throughout 7th– to 9th-century Europe were also used. Independent of distant powers, the Slavic tribes in Poland lived a relatively undisturbed life, but at the cost of some <b>backwardness</b> in civilization.|$|E
25|$|Though right-wing {{scholars}} (e.g. Paul Hollander) {{have given}} prominence {{to the role}} that religiosity, culture and <b>backwardness</b> play in inflaming anti-Americanism in the region, the poll noted that radicalism among Arabs or Muslims isn't correlated with poverty, <b>backwardness</b> or religiosity. Radicals were in fact shown to be better educated and wealthier than 'moderates'.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Muslim {{violence}} is planned and executed to render Muslims economically and socially crippled and, {{as a final}} outcome of that economic and social <b>backwardness,</b> assimilating them into lower rungs of Hindu society.|$|E
25|$|The February 1917 revolution...grew out of prewar {{political}} and economic instability, technological <b>backwardness,</b> and fundamental social divisions, coupled with gross mismanagement of the war effort, continuing military defeats, domestic economic dislocation, and outrageous scandals surrounding the monarchy.|$|E
25|$|Tegucigalpa's {{economic}} {{challenges are}} tied {{to those of the}} rest of the country, such as overcoming crime, anomalies in the judicial system, educational <b>backwardness,</b> and deficient infrastructure in order to continue to encourage foreign investors and permit growth of local entrepreneurs.|$|E
25|$|Russia's {{great power}} status {{obscured}} the inefficiency of its government, {{the isolation of}} its people, and its economic <b>backwardness.</b> Following the defeat of Napoleon, Alexander I was willing to discuss constitutional reforms, and though a few were introduced, no thoroughgoing changes were attempted.|$|E
25|$|Chikmagalur {{district}} unfortunately has {{not made}} good progress in terms of Industrial Development. Inadequate infrastructure, poor roads, poor rail network and investors preferring non-industrial ventures over industrial ones are quoted {{as some of the}} reasons for the <b>backwardness</b> of Industrial Development in this district.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia Beyer {{explains}} how terrorism increased {{as a response}} to past and present military intervention and occupation, as well as to 'structural violence'. Structural violence, in this instance, refers to economic conditions of <b>backwardness</b> which are attributed to the economic policies of the Western nations, the United States in particular.|$|E
25|$|Ruined by war, pestilence, famine, and unpaid foreign indemnities, Paraguay was on {{the verge}} of {{disintegration}} in 1870. Its fertile soil and the country's overall <b>backwardness</b> helped it survive. Paraguay's mostly rural populace continued to subsist as it had done for centuries, eking out a meager existence under difficult conditions.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{criticism}} {{of the role of}} the Church in society, especially the fraier and nun monasteries. These laws sought to limit excessive economic power of some brotherhoods, their large number, the lack of administrative and fiscal control by the authorities and public manifestations of piety, the latter listed as signs of <b>backwardness</b> and fanaticism, especially those of Holy Week.|$|E
25|$|The {{one major}} {{weakness}} and <b>backwardness</b> of the Commonwealth defenses {{was the lack}} of significant system of modern fortifications throughout most of its territory, which allowed the invading armies to inflict damage disproportionate to military effort. The exceptions were the mouth of the Vistula region and the south-east, where there were powerful, even if neglected fortresses, such as the Kamieniec Podolski (Kamianets-Podilskyi) Castle.|$|E
25|$|Murgescu was {{survived by}} his wife, Ecaterina Oproiu, {{who went on to}} serve as a Presidential {{appointee}} on a visual media regulatory agency, the National Audiovisual Council, between 1992 and 2000. Murgescu's nephew, Bogdan Murgescu, also trained in economic history, and achieved notoriety for his analysis of economic <b>backwardness.</b> He credits Costin Murgescu as an early influence on his own work.|$|E
25|$|The {{censorship}} of books was actually very ineffective, and prohibited books circulated in Spain without significant problems. The Spanish Inquisition never persecuted scientists, and relatively few scientific books {{were placed on}} the Index. On the other hand, Spain was a state with more political freedom than in other absolute monarchies in the 16th to 18th centuries. The <b>backwardness</b> of Spain in economy and science may not be attributable to the Inquisition.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{impact of}} civil strife and foreign interventions had doomed Honduras {{to a position}} of relative economic and social <b>backwardness</b> throughout the nineteenth century. The country had remained overwhelmingly rural; Tegucigalpa, Comayagua, and San Pedro Sula were the only towns of any size. In the early 1850s, the total population was estimated at 350,000, the overwhelming majority of whom were mestizos. By 1914 the population had grown to only 562,000.|$|E
25|$|Catherine held western European philosophies {{and culture}} {{close to her}} heart, {{and she wanted to}} {{surround}} herself with like-minded people within Russia. She believed a 'new kind of person' could be created by inculcating Russian children with European education. Catherine believed education could change {{the hearts and minds of}} the Russian people and turn them away from <b>backwardness.</b> This meant developing individuals both intellectually and morally, providing them knowledge and skills, and fostering a sense of civic responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Georgescu engaged {{himself in}} {{politics}} and joined the pro-monarchy National Peasants' Party. The country's economy was still underdeveloped and had a large agrarian base, where {{the mass of the}} peasantry lived in <b>backwardness</b> and poverty. Substantial land reforms were called for if the most appalling inequalities between the rural and the urban parts of the population were to be evened out. Georgescu put a persuasive effort into this work and was soon elevated to the higher ranks of the party, becoming member of the party's National Council.|$|E
25|$|The country's {{system of}} {{education}} was highly centralized and universally {{accessible to all}} citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural <b>backwardness.</b> However, {{as part of the}} general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations. The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary. According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} Assam today {{represents}} a unique juxtaposition of <b>backwardness</b> amidst plenty. Despite its rich natural resources, and supplying {{of up to}} 25% of India's petroleum needs, Assam’s growth rate has not kept pace with that of India; the difference has increased rapidly since the 1970s. The Indian economy grew at 6% per annum over the period of 1981 to 2000; {{the growth rate of}} Assam was only 3.3%. In the Sixth Plan period, Assam experienced a negative growth rate of 3.78% when India's was positive at 6%. In the post-liberalised era (after 1991), the difference widened further.|$|E
25|$|The end of Cádiz's {{monopoly}} of trade with America {{brought about a}} rebirth of Spanish manufactures. Most notable was the rapidly growing textile industry of Catalonia which by the mid-1780s saw {{the first signs of}} industrialization. This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in Barcelona. This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood {{in stark contrast to the}} relative <b>backwardness</b> of most of the country. Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as Cuba, with its plantations, and a renewed growth of precious metals mining in America.|$|E
25|$|This wave {{started in}} the middle of the twentieth century and was {{characterized}} by the hope to achieve al-Nahda via rapid radical changes. Its theorists criticized the previous gradual approach as futile. They thought that the Arab world was held back from progress by two major forces: foreign colonialism and local tyranny. Thus, they supported national liberation movements and revolutions. To them, revolution was the only way to overcome the <b>backwardness</b> of the Arab world. The Western world was no more a model to follow, instead Third World counties that resisted imperialism such as Vietnam and Cuba became the models.|$|E
25|$|In February 1967, the {{authorities}} launched a violent campaign to extinguish religious life in Albania, claiming that religion had divided the Albanian nation {{and kept it}} mired in <b>backwardness.</b> Student agitators combed the countryside, forcing Albanians to quit practicing their faith. Despite complaints, even by APL members, all churches, mosques, monasteries, and other religious institutions were closed or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, and workshops by year's end. A special decree abrogated the charters by which the country's main religious communities had operated. The campaign culminated in an announcement that Albania had become the world's first atheistic state, a feat trumpeted as one of Enver Hoxha's greatest achievements.|$|E
25|$|After {{the initial}} 1936 ban on hijab in Iran, {{the rules of}} dress code were relaxed, and after Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 the {{compulsory}} element in the policy of unveiling was abandoned. According to Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, between 1941 and 1979, wearing hijab was no longer offensive, but still considered {{it to be a}} real hindrance to climbing the social ladder, a badge of <b>backwardness</b> and a marker of class. A headscarf, let alone the chador, prejudiced the chances of advancement in work and society not only of working women but also of men, who were increasingly expected to appear with their wives at social functions.|$|E
25|$|This period {{marked the}} start of another open {{conflict}} between Xenopol and the Junimists: the former took over {{as editor of the}} PNL mouthpiece Voința Națională, and began publishing essays denouncing the <b>backwardness</b> of Junimist ideology. By October 1886, Xenopol even sided with Junimeas Marxist adversaries at Contemporanul, and allowed Marxist leader Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea to publish anti-Maiorescu pieces in Voința Națională. He collected such articles, adding his own, into the brochure Contrazicerile d-lui T. Maiorescu ("Mr. T. Maiorescu's Contradictions"). During 1885, Xenopol also directed the antisemitic campaign against the Alliance Israélite Universelle, with unsigned articles {{which may or may not}} have been written by Caragiale.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{was ordered}} home by London as the Foreign Office was not {{comfortable}} with the idea of him commanding the Chinese Army against Russia if war should break out, believing that this would cause an Anglo-Russian war and Gordon was told that he would be dishonorably discharged if he remained in China. Though the Qing court rejected Gordon's advice to seek a compromise with Russia in the summer of 1880, Gordon's assessment of China's military <b>backwardness</b> and his stark warnings that the Russians would win if a war did break out {{played an important role in}} ultimately strengthening the peace party at the court and preventing war.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{estimate}} is that over 200,000 Scotch-Irish migrated to the Americas between 1717 and 1775. As a late arriving group, they found that land in the coastal areas of the British colonies was either already owned or too expensive, so they quickly left for the more mountainous interior where land could be obtained cheaply. Here they lived on the first frontier of America. Early frontier life was extremely challenging, but poverty and hardship were familiar to them. The term hillbilly has often been applied to their descendants in the mountains, carrying connotations of poverty, <b>backwardness</b> and violence; this word has its origins in Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Although several Eastern bloc {{countries}} had attempted some abortive, limited {{economic and political}} reform since the 1950s (e.g. the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and Prague Spring of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet apparatchiks, led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of Brezhnev stagnation. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits {{to make up for}} its increasing <b>backwardness.</b> The costs of maintaining its military, the KGB, subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund Soviet economy.|$|E
25|$|Jagjivan Ram {{passed his}} {{matriculation}} {{in the first}} division and joined the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in 1927, where {{he was awarded the}} Birla scholarship, and passed his Inter Science Examination; while at BHU, he organised the scheduled castes to protest against social discrimination. As a Dalit student, he was denied basic services like meals in his hostel and haircuts by local barbers. A Dalit barber would arrive occasionally to trim his hair. Eventually, Jagjivan left BHU and continued his education at Calcutta University. The incidents in BHU turned him into an atheist. In 2007, the BHU set up a Babu Jagjivan Ram Chair in its faculty of social sciences to study caste discrimination and economic <b>backwardness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medieval writers often {{assumed that}} paganus as a {{religious}} term {{was a result of}} the conversion patterns during the Christianization of Europe, where people in towns and cities were converted more readily than those in remote regions, where old ways lingered. However, this idea has multiple problems. First, the word's usage as a reference to non-Christians pre-dates that period in history. Second, paganism within the Roman Empire centred on cities. The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during Early Christianity. Third, unlike words such as , paganus had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured <b>backwardness)</b> used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.|$|E
