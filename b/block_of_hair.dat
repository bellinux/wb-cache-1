40|$|The {{fundamental}} fracture {{mechanisms of}} biological protein materials remain largely unknown, in part, {{because of a}} lack of understanding of how individual protein building blocks respond to mechanical load. For instance, it remains controversial whether the free energy landscape of the unfolding behavior of proteins consists of multiple, discrete transition states or the location of the transition state changes continuously with the pulling velocity. This lack in understanding has thus far prevented us from developing predictive strength models of protein materials. Here, we report direct atomistic simulation that over four orders of magnitude in time scales of the unfolding behavior of α-helical (AH) and β-sheet (BS) domains, the key building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>hair,</b> hoof, and wool as well as spider silk, amyloids, and titin. We find that two discrete transition states corresponding to two fracture mechanisms exist. Whereas the unfolding mechanism at fast pulling rates is sequential rupture of individual hydrogen bonds (HBs), unfolding at slow pulling rates proceeds by simultaneous rupture of several HBs. We derive the hierarchical Bell model, a theory that explicitly considers the hierarchical architecture of proteins, providing a rigorous structure–property relationship. We exemplify our model in a study of AHs, and show that 3 – 4 parallel HBs per turn are favorable in light of the protein's mechanical and thermodynamical stability, in agreement with experimental findings that AHs feature 3. 6 HBs per turn. Our results provide evidence that the molecular structure of AHs maximizes its robustness at minimal use of building materials...|$|R
40|$|A TPCA-based, three-marker {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to demonstrate that the dimeric benzothiazolylthiazinoisoquinoline units recently identiﬁed in natural and synthetic pheomelanins are dominant structural building <b>blocks</b> <b>of</b> red human <b>hair</b> pheomelanin. This ﬁnding would prompt a revisit of pheomelanin build-up in terms of coupling of carboxylated benzothiazine intermediates into a speciﬁc BT-TIQ-related dimeric building block preceding further polymerization. Thus, BT-TIQ would reproduce all of the main chemical properties and spectral features of human pheomelanin. In this sense, BTTIQ compares to none of the low molecular weight intermediates so far isolated, including the trichochromes, and should, therefore, be duly considered in future models of pheomelanin structure...|$|R
40|$|Planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) signaling {{is essential}} in determining the polarity of cells within the plane of an epithelial sheet. Core PCP genes have been recently shown to control the global polarization <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> follicles in mice. Fuz, a homologue of the Drosophila PCP effector gene, fuzzy, is critical in ciliogenesis in vertebrates, and {{is required for the}} development of a wide range of organs in mice. Here, we report that disruption of the Fuz gene in mice severely <b>blocked</b> the development <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> follicles in the skin. In contrast to the loss <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> follicle polarization in mice deficient in core PCP genes, hair follicles in mice lacking the Fuz gene retained their typical anterior–posterior orientation. We show that disruption of Fuz impaired the formation of primary cilia and the hedgehog signaling pathway in the skin. In addition, using skin grafts and skin reconstitution assays we demonstrate that the expression of Fuz is required in both epidermal and dermal cells and that the formation of primary cilia is a cell-autonomous process that does not require cross talk between the epithelia and mesenchymal compartments during hair follicle formation...|$|R
40|$|During the <b>hair</b> cycle <b>of</b> {{adult male}} Walter Reed Swiss mice, autoradiographic studies of RNA {{metabolism}} {{were made in}} conjunction with actinomycin D, an inhibitor of DNA-directed RNA synthesis. In control animals, the synthesis of RNA reaches its maximum in mid-anagen, and decreases after the 17 th day to nil on the 18 th and 19 th day <b>of</b> the <b>hair</b> cycle. Subsequently, there is a sharp rise in RNA synthesis {{at the end of}} Catagen without a corresponding increase in DNA synthesis. When administered in early anagen, actinomycin D has the greatest inhibitory effect upon RNA synthesis. In mid-anagen, the effect is less and it is least when given after the induction of catagen. Although actinomycin D <b>blocks</b> keratinization <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> in early anagen, it does not block the formation at the catagen follicle with its encapsulated club hair, club hair formation occurs in the hypodermis as the upward movement of the catagen follicle is suppressed. These findings suggest that the production <b>of</b> <b>hair</b> in mid-anagen and club hair formation in catagen. Short-lived m-RNA molecules appear to be responsible for the upward movement of the catagen follicle. Furthermore, RNA molecules responsible for the downward growth of the follicles appear to be produced around the 3 rd day. The long-lived mRNA molecules responsible for keratinization in mid anagen appear to be produced between the fifth and 8 th day after plucking while those responsible for club hair formation in catagen appear to be produced around the 16 th day <b>of</b> the <b>hair</b> cycle. Long lived m- 4 NA molecules are produced in the residual bub matrix cells of the catagen follicle between the 17 th and 18 th day <b>of</b> the <b>hair</b> cycle. It is suggested that these molecules remain in the residual bulb matrix cells of the telogen follicle throughout its quiescence, and may be responsible for hair growth induction in the subsequent wave.
