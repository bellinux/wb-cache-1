5|$|The <b>Bribery</b> Act 2010 (c.23) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{that covers}} the {{criminal}} law relating to <b>bribery.</b> Introduced to Parliament in the Queen's Speech in 2009 after several decades of reports and draft bills, the Act received the Royal Assent on 8 April 2010 following cross-party support. Initially scheduled to enter into force in April 2010, this was changed to 1 July 2011. The Act repeals all previous statutory and common law provisions in relation to <b>bribery,</b> instead replacing them with the crimes of <b>bribery,</b> being bribed, the <b>bribery</b> of foreign public officials, {{and the failure of}} a commercial organisation to prevent <b>bribery</b> on its behalf.|$|E
5|$|All RICO predicates {{are also}} money {{laundering}} predicates. Federal program <b>bribery,</b> while not a RICO predicate, is a money laundering predicate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bribery.</b> Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to <b>bribery.</b> It is also <b>bribery</b> for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for <b>bribery</b> at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
5|$|For {{both the}} <b>bribery</b> and {{gratuity}} subsections, {{the courts have}} interpreted an implicit exception for campaign contributions.|$|E
5|$|In April 2009, India ordered 12 AW101 {{to serve}} as {{executive}} transport helicopters for the Indian President and Prime Minister. The selection followed field trial assessments between the AW101 and the Sikorsky S-92 held in 2008. However, the procurement was put on hold and subsequently cancelled due to the 2013 Indian helicopter <b>bribery</b> scandal, in which Finmeccanica, AgustaWestland's parent company, were accused of using <b>bribery</b> to win the contract. The three helicopters delivered {{as part of the}} contract may be returned to the manufacturer as part of the arbitration process.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 2005, {{four months}} after his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and <b>bribery</b> of Alabama Governor Don Siegelman. Prosecutors claimed that Scrushy had agreed to pay over $500,000 of Siegelman's debt, which he accumulated during a failed attempt to bring a state lottery to Alabama, in exchange for a seat on the Certificates of Need Review Board. The board serves the state by reviewing hospitals and approving their construction. Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorney's accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy and Siegleman pleaded not guilty to all charges, but they were both convicted following a trial that lasted approximately six weeks. Scrushy was convicted of <b>bribery,</b> conspiracy, and mail fraud, while Siegelman was convicted of <b>bribery,</b> conspiracy, mail fraud, and obstruction of justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of voters was or might have been prevented from electing their preferred candidate due to a general occurrence of <b>bribery,</b> treating, intimidation or some other form of misconduct or circumstances.|$|E
5|$|For example, between 1985 and 1991, over 75 public {{officials}} {{were convicted of}} corruption offenses in the Southern District of West Virginia alone. By comparison, the only appellate court decision citing West Virginia's <b>Bribery</b> and Corrupt Practices Act, in 1991, was a federal court decision involving the state statute as a federal RICO predicate.|$|E
5|$|His {{successor}} was Kenneth Gibson, the city's first African American mayor, {{elected in}} 1970. He {{pleaded guilty to}} federal tax evasion in 2002 {{as part of a}} plea agreement on fraud and <b>bribery</b> charges. During his tenure as mayor in 1980, Gibson was tried and acquitted of giving out no-show jobs by an Essex County jury.|$|E
5|$|In a 2013 federal <b>bribery</b> {{trial of}} a Board of Review analyst, in secret {{recordings}} by an undercover FBI informant from 2008, the defendant named Berrios as a recipient of bribes. Berrios was not accused of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} at {{the county}} level, {{and to some degree}} at the state level, became notoriously tolerant of the illegal activities in Galveston, in no small part because of the prosperity they generated, and the <b>bribery</b> and influence peddled by the Maceos. The city police very early on became entirely complicit.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 2015 two FIFA vice-presidents {{were arrested}} on {{suspicion}} of <b>bribery</b> in the same Zurich hotel where seven FIFA officials had been arrested in May. An additional 16 indictments by the U.S. Department of Justice were announced on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The program <b>bribery</b> statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, {{was enacted}} in 1984. Previous {{prohibitions}} required the specific funds {{to have been}} under federal control (18 U.S.C. § 641) or the involvement of federal employees (18 U.S.C. § 201).|$|E
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of <b>bribery.</b> Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|By 1898, American {{financier}} Charles Tyson Yerkes {{had made}} a large fortune developing the electric tramway and elevated railway systems in Chicago, but his questionable business methods, which included <b>bribery</b> and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the tramway system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and {{turned his attention to}} opportunities in London.|$|E
5|$|Cope's and Marsh's discoveries were {{accompanied}} by sensational accusations of spying, stealing workers and fossils, and <b>bribery.</b> The two men were so protective of their digging sites that they would destroy smaller or damaged fossils {{to prevent them from}} falling into their rival's hands, or fill in their excavations with dirt and rock; while surveying his Como quarries in 1879, Marsh examined recent finds and marked several for destruction. On one occasion the scientists' rival teams fought each other by throwing stones.|$|E
5|$|Despite its short life, {{the first}} Disraeli {{government}} succeeded in passing {{a number of}} pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the Corrupt Practices Act did much to end electoral <b>bribery.</b> It authorised {{an early version of}} nationalisation, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful expedition against Tewodros II of Ethiopia under Sir Robert Napier.|$|E
5|$|During Tsang's second term, he {{initiated}} modest {{reforms in}} areas of education, environment and food safety. He concluded his term, however, when a local news media uncovered evidence of him receiving favours and hospitality from business tycoons on various occasions. This resulted in further discovery of <b>bribery</b> in Tsang's government; then-Chief Secretary of Administration, Rafael Hui, was convicted of corruption in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Four {{months after}} his {{acquittal}} in Birmingham, Scrushy was indicted along with former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on October 28, 2005, by {{a federal grand jury}} in Montgomery, Alabama. The indictment included 30 counts of money laundering, extortion, obstruction of justice, racketeering, and <b>bribery.</b> Although the new charges were filed a month before the previous trial ended, Scrushy's attorneys accused prosecutors of filing charges as retaliation for Scrushy's acquittal. Scrushy pleaded not guilty to all charges, but was convicted along with Siegelman in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|In December 2008, the German {{multinational}} Siemens {{agreed to}} pay an $800million fine to the United States government, and approximately €700million to the German government, to settle allegations of <b>bribery.</b> The settlement revealed that Menem had received about US$2million in bribes from Siemens in exchange for awarding the national ID card and passport production contract to Siemens; Menem denied the charges but nonetheless {{agreed to pay}} the fine.|$|E
5|$|Initially Göth's {{plan was}} that all the factories, {{including}} Schindler's, should be moved inside the camp gates. However, Schindler, {{with a combination of}} diplomacy, flattery, and <b>bribery,</b> not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at his own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, were well fed and housed, and were even permitted to undertake religious observances.|$|E
5|$|Known {{initially}} as {{a kindly}} physician, Doc Ames led the city into corruption during four terms as mayor just before 1900. The gangster Kid Cann {{was famous for}} <b>bribery</b> and intimidation during the 1930s and 1940s. The city made dramatic changes to rectify discrimination as early as 1886 when Martha Ripley founded Maternity Hospital for both married and unmarried mothers.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1702, Queen Anne united West and East Jersey {{into one}} Royal Colony, the Province of New Jersey. Edward Hyde, 3rd Earl of Clarendon became the royal colony's first governor. After Hyde was {{recalled}} to England in 1708 over charges of graft, <b>bribery,</b> and corruption, {{the governor of}} New York was charged to also preside over New Jersey. Finally, in 1738, King George II appointed a separate governor, Lewis Morris, to run New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Section 10 {{requires}} the authorisation of any prosecution {{by the director}} of the appropriate prosecution agency before a case can go ahead; this is a shift from the old regime, which required the consent of the Attorney General for England and Wales. Section 11 explains the penalties for individuals and companies found guilty of committing a crime. If an individual is found guilty of a <b>bribery</b> offence, tried as a summary offence, they may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and fined up to £5,000. Someone found guilty on indictment, however, faces up to 10 years' imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent <b>bribery</b> is punishable by an unlimited fine. In addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
5|$|Some mayors are {{particularly}} notable, for example: Conservative José María Caro Martínez (18301916), father of José María Caro Rodríguez, the first Chilean Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church; Radical Carlos Rojas Pavez, {{the founder of}} Pichilemu, a newspaper which counted with collaborations of local journalist and historian José Arraño Acevedo and municipal worker Miguel Larravide Blanco; and Christian Democrat Jorge Vargas González (b. 1967), a politician who was forced out of office in two different times, under charges of <b>bribery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suzy Kline's book, Horrible Harry Moves {{up to the}} Third Grade {{features}} a story on Starkey's deadly escape. The account {{is given to the}} characters by a guide, stating Starkey's amassing of the $100 and <b>bribery</b> of a guard. The fictional guide also states that the guard provided the information on the way to escape, and deliberately chose not to warn Starkey of the frayed rope that would cause his fatal fall.|$|E
5|$|The Games {{have grown}} {{so much that}} nearly every nation is now represented. This growth has created {{numerous}} challenges and controversies, including boycotts, doping, <b>bribery,</b> and a terrorist attack in 1972. Every two years the Olympics and its media exposure provide unknown athletes with the chance to attain national and sometimes international fame. The Games also constitute {{an opportunity for the}} host city and country to showcase themselves to the world.|$|E
5|$|The Hobbs Act, the Travel Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) {{have been}} upheld under the Commerce Clause. The mail fraud statute has been {{justified}} under the Postal Clause. In Sabri v. United States (2004), the Supreme Court upheld {{the constitutionality of}} the program <b>bribery</b> statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, under the Spending Clause (with Justice Clarence Thomas citing the Commerce Clause in concurrence). Prior to Sabri, several circuit courts had already so held.|$|E
5|$|The Skanska case {{occurred}} during Kirchner's presidency, during which {{several members of}} de Vido's ministry were accused of <b>bribery</b> in requests for tender for pipeline construction, based on a tape recording of Skanska employees discussing the bribes. The case was closed in 2011, when it was ruled that the tape was not acceptable evidence {{and there was no}} overpricing. It was reopened in 2016 (with Cristina Kirchner out of the government), and the tape was accepted as evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{judicial}} system in Belarus lacks independence and {{is subject to}} political interference. Corrupt practices such as <b>bribery</b> often took place during tender processes, and whistleblower protection and national ombudsman are lacking in Belarus's anti-corruption system. However, there is a political will to fight against corruption in the government, {{and the government has}} made some progress in combating corruption, such as minimizing tax regulations in order to improve transparency in the tax office.|$|E
5|$|The {{statutes}} {{differ in}} their jurisdictional elements, the mens rea that they require (for example, {{a quid pro quo}} or a nexus), the species of official actions that are cognizable, whether or not non-public official defendants can be prosecuted, and in the authorized sentence. The statutes most often used to prosecute public corruption are the Hobbs Act, Travel Act, RICO, the program <b>bribery</b> statute, and mail and wire fraud statutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the <b>bribery</b> case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the <b>bribery</b> file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
5|$|There is {{not much}} {{evidence}} that the chariot races were subject to bribes {{or other forms of}} cheating in the Roman Empire. In the Byzantine Empire, there seems to have been more cheating; Justinian I's reformed legal code prohibits drivers from placing curses on their opponents, but otherwise there {{does not seem to have}} been any mechanical tampering or <b>bribery.</b> Wearing the colours of one's team became an important aspect of Byzantine dress.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the point}} at which {{explicit}} constitutional authority for the creation of federal crimes runs out. But the statute went on to define additional crimes: theft or falsification of court records, perjury, <b>bribery</b> of federal judges, interference with judicial process, and liberation of federal prisoners. All of these were plainly necessary and proper to the operation of the federal courts; Marshall was to cite the perjury section as precedent for the existence of implicit powers in M'Culloch v. Maryland.|$|E
