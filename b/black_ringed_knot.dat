40|$|The {{nominate}} (Afro-Siberian) subspecies of the Knot Calidris canutus canutus breeds on the Taimyr Peninsula in Siberia and occurs commonly in the westernmost Wadden Sea during {{migration to}} West and South Africa. The recoveries and controls of 2045 <b>Knots</b> <b>ringed</b> in Britain and Ireland provide {{no evidence for}} canutus wintering there nor for their regular passage during autumn and spring migration. Five juveniles ringed {{in the first week}} of September 1963 were recovered in Africa between eight and 37 days later, and another two birds ringed at the same time (one as an adult) showed up in subsequent years in Spain and Germany at times typical for Afro-Siberian Knots. There have been no comparable bursts of southern recoveries since. The period in 1963 during which the Afro-Siberian juveniles were captured on the Wash was characterized by sustained wind patterns conducive to bringing naive juvenile waders from the Siberian tundra to the southwest. Such conditions have been increasingly rare in later years. The paucity of recent records may additionally reflect a decline in this population. Juveniles leaving Siberia would probably fly a constant compass course to western Europe, a flight of more than 5000 km logically ending in southeastern England. The scarcity of Afro-Siberian type recoveries based on <b>Knots</b> <b>ringed</b> a mere 350 km (five to six hours of flight) west of the Wadden Sea is therefore remarkable. ...|$|R

Cilia dusky. Antenna <b>black,</b> shafts <b>ringed</b> with white; head, thorax and abdomen brown, with a little blue scaling; beneath: white.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 9-11 mm. The forewings are white, irregularly irrorated with fuscous {{and dark}} fuscous, more thinly towards the dorsum anteriorly. There is an oblique blackish bar from the costa at one-sixth to the fold, {{as well as}} blackish spots on the costa before the middle and at two-thirds and a black subcostal dot at one-fourth. The stigmata are <b>black,</b> sometimes <b>ringed</b> with white, the plical rather obliquely before the first discal, an additional dot between the second discal and the dorsum. A small blackish spot is found on the dorsum before tornus and there are three blackish dots on the costa towards the apex, the apical area is darker-suffused. The hindwings are light grey, in males thinly scaled and whitish-tinged anteriorly.|$|R
50|$|The {{adults are}} 6.8-7.4 millimetres (0.27-0.29 in) long, with {{yellowish}} to red coloured head, legs, and prothorax. Their pronotum is either yellow or yellowish-brown, {{although they have}} two large black spots near the hind margin. The hemelytra are brown other than for the lateral edges, which are narrow and yellow coloured. The antennae are <b>black</b> and are <b>ringed</b> with yellowish-white colour. The adult species also could fly, but not high, since the dispersal is not rapid.|$|R
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large <b>black</b> spot <b>ringed</b> in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|R
50|$|Greek traders seem to {{have been}} meeting nomads in the {{district}} as early as the 7th century BC without a formal, permanent settlement. Greek colonies had two kinds of origins, apoikiai of citizens from the mother city-state, and emporia, which were strictly trading stations. Founded late in the 3rd century BC, by merchant adventurers from Miletus, Tanais quickly developed into an emporium at the farthest northeastern extension of the Hellenic cultural sphere. It was a natural post, first for the trade of the steppes reaching away eastwards in an unbroken grass sea to the Altai, the Scythian Holy Land, second for the trade of the <b>Black</b> Sea, <b>ringed</b> with Greek-dominated ports and entrepots, and third for trade from the impenetrable north, with furs and slaves brought down the Don.
