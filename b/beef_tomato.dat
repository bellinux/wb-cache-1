Individual fruit growth and development was assessed on a <b>beef</b> <b>tomato</b> cultivar during the reproductive period (first nine inflorescences). A non-destructive photograph technique {{was used to measure}} fruit growth from very early stages of their development and then calliper measurements were made on big fruits. From these measurements we determined the precise developmental stage at which fruit growth stopped. Fruit potential growth, which is defined as the growth achieved in non-limiting conditions for assimilate supply, was also assessed by this method on plants thinned to one flower per inflorescence. The latter was used to calculate the ratio between actual and potential growth, which was found to be a good index of the competition for assimilates...|$|E

The mean temperature was around 16 °C in the plastic greenhouse and around 17 °C in the glasshouse. A. fuscipennis was introduced {{at a rate of}} 5 pupae per m 2 per week during the first 13 weeks of the first cycle. During the second cycle, 2. 5 pupae of both E. formosa and A. fuscipennis per m 2 per week were introduced during the first 13 weeks. During the first cycle, control was obtained for 5 months in the plastic greenhouse and 3 months in the glasshouse, after which the population of T. vaporariorum adults increased to a maximum of 50 adults per plant. Parasitism was initially higher than 80 % but then decreased to 56 % in the plastic greenhouse and to 20 % in the glasshouse. During the second cycle, biological control was successful in both greenhouses. Populations of T. vaporariorum were lower than 1. 2 adults per plant and parasitism, caused mainly by E. formosa, was near 90 % most of the time. Therefore, E. formosa is recommended to keep populations of T. vaporariorum at low levels in unheated greenhouses on the Bogotá Plateau. When high populations of T. vaporariorum are to be expected or control of high-density spots is required, A. fuscipennis could be a beneficial addition to E. formosa...|$|E
40|$|Biological {{control of}} Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) by Encarsia formosa Gahan was tested during three {{consecutive}} production cycles (16 - 28 weeks) on a <b>beef</b> <b>tomato</b> (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crop in a glasshouse {{and a plastic}} greenhouse on the Bogota Plateau in Colombia. During {{the course of this}} study over the period 1997 - 1999, the mean temperature was around 16 °C in the plastic greenhouse and around 17 °C in the glasshouse. E. formosa was introduced at a rate of 3 adults per m 2 per week in the 1997 production cycle, and at a rate of 3 and 5 pupae per m 2 per week in 1998 and 1999, respectively. In 1997, the adult whitefly population increased exponentially to a peak of 76 adults per plant in the plastic greenhouse, while the whitefly population in the glasshouse reached a peak of only 12 adults per plant. The percentage parasitism fluctuated between 42 and 82 % in the glasshouse and between 28 and 47 % in the plastic greenhouse. In 1998, the T. vaporariorum population could not be brought under control in both greenhouses and reached a peak of 80 and 53 T. vaporariorum adults per plant in the plastic greenhouse and the glasshouse, respectively. Parasitism fluctuated between 55 and 97 % in the glasshouse and between 32 and 84 % in the plastic greenhouse. In 1999, biological control was successful in both greenhouses. Most of the time, populations of T. vaporariorum were lower than 1. 2 adults per plant and parasitism by E. formosa was 80 % or higher. We suggest that the higher temperature is the main reason for better parasitism in the glasshouse when compared to the plastic greenhouse. The successful results of 1999 show that biological control is possible under the short day and low temperature conditions of greenhouses situated in the high altitude tropics such as the Bogota Plateau. Recommendations are given for the application of E. formosa {{based on the results of}} these experiments...|$|E
40|$|Människor har de senaste århundradena bidragit till ökade emissioner av klimatgaser, vilket i sin tur har bidragit till den klimatförändring som idag upplevs. Jordbruket står för en stor del av dessa emissioner och i takt med att befolkningen ökar sätts ytterligare press på jordbruket att kunna förse denna befolkningsökning med livsmedel. Samtidigt ökar detta även pressen på miljön. Syftet med denna rapport var att utröna huruvida det ur ett klimatperspektiv är mest fördelaktigt att Sverige har en hög självförsörjningsgrad på ett urval av jordbruksprodukter, eller om dessa bör produceras i de länder som de idag importeras ifrån. Detta utfördes genom jämförelse av olika studier som utfört livscykelanalyser på dessa jordbruksprodukter. Klimatpåverkan uttrycktes i koldioxidekvivalenter i de studerade livscykelanalyserna. Resultaten visade att självförsörjningsgraden i Sverige för de utvalda produkterna fläskkött, mjölk, nötkött, tomat och ägg varierade mellan 14 och 103 procent. För fläskkött erhölls den lägsta klimatpåverkan vid produktion i Danmark med inkluderad {{transport}} till Sverige. För nötkött visade resultaten att den lägsta klimatpåverkan uppkom vid produktion i Danmark, och för mjölk vid produktion i Tyskland. Resultatet för tomat visade att lägst klimatpåverkan erhölls vid produktion i Spanien, med transport till Sverige. För ägg var produktion i Sverige det alternativ som gav lägst emissioner och således den enda produkt, utifrån resultaten i denna rapport, där Sverige borde ha en hög självförsörjningsgrad. Stora variationer uppvisades i de olika studierna, både mellan och inom länderna, för respektive produkt. Det diskuterades huruvida en viss del av dessa variationer kunde härledas till olikheter i studiernas utformning, med olika systemgränser och inkluderade processer som exempel. Att transport till Sverige ej inkluderades i samtliga studier noterades som en svaghet för resultaten i denna rapport. Detta kunde mycket väl tänkas påverka resultaten i den utsträckning att det optimala landet för produktion ändrades, och således att självförsörjning i Sverige blev mer fördelaktigt. Aspekter för självförsörjning som ej är kopplade till klimatperspektivet diskuterades till viss del i denna rapport. För vissa av dessa kunde det tänkas att motstridiga rekommendationer uppstod jämfört med de resultat som presenterades som fördelaktiga ur ett klimatperspektiv. Andra aspekter som sociala och ekonomiska utelämnades i denna rapport. För framtida studier rekommenderas att fler aspekter än klimatpåverkan integreras för att få ett mer allomfattande resultat gällande vilken självförsörjningsgrad som bör gälla för Sverige.  Human {{actions have}} {{during the last}} centuries contributed to increased emissions of greenhouse gases, {{which in turn has}} been a contributing factor to the climate change that is experienced today. Agriculture accounts for a large part of these emissions, and as the human population increases, further pressure is put on the agriculture to provide food for the increasing population. At the same time this also increases the pressure on the environment. The purpose of this report was to determine whether it from a climate perspective is most beneficial that Sweden has a high self-sufficiency rate on a selection of agricultural products, or if these should be produced in the countries that they today are imported from. This was carried out by a comparison between different studies that had conducted life cycle analyses on this selection of products, where the impact on climate was expressed in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents. The results showed that the levels of self-sufficiency in Sweden for the selected products pork, milk, <b>beef,</b> <b>tomato</b> and egg ranged between 14 and 103 percent. For pork, the lowest value of impact on the climate was obtained at production in Denmark with included transport to Sweden. For beef, the results showed that the lowest impact on climate emerged from production in Denmark, and for milk from production in Germany. The result for tomato showed that the lowest impact on climate was obtained at production in Spain, with included transport to Sweden. For egg, production in Sweden was the option that resulted in the lowest emissions, and was therefore the only product, according to the results in this report, where Sweden should have a high self-sufficiency rate. Large variations were demonstrated in the different studies, both between and within countries, for each product. A discussion was held whether a part of these variations could be traced to differences in how the studies were modeled, with different system boundaries and included processes as examples. The fact that transport to Sweden was not included in all of the studies was noted as a weakness for the results of this report. This could likely affect the results {{to the extent that the}} optimal country for production changes, and therefore that self- sufficiency in Sweden would be more beneficial. Aspects of self-sufficiency that are not related to the climate perspective were discussed to some extent in this report. Some of these were thought to result in contrary recommendations compared to the results that were presented as most beneficial from a climate perspective. Other aspects, such as social and economic, were excluded in this report. For future studies, more aspects than impact on the climate are recommended to be integrated, to obtain a more comprehensive result regarding which self-sufficiency rate Sweden should have. ...|$|E
