40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is a layer {{manufacturing}} {{process for the}} direct production of near full density and functional metallic parts with a high geometrical freedom. During the process, successive layers of metal powder are completely molten and consolidated by the energy of a high intensity laser beam. The process is capable of producing almost fully dense parts having mechanical properties {{comparable to those of}} bulk materials. However, poor surface quality limits the process. This limitation can be overcome by laser surface re-melting (LSR) applied on the surfaces having a normal vector parallel to the <b>building</b> <b>axis.</b> Surface modification by LSR does not only improve the surface quality, but also has the potential to enhance microhardness and to change the microstructure because of high cooling rates. In this study, the parts are first produced by SLM from 316 L stainless steel powder. The last layer of the parts are then re-molten with different parameter selections using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source. The influence of LSR on surface quality, microhardness and microstructure is investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Selective laser melting (SLM) is a layer-additive {{manufacturing}} technology {{which makes it}} possible to create fully functional parts directly from standard metals without any intermediate binders or any additional post-processing steps. During SLM, a high intensity laser beam selectively scans a powder bed according to the CAD data of the part to be produced and powder particles are completely melted. SLM is capable of producing near full density parts with an almost infinite geometric freedom. However, the mechanical properties obtained with SLM may differ from the ones of bulk material. In this study, Charpy impact tests are applied on the samples produced by SLM from different materials; Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, AISI 316 L (X 2 CrNiMo 18 - 14 - 3) and maraging steel 300 (X 3 CoMoTi 18 - 9 - 5).

40|$|By {{using three}} {{dimensional}} software MIDAS/GTS, the interactions among structures-soil-tunnel system is considered in this paper, {{and the working}} condition of shallow-buried underground excavation is simulated in the foundation of frame structures with the short-pile. The loadings and deformations of structures are studied {{before and after the}} tunnelling, and the influences of the following factors, including the horizontal position of tunnel and building, the height of building and the soil property, are analyzed. It is indicated that when the horizontal distance L equals zero (the distance between <b>building</b> <b>axis</b> to the tunnel axis), the building settlement increases gradually and shows a normal distribution during and after the tunnelling. Due to the small stiffness of frame structures with short-pile foundations, the building has large nonuniform settlement. When the distance of excavation is no less than 1. 8 times of the thickness of overburden soil, the building settlement becomes stable, and the first principal stress P 1 and maximum deformation rate E 1 generally show a trend of decrease. With the increasing L, P 1 and E 1 will decrease accordingly, and the buildings tend to be inclined toward the tunnel. For a relatively larger distance, the building is nearly not affected...|$|E
40|$|Laser {{scanning}} {{systems are}} frequently {{used to provide}} the digital surface models, DSM, of the earth surface. Laser scanning is a fast and precise technique to extract information related with various objects (terrain and non-terrain). Automatic extraction of objects from laser scanner data and images has recently been an important subject. Buildings are the objects of the highest interest in 3 D city modeling. Urban areas are rapidly changing due to human activities in construction, destruction or extension of topographic elements such as buildings and roads. This mandates the availability of fast data acquisition technique and automatic method for detecting and extracting 3 D topographic objects from the data. In this paper, building details were extracted from laser scanning data. We used data which were produced by ISPRS III commission to be evaluated the filtering techniques belonging to Stuttgart city center. We produced an efficient algorithm with Hough transform technique by using MATLAB software. We present a sequential Hough transform for detection of building in point clouds. Our algorithm consists of two sequential steps of low dimensional Hough transforms. The first step, called Orientation Estimation, uses the Gaussian sphere of the input data and performs a 2 D Hough Transform for finding strong hypotheses for the direction of <b>building</b> <b>axis.</b> The second step of Position and Radius Estimation consists of a 3 D Hough transform for estimating building position and radius. This sequential breakdown reduces the space and time complexity while retaining the advantages of robustness against outliers and multiple instances. The results of applying this algorithm to real data sets from two industrial sites are presented that demonstrate {{the effectiveness of this}} procedure for building detection. 1...|$|E

The wind resource in urban environments is challenging to predict but technologies, including computational fluid dynamics software, are making it possible. This software pinpoints suitable placement for wind turbines through models that show wind acceleration patterns over a <b>building.</b> Horizontal <b>axis</b> wind turbines (HAWTs) have dominated the wind industry but vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) offer potential to outperform HAWTs in urban environments. VAWTs can handle turbulent and unconventional wind and generate energy at slower speeds, which is beneficial for these areas. A case study at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts analyzes the functionality of a HAWT and a VAWT. The machines are compared by their efficiencies due to an imbalance of rated power outputs. The machines’ average maximum power coefficients are similar. However, when the R 2 values of the turbine’s power curves are compared the VAWT demonstrates greater capacity to track changes in the wind. This research {{is the first step}} in redefining the power systems employed at Clark University and the data will be utilized to find better locations for the wind turbines...|$|R

A scaled model of a horizontal-co-axial wind turbine was designed, built and tested in the wind tunnel of University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and its characteristics and aerodynamic-noise emissions were analyzed. The noise reduction capability of the horizontal-twin-shaft wind turbines was compared with wind turbines with the conical entry nozzle (stator), duct-shroud-envelop and vertical shafts. Air velocity, shaft rpm, electric-power generation, noise frequency and amplitude were measured. It was found that up to 15 % reduction in the amplitude (dB) of noise emisit from twin shaft wind turbine compared to the single shaft bench mark turbine.

40|$|Meiotic {{chromosomes}} assemble characteristic "axial element" {{structures that}} are essential for fertility and provide the chromosomal context for meiotic recombination, synapsis and checkpoint signaling. Whether these meiotic processes are equally dependent on axial element integrity has remained unclear. Here, we investigated this question in S. cerevisiae using the putative condensin allele ycs 4 S. We show that the severe axial element assembly defects of this allele are explained by a linked mutation in the promoter of the major axial element gene RED 1 that reduces Red 1 protein levels to 20 - 25 % of wild type. Intriguingly, the Red 1 levels of ycs 4 S mutants support meiotic processes linked to axis integrity, including DNA double-strand break formation and deposition of the synapsis protein Zip 1, at levels that permit 70 % gamete survival. By contrast, the ability to elicit a meiotic checkpoint arrest is completely eliminated. This selective loss of checkpoint function {{is supported by a}} RED 1 dosage series and is associated with the loss of most of the cytologically detectable Red 1 from the axial element.
