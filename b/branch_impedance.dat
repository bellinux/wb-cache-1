50|$|Core {{losses are}} caused mostly by {{hysteresis}} and eddy current {{effects in the}} core and are proportional to {{the square of the}} core flux for operation at a given frequency. The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current IM to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, {{the relationship between the two}} being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits. With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°. With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current I0 equals transformer no-load current.The resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on linearity assumptions, retains a number of approximations. Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing <b>branch</b> <b>impedance</b> is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.|$|E

The method implementation is made scalable by casting all formulas into the framework of the popular backward/forward algorithm. The ad-vantages of this approach are illustrated on a radial IEEE 32 -bus test system.

This line provides helium during engine startup to begin turbomachinery operation. The spin start line also acts as an acoustic side branch which alters the chamber's acoustic modes. The side branch effectively creates 'split modes' in the chamber longitudinal modes, in particular below the first longitudinal mode and within the frequency range associated with the injection-coupled response of the Gas Generator. Interaction between the spin start-modified chamber acoustics and the injection-driven response can create a higher system response than without the spin start attached to the chamber.

In this paper, the hardware implementation of an antenna array system for SLL reduction is introduced using microstrip technology. The proposed antenna array system consists of two main parts, the antenna array, and its feeding network. Power dividers play a vital role in various radio frequency and communication applications. A power divider can be utilized as a feeding network of an antenna array. For the synthesis of a radiation pattern, an unequal-split power divider is required. A new design for a four ports unequal circular sector power divider and its application to antenna array SLL reduction is introduced. The amplitude and phase of the signals emerging from each power divider branch are adjusted using stub and inset matching techniques. These matching techniques are used to adjust the <b>branches</b> <b>impedances</b> according to the desired power ratio.

The validity of each model was compared in time domain with ATP-EMTP software which uses transmission line approach. It is {{found that for}} a power-line network with minimum number of branches all the models give similar signal/pulse time responses compared with ATP-EMTP software; however, Zimmermann and Dostert model indicates the same amplitude but different time delay. It is observed that when the numbers of branches are increased only generalized TL theory approach results are comparable with ATP-EMTP results. Also the Multi-Carrier Spread Spectrum (MC-SS) system was applied to check the implication of such behavior on the modulation schemes. It is observed that using Philipps on the underground cable can predict the performance up to 25 dB better than other channel models which can misread the actual performance of the system. Also modified Zimmermann and Dostert under multipath can predict a better performance of about 5 dB better than the actual predicted by Generalized TL theory.

These stimulations can be viewed from an engineering standpoint as involving an artificial electric source (DC, noise, or AC) attached to an <b>impedance</b> <b>branch</b> of a distributed parameter circuit. The distributed parameter circuit is an approximation of the brain and includes electric sources (neurons) and impedances (volume conductors). Such a brain model is linear, {{as is often the case}} with the electroencephalogram (EEG) forward model. Thus, the above-mentioned current stimulations change the current distribution in the brain depending on the locations of the electric sources in the brain. Now, if the attached artificial electric source were to be replaced with a resistor, or even a negative resistor, the resistor would also change the current distribution in the brain. In light of the superposition theorem, which holds for any linear electric circuit, attaching an electric source is different from attaching a resistor; the resistor affects each active electric source in the brain so as to increase (or decrease in some cases of a negative resistor) the current flowing out from each source.
