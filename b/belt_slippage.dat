50|$|Fan wheel speeds in {{belt-driven}} {{fans are}} fixed unless the belt(s) slip. <b>Belt</b> <b>slippage</b> {{can reduce the}} fan wheel speed by several hundred revolutions per minute (rpm).|$|E
50|$|In addition, some belt weigher {{controllers}} {{will offer}} {{features such as}} driving an output to stop the belt when a predefined mass of material has been measured, or a range of alarms to indicate nil flow, <b>belt</b> <b>slippage</b> and belt stoppage.|$|E
50|$|Typical CVT designs require {{high level}} of {{hydraulic}} pressure for operation, and CVT hydraulic-fluid pumps are typically driven {{at the same rate}} as engine speed, leading to pumps wasting considerable effort, lowering transmission efficiency at higher engine speeds as the pump moves more fluid than necessary to lubricate and sandwich the CVT's belt. Hydraulic pressure was reduced to an optimal point to protect against <b>belt</b> <b>slippage,</b> while conserving drive effort to limit excess pumping losses in the new design; also, the oil pump features a coaxial 2-port design that enables a 25-percent reduction in pump drive torque, lowering its parasitic draw on the engine.|$|E
40|$|Depending on your farm operation, the {{following}} actions could reduce your on-farm energy consumption. Refer to the references {{at the end}} of the bulletin for more information. Ventilation 1. Install thermostats to control fans so they are on when needed and shut off when not needed. Research has indicated that cows begin to show mild heat stress at 74 ˚F and 75 % relative humidity, so thermostats should be set between 70 ˚F and 75 ˚F. 2. Clean fan blades, guards, motors, thermostats and shutters monthly. a. Dust build-up on motors increases operating temperatures and can lead to overheating. b. Dust-covered thermostats do not sense temperatures accurately. c. Dirty shutters can decrease fan efficiency by 25 %. 3. Lubricate shutter hinges with graphite—not grease or oil— every 3 months. 4. Check belt condition, tension and alignment on fans with <b>belts.</b> <b>Slippage</b> of <b>belts</b> can cut belt life in half and reduce air flow rates by as much as 30 % or more. Always replace guards after servicing. 5. Install efficient fans. For fan efficiency ratings refer to Agricultura...|$|R
50|$|Timing belts, toothed belts, cogged or cog belts, and {{synchronous}} belts are non-slipping {{mechanical drive}} belts. They are made as flexible belts with teeth moulded onto their inner surface. The belts run over matching toothed pulleys or sprockets. When correctly tensioned, {{these type of}} <b>belts</b> have no <b>slippage,</b> and are often used to transfer motion for indexing or timing purposes (hence their name). They are often used in lieu of chains or gears, so there is less noise and a lubrication bath is not necessary.|$|R
50|$|Contamination: paint, powder, acid or {{alkaline}} fluids, abrasives, glass bead, steel shot, etc. can all lead {{to rapid}} deterioration of track and chain. Ask any bearing company about {{the leading cause}} of bearing failure and they will point to contamination. Once a foreign substance lands on the raceway of a bearing or on the track, pitting of the surface will occur, and once the surface is compromised, wear will accelerate. Building shrouds around your conveyors can help prevent the ingress of contaminants. Or, pressurize the contained area using a simple fan and duct arrangement. Contamination can also apply to <b>belts</b> (causing <b>slippage,</b> {{or in the case of}} some materials premature wear), and of the motors themselves. Since the motors can generate a considerable amount of heat, keeping the surface clean is an almost-free maintenance procedure that can keep heat from getting trapped by dust and grime, which may lead to motor burnout.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>slippage</b> can be {{addressed}} in several ways. Belt replacement is an obvious solution, and eventually the mandatory one (because no belt lasts forever). Often, though, before the replacement option is executed, retensioning (via pulley centerline adjustment) or dressing (with any of various coatings) may be successful to extend the belt's lifespan and postpone replacement. Belt dressings are typically liquids that are poured, brushed, dripped, or sprayed onto the belt surface and allowed to spread around; they are meant to recondition the belt's driving surfaces and increase friction between the belt and the pulleys. Some belt dressings are dark and sticky, resembling tar or syrup; some are thin and clear, resembling mineral spirits. Some are sold {{to the public in}} aerosol cans at auto parts stores; others are sold in drums only to industrial users.|$|E

Shelton, a design engineer with Logical Control Systems to solve this problem. Shelton found the solution in a NASA Tech Brief article describing a system of pulley and belt drives. This led {{to the design of}} a system that monitors drive components for changes in relative speed that would indicate <b>belt</b> <b>slippage</b> and jam probability.

The authors presented the new stochastic method in a previous paper last year. The two methods are compared in an application example of a vehicle alternator. The alternator may experience three faults including <b>belt</b> <b>slippage,</b> a broken diode, or incorrect controller reference voltage.

40|$|Automotive {{vehicles}} {{are becoming increasingly}} dependent on electric power, and this trend will accelerate. The health of the vehicular electric power generation and storage (EPGS) system is crucial to enhance vehicle safety, fuel economy, and customer satisfaction. In this research, a state-of-health (SOH) monitoring method is developed for automotive EPGS system, focusing on alternator related faults. Parity relations, characterizing the correlation among EPGS system signals under normal operating conditions, are generated using principal/minor component analysis techniques. Based on a design of structured residuals, the faults under consideration, including shorted diodes, <b>belt</b> <b>slippage,</b> and regulator fault, are successfully detected and isolated. The effectiveness of the diagnostic algorithm is illustrated by using Matlab/Simulink based EPGS Simulation model...|$|E
40|$|Belt {{conveyors}} {{are widely}} used in bulk solids handling and conveying systems. Considering the extensive use of belt conveyors, their operations involve {{a large amount of}} energy. Taking the relevant economic and social challenges into account, there is a strong demand for lowering the energy consumption of belt conveyors, and for reducing the carbon footprint. Speed control is one of the promising approaches for reducing the power consumption of belt conveyors. This thesis focuses on the application of speed control to belt conveyors for reducing their energy consumption. Research on belt conveyor speed control has already been carried out for more than twenty years. However, rare implementations of speed control to reduce energy consumption can be found in practice. One major reason is that the current research does not cover issues like the potential risks (such as the risk of belt over-tension, the risk of <b>belt</b> <b>slippage</b> around the drive pulley and the risk of motor over-heating) and the dynamic analyses of belt conveyors in transient operations. Therefore, speed control of belt conveyors is not often successfully applied in practice [...] .

40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct {{measurement}} of building ventilation rate in livestock housing {{is a formidable}} task due to uncontrollable variations in fan and system performance that are caused by factors such as building static pressure, fan <b>belt</b> <b>slippage,</b> and dust accumulation on shutters and blades. Estimating building ventilation rate by an indirect method based on a CO 2 balance offers a potentially viable alternative to direct measurement. The validity of the CO 2 balance method depends on the validity of relationship between CO 2 production inside the building and metabolic rate of the animals and the knowledge of CO 2 generation by the housing environment. Metabolic rates of modern laying hens have recently been quantified in intensive large−scale laboratory measurements. However, performance of the indirect method remains to be evaluated under field conditions. This article compares building ventilation rates obtained by direct measurement and by a CO 2 balance. The test was conducted at a commercial laying hen house that used manure belts with daily manure removal. The results indicate that ventilation rates estimated by the indirect method {{were not significantly different}} (P> 0. 2) from those as determined by the direct measurement when the averaging or integration time interval was 2 h or longer. Careful application of the indirect method could greatly improve the affordability and versatility of endeavors toward quantifying air emissions from confined animal housing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Continuously {{variable}} transmission (CVT) {{is a type}} of automatic transmission that can change the gear ratio to any arbitrary setting within the limits. The most common type of CVT operates on a pulley system that allows an infinite variability between highest and lowest gears with no discrete steps. However, the current CVT system with hydraulic actuation method suffers from the power loss. It needs continuous force for the pulley to clamp the belt and hold the torque resulting in large amount of energy consumption. This study focused on the development of an electromechanical actuated control CVT to eliminate the problem that faced by the existing CVT. It is conducted with several steps; computing and selecting the appropriate sizing for stroke length, lead screw system and etc. From the visual observation {{it was found that the}} CVT system of this research is satisfactory. II. METHODOLOGY One approach of changing the CVT ratio is by using an electromechanical actuator. This includes a set of power screw and a DC motor for each pulley. The function of power screw mechanisms is for shifting movable sheaves axially along the shafts. For this system to function effectively the primary motor is responsible for changing transmission ratio and the secondary motor is for controlling the <b>belt</b> <b>slippage.</b> The system only operates during the transmission ratio changing which consume less power compared to the conventional hydraulic CVT. The power screw mechanism makes sure that the pulley is held at its place when there is no gear ratio changing...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a model using multivariate statistical methods to identify system faults in an air-handling unit (AHU). The effects of using a reduced amount of available information are investigated. The faults are simulated and are applied in an actual flow loop facility;The process model fault scheme as presented in Iserman (1987) was adopted for this research. Unlike the parameter estimation from Iserman study, the procedures for detecting and diagnosing AHU faults in this study use multivariate Statistics and Probability; To aid the research, a factorial experimental design was developed and experimental normal and fault data were collected for the AHU operation. The investigation included three types of faults: fan <b>belt</b> <b>slippage,</b> coil blockage, and sticking control valve. The data included temperatures, flow rates, pressure rise of the fan, fan speed, and power measurement. To extract the dimensionality of the problem, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed and cross-examined by the method of discriminant analysis. An additional energy analysis was performed to validate the model and provide the grounds for the explanation of the physical fault detection with the minimum set of variables for the AHU;The logistic regression analysis was applied to distinguish between normal and faulty operation. In determining the minimal set of variables, stepwise discriminant analysis provided four variables: inlet air temperature, outlet water temperature, inlet water temperature, and fan pressure rise. Standardized discriminant coefficients allowed freedom from scale and correctly reflected the joint contribution of the variables to the discriminant function as it maximally separated the groups;Discriminant and classification analysis showed valuable information for detecting and diagnosing the three faults in an AHU. The experimental data gathered using a factorial experiment design gave good evaluation of the significant variables involved to segregate different faults. The results of this research demonstrated an effective fault detection and diagnostic mechanism for an air-handling unit, leading to improved system performance and decreased energy use and demand...|$|E
40|$|Objective Since the {{shoulders}} are rarely seriously injured in frontal or oblique collisions, {{they have been}} given low priority {{in the development of}} frontal impact crash test dummies. The shoulder complex geometry and its kinematics are of vital importance for the overall dummy kinematics. The shoulder complex also influences the risk of the safety belt slipping off the shoulder in oblique forward collisions. The first aim {{of this study was to}} develop a new 50 th percentile male THOR shoulder design while the second was to compare the new shoulder, mounted on a THOR NT dummy, with volunteer, THOR NT and Hybrid III range-of-motion and stiffness data. The third aim was to test the repeatability of the new shoulder during dynamic testing and to see how the design behaves with respect to <b>belt</b> <b>slippage</b> in a 45 ° far-side collision. Methods The new 50 th percentile THOR shoulder design was developed with the aid of a shell model of the seated University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) 50 th percentile male with coordinates for joints and bony landmarks (Schneider et al., 1983). The new shoulder design has human-like bony landmarks for the acromion and coracoid processes. The clavicle curvature and length are also made similar to that of a male human, as is the range-of-motion in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior and medial-lateral directions. The new shoulder design was manufactured and tested under the same conditions that Törnvall et al. (2005 b) used to compare the shoulder range-of-motion for the volunteers, Hybrid III and THOR Alpha. The new design was also tested in two dynamic test configurations: the first was a 0 ° full-frontal test and the second was a 45 ° far-side test. The dummy tests were conducted with an R- 16 seat with a three-point belt, the ΔV was 27. 0 ± 0. 5 km/h and the maximum peak acceleration was approximately 14. 6 ± 0. 5 g for each test. Results A new shoulder design with geometry close to that of humans was developed to be retrofitted to the THOR NT dummy. The results showed that the range-of-motion for the new shoulder complex during static loading was larger by at least a factor of three, for the maximum load (200 N/arm), than that of either the Hybrid III or the THOR NT; this means it was more similar to the volunteers’ range-of-motion. It was observed that the THOR NT with the new shoulder did not slide out of the shoulder-belt during a far-side collision. The performance of the new shoulder was reasonably repeatable and stable during both the static tests and the sled tests. Conclusions A new shoulder for the THOR NT has been designed and developed, and data from static range-of-motion tests and sled tests indicate that the new shoulder complex has the potential to function in a more human-like manner on the THOR dummy...|$|E
