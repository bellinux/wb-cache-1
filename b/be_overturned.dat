5|$|A related {{objection}} is {{that evolution}} {{is based on}} unreliable evidence, claiming that evolution is not even well-evidenced. Typically, this is either based on the argument that evolution's evidence is full of frauds and hoaxes, that current evidence for evolution is likely to <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> as some past evidence has been, or that certain types of evidence are inconsistent and dubious.|$|E
5|$|Although the High Court {{ordered that}} {{the verdict of}} the {{original}} conviction <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> and that a retrial be conducted, {{there was never any}} retrial since Dietrich had already served his sentence.

5|$|During a BBC Newsnight {{discussion}} of the case, Lord Scarman, a former Law Lord, said the convictions ought to <b>be</b> <b>overturned.</b> Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist's report about Raghip and, supported by Raghip's MP Michael Portillo, asked the Home Secretary to review the case. She also submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 1990 Home Secretary Kenneth Baker referred Raghip's case back to the Court of Appeal.|$|E

5|$|On March 30, 1993, it was {{announced}} that Gil Stein, who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, had been inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors and by telling them to change the rules for selection. Two lawyers, hired by the league to lead an investigation, recommended that Stein's selection <b>be</b> <b>overturned,</b> although it was soon revealed that Stein had previously decided to turn down the induction.|$|E
5|$|In 1530 Vermigli was {{appointed}} vicar {{of the monastery}} at San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. There he learned Hebrew from a local Jewish doctor so he could read the Old Testament scriptures in their original language. Even among those who sought deeper biblical study, it was uncommon for clergy to learn Hebrew, though not unheard of. In 1533 the chapter-general elected Vermigli abbot of the two Lateran monasteries in Spoleto. At this post he was also responsible for two convents. The discipline in the monastic houses in Vermigli's care had been lax before his arrival, and they had {{become a source of}} scandal in Spoleto. There was also a history of power struggle between the Bishop of Spoleto, Francesco Eroli, and the Spoletan abbacy, {{to the point that the}} bishop had excommunicated Vermigli's predecessor, only to <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> by Rome. Vermigli brought order to his houses and mended the relationship with the bishop.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{if there}} is a mistrial, or the case <b>is</b> <b>overturned</b> on appeal, {{generally}} this is without prejudice and (in the case of decision overturned on appeal) either all of the case is retried, or, if not all of the case <b>is</b> <b>overturned,</b> the parts that <b>were</b> <b>overturned</b> (like a sentencing hearing) are retried. If the case is dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, it will typically be dismissed with prejudice, which means that the defendant cannot be retried.|$|R

5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
5|$|After Preston won an FA Cup {{match against}} Upton Park in 1884, the Londoners protested, seeking the result to <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> due to professionalism in the Preston ranks. This sparked {{a series of}} events which {{threatened}} to split the FA. Under Sudell's instruction, Preston withdrew from the competition. Fellow Lancashire clubs Burnley and Great Lever followed suit. The protest gathered momentum, to the point where more than 30 clubs, predominantly from the north, announced that they would set up a rival British Football Association if the FA did not permit professionalism. At the FA conference called to discuss the issue, Sudell {{was a member of the}} committee. He argued passionately for the acceptance of professionalism, but met opposition from southern-based amateur clubs, who viewed sport solely as a pastime. Backed by figures such as the more moderate but influential William McGregor of Aston Villa, the advocates of professionalism won the day and secured its acceptance. However, each club was permitted to only pay players who had been born or who had lived within six miles of the home stadium for at least two years.|$|E
5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E

5|$|British {{participants}} {{were involved in}} a number of controversies regarding the reallocation of medals during the Games. Shelly Woods was initially awarded the silver medal in the women's 5000m T54, but a rerun was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) after the Australian, US and Swiss teams protested the result because six competitors {{were involved in a}} crash on the penultimate lap. When the race was rerun Woods won the bronze medal. David Weir believed he had won the gold medal in the men's 800m T54 but a rerun of the race was ordered after it was discovered that the Australian silver medallist, Kurt Fearnley, had begun the race in the wrong lane. Following a letter from Fearnley and the Australian authorities to the IPC, which asked that the result not <b>be</b> <b>overturned</b> in the spirit of sportsmanship, the rerun was cancelled and Weir's medal reinstated. Discus thrower Rebecca Chin was originally awarded the silver medal in the women's F37–38, but her classification was challenged and Chin was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased. The decision was particularly controversial given that Chin had already been assessed earlier in the Games whilst she competed in the women's F37–38 shot put final.|$|E
