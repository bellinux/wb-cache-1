5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|Although Gregory had {{intended}} London {{to be the}} southern archbishopric for the island, Augustine never moved his episcopal see to London, and instead consecrated Mellitus as a plain bishop there. After Augustine's death in 604, Canterbury continued to {{be the site of}} the southern archbishopric, and London remained a bishopric. It may have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kentish king did not wish greater episcopal authority to be exercised outside his own kingdom.|$|E
5|$|General Eisenhower issued {{orders to}} {{preserve}} the building during the bombardment of Frankfurt, because he intended to use it after the war as his headquarters.

5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Priest is a single individual, if {{only because of the}} appealing parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness.

5|$|Foliot was Becket's rival for the Archbishopric of Canterbury. He {{objected to}} the king's choice {{on the grounds that}} Becket was too worldly, the only bishop or magnate known to have opposed the king's choice. When the newly elected {{archbishop}} was presented to the court before his consecration, Foliot remarked that the king had performed a miracle by turning a layman and a knight into an archbishop. Soon after Becket's consecration the king wrote to the pope asking for permission to make Foliot the royal confessor. This may have been a conciliatory move to appease Foliot after the loss of Canterbury, or it may have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> king and the new archbishop were already having differences of opinion and the king wished Foliot to be a counter-weight to Becket's influence.|$|E

5|$|Hillforts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages, around {{the start of the}} 1st millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and, as a result, trading patterns shifted. The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1944, {{troops of}} the {{division}} in Tetovo and Gostivar mutinied, killing their German officers and NCOs. By this time, the division numbered fewer than 7,000 men, which was less than one-third of its intended strength. Within two months of its initial deployment, 3,500 men had deserted. Himmler brought in 3,000–4,000 Kriegsmarine (German navy) personnel from Greece {{to make up the}} numbers, but this had little effect on the division's fighting ability. By the beginning of October 1944, the division's strength had fallen to about 4,900 men, fewer than 1,500 of whom were fit for combat. Schmidhuber held his men in contempt, and he, his superiors, and Fitzthum explained their failure to create an effective security force by denigrating the Albanian culture and military reputation. Later, less-involved members of the Wehrmacht stated that the principal issue regarding the unit's reliability may have <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans did not work closely with the Albanians at the local level. In mid-October, it was engaged in heavy fighting around Đakovica. By this time, desertions had significantly affected the division's strength and its 86 officers and 467 NCOs were left with a force of only 899 men, about half of whom were Albanian. On 24 October, Generaloberst Alexander Löhr, the commander of Army Group E, ordered that all Albanian members of the division be disarmed and released.|$|E
5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent rocket engine outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E
30|$|However, VCO 2 -based {{calorimetry}} has two methodological challenges. <b>The</b> first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> method {{requires a}} choice of RQ to be made, and <b>the</b> second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the estimation is affected by instant variability in measurements of MV and VCO 2.|$|R
50|$|A police lineup is {{a method}} for an {{eyewitness}} to identify a perpetrator by viewing a series of photos, or a live group of suspects. One possible outcome of a lineup <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly identify the criminal. Another outcome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can correctly state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> criminal <b>is</b> not in the lineup. A third option <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eyewitness can fail to recognize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> culprit <b>is</b> present. Lastly, the eyewitness can incorrectly select another suspect. The ideal result is to correctly identify the offender, and the worst outcome is to mistakenly identify an innocent.|$|R

5|$|This was a storyline that Russell T Davies {{thought up}} {{as a final}} one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (this was going to air around Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.).

This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became The End of Time that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Proestex family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Aaddams and Rossiter.|$|E
5|$|Under {{a renewed}} {{agreement}} in 1999, {{all but one}} of the St. Louis County districts agreed to continue their participation, albeit with an opt-out clause that allowed districts to reduce the number of incoming transfer students starting in 2002. In addition, districts have been permitted to reduce available seats in the program. Since 1999, districts have reduced availability by five percent annually. A five-year extension of the voluntary transfer program was approved in 2007, and another five-year extension was approved in 2012, allowing new enrollments to take place through the 20182019 school year in participating districts. Critics of the transfer program note that most of the desegregation under the plan is via transfer of black students to the county rather than transfer of white students to the city. Another criticism has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> program weakens city schools by removing talented students to county schools. Despite these issues, the program will continue until all transfer students reach graduation; with the last group of transfer students allowed to enroll in 20182019, the program will end after the 20302031 school year.|$|E

30|$|One {{reason of}} these {{increases}} might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impact of FTO substrate samples {{on the environment}} is reduced, in which the process was in a nitrogen-filled glovebox while the reported process was in the air.

For ITO, the oxygen hole as carrier reduction causes the decrease of conductivity after annealing. The third reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light transmittance of the FTO substrate was a little higher than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> ITO substrate.|$|R
