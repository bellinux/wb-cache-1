5|$|Hobgood et al. {{argue that}} one key {{component}} in equipping nations to develop emergency medical systems {{is to identify}} the aspects of training that are essential for health care providers. In their view, a standard curriculum is useful for identifying core issues, even if countries have very different needs and resources. To address this goal, the International Federation for Emergency Medicine developed a model curriculum in 2009. This initiative seeks to provide a minimum basic standard that can <b>be</b> <b>tailored</b> to {{the specific needs of}} the various nations implementing training in emergency medicine. It is targeted towards all medical students in order to produce a minimum competency in emergency care for all physicians, regardless of their specialty.|$|E

The {{size and shape of}} viruses, and the number and nature of the functional groups on their surface, is precisely defined. As such, viruses are commonly used in materials science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can <b>be</b> <b>tailored</b> by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E

5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona family group. As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can <b>be</b> <b>tailored</b> to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem is a {{tactical}} role-playing game which puts {{players in the}} role of a customizable Avatar: their gender, appearance, character class and statistics can <b>be</b> <b>tailored</b> by the player. Missions are split between story-based chapters and optional side chapters: side chapters give access to new playable characters outside the main narrative. Players can save at any time during battles, with the game opening offering a save {{at the end of each}} chapter. Outside battles, the player can visit towns to buy supplies and items such as weapons. Characters recruited by the player can also engage in support conversations accessed through the battle menu: these raise a character's support rank and grant boons during battle. How characters connect through supports is documented using a relationship chart.|$|E

5|$|Xbox One X's {{design is}} a {{revision}} of the Xbox One S hardware, but further streamlined. It uses a system-on-chip (SoC) known as Scorpio Engine, which incorporates a 2.3GHz octa-core CPU, and a Radeon GPU with 40 Compute Units clocked at 1172MHz, generating 6 teraflops of graphical computing performance. It also includes 12GB of GDDR5 RAM, 9 GB of which is allocated to games. To assist in optimizing the new hardware to run existing games at 4K resolution, Microsoft developers used internal debugging software to collect GPU traces from major titles that did not run at full 1080p resolution on the original Xbox One. Scorpio Engine's CPU utilizes a custom platform designed to maintain compatibility with the Jaguar CPU of the original Xbox One, but with a 31% increase in performance; the custom platform is unrelated to AMD's current Ryzen architecture. The console will feature a vapor chamber method of cooling for the SoC, and motherboards will <b>be</b> <b>tailored</b> to the exact voltage needs of each individual Scorpio SoC to optimize their output and energy usage. The console will also support AMD's FreeSync technology on compatible displays.|$|E
