5|$|Alexander Vinokourov was the team's leader {{alongside}} Kreuziger. Vinokourov stated {{before the}} season that 2011 would likely be his {{last year as a}} professional rider. He sustained a serious crash at the Tour de France. He broke his right femur and retired from the sport for a time, but he eventually went <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> decision and his decision from {{before the season}}, opting instead to return for the 2012 season.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 September, Wolfe's army formed a line first with {{their backs to the}} river, then spread out across the Plains with its right {{anchored}} by the bluff along the St. Lawrence and its left by a bluff and thick wood above the St. Charles River. While the regular French forces were approaching from Beauport and Quebec, the Canadian militia and native sharpshooters engaged the British left flank, sheltering in the trees and scrub; the militia held these positions throughout the battle and fell <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> line during the general retreat, eventually holding the bridge over the St. Charles River.|$|E
5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked down hard on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E

The outpost consisted of a yamen, as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.|$|E

25|$|The burning {{sensation}} in muscles during hard exercise {{can be attributed}} to the release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a part of lactic acid. The body falls <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> less efficient but faster method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million years ago (see diagram above right), and thus would represent a more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD+ in cells.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{keywords}} attribute, {{the description}} attribute {{is supported by}} most major search engines, like Yahoo! and Bing, while Google will fall <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> tag when information about the page itself is requested (e.g. using the related: query). The description attribute provides a concise explanation of a Web page's content. This allows the Web page authors to give a more meaningful description for listings than might be displayed if the search engine was unable to automatically create its own description based on the page content. The description is often, but not always, displayed on search engine results pages, so it can affect click-through rates. While clicks for a result can be a positive sign of effective title and description writing, Google does not recognize this meta element as a ranking factor, so using target keyword phrases in that element will not help a site rank better.

25|$|The {{next day}} José, Kate, and Ana arrive for the photo shoot at the Heathman Hotel, where Christian is staying. Christian asks Ana out {{for coffee and}} asks if she's dating anyone, {{specifically}} José. Ana replies {{that she is not}} dating anyone. During the conversation, Ana learns that Christian is also single, but he says he is not romantic. Ana is intrigued but believes she is not attractive enough for Christian. Later, Ana receives a package from Christian containing first edition copies of Tess of the d'Urbervilles, which stuns her. Later that night, Ana goes out drinking with her friends and ends up drunk dialling Christian, who informs her that he will be coming to pick her up because of her inebriated state. Ana goes outside to get some fresh air, and José attempts to kiss her, but he is stopped by Christian's arrival. Ana leaves with Christian, but not before she discovers that Kate has been flirting with Christian's brother, Elliot. Later, Ana wakes to find herself in Christian's hotel room, where he scolds her for not taking proper care of herself. Christian then reveals {{that he would like to}} have sex with her. He initially says that Ana will first have to fill out paperwork, but later goes <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> statement after making out with her in the elevator.|$|E

500|$|Élisabeth de Gramont, the Duchess of Clermont-Tonnerre, was {{a writer}} {{best known for her}} popular memoirs. A {{descendant}} of Henry IV of France, she had grown up among the aristocracy; when she was a child, according to Janet Flanner, [...] "peasants on her farm... begged her not to clean her shoes before entering their houses". She looked <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> lost world of wealth and privilege with little regret, and became known as the [...] "red duchess" [...] for her support of socialism. [...] She was married and had two daughters in 1910, when she met Barney; her husband {{is said to have been}} violent and tyrannical. They eventually separated, and in 1918 she and Barney wrote up a marriage contract stating: [...] "No one union shall be so strong as this union, nor another joining so tender—nor relationship so lasting." ...|$|E
500|$|In an April 2010 {{interview}} with South Yorkshire newspaper The Star, Grant expressed his disappointment with the side-project band's sudden increase in success and awareness, {{in which he}} claimed that he wanted the band to continue playing in clubs with a slower ascendency to the bigger venues. The tour promoter however suggested that Renegades should play slightly bigger venues for the second tour than of those seen on their debut. Looking <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> version of the band, Grant Nicholas explained in an {{interview with}} Culture Deluxe, that the project was not a big marketing plan, but announced it without saying exactly what was happening. Some people thought it was a name change, Grant recording a solo album, while others got the idea from the start. He described problems with promoters printing [...] "Feeder" [...] on the tickets, leading to a misunderstanding that a more mainstream set was expected.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot for United Artists (UA) using a cinéma vérité style in {{black-and-white}} and produced {{over a period}} of sixteen weeks. It had a low budget for its time of £200,000 ($500,000) and filming was finished in under seven weeks. At first, the film itself was something of a secondary consideration to UA, whose primary interest was in being able to release the soundtrack album in the United States before Capitol Records (the American EMI affiliate who had first shot at releasing Beatles music in the States) got around to issuing their material; in the words of Bud Ornstein, the European head of production for United Artists: [...] "Our record division wants to get the soundtrack album to distribute in the States, and what we lose on the film we'll get <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> disc." [...] As film historian Stephen Glynn put it, A Hard Day's Night was intended as, [...] "a low-budget exploitation movie to milk the latest brief musical craze for all it was worth." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} post was [...] "a {{fascinating}} {{look at where}} Kanye's head is at these days", and complimented West for his [...] "humility and honesty".

One day, we'll all look <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye." [...] Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink. Mitchell wrote, [...] "Did he just get the last laugh on South Park? Conspiracy!" [...] In response to the media coverage, West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny, but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his [...] "ego epiphany". The next day, he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant, the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke.|$|E
500|$|A {{makeshift}} {{control room}} with tape machines, a mixing console, and other outboard equipment {{was set up}} in Danesmoate's dining room, with the adjacent drawing room used for recording and performing. The large doors separating the rooms were replaced with a glass screen, and to maintain a relaxed [...] "non-studio" [...] atmosphere for the sessions, the control room was dubbed the [...] "lyric room" [...] and the recording space was called the [...] "band room". Lanois' strategy was to encourage the band members to have their parts worked out in advance and to capture as much of the essence of a live band take as possible, without having the possibility of subsequent overdubbing to fall <b>back</b> <b>on.</b> <b>This</b> was a change for U2, who previously recorded each instrument separately and then layered them into the mix. To support his approach of having all the band members recording in a room together, Lanois eschewed having them wear headphones in favour of using monitor speakers due to their power; Mullen and bassist Adam Clayton used two each. To aid in sound isolation, gobos were built in the drawing room, although the production staff still faced issues with audio spill from the monitor speakers. Lanois said that due to the setup, [...] "you have to make a commitment to what you put down and either use it or throw it all away." [...] This recording setup was duplicated at subsequent locations during the album sessions.|$|E

500|$|Just {{before the}} stage-concluding ascent to the hilltop town of Chieti truly began, world time trial {{champion}} Fabian Cancellara, Giovanni Visconti, Dmitriy Muravyev, and world road race champion Thor Hushovd tried a counter-move, but none could keep Cancellara's wheel, {{so they did}} not attain a meaningful advantage and were soon brought back. As the climb began, Michele Scarponi, Philippe Gilbert, Danilo Di Luca, and Damiano Cunego went on the attack and gapped off some of their rivals. Ivan Basso and Cadel Evans at first rode more conservatively, but did bridge back up. Scarponi was the strongest of the attackers, quickly surging {{to the front of}} the race. Gilbert and then Evans in succession tried to make their way up to him. Cunego marked each move and stayed in their slipstream, so that should the man he was following catch Scarponi, he would be fresher to attack and take victory for his team. Since his teammate was up the road, he did not help either in the chase. Scarponi faded toward the end but held on for victory by a few bike lengths. When it was clear that Scarponi would win the day, Cunego put in a finishing kick to take second place ahead of Evans, giving [...] the top two finishers on the day. Scarponi also won in Chieti in the 2010 Tirreno–Adriatico. The gruppetto containing the sprinters, including overnight race leader Tyler Farrar, was 17 minutes back, so there was a new leader after this stage. That was Robert Gesink, still well-placed because of 's win in the team time trial, but he had had his advantage narrowed by finishing 12 seconds <b>back</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> stage.|$|E
