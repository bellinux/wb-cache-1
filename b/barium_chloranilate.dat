40|$|Some anions (sulphate) may be {{determined}} by their reaction with a slightly dissociated or slightly soluble compound (<b>barium</b> <b>chloranilate),</b> another anion (chloranilate ion) being liberated and its extinction measured. An equation is given in this paper {{for the relationship between}} the concentration of sulphate and the extinction. For low concentrations the equation is non-linear. A calibration curve, prepared under standardised conditions, agrees well with theory. It shows a precision of about 5 % at 20 μg of sulphate. At higher levels the precision is slightly better. It is proved that many interferences of foreign ions may be explained quantitatively by consideration of the activity coefficients. The scope of this method is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Alkyl sulfatase was {{induced by}} growth on {{nutrient}} broth plus {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) in a bacterium we have designated Pseudomonas C 12 B. Measurement of the radioactivity of S 35 O 4 = released from SDS 35 by the enzyme in cell-free extracts provided an effective assay technique. The <b>barium</b> <b>chloranilate</b> assay for release of SO 4 = from SDS was somewhat less sensitive but effective if analyzed at 332 mμ. This test was only approximately 55 % as sensitive if analyzed at 530 mμ. The activity of the glyoxylate bypass enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthetase, was significantly stimulated by growth of the bacteria on SDS as the sole carbon source, but not by growth on nutrient broth or nutrient broth plus SDS...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automatic procedure employing a reagent {{in the form}} of a slurry in a flow-injection system. The feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated by sulphate determination in water using the <b>Barium</b> <b>Chloranilate</b> method, which is based on the precipitation of barium sulphate. The release of a stoichiometric amount of highly colored chloranilic ions is monitored at 528 nm. The reaction is carried out in alcoholic medium in order to reduce the solubility of the reagent. A considerable improvement in the sensitivity is attained by adding ferric ions to the released chloranilic ions. An on-line filtration step to separate the excess reagent from the released chloranilic ions was necessary. In addition, a column containing a cation exchange resin was included in the manifold to remove potentially interfering ions. The proposed procedure is suitable for 30 determinations per hour and the relative standard deviation is less than 2 %. The analytical curve is linear between 0. 0 and 40 mg L- 1 and the determination limit is about 2. 0 mg L- 1 SO 4 (2 -). Accuracy was confirmed by running several samples already analysed by a standard turbidimetric procedure...|$|E
