50|$|The inner {{diameter}} of dredge ball joint pipes ranges from 400 mm to 1200 mm. Dredge <b>ball</b> joint <b>liners</b> {{can be produced}} from steel and hard iron materials. To allow for variations of the tilting angle, the ball turning angle of a dredge ball joint is 15 degrees to 18 degrees, and the discharge pipe variation for a dredge ball joint ranges from 10 mm to 30 mm. The dredge ball joints are made to operate at low, medium and high pressure.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} liner wear and the {{changing}} characteristics of the ability of crushing and grinding in the coal pulverizer are analyzed, {{a new type of}} cylinder liner is developed, which has a multi-step wave crest. The small <b>balls</b> on the <b>liner</b> are stuck by the steps, in this way, the wear of the liner wave crest is lightened, so it can keep a long-term stability, it also can take the balls to a reasonable height, increase the number of the balls which are taken by the wave crest and make the dropping points scattered, as result of that, it substantially increased the coal pulverizer's crushing and grinding efficiency; Also the wave crest of the liner can be dismantled from the base plate and individually replaced, so it made a great reduce in the material consumption of liner. The test shows that, with appropriate use of the <b>balls,</b> the <b>liner</b> can reduce the ball charge by 35 - 50 %, reduce power consumption by 30 - 40 %，it also can keep the coal pulverizer's output and improve milling fineness...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as <b>liners</b> in <b>ball</b> mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. <b>Ball</b> mills require <b>liners</b> that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as <b>liners</b> in their <b>ball</b> mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make <b>ball</b> mill <b>liners</b> out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per <b>ball</b> mill <b>liner</b> replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as <b>ball</b> mill <b>liners...</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{line drive}} or a liner. This is a sharply hit, low-flying batted ball. The {{threshold}} between a line drive and a fly <b>ball</b> is subjective; <b>liners</b> {{tend to have}} little noticeable arc. Liners {{also tend to be}} the hardest balls to catch because of their speed and rapid descent; however, very fast liners hit directly to an infielder are often caught by instinct without the need for judgment, making the catch easy though perhaps unexpected. Line drives can be especially dangerous to baseball players and spectators. As recently as July 22, 2007, Tulsa Drillers first base coach Mike Coolbaugh was killed in a line drive accident at a minor league stadium in Little Rock.|$|R

40|$|The {{grinding}} {{efficiency of}} semi autogenous milling or ball milling {{depends on the}} tumbling motion of the total charge within the mill. Utilization of this tumbling motion for efficient breakage of particles depends on the conditions inside the mill. However, any kind of monitoring device to measure the conditions inside the mill shell during operation is virtually impossible due to the severe environment presented by the tumbling charge. An instrumented grinding ball, which {{is capable of surviving}} a few hours and transmitting the impacts it experiences, is proposed here. The spectrum of impacts collected over 100 revolutions of the mills presents the signature of the grinding environment inside mill. This signature could be effectively used to optimize the milling performance by investigating this signature's relation to mill product size, mill throughput, make-up ball size, mill speed, <b>liner</b> profile and <b>ball</b> addition rates. At the same time, it {{can also be used to}} design <b>balls</b> and <b>liner</b> systems that can survive longer in the mill.

The technological advances made in electronics and communication makes this leap in instrumentation certainly viable. Hence, the instrumented grinding ball offers the ability to qualitatively observe and optimize the milling environment. An instrumented load cell package that can measure the force of impacts inside the grinding chamber of a mill is developed here. The signal from the instrumented load cell package is interpreted in terms of a histogram termed as an impact spectrum which is a plot of the number of impacts at a specific energy level against the energy. It reflects on the average force regime of the mill. The instrumented load cell package was calibrated against the ultra fast load cell which has been unanimously accepted as a standard to measure single breakage events. The load cell package was successfully used to produce impact spectra in an 8. 5 inch lab scale mill. The mill speed and the ball size were varied to study their effect on the impact spectra. A good correlation was found between the process variables and the impact spectra. The load cell package was then used in a 16 inch pilot scale mill. The mill speed, ball size, and mill filling were varied here and a consistent trend between these variables and impact spectra was observed. With a better understanding developed from the initial tests, the design of the load cell package was significantly changed to eliminate noise. With the new design, the impact spectra were re-determined in the 16 inch pilot mill varying the process variables - ball size, mill speed, and mill filling. Finally, it is successfully shown that a change in the operating variables of a mill can be seen in the impact spectra and that this concept can be successfully developed to monitor the grinding operation of industrial mills. To adapt it to industrial level it is mandatory to make the load cell package wireless. A design of a wireless circuit that is capable of transferring data at the required speed of 1000 kbps was also developed and tested at Cortez Gold Mines (CGM), Nevada...|$|R
