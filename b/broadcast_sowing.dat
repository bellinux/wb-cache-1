50|$|Weeds are {{the major}} biotic {{stresses}} for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, {{which leads to a}} relatively slow development in early growing stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species Eleusine indica (common name Indian goose grass) is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in early growing stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides Eleusine indica, the species Xanthium strumarium, which is animal disperesed and the stolon-owning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing</b> in order to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and Eleusine indica easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds.

The book begins by providing evidence from his own crop trials in favour of the seed drill, claiming yield increases of up to 20% over the traditional method of <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing.</b> The book then gives detailed instructions, accompanied by illustrations, for the construction of Amos's own drill machines (in two versions), a drill plough and two other devices (an expanding horse-hoe and scuffle).

It is known from Arthur Young's comments that not only Major Cartwright but at least one other Lincolnshire farmer used Amos's design, but it is unclear how many others adopted it. The expanding horse-hoe had moveable shares that, unlike its main rivals, could be adjusted to suit the differing distances at which seed had been drilled. Amos's cheap and practicable drill plough was adopted by Arthur Young who in turn commended it to the Board of Agriculture and several others.|$|E

40|$|Introduction In {{order to}} be able to adapt to {{changing}} environmental conditions, crop plants need a certain degree of diversity (Stevens 1942, Finckh 2008). The development of genetically diverse populations (composite cross populations, CCPs) instead of breeding entirely homogeneous pure line varieties by standard pedigree breeding methods is a strategy that aims at creating flexible varieties. Material and Methods Three winter wheat CCPs from the UK based on 20 modern wheat varieties (A) or a subset of either 12 high quality varieties (Q) or 9 high yielding parents (Y) were used. Since the F 5 the CCPs have been grown under organic (O) and conventional (C) conditions in two parallel sets at the University of Kassel without artificial selection applied. In addition, since the F 8 two A populations have been maintained as <b>broadcast</b> <b>sown</b> populations without mechanical weed control. In 2011 / 12 the F 11 of all 14 populations were compared in a replicated field trial to the mixture of the 20 parents and the three commercial wheat cultivars Achat, Akteur, and Capo. N-uptake of the plants was measured at the beginning of stem elongation, at the flowering stage and in the ripe seeds and straw. Samples of fresh plants were cut and dried for 72 hours at 60 °C. Seeds and straw were dried after harvesting and all samples were milled and analyzed for N-content using a CHN analyzer. Nmin in the soil was measured in early spring, at the flowering stage and after harvest. Results and Discussion Overall, the differences among the populations in N-uptake appeared small. However, when comparing the conventionally and organically grown populations as two groups, in 2011, at flowering O- populations had taken up approximately 6...|$|R

40|$|Pulse {{crops in}} Bangladesh are mainly low-input rainfed crops with <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing.</b> Since the 1990 s, rotary tillage two-wheel {{tractors}} (2 WT) have largely replaced animal draft for crop establishment. However, rotary tillage causes excessive evaporation from seedbeds in rapidly-drying soils. Therefore 2 WT-based minimum tillage (MT) options were explored to optimize seedbed moisture for lentil and chickpea establishment. Two types of 2 WT-mounted seeding units were manufactured, a strip tiller retaining rotary blades only {{in front of}} the tynes and a tyne seeder in which the rotary tiller shaft is removed. In some soil types, seedling emergence and grain yields of lentil and chickpea with these seeders matched those with broadcasting. In wet soils, the minimal soil disturbance with MT resulted in anaerobic conditions around seedling roots thereby limiting root growth and nodulation. In clay soils with rapid surface drying traction was inadequate for tyne tillage and strip tillage could not adequately penetrate rice paddy hardpans to allow adequate growth of seedling roots. Potential solutions to these limitations are under test so that 2 WT-based MT can be adapted for more timely and economic sowing of crops, including pulses, in smallholder plots and to achieve the agronomic benefits of line sowing over <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing...</b>|$|E

40|$|European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) pose a {{major threat}} to {{agricultural}} production and conservation values in several countries. In New Zealand, population control via poisoning is a frontline method for limiting rabbit damage, with large areas commonly treated using the metabolic toxin sodium fluoroacetate (' 1080 ') delivered in bait via aerial dispersal. However, this method is expensive and the high application rates of the active ingredient cause public antipathy towards it. To guide reductions in cost and toxin usage, we evaluated the economics and efficacy of rabbit control using an experimental approach of sowing 1080 -bait in strips instead of the commonly-used <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing</b> method (i. e. complete coverage). Over a 4 -year period we studied aerial delivery of 0. 02 % 1080 on diced carrot bait over ~ 3500 ha of rabbit-prone land in the North and South islands. In each case, experimental sowing via strip patterns using 10 - 15 kg of bait per hectare was compared with the current best practice of aerial <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing</b> at 30 - 35 kg/ha. Operational kill rates exceeded 87 % in all but one case and averaged 93 - 94 % across a total of 19 treatment replicates under comparable conditions; there was no statistical difference in overall efficacy observed between the two sowing methods. We project that strip-sowing could reduce by two thirds the amount of active 1080 applied per hectare in aerial control operations against rabbits, both reducing the non-target poisoning risk and promoting cost savings to farming operations. These results indicate that, similarly to the recently-highlighted benefits of adopting strip-sowing for poison control of introduced brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand, aerial strip-sowing of toxic bait could also be considered a best practice method for rabbit control in pest control policy...|$|E

30|$|The differing ecologies of the rufipogon {{perennial}} and nivara annual ecotypes of {{the wild}} rice imply differing modes of hunter-gatherer exploitation and the importance and intensity of early cultivation that was necessary (Fuller and Qin 2009). The perennial rufipogon would have normally been a fairly poor grain resource, with more metabolic energy invested in vegetative tissues. This necessitated human manipulation of soil and water environment to induce a drought response of higher grain productivity. Over time {{there would have been}} selection for more annuality and reduced vegetative growth (shorter and straighter growth habit), as well as increasing grain yields and grain size. Thus more intensive human efforts at managing the soil and water conditions of early cultivated rufipogon would have been repaid by increasing yields and the accumulation of domestication genes. The archaeological evidence from the Lower Yangtze supports this inferred process (Fuller and Qin 2009, 2010). By contrast, the annual O. nivara wild rices could have been exploited on a large scale without any serious cultivation, or selection of habit changes or domestication traits. This represents a “proto-indica” hypothesis (Fuller et al. 2010 a) in which intensive exploitation of proto-indica wild types, which probably included burning off competing vegetation and some <b>broadcast</b> <b>sowing,</b> could have taken place for millennia without the evolution of domesticated rice (Fuller 2011).
