40|$|Type- 1 Diabetes {{mellitus}} (T 1 D) {{management is}} important to increase {{the quality of life}} in diabetic children. This research aimed to explore and to compare the parents and children perspective in the quality of life related to T 1 D. Cross sectional method was used to 35 dyad children (8 - 18 years old) and their parents. Children have been registered in top referral hospital in Indonesia. They filled the PedsQL® Module Diabetes 3. 2 by self-report. Data were analyzed by t-test. The characteristic of respondents consist of the children and parents age, length of <b>being</b> <b>diagnoses</b> with T 1 D and the number of visit in the last 6 months.   Quality of life dimensions were measured in the last month since data collected. It consists of sign and symptom, disease and therapy, T 1 D management concern related to complication and communication. The result showed that the children mean age was 13. 11 + 2. 85 years old compared to parents (41. 03 + 8. 34 years old). The average length of <b>being</b> <b>diagnoses</b> with T 1 D was 4. 54 + 2. 87 years and the average number of visit in the last 6 months was 5. 8 + 1. 79. Total score of quality of life from parents and children perspective were 64. 41 % + 10. 97 and 63. 09 % + 13. 25. Moreover, t-test analysis found that there was significant difference in parent perspective compared to the children perspective regarding quality of life related to T 1 D. In conclusion, children have relatively lower perception in evaluating their quality of life in T 1 D compared to the parents. Therefore, it is necessary for nurses to explore the influencing factors as well as coping mechanism related to T 1 D management so that nurses can develop individual nursing plan to increase the T 1 D children's quality of life...|$|R
