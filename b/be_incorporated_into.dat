5|$|As {{the number}} of {{cavities}} {{play a vital role}} in moulding costs, so does the complexity of the part's design. Complexity can <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> many factors such as surface finishing, tolerance requirements, internal or external threads, fine detailing or {{the number of}} undercuts that may be incorporated.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accuracy}} {{was important}} to many British designers, resulting {{in the use of}} genuine military equipment as models for memorials, and long discussions with committees over the details to <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> designs. In contrast, the British interest in accurately depicting real weaponry from the war was far less common on German monuments, where usually stylised medieval weapons and armour were used.|$|E
50|$|In eastern Europe also, old pagan traditions <b>were</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Christmas celebrations, {{an example}} being the Koleda, which <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the Christmas carol.|$|R

5|$|On June 29, 2006, the Court {{issued a}} 5–3 {{decision}} holding {{that it had}} jurisdiction, and that the administration did not have authority to set up these particular military commissions without congressional authorization, {{because they did not}} comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention (which the court found to <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the Uniform Code of Military Justice).|$|E
5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} {{a clear distinction}} between the real world and the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the real world.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst to refurbish St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E
50|$|On 1 January 1964 the {{district}} of Rudsgrendi with 21 inhabitants <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Notodden municipality to the east. The rest of Hovin, with 461 inhabitants, <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Tinn.|$|R
50|$|Although Laudium was {{initially}} part of Pretoria, it <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Centurion following {{the end of}} apartheid. Centurion, including Laudium, <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in 2000.|$|R
25|$|Large exclaves {{affected}} by the 1844 Act included the County Durham exclaves of Islandshire, Bedlingtonshire and Norhamshire, which <b>were</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Northumberland; and the Halesowen exclave of Shropshire, which <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Worcestershire.|$|R
5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for arable land. Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of the capital Sydney, including one to find an overland route to Jervis Bay, an area which would later <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 Charles Throsby, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.|$|E
5|$|Highway27 was {{designated}} as a two lane road travelling north from Highway2 (Lake Shore Boulevard) towards Barrie. As Toronto grew outwards following the annexation of various municipalities, the Ontario Department of Highways (DHO) began planning for a bypass of the city, aptly named the Toronto Bypass. A significant portion of this bypass was designed to <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the Transprovincial Highway, now Highway401. The remainder was designed to follow the existing right-of-way of Highway27 between the QEW and Richview Sideroad (now Eglinton Avenue).|$|E
5|$|Much of {{what was}} {{included}} in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> {{the final version of the}} Constitution without debate. Examples of these details included the Speech and Debate Clause, which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.|$|E

50|$|Al-Tall was {{captured}} by the Carmeli Brigade during Operation Ben-Ami. Following the war the area <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the State of Israel, but the village's land has not <b>been</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> any municipality or village.|$|R
50|$|A Romanesque window {{probably}} from this church <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> St. Peter's, the Church of Ireland parish church of Ferns. Face corbels {{from the church}} <b>were</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the wellhouse built over St Mogue's Well.|$|R
5|$|Plant virus {{particles}} or virus-like particles (VLPs) have applications in both biotechnology and nanotechnology. The capsids of most plant viruses are simple and robust structures {{and can be}} produced in large quantities either by the infection of plants or by expression {{in a variety of}} heterologous systems. Plant {{virus particles}} can be modified genetically and chemically to encapsulate foreign material and can <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> supramolecular structures for use in biotechnology.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The coil of the {{transducer}} adds some inductance on {{the electrical}} {{side of the}} filter. It is common practice to add a capacitor in parallel with the coil so that an additional resonator is formed which can <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the filter design. While this will not improve performance {{to the extent that}} an additional mechanical resonator would, there is some benefit and the coil has to be there in any case.|$|E
50|$|Neukieritzsch is a {{municipality}} in the Leipzig district, in Saxony, Germany. On 1 April 2008, {{the former}} municipality of Lobstädt <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Neukieritzsch. On 1 July 2014, the former municipality of Deutzen <b>was</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> Neukieritzsch.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of the submarine commenced in May 1983, when the government released a request for tender and approached seven of the world's nine diesel-electric submarine manufacturers for submissions. The submissions would be narrowed down to two based on the provided information, with these undergoing a funded study to determine the winning design. Tendering companies had to demonstrate how Australian industries would <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the project, {{and that they were}} willing to establish an Australia-based consortium to construct the submarines. All seven companies responded {{by the end of the}} year: the combined submissions totalling four tonnes (9,000lb) of paper.|$|E
5|$|The {{ytterbium}} +3 ion {{is used as}} a {{doping material}} in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly efficient, have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; ytterbium can also easily <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the material used to make the laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm–1µm, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for efficient lasers and power scaling.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{architect}} Robert Smirke was appointed in December 1834 {{to design a}} replacement palace, pressure from the former MP Lieutenant Colonel Sir Edward Cust to open the process up to a competition gained popularity {{in the press and}} led to the formation in 1835 of a Royal Commission. This body determined in which style the new construction should be built, and in June they decided that either Elizabethan or gothic styles should be used. The commission also decided that although competitors would not be required to follow the outline of the original palace, the surviving buildings of Westminster Hall, the Undercroft Chapel and the Cloisters of St Stephen's should all <b>be</b> <b>incorporated</b> <b>into</b> the new complex.|$|E
