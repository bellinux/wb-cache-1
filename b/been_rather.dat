5|$|Anna Komnene {{described}} the proceedings with very repetitive details, with Bohemond frequently pointing {{out his own}} mistakes and praising the benevolence of Alexios and the Empire; the proceedings must have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> humiliating for Bohemond. On the other hand, Anna's work was meant to praise her father and {{the terms of the}} treaty may not be entirely accurate.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E
5|$|However, Judge Langlois {{receives}} a letter informing {{him of the}} genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.|$|E
5000|$|The spire of the claviform, {{light brown}} shell <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> low, its protoconch large and rather blunt. The whorls <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> convex, lacking an angle or shoulder. The shell is {{sculptured}} overall by raised spiral threads. The body whorl <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> quadrate. The aperture is oblong. The wide siphonal canal <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> short. The columella is straight. The anal sinus is deep and wide.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 24-27 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> glossy ochreous-fuscous, {{with a faint}} purple tinge. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light-fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous, slightly purplish tinged and the terminal edge is dark fuscous. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
5|$|At 18:35, {{although}} Meldrum {{believed they}} {{could at least}} hold where they were, the regiment was ordered by Chetwode to withdraw. At 19:00 horse teams arrived to recover the guns, and at 19:45 they slowly retired back to the suburbs of Gaza. At 21:40 they rejoined the brigade and left the town. The next morning at 08:30 they arrived at Deir El Belah, where the division was now located. Casualties during the battle had again <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> light, at one dead and nineteen wounded. They had captured 197 prisoners, {{as well as the}} guns and field hospital.|$|E

25|$|Some have judged Bahram V to have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> a weak monarch, {{after the}} heart of the grandees and the priests. He is said to have built many great fire-temples, with large gardens and villages (Tabari).|$|E

25|$|To Petrarch, his Africa was his croce e delizia for {{the rest}} of his life. Petrarch set great store by Africa and his other classicizing works, but the epic was not {{particularly}} well-received because of the literary transposition from Livy; the two parts of the death of Magone and the love story of Sofonisba have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> better received.|$|E
25|$|The later part of Greco-Buddhist art {{in northwestern}} India is usually {{associated}} with the Kushan Empire. The Kushans were nomadic people who started migrating from the Tarim Basin in Central Asia from around 170 BC and ended up founding an empire in northwestern India from the 2nd century BC, after having <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> Hellenized through their contacts with the Greco-Bactrians, and later the Indo-Greeks (they adopted the Greek script for writing).|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{inside the}} Kandyan kingdom became increasingly unstable and during Rajasingha's reign {{many of the}} powerful families that came to dominate Kandyan politics in the 18th century acquired greater power. It {{is interesting to note}} that attempts on Rajasingha's life appear to have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> commonplace. Rajasingha's reign also saw a gradual diminution of the Kandyans' dreams of reuniting Sri Lanka under a single, native, crown.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> light glossy grey with the discal stigmata moderately large, cloudy and dark grey. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> thinly scaled and light grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 23-24 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous, strewn throughout {{with fine}} pale ochreous-fuscous strigulae {{and with a}} dark fuscous discal dot at three-fifths. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 18 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> elongate and pale greyish-ochreous, with some scattered fuscous and blackish specks and markings formed of dense blackish-fuscous irroration. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
25|$|S. T. Karnick, National Review (May 10, 2002) — Timothy Hutton, {{who also}} serves as {{executive}} producer for the show, is just brilliant as Archie Goodwin, managing to express the gumshoe's toughness (which I had <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> skeptical {{of his ability to}} do) as effectively as he shows his moral strength and emotional complexity. … Chaykin quite simply is Nero Wolfe, playing the role with impressive confidence and subtlety.|$|E
25|$|Frederick Muller— {{the film}} editor for The Trial, Chimes at Midnight and the CBS Special Orson Bag was {{fortunate}} to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version— was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but {{with the addition of}} ad hoc sound and music, it probably would have <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> successful.|$|E
25|$|Although David Hewlett had <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> {{focused on}} the actors and the acting before, he started paying more {{attention}} to old style comedy film-making such as works of Monty Python and director Blake Edwards. In general, old-fashioned comedies would appeal more to him than comedy films of recent history. Hewlett said he copied some old-fashioned techniques into his own project. He specifically mentioned A Fish Called Wanda and Fawlty Towers as major influences.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 14-16 mm. The forewings are fuscous-grey {{with the}} extreme costal edge whitish anteriorly. The stigmata <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> large, blackish, the plical directly beneath the first discal. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 16-17 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous, {{slightly and}} irregularly whitish-sprinkled {{and with a}} small white discal dot at three-fifths and a dark fuscous terminal line. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark fuscous.|$|R

25|$|Hughes was {{a notorious}} {{consumer}} {{of alcohol and}} food. Towards {{the end of his}} career, this was felt to have increased damage to his knees, and may have ultimately led to a shortening of his Australian and Victorian playing careers. Having always <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> overweight, he participated in both seasons of Channel Nine's Celebrity Overhaul to lose weight and improve his fitness. He was the top performer (weight-wise) in the first season of the show.|$|E
25|$|Land reform {{expanded}} {{under his}} administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an {{integrated rural development}} approach, providing {{tens of thousands of}} small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers and access to credit. An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration and/or purchased by large bauxite companies.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of Mg2+ transport {{appears to have}} <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> complicated. Proteins apparently based on MgtE are present in bacteria and metazoa, but are missing in fungi and plants, whilst proteins apparently related to CorA are present {{in all of these}} groups. The two active transport transporters present in bacteria, MgtA and MgtB, do not appear to have any homologies in higher organisms. There are also Mg2+ transport systems that are found only in the higher organisms.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark purplish-fuscous with an oblique ochreous-whitish strigula on the costa at four-fifths, where a faint line of scales is indicated to the tornus. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>rather</b> dark grey.|$|R
50|$|Plug's fellow Jūden-chan and rival, {{who becomes}} her supervisor. She <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> serious {{when it comes}} to work and <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> annoyed with how Plug is {{carrying}} out her job. In turn, Plug finds Allesta irritating for interfering with her work and the two girls tend to fight a lot. She sometimes ends up crying, which Plug uses as blackmail material. Compared to Plug, Allesta <b>is</b> <b>rather</b> busty, which causes Plug to tease her about that.|$|R

25|$|The art of Eastern Catholicism {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> {{closer to the}} Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in {{countries}} near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences. The Black Madonna of Częstochowa {{may well have been}} of Byzantine origin - it has been repainted and this is hard to tell. Other images that are certainly of Greek origin, like the Salus Populi Romani and Our Lady of Perpetual Help, both icons in Rome, have been subjects of specific veneration for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Common Sense was {{immensely popular}} in {{disseminating}} {{to a very}} wide audience ideas that were already in common use among the elite who comprised Congress and the leadership cadre of the emerging nation, who rarely cited Paine's arguments in their public calls for independence. The pamphlet probably had little direct influence on the Continental Congress' decision to issue a Declaration of Independence, since that body was more concerned with how declaring independence would affect the war effort. Paine's great contribution was in initiating a public debate about independence which had previously <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> muted.|$|E
25|$|The Loire hosts about 64% of {{nesting bird}} species of France, that is 164 species, of which 54 are water birds, 44 species are common for managed forests, 41 to natural forests, 13 {{to open and}} 12 to rocky areas. This {{avifauna}} has <b>been</b> <b>rather</b> stable, at least between the 1980s and 2000s, with significant abundance variations observed only for 17 species. Of those, five species were growing in population, four declining, and other eight were fluctuating. Some of these variations had a global nature, such as {{the expansion of the}} Mediterranean gull in Europe.|$|E
