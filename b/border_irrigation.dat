The University's scientific and teaching interest looked for a systematic botanical collection representing the botanical sphere, while the Society aimed to maximise its utility for agriculture. The city finally yielded the promised ground to the University in 1798, but planting was soon suspended, apparently due to the poor quality of the soil and the inconveniences caused to the adjacent promenade of the Albereda. In 1802 the city offered a new and definitive site, which could be irrigated in the traditional way, by <b>border</b> <b>irrigation,</b> directly from the Rovella irrigation channel.

40|$|A zero inertia {{mathematical}} model {{as described by}} Strelkoff and Katopodes (1977 b) was used to simulate irrigations in blocked-end or ponded sloping borders. The model {{is based on the}} assumption that inertia is negligible. A linearization method was then used to decrease the difficulty and expense of the solution. The resulting mathematical expressions were solved with a double sweep technique. <b>Border</b> <b>irrigations</b> were simulated, using the model, for selected intake families (soil infiltration characteristics), required depths of infiltration, discharge rates, lengths, times of application, slopes, and roughness values. The output from the model, including the depth of infiltration, the maximum depth of flow at the upper end of the border, the maximum depth of ponding at the downstream end and the application efficiency, was used to develop the design charts for ponded sloping <b>irrigation</b> <b>borders.</b> These were combined with the operational input parameters to provide the design charts for a given intake family, slope and roughness. Since the same input parameters apply, the design charts developed can be used for ponded or free outflow borders. In cases of free outflow borders, ponding is replaced by runoff. Ponding can improve application efficiency over free outflow borders, provided that ponding affects a significant length of the border. Where runoff can not be reused, ponding or end-blocking a border strip is recommended. The maximum potential application efficiencies, on ponded <b>borders,</b> with adequate <b>irrigation</b> and minimum deep percolation were determined, with respect to intake family, required depth of infiltration, slope, roughness and length of run. A sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of infiltration showed that it is better to underestimate than to overestimate infiltration. The effects of roughness and slope on irrigation efficiencies and depth of ponding were also studied.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at South Island Dairy Event (SIDE) conference, 5 - 7 July 1999, Christchurch. Irrigation {{has been a}} frequently discussed subject in New Zealand for many years. A book called Practical Irrigation was written by John McKeague and published in Ashburton in 1899, 100 years ago. Although there were some small developments in irrigation from that time, it wasn't until the 1930 s that state-funded irrigation schemes progressed {{as we know them}} today. All of the early schemes were surface water <b>irrigation</b> schemes - <b>border</b> strip <b>irrigation</b> and wild flooding. Spray irrigation was introduced on private schemes in the 1960 s and later on into some of the state-funded schemes. However, even in the early 1980 s the majority of the new schemes utilised <b>border</b> strip <b>irrigation.</b> The interesting thing about these developments is that the surface water irrigation systems were often constructed on soils that were likely to result in low water use efficiency. In fact, in some of the later schemes, provision was made for drainage to prevent water-logging of farms at the bottom of schemes. Using water efficiently {{did not appear to be}} high priority. The situation is changing rapidly. Irrigation efficiency is one of the key issues facing irrigation farmers and water managers in New Zealand. The general population is now much more environmentally aware than in the past and sees inefficient water use as a threat to environmental sustainability. Farmers may be forced to irrigate efficiently by being allocated water on an efficient basis. To maintain access to water, there will also be more pressure on farmers to demonstrate that they are using water effectively and efficiently. On most of the irrigated dairy farms in the South Island, irrigation is a necessary part of the farming enterprise, because without irrigation, dairy farming would not be viable in these areas. Maintaining access to water, therefore, is vital...|$|R

40|$|Advances in {{mathematical}} modelling {{and the availability}} of high speed computers with considerable memory size is making it possible to study the hydraulics of <b>border</b> <b>irrigation</b> in a greater depth than every before. A zero inertia mathematical model was found to be reliable and inexpensive among the models available in <b>border</b> <b>irrigation</b> hydraulics and was used for this study to simulate free outflow flowing <b>border</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Special emphasis was given to the runoff produced from such a system. This study dealt particularly with, the identification of pertinent open channel variables affecting runoff in <b>border</b> <b>irrigation,</b> presentation of predictive graphical and mathematical solution to quantify runoff, and with utilization of these solutions in developing reuse system design criteria. Inflow rate, surface resistance, border slope, soil infiltration characteristics, application time (time of cutoff and length of run of the border) were among other variables studied. As one might expect, runoff was found to increase with slope, flow rate, application time and decrease with increase in infiltration rate, length of run and bed and vegetation drag. Considering the number of variables affecting runoff characteristics from a given irrigation, it was obvious to see a thorough examination of each variable in dimensional terms was practically impossible. Also, presentation of the results would have required too many graphs. Dimensional anslysis was used to solve this problem and in developing dimensionless runoff curves. The ability to quantify runoff made it possible to develop reuse system design formula for proper sizing of reuse systems under several operational requirements. Shape function for the ultimate infiltrated depth profile was used to get times of runoff and also calculate various efficiencies which are useful for evaluating the system. The study shows, through the use of reuse system, the potential application efficiency can be changed from present values of 60 percent to 90 percent in Arizona. It also can be used to demonstrate the saving in energy that can be realized through such system.

40|$|Irrigation has {{different}} impacts on soils. The most studied negative impacts are related with salinity, sodicity or soil contamination {{because of poor}} irrigation water quality or rising water tables. It is assumed that with suitable water quality the impact of irrigation on soil is positive. However, there are publications showing that under certain conditions long-term freshwater irrigation may cause soil fertility deterioration. Therefore a hypothesis has appeared that some Mexican soils may also be degraded. The objective of our study was to compare some properties of agricultural soils irrigated for more than 30 years with freshwater with non-irrigated virgin soils in different climatic zones. The principle agricultural crops studied were corn and wheat. The impact of furrow and <b>border</b> strip <b>irrigation</b> on soils were positive under arid climatic conditions, but in semi-arid, semi-humid and humid conditions irrigation gradually caused deterioration of soil fertility because of annual leaching of organic matter and exchangeable calcium.

Thus, irrigation itself can induce changes in soil fertility. Therefore, in semi-arid, semi-humid and humid conditions of Mexico {{it is appropriate to}} reduce irrigation water losses.

In a state such as Utah where the water supply is limited, it is essential to find methods of saving water while maintaining high productivity. Proper management of irrigation water can result in water conservation. For this study, an irrigation district in Northern Utah was selected as a case study called the Bear River Canal Company. The main canal command area encompasses 26500 hectares and the principal crops are alfalfa, corn, hay and small grains. The majority of the irrigators practice basin or <b>border</b> surface <b>irrigation.</b> The soils are mostly silty loam and silty clay loam, with 7 main soil classifications covering the irrigated area.

40|$|AbstractThe {{scholarly}} {{debate around}} ‘global land grabbing’ is advancing theoretically, methodologically and empirically. This study contributes to these ongoing efforts by investigating {{a set of}} ‘small-scale land acquisitions’ {{in the context of}} a recent boom in banana plantation investments in Luang Namtha Province, Laos. In relation to the actors, scales and processes involved, the banana acquisitions differ from the state-granted large-scale land acquisitions dominating the literature on ‘land grabbing’ in Laos. Starting from the experience of a rural village in Laos, where two Chinese banana investors leased land on six-year contracts in 2010, we trace the strategies employed by the investors to gain access to the land, the experience of the villagers in the process and the outcome of the acquisitions in terms of land use change. The findings reveal how the investors established networks of local middlemen who facilitate negotiations over land directly at the village level, thus enabling them to circumvent any formal involvement of government authorities. The informal acquisition process also ensured a rapid and successful implementation of the plantations with consequent land use change, including the destruction of field structures, plot <b>borders</b> and <b>irrigation</b> systems, as well as erosion and heavy chemical input. Drawing upon the literature on ‘powers of exclusion’ and ‘control grabbing’, the paper argues that despite the apparent small-scale and short-term nature of these leases, the forceful acquisition strategies pursued by the investors coupled with the rapid land use conversion and associated cultivation practices results in strong and longer-term alienation of land from the local communities involved. This implies the need to take these more informal forms of land acquisitions into account when designing policies to address the negative implications of land grabbing in Laos and elsewhere...|$|R

Effect of irrigation treatment on maize biological index was significant in less irrigation times and less irrigation quota. Water production efficiency increased 23. 3 % and yield increased 15. 9 % under film hole irrigation than that of <b>border</b> <b>irrigation.</b> Water consumption of the maximum yield was 3410 m 3 /hm 2 under film hole irrigation...|$|E
40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed. Field-water application efficiency is the precentage of water delivered to a field that is stored in the soil within the root zone of the growing crop. Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation. Each of these methods has charactersitic water losses, but all losses can be classified under evaporation, deep percolation, or runoff. Water-application efficiency studies have been conducted at a number of locations in the United States. This paper summarizes a study conducted near Boise, Idaho to compare the field-water appli• cation efficiencies of the furrow, border, contour border, and sprinkler methods of irrigation of crops in a grain-legume rotation on 3 to 5 per cent slopes.

40|$|Irrigation {{has been}} an {{essential}} part of Utah’s agriculture since pioneer days. Over half of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered using surface methods such as flood, furrow, <b>border,</b> or basin <b>irrigation.</b> About 40 % of the irrigated acreage is under some form of sprinkler irrigation, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot, and other types. Low flow or micro-irrigation systems, including drip emitters, emitter tubes, drip tapes, bubblers and micro-sprinklers (sprays) are currently used on {{only a small fraction of}} the total irrigated area, but will become more common as water becomes more scarce and expensive. Currently, low flow and micro-irrigation is primarily used in orchards, vegetables and landscapes. When designed and operated properly, low flow or micro-irrigation systems apply water more efficiently and uniformly than sprinklers or surface irrigation systems, conserving water and generating higher yield per unit of water applied. Most low-flow systems are designed to operate at pressures of 10 to 25 pounds per square inch (psi). Municipal water systems typically deliver water at 50 to 70 psi. Water pressure can be tested with a pressure gage designed for water systems. Some gages are designed to test static pressure and can be fastened directly onto the hose bib or pipe. Other gauges are designed to test the pressure of flowing water, such as in a sprinkler nozzle, by inserting the tester directly into the stream of water. Simple pressure gages can be purchased at a local plumbing or irrigation supply store. For most low-flow systems, a pressure reducer will need to be installed to provide the manufacturer-recommended pressures for low-flow components and fittings. Be sure to install the pressure reducer before testing for flow rate...|$|R
40|$|Predation is {{increasingly}} pointed out {{as one of}} the factors contributing to population declines of ground-nesting farmland birds, though it remains poorly understood how ongoing transformations of agricultural landscapes affect predator assemblages. This study addressed this issue, estimating the contribution of landscape composition and conﬁguration to spatial variation in species richness and abundances of mammalian carnivores across a gradient of agricultural intensiﬁcation in southern Portugal. The carnivore assemblage was diverse (10 species), but it was largely dominated by just three widespread and abundant species of generalist predators: domestic dog (Canis familiaris), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon). The number of domestic carnivore species and the abundance of cats (Felis catus) increased along with farmland occupation by human dwellings, whereas dogs were not responsive to landscape variables. The species richness of wild carnivores was highest in landscapes with a patchwork of arable ﬁelds and semi-natural habitats such as forests and shrubland, though it was also high in irrigated landscapes with dense networks of irrigation channels and tree lines <b>bordering</b> agricultural ﬁelds. <b>Irrigation</b> was also positively associated with the abundance of otters (Lutra lutra) and mongooses. Cats, foxes, badgers (Meles meles), and total and wild carnivore abundances, were positively affected by increasing cover by eucalyptus and pine forest plantations. In general, results suggest that the highest diversity and abundance of carnivores in Mediterranean farmland may occur in mosaic landscapes with small agricultural ﬁelds, high cover by woody vegetation patches and corridors, and many human dwellings. Preventing scrub encroachment and afforestation may thus be necessary to maintain a low predation risk in open farmland habitats, which are often inhabited by ground-nesting birds of high conservation concern. Conversely, keeping shrubland and forest patches within farmed landscapes may be essential where carnivore persistence is a relevant conservation goal...|$|R
