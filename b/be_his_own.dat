5|$|While in {{his early}} teens, Tolkien had his first {{encounter}} with a constructed language, Animalic, an invention of his cousins, Mary and Marjorie Incledon. At that time, he was studying Latin and Anglo-Saxon. Their interest in Animalic soon died away, but Mary and others, including Tolkien himself, invented {{a new and more}} complex language called Nevbosh. The next constructed language he came to work with, Naffarin, would <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> creation.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> choice.|$|E

While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement.

5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} {{his own money}} into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E

5|$|Putnam himself may <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have {{led him to}} attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one species of animal (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E
5|$|Surviving {{letters from}} the precentor of Chichester Cathedral beg the bishop to come to Chichester over Easter to {{celebrate}} the Easter Mass {{and to deal with}} pressing issues in the diocese. Neville's duties as chancellor kept him from attending to much of the business of his diocese, but he employed clerics to administer the ecclesiastical offices of his diocese and in general his relationship with his cathedral chapter appears to have been good. He employed a teacher of theology for his cathedral, and supported students at schools in Lincoln, Oxford, and Douai. He worked to protect the rights, lands, and privileges of his diocese and cathedral chapter from encroachment by others, both secular and clerical. On one occasion he threatened to excommunicate the Earl of Arundel or the earl's men for hunting on land the bishop considered to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b>|$|E
5|$|The graphic {{novel was}} the first Batman story to be written by Morrison before {{becoming}} a regular writer in future Batman titles. Inspired by previous works like The Dark Knight Returns, Morrison conceived the story to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> different approach to the character, using heavy symbolical references and the deconstruction of many iconic Batman villains. The story follows the vigilante Batman, who is called upon to quell a maddening riot {{taking place in the}} infamous Arkham Asylum, a psychiatric hospital housing the most dangerous supervillains in Gotham City. Inside, Batman confronts many of his enduring rogues gallery, such as the Joker, Two-Face, and Killer Croc, many of them having changed since he last saw them. As Batman ventures deeper, he discovers the origin of how the asylum was established, the history of its builder Amadeus Arkham, and the supernatural and psychological mystery that has been haunting the area.|$|E

5|$|The {{year after}} the Olympics, Dix began {{the season with a}} world-leading time of 10.00seconds in Tallahassee in April. He also set a world-leading relay time of 37.92seconds with Travis Padgett, Shawn Crawford and Darvis Patton at the Penn Relays. However, he failed to {{maintain}} this strong form through the rest of 2009. Coach Teddy Long planned to improve Dix's start and acceleration in his races, but the two parted company in April. He placed third behind Michael Rodgers and Asafa Powell at the Prefontaine Classic but, unusually, this proved to {{one of the highlights of}} a low-profile year for Dix. He competed at the US Championships, but injuries forced him out of both the 100m and 200m races and he did not qualify for the World Championships. Furthermore, he entered a legal battle with his management company, regarding whether they merited the 20% portion of his multimillion-dollar sponsorship contract with Nike. The dispute with his agent Kimberly Holland was resolved in July: although the terms were undisclosed, Dix left Holland's Icon Management and decided to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> agent. With his father as his coach, a legal battle and no major races to prepare for, Dix ran only a handful of local meetings in the rest of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Chinese-owned {{newspaper}} Lay Po in 1923, Tio {{revealed that}} Sair Tjerita Siti Akbari had been {{heavily influenced by}} the 1847 poem Sjair Abdoel Moeloek, credited variously to Raja Ali Haji or his sister Saleha. He noted that Sair Siti Akbari, which Lie stated to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> closely followed the earlier work's plot. In his 1958 biography, Tio revealed that Lie's Tjhit Liap Seng was an amalgamation of two European novels: Jacob van Lennep's Klaasje Zevenster (1865) and Jules Verne's Les Tribulations d'un Chinois en Chine (1879). Tio noted that a third book, Pembalasan Dendam Hati, had extensive parallels with a work by Xavier de Montépin translated as De Wraak van de Koddebeier. In face of these revelations, literary critics such as Tan Soey Bing and Tan Oen Tjeng wrote that none of Lie's writings were original.|$|E
5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to <b>be</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble in the casino and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard. Bond rescues her and kills both gangsters; he makes it look like a murder-suicide.|$|E

But the evidence must be suppressed, and with the view of suppressing it he took the little bag and all the papers down with him to the study.
