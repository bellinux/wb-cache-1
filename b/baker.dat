40|$|Purpose: We {{retrospectively}} compared plain radiographic and MR imaging {{findings of}} acutely ruptured and unruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts {{to determine which}} factors cause rupture of BCs. Materials and Methods: The MR findings for 44 <b>Baker’s</b> cysts (non-ruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts in 30 patients and ruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts in 14 patients) were evaluated. On the MR images, {{the characteristics of the}} <b>Baker’s</b> cysts, meniscal tears, and the quantity of joint effusions were evaluated. On plain radiographs, the grade of osteoarthritis of the affected knee was evaluated. Results: There was no statistically significant difference with respect to the size of <b>Baker’s</b> cysts, meniscal tears, and the grade of osteoarthritis between ruptured and unruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts. The wall thicknesses, inner signal intensities, inner septations, and the quantity of joint effusions were statistically different between the ruptured and unruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts. Conclusion: The most significant imaging finding which influences the rupture of a <b>Baker’s</b> cyst is the quantity of the joint effusion of the affected knee. In management of the patients with <b>Baker’s</b> cysts, the quantity of joint effusions should be kept in mind for preventative or treatment trials involving ruptured <b>Baker’s</b> cysts.

5|$|The {{summer after}} graduation, <b>Baker</b> toured Europe as a celebrity {{correspondent}} for The New York Times, where {{he wrote about}} events like the Henley Royal Regatta. Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, <b>Baker</b> earned about $20 per week. <b>Baker</b> befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though ten years older than <b>Baker,</b> they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed <b>Baker</b> to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced <b>Baker</b> to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom <b>Baker</b> was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, <b>Baker</b> was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bakers</b> {{were often}} {{part of the}} guild system, which was {{well-established}} by the sixteenth century: master <b>bakers</b> instructed apprentices and were assisted by journeymen. In Amsterdam in 1694, for example, the cake-bakers, pie-bakers, and rusk-bakers separated from an earlier Bread <b>Bakers</b> Guild and formed their own guild, regulating the trade. A fraternity of <b>bakers</b> in London existed as early as 1155, according to records of payments to the Exchequer; the Worshipful Company of <b>Bakers</b> was formed by charters dated 1486, 1569, and 1685. The guild still exists today, with mostly ceremonial and charitable functions. Five <b>bakers</b> have served as lord mayor of London.|$|R

At 18, she moved with her family to St. Petersburg, Florida, where she attended St. Petersburg College (then St. Pete Junior College). After her first year in college, <b>Baker</b> began working as a magician's assistant on the vaudeville circuit and joined a dance company, working as a professional dancer. In 1949, <b>Baker</b> won the title of Miss Florida Fruits and Vegetables. In 1951, <b>Baker</b> moved to New York City, where she rented a dirt-floor basement apartment in Queens. She worked as a nightclub dancer and also took stint jobs as a chorus girl in traveling vaudeville shows, which took her to Windsor, Detroit, and New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baker</b> {{has been}} married three times; she first married Louie Ritter in 1953, but the {{marriage}} ended within a year, after which she enrolled at the Actors Studio in New York City. <b>Baker</b> alleged that Ritter had raped {{her when she was}} still a virgin {{in the early stages of}} their relationship. Her second was to director Jack Garfein, a Holocaust survivor she met at the Studio and for whom she converted to Judaism (having been raised a Catholic). They had one daughter, Blanche <b>Baker</b> (born 1956), also an actress; and a son, Herschel Garfein (born 1958), who is a composer and faculty member at the Steinhardt School of Music at New York University. Garfein and <b>Baker</b> divorced in 1969. <b>Baker</b> also has six grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baker</b> {{separated}} from her second husband, Jack Garfein, in 1967, and moved to Europe with her two children {{to pursue a career}} there after struggling to find work in Hollywood. Eventually settling in Rome, Italy, <b>Baker</b> became fluent in Italian and spent the next several years starring in hard-edged Italian thrillers, exploitation, and horror films. In 1966, <b>Baker</b> had been invited to the Venice International Film Festival, where she met director Marco Ferreri, who asked her to play the lead role in Her Harem (1967). This was followed with the horror films The Sweet Body of Deborah (1968) and The Devil Has Seven Faces (1971). <b>Baker</b> also starred in So Sweet... So Perverse (1969), Paranoia (1969), A Quiet Place to Kill (1970), and Il coltello di ghiaccio (Knife of Ice) (1972), all horror films directed by Italian filmmaker Umberto Lenzi.|$|E

5|$|<b>Baker</b> {{was also}} the {{inspiration}} for literary works. In 1913 F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when <b>Baker</b> was a senior. Though he only spoke to <b>Baker</b> once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. His first novel, This Side of Paradise, has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker's middle name, and the minor character Allenby is <b>Baker</b> himself. Mark Goodman's 1985 novel Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies is a fictionalized account of Baker's life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baker</b> {{was born}} in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, the second son of Alfred Thornton <b>Baker,</b> a wealthy upholsterer, and Mary Augusta Pemberton, a socialite. Alfred, known as Bobby to his friends, had played halfback while a student at Princeton University in the 1880s, the same school his father had attended. One of Baker's {{ancestors}} was Francis Rawle, a Quaker who emigrated to Philadelphia in 1688 {{and became one of}} the wealthiest members of the city. <b>Baker</b> was named after his uncle, Dr. Hobart Amory Hare, who was the obstetrician at his birth and president of the Jefferson Medical Hospital in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven, <b>Baker</b> and his twelve-year-old brother Thornton were sent to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. Baker's parents divorced in 1907 and both remarried.|$|E
5|$|<b>Baker</b> {{was named}} {{captain of the}} {{football}} team in 1913, his senior year. Princeton finished {{with a record of}} five wins, two losses, and one tie. Over his three-year football career with the Tigers, <b>Baker</b> scored 180 points, a school record that lasted until 1964 when Cosmo Iacavazzi broke it in the final quarter of his last college game. <b>Baker</b> caught over 900 punts in his career, and averaged 300 yards in punt returns per season. He was awarded a varsity letter in football five times; combined with the three letters he earned in hockey, his total was the most that could be earned at Princeton at the time.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bakers</b> are {{frequently}} exposed to various irritant chemicals during work which can induce respiratory problems. In this study, {{pulmonary function tests}} and self-reported respiratory and allergic symptoms in <b>bakers</b> were compared with matched control subjects. The frequency of respiratory and allergic symptoms was evaluated {{in a sample of}} 58 Iranian <b>bakers</b> and 58 control subjects using a questionnaire. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were also measured in all participants. All respiratory symptoms were significantly higher in <b>bakers</b> than control croup (P< 0. 05 to p< 0. 005). All allergic symptoms in <b>bakers</b> were also significantly greater than control group (P< 0. 05 to p< 0. 005). In addition, all respiratory (except sputum) and allergic (except urticaria) symptoms were significantly higher in <b>bakers</b> during work compared to rest period (p< 0. 05 to p< 0. 01) during work. Most PFT values except MEF 25 were also significantly lower in <b>bakers</b> than control subjects (p< 0. 05 to p< 0. 001). These results showed that <b>bakers</b> have a higher frequency of work related respiratory symptoms and to a lesser extend allergic symptoms particularly during the work period.

40|$|A {{national}} cohort {{based on}} the census at 9 November 1970 and the death registration files from 1970 to 1980 was analysed to see if skilled Danish <b>bakers</b> had an excess of respiratory cancer. The group of skilled <b>bakers</b> was divided into occupational subgroups to try to narrow down the possible causes of cancer. Significant excess mortality was found among skilled <b>bakers</b> in retail bakeries, skilled <b>bakers</b> in hotels and restaurants, and independent <b>bakers.</b> To adjust for confounding factors, the SMR was calculated with control groups of equal social status and smoking habits. With all skilled workers as the reference group, skilled <b>bakers</b> in retail bakeries still had an excess, but now insignificant, risk but skilled <b>bakers</b> in hotels and restaurants had a significant excess risk. Compared with all self employed people in urban occupations in which an average of six or fewer workers were employed as a referent group, independent <b>bakers</b> had an insignificant excess risk.
