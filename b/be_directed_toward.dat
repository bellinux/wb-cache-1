5|$|The optic tectum allows {{actions to}} <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> points in space, most {{commonly}} {{in response to}} visual input. In mammals it is usually {{referred to as the}} superior colliculus, and its best-studied function is to direct eye movements. It also directs reaching movements and other object-directed actions. It receives strong visual inputs, but also inputs from other senses that are useful in directing actions, such as auditory input in owls and input from the thermosensitive pit organs in snakes. In some primitive fishes, such as lampreys, this region is the largest part of the brain. The superior colliculus is part of the midbrain.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{molecular}} mimicry {{is a useful}} tool in understanding the etiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of autoimmune disorders. Molecular mimicry is, however, only one mechanism by which an autoimmune disease can occur in association with a pathogen. Understanding the mechanisms of molecular mimicry may allow future research to <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> uncovering the initiating infectious agent as well as recognizing the self determinant. This way, future research {{may be able to}} design strategies for treatment and prevention of autoimmune disorders. The use of transgenic models such as those used for discovery of the mimicry events leading to diseases of the CNS and muscle disorders has helped evaluate the sequence of events leading to molecular mimicry.|$|E

The majority ruled that the District had a compelling interest in maintaining racial diversity. Applying a test from Grutter, the Circuit Court also ruled that the tiebreaker plan was narrowly tailored, because 1) the District did not employ quotas, 2) the District had considered race-neutral alternatives, 3) the plan caused no undue harm to races, and 4) the plan had an ending point.|$|E
2500|$|In his own 1937 book, Hudal {{proposed}} a reconciliation and a pragmatic compromise between Nazism and Christianity, leaving {{the education of}} youth to the Churches, while the latter would leave politics entirely to National Socialism.

In the autumn of 1934, Hudal had personally explained this strategy to Pius XI: the [...] "good" [...] ought {{to be separated from}} the [...] "bad" [...] in National Socialism.

Speaking accurately, we only know by the method now characterized, that all terrestrial bodies tend to the earth, and not to some unknown fixed point lying in the same direction. In every twenty-four hours, by the earth’s rotation, the line drawn from the body at right angles to the earth coincides successively with all the radii of a circle, {{and in the course of}} six months the place of that circle varies by nearly two hundred millions of miles; yet in all these changes of the earth’s position, the line in which bodies tend to fall continues to <b>be</b> <b>directed</b> <b>toward</b> it: which proves that terrestrial gravity is directed to the earth, and not, as was once fancied by some, to a fixed point of space.|$|E
