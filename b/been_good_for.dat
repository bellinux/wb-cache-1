Her domestic approval rating recovered after her resignation; the balance of public opinion was that her government had <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the country. Aged 66, she retired from the House at the 1992 general election, saying that leaving the Commons would allow her more freedom to speak her mind.|$|E
5|$|The town is sited on {{the hills}} {{adjoining}} the flood plain of the River Nene. In the predominantly agrarian medieval period, this combination of access to fertile, if flood-prone, valley bottom soils and drier (but heavier and more clay-rich) hillside/ hilltop soils seems to have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> a mixed agricultural base. The clay-rich hilltop soils are primarily a consequence of blanketing of the area with boulder clay or glacial till during the recent glaciations. On the valley sides and valley floor however, these deposits have been largely washed away in the late glacial period, and in the valley bottom extensive deposits of gravels were laid down, which have largely been exploited for building aggregate in the last century.|$|E

Less frequently, he also threw a changeup to left-handed hitters at 87–89mph. The {{curve is}} {{especially}} good for swinging strikes with its 44% whiff rate for Burnett's career. The changeup has also <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> getting groundouts — it has a ground ball/fly ball ratio of better than 5:1.|$|E

25|$|Initially, college educated {{workers were}} likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who {{were more likely to}} compete with {{immigrants}} and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the financial crisis of 2007. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good.

25|$|In 1806 he {{negotiated}} the Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95 {{because he felt}} it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> business, Jefferson was unhappy {{that it did not}} end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812. Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.|$|E

25|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of Sassanid rule in 224 an orthodox Pars-oriented Zoroastrian tradition would play an important part in influencing and lending legitimization to the state until its collapse in the mid-7th century. After Ardashir I had deposed the last Parthian King, Artabanus V, he sought the aid of Tansar, a herbad (high priest) of the Iranian Zoroastrians to aid him in acquiring legitimization for the new dynasty. This Tansar did by writing to the nominal and vassal kings in different regions of Iran to accept Ardashir I as their new King, most notably in the Letter of Tansar, which was addressed to Gushnasp, the vassal king of Tabarestan. Gushnasp had accused Ardashir I of having forsaken tradition by usurping the throne, and that while his actions 'may have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> the World' they were 'bad for the faith'. Tansar refuted these charges in his letter to Gushnasp by proclaiming that not all of the old ways had been good, and that Ardashir was more virtuous than his predecessors. The Letter of Tansar included some attacks on the religious practices and orientation of the Parthians, who did not follow an orthodox Zoroastrian tradition but rather a heterodox one, and so attempted to justify Ardashir's rebellion against them by arguing that Zoroastrianism had 'decayed' after Alexander's invasion, a decay which had continued under the Parthians and so needed to be 'restored'.|$|E
500|$|The second gun, Furious spare, {{was mounted}} in , {{but she was}} not ready for combat until 13 October 1918. She fired three rounds the {{following}} day, but had to cease fire to avoid hitting friendly advancing troops. One round had already been loaded when the order came to cease fire so she fired it, with a reduced charge, into a minefield to seaward. A total of 85 18-inch shells were fired in action by both guns. [...] Wear on General Wolfes gun was measured at about 0.37 inch after firing 161 effective full charges (EFC) - 105 rounds including proof and practice, with 57 being supercharges.

He said that his team had more work to do on his car and was looking forward to the next race. Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E

On his way to Buxton in Derbyshire to take the baths, he died at Cornbury Park near Oxford, on 4 September 1588. Leicester's health had not <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> some time; historians have {{considered}} malaria and stomach cancer as causes of death. His death came unexpectedly, and only a week earlier he had said farewell to his Queen. Elizabeth was deeply affected and locked herself in her apartment for a few days until Lord Burghley had the door broken. Her nickname for Dudley had been [...] "Eyes", which was symbolised by the sign of ôô in their letters to each other. Elizabeth kept the letter he had sent her six days before his death in her bedside treasure box, endorsing it with [...] "his last letter" [...] on the outside.

Sarah tries this notion with Zoe, describing this Batley added: [...] "I think that's what happened with Zoe as well because they were such good friends. With Lydia, she brought something to her and she got on with her and was sparky, which is something that Sarah liked. I don't know if she'd suddenly turned, though. Maybe she was more bisexual than anything." ...|$|E

Similarly, Fort Worth Star-Telegram staff writer Robert Philpot commented that [...] "Even in its weak seasons, this show has always <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> at least one belly laugh per episode.

500|$|The RPF {{carried out}} a major {{fundraising}} programme, spearheaded by financial commissioner Aloisia Inyumba from an office in Kampala. They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world, {{as well as from}} some businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government. The sums involved were not enormous, but with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability. It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of an excess of redundant weaponry {{at the end of the}} Cold War. It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan army; according to Gérard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and passed weaponry to the RPF in a clandestine manner. Museveni likely knew of this, but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community. Museveni later said that [...] "faced with [...] fait accompli situation by our Rwandan brothers," [...] Uganda went [...] "to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have <b>been</b> <b>good</b> <b>for</b> Uganda's stability." ...|$|E
