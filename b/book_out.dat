Stanton (the art history {{professor}} emerita at Johns Hopkins University {{who died in}} 2003).

The <b>book</b> (<b>out</b> of print but still in many public and university art libraries) also contains a wealth of biographical information and many large plate reproductions of the artist's works, some in color. There are also photographs of the artist.|$|E
25|$|Born, {{like his}} brothers, in London, Hargreaves, in his youth, was placed {{by his mother}} with old family friends at Burston Hill Farm, north of Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire where he was profoundly {{influenced}} by the farmer Victor Pargeter. Over half a century later, Hargreaves would acknowledge Pargeter {{as part of a}} composite of father, grandfathers, uncles and old farming friends in the formative character of 'The Old Man' at the start of his <b>book</b> <b>Out</b> of Town (1987). Hargreaves was to live at a variety of addresses in central London between Soho, Chelsea and Hampstead. In the late '40s he was moving between a London home and a caravan in a field {{on the bank of the}} River Kennet at Midgham, then a cottage in Bagnor in Berkshire by the Winterbourne running into the River Lambourn, then at Lower Pennington and Walhampton near Lymington as well as at Minstead and East Boldre in the New Forest, and he spent his final years at Raven Cottage, near Belchalwell in Dorset which he – an inveterate commuter to and from the places from where he worked – was wont to bless for being 'just out of range of London'. He died at the Winterbourne Hospital in Dorchester, and was cremated at Salisbury, his ashes being spread on Bulbarrow Hill above Raven Cottage.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a <b>book</b> <b>out</b> of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will not get in trouble.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Arie Kaplan, some Holocaust {{survivors}} {{objected to}} Spiegelman making a comic <b>book</b> <b>out</b> of their tragedy. [...] Literary critics such as Hillel Halkin objected {{that the animal}} metaphor was [...] "doubly dehumanizing", reinforcing the Nazi belief that the atrocities were perpetrated by one species on another, when they were actually done by humans against humans. [...] Comics writer and critic Harvey Pekar and others saw Spiegelman's use of animals as potentially reinforcing stereotypes. [...] Pekar was also disdainful of Spiegelman's overwhelmingly negative portrayal of his father, calling him disingenuous and hypocritical for such a portrayal in a book that presents itself as objective. [...] Comics critic R.C. Harvey argued that Spiegelman's animal metaphor threatened [...] "to erode [...] moral underpinnings", and played [...] "directly into [...] racist vision".|$|E
500|$|When Warner Bros. {{shut down}} {{pre-production}} of The Fountain in 2002, Aronofsky reserved rights {{to publish a}} graphic novel based on the script that was not produced. He said, [...] "I {{knew it was a}} hard film to make, and I said at least if Hollywood fucks me over at least I'll make a comic <b>book</b> <b>out</b> of it." [...] He shopped the story to Vertigo Comics and met comic book artist Kent Williams, whose illustrations impressed him. Aronofsky hired Williams to create the graphic novel, and Ari Handel, co-writer for the film, provided Williams with research, photographs, and images on [...] "Mayans, astronomy, pulsars, and all kinds of cool stuff" [...] for the graphic novel's design. Aronofsky gave Williams the freedom to interpret the story as the artist saw fit.|$|E

To help her, Stead met with Wendy Lamb, an editor Stead had met in a workshop a few years before. Lamb suggested that Stead meet with a [...] "critique group" [...] who would help read and revise the drafts Stead wrote. After Stead created a revised copy of the novel in 2005, she sent it to Lamb again and a contract was drawn up. More revisions were made {{in order to make}} the new world created in the novel easier to understand. Stead found it hard [...] "to maintain a sense of 'the whole'. Over and over I mapped out the <b>book</b> <b>out</b> for myself using post-its in a manila folder, trying to get a sense of where the tension went". The novel took three years to complete.|$|E

The idea was also discussed at the 1962 annual sessions of the All India Gujarati Sahitya Parishad and the Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad.|$|E
500|$|The phrase's literal use extends {{into the}} 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing {{on it to}} {{advocate}} for the legal rights of the region's children. The 2008 book Child Labour in a Globalized World used the phrase {{to call attention to}} the role of debt bondage in child labor. Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase [...] "What about the children" [...] in her 2009 book, International Children's Rights, to focus on child-labor program conditions. Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his <b>book,</b> <b>Out</b> of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy, writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, Children's Rights and Human Development, child psychiatrist Bruce D.

[...] Thompson claims that the makers of the game are sacrificing their values. He said, [...] "Because of the Christian context, somehow it's OK? It's not OK. The context is irrelevant. It's a mass-killing game." [...] Left Behind author Tim LaHaye disagrees, saying [...] "Rather than forbid young people from viewing their favorite pastime, I prefer to give them something that's positive." [...] The dispute over the game has caused Thompson to sever ties with Tyndale House, which publishes both the Left Behind books and Thompson's <b>book,</b> <b>Out</b> of Harm's Way. Thompson has not seen the game, which he says has [...] "personally broken my heart," [...] but claims, [...] "I don't have to meet Abraham Lincoln to know that he was the 16th president of the United States." ...|$|E
