30|$|Another {{approach}} {{to improve the}} fire resistance of a woven fabric is to apply an FR coating to the outer cover fabric or fire barrier fabric. These coatings are attractive to the manufacturer {{as they can be}} applied to almost any fiber/fabric type. FR-treated fabrics only retard or delay the spread of flames as long as treatment chemicals are retained in the fabric. FR protection may be lost due to wear and tear. Some FR-coated barrier materials are functional for a short time but have serious drawbacks, including separation of the coating from the knitted substrate followed by <b>balling</b> <b>up</b> under the upholstery fabric and complete disintegration over {{a short period of time}} ([Anon 2999]).|$|E

Annealing induced crystallisation and transformation of anatase to the rutile phase and led to increased roughness, with localised fracture and <b>balling</b> <b>up</b> of the surface oxide layer as the time and temperature of annealing were increased. Nitric acid modification produced no influence on the anatase to rutile transformation, whilst further aging in boiling water induced an acceleration of this transformation.

40|$|Electron beam recrystallised {{polycrystalline}} silicon films on float glass {{for the use}} as solar cell absorber are investigated. The silicon layer is deposited in a high rate PECVD process using trichlorosilane SiHCl 3 and hydrogen H 2. The initial nanocrystalline layer is zone melted and recrystallised to a polycrystalline film using a line shaped electron beam assembly. The layer set up consists of a 20 m thick silicon layer on a sputtered tungsten film. To prevent <b>balling</b> <b>up,</b> the silicon is covered with silicon dioxide SiO 2. The amount of chlorine and hydrogen in the initial layer is {{in the order of}} 0. 1 1 at and is reduced by the zone melting recrystallisation ZMR to maximum value of 0. 05 at. The ZMR also leads to a more uniform concentration in depth due to a fast diffusivity in the silicon melt.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} master-oscillator power {{amplification}} using a broad-area laser diode (BAL) emitting at a wave-length of λ = 780 nm. The master oscillator is an injection-locked single-mode diode laser delivering a seeding beam of 35 mW, which is amplified in double {{pass through the}} <b>BAL</b> <b>up</b> to 410 mW. After beam shaping and spatial filtering by a single-mode fibre we obtain a clean Gaussian beam with a maximum power of 160 mW. There is no detectable contri-bution of the BAL eigenmodes in the spectrum of the output light. This laser system is employed for operation of a 87 Rb magneto-optical trap (MOT) and for near-resonant absorption imaging in a Bose−Einstein condensation experiment. PACS: 42. 60. By; 42. 50.
