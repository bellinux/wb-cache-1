5|$|Meyerbeer's large choral 'tableaux' {{also made}} a major {{contribution}} to the overall dramatic effect; the composer particularly sought opportunities to write such large-scale crowd scenes, and preferred libretti which offered such possibilities.

5|$|The 1948 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 90 and outscored their opponents 252 to 44. The defensive unit led by Dworsky held its opponents to just 4.9points per game, including shutouts against Oregon (140), Purdue (400), Northwestern (280), Navy (350), and Indiana (540). The 1948 Wolverines finished the season ranked No. 1 by the AP, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Ten Conference rules prohibited {{a team from}} playing in the Rose Bowl {{two years in a}} row. Dworsky did, however, play in the 1948 Blue-Gray All Star game.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match {{of the night}} was between the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger and his challenger, Big Show.

As a result, Swagger got frustrated and hit Big Show with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt, and was disqualified. After the match, Swagger attacked Big Show with a steel chair, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Show was able to stop him with a chokeslam. Big Show then performed his knockout punch on Swagger, before leaving the area.|$|E

The golden jellyfish population in Big Jellyfish Lake, Koror {{did not seem to be}} affected. The reason for this was not clear, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Jellyfish Lake experienced lower temperature increases than the other lakes and there was experimental evidence that the golden jellyfish medusa from Big Jellyfish Lake were more tolerant of higher temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The third {{match was}} the triple threat {{hardcore}} match between Raven, Kane and The Big Show for the Hardcore Championship. During the match, the three wrestlers fought {{their way out}} of the ring and through the crowd into the backstage area. Big Show tried to lock himself, Raven and the referee in a security cage but Kane broke the padlock and afterwards threw Raven through a glass window. Big Show and Kane continued to brawl ending with the two throwing each other through a wall. Raven tried to escape by driving off in a golf cart, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Show stopped him and caused him to crash. Kane shortly followed with another golf cart, accompanied by the referee, and ran into Raven. The fight headed back into the stadium with Big Show attempting to press slam Raven off the entrance stage but both were kicked off it by Kane.

[...] We started with only one man from a previous Blues race and no internationals. [...] Nothing <b>but</b> <b>big</b> hearts and lungs". [...] Cambridge's boat club president Richard Phelps was upbeat: [...] "We're buoyant, tails up, the boat's been going fast." [...] Cambridge were coached by Robin Williams who was reserved in his assessment, noting his crew needed to be [...] "comfortable with the situation of rowing side-by-side." ...|$|E
500|$|The first main {{match was}} between Kurt Angle and The Big Show. For the {{duration}} of the match, The Big Show, who stood at [...] squashed Angle. Angle was intentionally counted out but General Manager Theodore Long ordered Angle to continue the match or Angle would never wrestle on SmackDown! again. After Angle returned to the ring, Big Show continued to squash Angle. Angle retrieved a steel chair <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Show punched the chair onto Angle's face. As Big Show prepared to perform a chokeslam, Angle countered into an ankle lock. While Big Show reached the ropes to force Angle to break the hold, the referee was knocked down. Angle began targeting Big Show's knee and hit his knee with the chair. The match ended with Big Show chokeslamming Angle from the top rope for the win.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} the No Disqualification match between Big Show and Floyd Mayweather, Jr..

As Big Show was about to chokeslam Mayweather, one of Mayweather's accomplices struck a steel chair on Big Show's back, and the latter chokeslammed him in retaliation. Capitalizing from this distraction, Mayweather grabbed that chair and hit Big Show multiple times {{on the head with}} it. Finally, Mayweather removed his right glove and {{put on a pair of}} brass knuckles to hit Big Show in the face. As a result, Big Show was knocked out as he could not answer the referee's ten count, and Mayweather was declared the winner.|$|E

Chief Wiggum and his son Ralph move to New Orleans with Seymour Skinner as Wiggum's sidekick. Wiggum has proclaimed that he will [...] "clean up the city" [...] of New Orleans, {{but it does not}} take long before he meets his nemesis, Big Daddy, who warns Wiggum to stay out of his business. Soon after, Ralph disappears and Wiggum finds Big Daddy's calling card left behind. Wiggum manages to track Big Daddy's ransom call to the Mardi Gras, where he briefly runs into the Simpson family, [...] and the two chase each other to Big Daddy's mansion in the New Orlans bayou (in reality the Louisiana governor's mansion which Big Daddy has managed to steal). Chief Wiggum then threatens Big Daddy with a gun, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Daddy counters by tossing Ralph at his father, then jumping out the window and swimming away (at an extremely slow speed, due to his weight). Wiggum ultimately lets the villain escape, feeling that he will meet him again [...] "each and every week, always in more sexy and exciting ways".|$|E

Majorino had not appeared since the second episode of the season, [...] "My Big Fat Greek Rush Week". At the time, Majorino was also a series regular on the HBO series Big Love, so her schedule was difficult to determine. She stated: [...] "It's a little tough, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Love and Veronica Mars have both been really great about juggling the schedule so I could do both shows." [...] On October 24, 2006, {{the cast and crew}} were filming the episode. Because of this other commitment, Majorino appeared in eleven episodes of the season instead of the scheduled twelve. On that same date, Majorino revealed that she would be returning in [...] "Spit & Eggs", that it resolved the Hearst rapist storyline, and that it would introduce the show's next major story arc. On her role in the episode and in the season as a whole in light of the events in the second season finale, Majorino commented, [...] "It's not like all of the sudden she's over everything that happened." ...|$|E
500|$|The largest {{facility}} {{in this area}} of the park is The Marketplace – International Buffet, originally called All's Well Hall.

In the park's opening season guidebook, the facility is listed as selling [...] "bratwurst, sausages, beef and mushroom pie, smoked sausage, grilled frankfurter, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, soft pretzels, pastries, with beer, wine, coffee, tea, milk, and soft drinks." [...] The self–serve restaurant had table service on request, and seated 528; Ginza Gardens in Grande Exposition of 1890 was the only other restaurant in the park with table service. A review of the restaurant in The Toronto Star describes the facility as the park's flagship eatery, but it received mixed reviews. [...] "The $2.50 beef and mushroom pie has a good crust and as much beef as potato. Tiny mushrooms, <b>but</b> <b>big</b> on flavor." [...] Conversely, 50 cent pretzels [...] "are strictly for teething tots –too cheewy." [...] The Marketplace currently serves an all–you–can–eat buffet, self described as [...] "upscale", offering meats like roast beef and fried chicken, pasta, a salad bar, a desert station, varied international cuisine, and other options.

500|$|... "Lose My Breath" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins, Fred Jerkins, Sean Garrett, LaShawn Daniels and Jay-Z. The {{production}} of the song was handled by Jerkins, Beyoncé, Rowland and Garrett. Record producer Jerkins, who had previously collaborated with the group for [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), had worked on [...] "Lose My Breath" [...] without informing Destiny's Child. Beyoncé and Williams heard the drum instrumentation of the track and they enjoyed it with the latter feeling that the song was nothing like the mainstream radio sound. They went to their band mate Kelly Rowland presenting the song. Alongside Jerkins, the group asked for help from American rapper Jay-Z who immediately created a chorus including the lines [...] "Can you keep up" [...] without hearing the track. The group took his chorus and wrote the verses and bridge around it. During an interview with Complex, Garrett recalled the time he worked with Williams on the song, saying, [...] "There was so much magic {{going on in the}} studio. We probably recorded all the songs in about a month and every day it was a new song coming out. 'Lose My Breath' was towards {{the latter part of the}} album and that was an amazing song that we felt could not only be big on the radio <b>but</b> <b>big</b> with bands and marching bands.

500|$|For the record, André 3000 {{did most}} of the album's production, while Big Boi crafted hooks for the songs. André 3000 and {{producer}} Mr. DJ learned about beat creation through observing the members of Organized Noize at work, with Mr. DJ observing that despite André 3000's normally frugal lifestyle, his enthusiasm for production led him to splurge on costly recording equipment. At one point, André 3000 attempted singing and modifying his voice with pitch-correction equipment, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Boi warned him that this would alienate the group's urban audience. Another point of contention was the order of the track listing; Big Boi wanted to begin the album with [...] "Y'all Scared" [...] while André 3000 and the other producers and musicians wanted the first track to be [...] "Return of the G", preferring that the record start with a song with just the duo as opposed to one with multiple collaborators. Big Boi missed his flight to attend the album mastering session {{and by the time he}} arrived, the others had already settled on a cohesive track list for the record. After a long, heated discussion, Big Boi eventually agreed to opening the album with [...] "Return of the G". The album features the song [...] "West Savannah", which had been recorded during the Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik sessions, and was included on Aquemini to give listeners a [...] "bonus" [...] that had sentimental value for the duo, as well as to pay homage to Big Boi's family living in Savannah.|$|E
500|$|Priyanka Gandhi, while campaigned in Rae Bareli on 24 April, accused Narendra Modi of favouring {{businessmen}} by allocating land {{to their}} companies {{at very low}} prices and defended her husband Robert Vadra over the accusations of corruptions. While addressing a rally in Amethi on 5 May, Modi responded by criticising Priyanka for saying that BJP was involved in low level politics. He also added that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had humiliated a former chief minister of a state at an airport. Priyanka Gandhi called Modi's statement an insult to his [...] "martyr father" [...] and criticised BJP for involving in low level politics.

She further said that Modi wanted power for himself and alleged that books defaming her family members were being dropped at night in the places where her public meetings were scheduled to take place. Agitated by the allegations BJP launched a CD and booklet titled Damadshree accusing Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Gahlot of helping Vadra in acquiring land in violation of the regulations. Priyanka Gandhi criticised this move of the BJP and compared it to [...] "panicky rats". She also took a pun on Modi's remarks on Rahul Gandhi in which he called him Shehzada (prince) and Namuna (specimen), by calling Modi's behaviour childish.|$|E

500|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} the pay-per-view, WWE {{announced}} on their official website that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing [...] "slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal". Heyman and McMahon clashed on the plane to the North Charleston Coliseum and after a producers' meeting, Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. This situation was cited by Punk in his controversial shoot promo in 2011, in which {{he referred to the}} idea as one in which [...] "Heyman saw something in [...] that nobody else wanted to admit." [...] In an early 2008 interview with The Sun, Heyman gave more details on how he would have booked the Extreme Elimination Chamber main-event, which included having Punk enter first and quickly eliminating Big Show via submission. According to the interview, McMahon nixed the idea, <b>but</b> <b>Big</b> Show liked the direction Heyman was heading, and was eager for the opportunity to [...] "make" [...] a rising star like Punk. He also stated that he kept going to McMahon {{on the night of the}} pay-per-view to say that [...] "The people are going to throw this back in our face".
