25|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} a specialized QoS API called qWave (Quality Windows Audio/Video Experience), {{which is a}} pre-configured Quality of Service module for time dependent multimedia data, such as audio or video streams. qWave uses different packet priority schemes for real-time flows (such as multimedia packets) and <b>best-effort</b> flows (such as file downloads or e-mails) to ensure that real time data gets as little delays as possible, while providing a high quality channel for other data packets.|$|E
25|$|The {{three top}} layers in the OSI model, i.e. the {{application}} layer, the presentation layer and the session layer, are not distinguished separately in the TCP/IP model which only has an application layer above the transport layer. While some pure OSI protocol applications, such as X.400, also combined them, {{there is no}} requirement that a TCP/IP protocol stack must impose monolithic architecture above the transport layer. For example, the NFS application protocol runs over the eXternal Data Representation (XDR) presentation protocol, which, in turn, runs over a protocol called Remote Procedure Call (RPC). RPC provides reliable record transmission, so it can safely use the <b>best-effort</b> UDP transport.|$|E
500|$|Internet {{reporter}} Dana Blankenhorn {{stated that}} the size of the bill illustrated a problem with the telephone companies' [...] "event based" [...] or connection-oriented business model and used it to argue for open spectrum in a radio frequency spectrum auction in the U.S. scheduled for 2008. He contrasted how telephone billing considers every action a separately billable event, while the Internet model is based on a flat fee for <b>best-effort</b> delivery in connectionless mode transmission.|$|E
50|$|<b>Best-effort</b> {{delivery}} {{describes a}} network service {{in which the}} network does not provide any guarantees that data is delivered or that a user is given a guaranteed quality of service level or a certain priority. In a <b>best-effort</b> network all users obtain <b>best-effort</b> service, meaning that they obtain unspecified variable bit rate and delivery time, depending on the current traffic load. It can be contrasted with reliable delivery, which can be built on top of <b>best-effort</b> delivery (possibly without latency and throughput guarantees), or with circuit switching schemes which maintain a defined, continuous quality of service.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>best-effort</b> scheduling algorithms are round-robin, fair queuing (a max-min fair scheduling algorithm), proportionally fair {{scheduling and}} maximum throughput. If differentiated or guaranteed {{quality of service}} is offered, as opposed to <b>best-effort</b> communication, weighted fair queuing may be utilized.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Best-effort</b> {{messages}} {{follow the}} usual Ethernet policy. There {{is no guarantee}} whether and when these messages can be transmitted, what delays occur and if messages arrive at the recipient. <b>Best-effort</b> messages use the remaining bandwidth of the network and have lower priority {{than the other two}} types.|$|E
50|$|A <b>best-effort</b> {{network or}} service {{does not support}} quality of service. An {{alternative}} to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a <b>best-effort</b> network by over-provisioning the capacity {{so that it is}} sufficient for the expected peak traffic load. The resulting absence of network congestion reduces or eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Operators often {{distinguish}} {{three broad}} types of network traffic: Sensitive, <b>Best-Effort,</b> and Undesired.|$|E
50|$|With {{the above}} in mind, the carrier's {{objective}} is to offer a maximum amount of <b>best-effort</b> EIR services over its network while reliably serving its committed CIR services. To achieve this PBB/PBT and T-MPLS approaches largely under-provision network resources, {{in order to avoid}} a situation where a burst in <b>best-effort</b> traffic would jeopardize the ability to serve committed traffic, leading to costly penalties. An additional issue with <b>best-effort</b> access on data networks is fair allocation among clients. With PBB/PBT and T-MPLS, the amount of bandwidth available to a particular client greatly depends on the client's location and the prevailing traffic conditions. This limits the value customers attach to EIR services and undercuts carriers' opportunities to offer differentiated access to its excess capacity.|$|E
50|$|HyperCast {{provides}} a <b>best-eﬀort</b> communication service (unreliable, unordered, possible duplication) for application messages, which {{are referred to}} as overlay messages.|$|E
50|$|In <b>best-effort</b> packet {{switching}} and other statistical multiplexing, round-robin scheduling {{can be used}} as an alternative to first-come first-served queuing.|$|E

50|$|If {{guaranteed}} or differentiated {{quality of}} service is offered, and not only <b>best-effort</b> communication, deficit round-robin (DRR) scheduling, weighted round-robin (WRR) scheduling, or weighted fair queuing (WFQ) may be considered.|$|E
50|$|A {{simplified}} packet {{data model}} is the greedy source model. It {{may be useful in}} analyzing the maximum throughput for <b>best-effort</b> traffic (without any quality-of-service guarantees). Many traffic generators are greedy sources.|$|E
50|$|Ethernet is {{the primary}} network {{protocol}} in data centers for computer-to-computer communications. However, Ethernet {{is designed to be}} a <b>best-effort</b> network that may experience packet loss when the network or devices are busy.|$|E
50|$|VPN {{may have}} <b>best-effort</b> performance, or {{may have a}} defined service level {{agreement}} (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.|$|E
50|$|On Linux {{the game}} autodetects any {{connected}} SingStar microphones and uses them automatically. On other platforms {{and with other}} types of microphones (e.g. webcams or analog microphones connected to sound cards) a <b>best-effort</b> detection is done.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, packet based {{networks}} {{made a big}} leap {{and almost}} every single service provided (voice, IP-TV, etc.) is IP based. This {{is due to the}} reason that the IP layer has long provided <b>best-effort</b> services.|$|E
50|$|Research {{continued}} {{within a}} joint industrial development between TTTech and Honeywell. TTEthernet was the industrial {{further development of}} the research. Objectives were extended towards scalable fault-tolerance and a finer classification of event-triggered messages into rate-constrained and <b>best-effort</b> traffic classes.|$|E
50|$|The Internet {{protocol}} {{offers a}} <b>best-effort</b> service of delivering datagrams between hosts. IPv4 is a connectionless internet protocol {{that depends on}} the <b>best-effort</b> delivery approach. IPv4 datagrams may be lost, arbitrarily delayed, corrupted, or duplicated. The applications built on top of it implement the additional services they require on an end-to-end basis. Transmission control protocol (TCP) provides a guaranteed delivery of an octet stream between a pair of hosts to the above layer, internally splitting the stream into packets and resending these when lost or corrupted. User datagram protocol (UDP) provides a thinner abstraction layer which only error-checks the datagrams. Both are transport-layer protocols and provide multiplexing between processes on the same host implemented with port numbers.|$|E
50|$|Packet {{switching}} based services, {{such as the}} Internet (and {{other networks}} that employ IP) are <b>best-effort</b> services, so degraded performance, although undesirable, can be tolerated. However, since the connection is contracted, ATM networks need to keep delays and jitter within negotiated limits.|$|E
5000|$|Internet video {{services}} are usually termed as Internet TV or Web TV. This approach {{is open for}} anybody to be a content provider, a service provider, or a consumer. Quality of service is not guaranteed since {{it is based on}} a <b>best-effort</b> service model.|$|E
5000|$|MacPorts was hosted on Mac OS Forge, an {{open source}} hosting service created and {{maintained}} by Apple Inc. for third-party projects {{not supported by}} Apple. When Apple closed Mac OS Forge in 2016, the project moved to GitHub. [...] <b>Best-effort</b> support can be sourced from the community.|$|E
5000|$|... while PIM often {{involves}} integrating data from multiple sources, we cannot assume users will invest {{the time to}} integrate. Instead, {{most of the time}} the system will have to provide <b>best-effort</b> results, and tighter integrations will be created only in cases where the benefits will clearly outweigh the investment.|$|E
50|$|A Default PHB (a.k.a. Default Forwarding (DF) PHB) is {{the only}} {{required}} behavior. Essentially, any traffic that {{does not meet the}} requirements of any of the other defined classes is placed in the default PHB. Typically, the Default PHB has <b>best-effort</b> forwarding characteristics. The recommended DSCP for the Default PHB is 000000B (0).|$|E
50|$|Reliable {{delivery}} can be {{contrasted with}} <b>best-effort</b> delivery, {{where there is}} no guarantee that messages will be delivered quickly, in order, or at all. A reliable delivery protocol can be built on an unreliable protocol; an extremely common example is the layering of Transmission Control Protocol on the Internet Protocol, a combination known as TCP/IP.|$|E
5000|$|Best effort {{traffic is}} all {{other kinds of}} non-detrimental traffic. This is traffic that the ISP deems isn't {{sensitive}} to Quality of Service metrics (jitter, packet loss, latency). A typical example would be peer-to-peer and email applications. [...] Traffic management schemes are generally tailored so <b>best-effort</b> traffic gets what is left after sensitive traffic.|$|E
50|$|In <b>best-effort</b> {{statistical}} multiplexing, a first-come first-served (FCFS) scheduling {{policy is}} often used. The advantage with max-min fairness over FCFS {{is that it}} results in traffic shaping, meaning that an ill-behaved flow, consisting of large data packets or bursts of many packets, will only punish itself and not other flows. Network congestion is consequently to some extent avoided.|$|E
50|$|Services in {{the data}} network are {{typically}} classified into 2 major categories: Committed Information Rate (CIR) and Excess Information Rate (EIR). A CIR service guarantees its user a fixed amount of bandwidth, whereas an EIR service offers <b>best-effort</b> only transport. Both types of services share a single capacity-constrained infrastructure. Both are further defined by additional parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Fair queuing is an {{algorithm}} {{that allows}} for network moderators to control packets by assigning flow weights. Groups of guaranteed-service applications are classed by their nature (e.g. [...] "voice","video","game") based on similar bandwidth and delay requirements. These guaranteed-service applications are given priority over <b>best-effort</b> applications which are limited by the access bandwidth available to the user.|$|E
5000|$|Ensuring that {{multiple}} users can harmoniously share a single communications link requires {{some kind of}} equitable sharing of the link. If a bottle neck communication link offering data rate R is shared by [...] "N" [...] active users (with at least one data packet in queue), every user typically achieves a throughput of approximately R/N, if fair queuing <b>best-effort</b> communication is assumed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decoding}} process consists of performing, {{to the extent}} possible, an inversion of each stage of the encoding process. The one stage that cannot be exactly inverted is the quantization stage. There, a <b>best-effort</b> approximation of inversion is performed. This {{part of the process}} is often called [...] "inverse quantization" [...] or [...] "dequantization", although quantization is an inherently non-invertible process.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{telephone}} {{networks are}} {{not based on}} <b>best-effort</b> communication, but on circuit switching. During the connection phase of a new call, resources are reserved in the telephone exchanges, or a busy signal informs the user that the call is blocked {{due to lack of}} free capacity. An ongoing phone call can never be interrupted due to overloading of the network, and is guaranteed constant bandwidth.|$|E
