2500|$|Windows Phone 8 devices use SD cards {{designed}} for access {{only by the}} phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> becomes <b>locked</b> [...] "to the phone with an automatically generated key" [...] so that [...] "the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC". Symbian devices, however, {{are some of the}} few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards. It is therefore possible to use a device such as the Nokia N8 to reformat the card for subsequent use in other devices.|$|R

50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} {{pushes the}} barrel <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> on the receiver group to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the barrel <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|R

50|$|The AN/PVS-4 uses a 25mm screw-type variable-gain Image Intensifier tube. Operational voltage is 3.0 Volts. Early {{production}} models feature two circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> {{located on the}} main housing. These <b>battery</b> <b>compartments</b> are designed to accommodate one 3.0V BA-5567/U, or two 1.5V BA-3058/U simultaneously. Later designations such as the AN/PVS-4A use two common AA batteries (BA-3058/U) via a purpose-built adapter (PN A3009873) that attaches {{to one of the}} circular <b>battery</b> <b>compartments.</b> Use of the adapter negates the need for BA-5567/U and BA-3058/U. AN/PVS-4s still in use today are typically upgraded with the AA battery adapter even if they have not been upgraded to a third generation tube. Some AN/PVS-4A models made after 1984 feature an integral AA battery housing that does not require the use of an external AA battery adapter.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to having specification differences, the Trophy and 7 Trophy have slight design differences as well. The 7 Trophy features a bright yellow <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> (typical of HTC Windows Mobile devices in the past), whereas the Trophy has a bright red <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> (to acknowledge the phone's Verizon ties). Press images of the Verizon device also appear to show a small circular cutout beneath the battery door, and above the Windows Phone logo. This circle is an external antenna port cover.|$|R
50|$|In these {{applications}} a latching {{continuity tester}} is used. A more complex device, it detects intermittent opens and shorts {{as well as}} steady-state conditions. These devices contain a fast acting electronic switch (generally a Schmitt trigger) forming a gated astable oscillator which detects and <b>locks</b> (<b>latches)</b> the indicator on an intermittent condition {{with a duration of}} less than a millisecond.|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common type of single-shot action, usually found in shotguns, small pistols, and black-powder [...] "elephant" [...] guns, a break action connects the barrel {{assembly}} to the breechblock with a hinge. When a <b>locking</b> <b>latch</b> is released, the barrel assembly pivots away from the receiver, opening the breech and, at least on better firearms, partially extracting the spent cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The Rio PMP300 {{suffers from}} a few notable design flaws. The <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> door flap is notorious for breaking. The battery cover is {{difficult}} to repair due to the stress caused by the spring-loaded <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> and the fragile plastic used for the door clips. The metal hinge used to hold the compartment {{to the base of}} the unit would also put strain on the plastic casing, causing cracks around the SmartMedia slot. Furthermore, the silver coating applied to the main central control button in the original 32 MB unit would often peel and flake off with use. The control disc would commonly fall off.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after noon}} on 12 June 1943, R-12, while {{underway}} {{to conduct a}} torpedo practice approach, sounded her last diving alarm. As she completed preparations to dive, the forward <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> began to flood. The collision alarm was sounded and a report was made that the forward <b>battery</b> <b>compartment</b> was flooding. Orders were given to blow main ballast, but the sea was faster. In about 15 seconds, R-12 was lost. The commanding officer, one other officer, and three enlisted men were swept from the bridge as the boat sank and were rescued. Forty-two lives were lost. R-12 was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 July.|$|R
50|$|In purely {{mechanical}} plants, {{the levers}} operate the field devices, such as signals, directly via a mechanical rodding or wire connection.
