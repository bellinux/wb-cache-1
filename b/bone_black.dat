25|$|In Vermeer’s oeuvre, {{only about}} 20 {{pigments}} have been detected. Of these 20 pigments, seven principal pigments which Vermeer commonly employed include lead white, yellow ochre, vermilion, madder lake, green earth, raw umber, and ivory or <b>bone</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} his meticulous {{painting}} technique was Vermeer's choice of pigments. He {{is best known for}} his frequent use of the very expensive ultramarine (The Milkmaid), and also lead-tin-yellow (A Lady Writing a Letter), madder lake (Christ in the House of Martha and Mary), and vermilion. He also painted with ochres, <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> and azurite. The claim that he utilized Indian yellow in Woman Holding a Balance has been disproven by later pigment analysis.|$|E
60|$|To {{which may}} be added their Black and White, which they also usually call Colours, of each of which they have several kinds, such as <b>Bone</b> <b>Black,</b> made of Ivory burnt in a close Vessel, and Blue Black, made of the small coal of Willow, or some other Wood; and Cullens earth, which {{is a kind of}} brown Black, &c. Their usual Whites are either {{artificial}} or natural White Lead, the last of which is the best they yet have, and with the mixing and tempering these colours together, are they able to make an imitation of any colour whatsoever: Their Reds or deep Yellows, they can dilute by mixing pale Yellows with them, and deepen their pale by mixing deeper with them; for it is not with Opacous colours as it is with transparent, where by adding more Yellow to yellow, it is deepned, but in opacous diluted. They can whiten any colour by mixing White with it, and darken any colour by mixing Black, or some dark and dirty colour. And in a word, most of the colours, or colour'd bodies they use in Limning and Painting, are such, as though mixt with any other of their colours, they preserve their own hue, and by being in such very smal parts dispers'd through the other colour'd bodies, they both, or altogether represent to the eye a compositum of all; the eye being unable, by reason of their smalness, to distinguish the peculiarly colour'd particles, but receives them as one intire compositum: whereas in many of these, the Microscope very easily distinguishes each of the compounding colours distinct, and exhibiting its own colour.|$|E

50|$|The {{painting}} was {{investigated by the}} scientists of the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage and FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF) Amsterdam. The ground is dense and yellowish in color and is composed of chalk, lead white, ocher and very little black. The dark background of the painting contains <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> weld (luteolin, reseda luteola), chalk, small amounts of red ochre, and indigo. The face and draperies were painted mainly using ochres, natural ultramarine, <b>bone</b> <b>black,</b> charcoal black and lead white.|$|E

60|$|At {{some time}} or other {{there had been}} a native village at this spot; {{probably}} the Zulus had cleaned it out in long past years, for I found human <b>bones</b> <b>black</b> with age lying in the long grass. Indeed, the cattle-kraal still remained and in such good condition that by piling up a few stones here and there on the walls and closing the narrow entrances with thorn bushes, we could still use it to enclose our oxen at night. This I did for fear lest there should be lions about, though I had neither seen nor heard them.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes the coats are {{in three}} {{different}} colors, such as brown for the first, red for the second, and white or grey for the final coat. The pigments used for this work include Indian red, Turkey red, Antwerp blue, German blue, umber, ochre, purple brown, <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> or oxide of manganese for black. Combinations of these colors are made to produce any desired tone.|$|E

Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally <b>bone</b> <b>blacks</b> but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|R

They were infected by The Citadel of <b>Bone's</b> <b>Black</b> ooze and plotted to transform the populace into mindless clowns until Chiro and Otto destroyed The Ringmaster's hat which transformed everyone back to normal. After the ordeal The Circus allowed Otto to perform in the circus and remained allies with the Hyperforce. The Ringmaster was voiced by Robert Englund and Leeah was voiced by Kari Wahlgren.|$|R
40|$|We studied polymorphisms of 23 {{microsatellite}} loci from 23 chromosomes in {{an indigenous}} breed of Xuefeng <b>black</b> <b>bone</b> chicken from Hunan {{in order to}} elucidate its genetic diversity and structure and to propose reasonable measures for its conservation and utilization. Seventy-nine alleles were identified in 50 individuals and {{the mean number of}} alleles was 3. 435 per locus. Average heterozygosity and polymorphic information content of 23 microsatellite loci were 0. 6285 and 0. 5496, respectively.

50|$|Bone char is {{also used}} as a black pigment for artist's paint, printmaking, calligraphic and drawing inks {{as well as other}} artistic {{applications}} because of its deepness of color and excellent tinting strength. <b>Bone</b> <b>black</b> and ivory black are artists' pigments which are in use since historic times by painters such as Rembrandt and Velázquez but also more recently by Manet or Picasso. The black dresses and high hats of the gentlemen in Manet's Music in the Tuileries are painted in ivory black.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Chinese {{method of}} making the ink was to grind a mixture of hide glue, carbon black, lampblack, and <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> pigment with a pestle and mortar, then pouring it into a ceramic dish where it could dry. To use the dry mixture, a wet brush would be applied until it reliquified, or more commonly in East Asian calligraphy, grind against an inkstone. The manufacture of India ink was well-established by the Cao Wei dynasty (220 - 265 AD). Historically the ink used in China were {{in the form of}} ink sticks made of lampblack and animal glue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{painting}} was investigated by Hermann Kühn in 1968 {{and there is}} also material on the pigment analysis on the website of the National Gallery in London where the {{painting was}} included in the exhibition [...] "Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and Leisure" [...] in 2013. The Music Lesson is a mature work of Vermeer and his handling of colour and his choice of painting materials is but one of the aspects proving his mastery. The painting is dominated by dark areas such as the bluish-black floor painted in <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> with addition of natural ultramarine.|$|E

50|$|Beadworking, done by women, has a {{long history}} among the Maasai, who {{articulate}} their identity and position in society through body ornaments and body painting. Before contact with Europeans, the beads were produced mostly from local raw materials. White beads were made from clay, shells, ivory, or <b>bone.</b> <b>Black</b> and blue beads were made from iron, charcoal, seeds, clay, or horn. Red beads came from seeds, woods, gourds, bone, ivory, copper, or brass. When late in the nineteenth century, great quantities of brightly colored European glass beads arrived in Southeast Africa, beadworkers replaced the older beads with the new materials and began to use more elaborate color schemes. Currently, dense, opaque glass beads with no surface decoration and a naturally smooth finish are preferred.|$|E
50|$|As in his {{previous}} entries to the Salon, The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit and El Jaleo, Sargent chose a canvas of dimensions large enough to ensure notice on the crowded Salon walls. The pose proved {{to be different from}} any of those tried in the preliminary works. It necessitated that Gautreau stand with her body facing the artist while her head was turned away, her right arm extended behind her for support, her hand on a low table; the result was to create tension in the neck and arm as well as to emphasize the subject's elegant contours. For painting the artificial tone of Gautreau's pale skin, Sargent used a palette composed of lead white, rose madder, vermilion, viridian, and <b>bone</b> <b>black.</b>|$|E
50|$|Animal {{charcoal}} or <b>bone</b> <b>black</b> is the {{carbonaceous residue}} {{obtained by the}} dry distillation of bones. It contains only about 10% carbon, the remainder being calcium and magnesium phosphates (80%) and other inorganic material originally present in the bones. It is generally manufactured from the residues obtained in the glue and gelatin industries. Its decolorizing power was applied in 1812 by Derosne to the clarification of the syrups obtained in sugar refining; but its use in this direction has now greatly diminished, owing {{to the introduction of}} more active and easily managed reagents. It is still used to some extent in laboratory practice. The decolorizing power is not permanent, becoming lost after using for some time; it may be revived, however, by washing and reheating. Wood charcoal also to some extent removes coloring material from solutions, but animal charcoal is generally more effective.|$|E

5000|$|In How to Be a Maquiladora, Sheila Black {{demonstrated}} {{her gift}} for using details to create images that evoke {{the life and}} environment of a specific locale. In House of Bone, her first major collection of poetry, Black paints with a much broader stroke. Not only does House of Bone, cover a much wider range of topics and experiences, but the particularities that she describe also seem to begrudgingly conceal the universal in the particular. This collection is also a much more personal book. While individual poems in Maquiladora, such as [...] "Desert Life," [...] remind the reader that the poet was no mere observer but {{a part of that}} environment about which she wrote, in House of <b>Bone,</b> <b>Black's</b> own experiences provide the grist for the poems.|$|R
