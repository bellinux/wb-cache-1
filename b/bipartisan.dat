5|$|During {{his first}} year in the legislature, Kefalas also founded the <b>bipartisan</b> Common Good Caucus to address poverty issues, and {{was a member of the}} Hispanic Caucus and the Diabetes/Obesity Caucus.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, {{authorization}} for {{a national}} historical park designation was incorporated in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act. Despite opposition from some legislators, the bill passed with <b>bipartisan</b> support, and {{was signed into law}} by the President on December 19, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, Ryan led the <b>bipartisan</b> {{effort to}} pass the Every Student Succeeds Act, which, among other things, fully {{repealed}} No Child Left Behind and severely limited the federal government's ability to impose and enforce national education standards such as Common Core.|$|E
5|$|In March 2002, McCain–Feingold, officially {{known as}} the <b>Bipartisan</b> Campaign Reform Act of 2002, passed in both Houses of Congress and {{was signed into law}} by President Bush. Seven years in the making, it was McCain's {{greatest}} legislative achievement.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{was elected}} to the Illinois Senate in 1996, {{succeeding}} Democratic State Senator Alice Palmer from Illinois's 13th District, which, at that time, spanned Chicago South Side neighborhoods from Hyde Park–Kenwood south to South Shore and west to Chicago Lawn. Once elected, Obama gained <b>bipartisan</b> support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. He sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. In 2001, as co-chairman of the <b>bipartisan</b> Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, 2015, Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Cory Booker (D-NJ), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) {{proposed}} a new <b>bipartisan</b> medical marijuana bill for patients and veterans to access medical marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had <b>bipartisan</b> support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the wild}} fires {{in the state of}} Colorado in 2012, Senator Roberts was elected as Chairwoman of the <b>bipartisan</b> Lower North Fork Fire Commission, which convened during the interim and which {{proposed}} four pieces of legislation to address the threat of wildfire risk and damage in Colorado.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2007 session, Roberts {{was named}} by House Republican {{leadership}} {{to the newly}} formed Criminal and Juvenile Justice Commission. In November 2007, she was named a Legislator of Merit by the Colorado Behavioral Health Council. She joined with other Republicans to criticize an executive order issued by Governor Bill Ritter allowing collective bargaining with government employee unions as a betrayal of Ritter's promise of <b>bipartisan</b> cooperation on major issues.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Ryan {{served on}} the joint, <b>bipartisan</b> National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, known as the Simpson-Bowles Commission. He voted with the {{majority}} of the Commission not to advance its final report to Congress. Ryan justified his vote claiming that the Commission's recommendations did not do enough to reduce health care costs.|$|E
5|$|In early 2014, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Debo P. Adegbile, {{a former}} {{lawyer for the}} NAACP who worked on Abu-Jamal's case, to head the civil rights division of the Justice Department, but the nomination {{was rejected by the}} U.S. Senate on a <b>bipartisan</b> basis because of Adegbile's prior public support of Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the storm, Congress appointed a <b>bipartisan</b> committee to investigate the response to Hurricane Katrina and the preparations prior to its landfall. The committee concluded that the forecasts given by the National Weather Service were timely, were not responsible for failures in other agencies, and were likely responsible for saving thousands of lives that would have otherwise {{been lost in the}} raging hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Joe Biden hung drywall at a Habitat for Humanity home in N.E.Washington,D.C. Biden's wife, Jill, their daughter, Ashley Biden, Michelle Obama and the Obamas' daughters, Malia and Sasha, {{spent the}} morning at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium where they helped {{thousands}} of volunteers prepare more than 85,000 care packages destined for U.S.troops overseas. Later that evening, the President-elect hosted three separate <b>bipartisan</b> dinners to honor the service of JohnMcCain, ColinPowell and JoeBiden.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{partisan}} disagreement in Congress prevented {{adjustments to}} the Act's provisions. However, at least one change, a proposed repeal of a tax on medical devices, has received <b>bipartisan</b> support. Some Congressional Republicans argued against improvements to the law on the grounds they would weaken the arguments for repeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} seen as entirely {{innocuous}} when it was introduced on January 16, 1956. It enjoyed <b>bipartisan</b> support, and on January 18 it was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives. It then fell to the Senate to consider the equivalent bill in the upper chamber, S. 2518, which was expected to have an equally untroubled passage following hearings scheduled to begin on February 20.|$|E
5|$|To face an {{opposition}} that was becoming uncooperative {{was not what}} Playford has expected, or could satisfactorily handle. Before the effect Dunstan had on Parliament, Playford would meet with Labor leaders to discuss bills, and ensure <b>bipartisan</b> support in the House of Assembly for them; there was little discordance on matters. The belligerents were previously only rural independent members.|$|E
5|$|Vermont {{joined the}} compact when Governor Peter Shumlin signed it into law on April 22, 2011. California entered the compact on August 8, 2011, with Governor Jerry Brown's signature. Rhode Island entered the compact on July 12, 2013, with Governor Lincoln Chafee's signature. On April 15, 2014, New York entered the compact with a <b>bipartisan</b> {{vote in the}} NY {{assembly}} and Governor Andrew Cuomo's signature.|$|E
5|$|When {{a federal}} court {{released}} former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A <b>bipartisan</b> majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons {{was the idea of}} Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, came up with the sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent <b>bipartisan</b> spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|After President Nixon {{was elected}} in November 1968, Ford's role shifted to being an {{advocate}} for the White House agenda. Congress passed several of Nixon's proposals, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1969. Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a <b>bipartisan</b> coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong {{assisted}} retired Filipino farmworkers in Delano, {{and was a}} delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention. Together with Vera Cruz, Itliong worked towards building a retirement facility for UFW workers, known as Agbayani Village. Although {{no longer in the}} United Farm Workers, Itliong continued to support others in the organized labor movement, such as helping others plan a strike against Safeway supermarkets in 1974. Itliong also served as President of the Filipino American Political Association, a <b>bipartisan</b> lobbying organization. He died in 1977 at the age of 63 in Delano of Lou Gehrig's disease.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1968, Kennedy {{had joined}} the new Committee for National Health Insurance at the {{invitation}} of its founder, United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther. In May 1970, Reuther died and Senator Ralph Yarborough, chairman of the full Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee and its Health subcommittee, lost his primary election, propelling Kennedy into a leadership role on the issue of national health insurance. Kennedy introduced a <b>bipartisan</b> bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, Republican {{congressional leaders}} reached a {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in <b>bipartisan</b> tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly unfair. Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a <b>bipartisan</b> bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a US <b>bipartisan</b> defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter. Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956. Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and the anti-nuclear movement.|$|E
5|$|Four years earlier, in the {{election}} of 1876, Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York {{in one of the}} most hotly contested presidential elections in the nation's history. The results initially indicated a Democratic victory, but the electoral votes of several states were disputed until just a few days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a <b>bipartisan</b> Electoral Commission, which ultimately decided the race for Hayes.|$|E
5|$|Garfield lingered for two-and-a-half {{months before}} dying on September 19, 1881. Vice President Chester A. Arthur, the New York Stalwart, {{was sworn in}} as {{president}} that night. Garfield's murder by a spoilsman inspired the nation to reform the civil service—and Arthur, erstwhile member of the Conkling machine, joined the cause. In 1883, a <b>bipartisan</b> majority in Congress passed the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act to reform the worst of the office-seeking system, and Arthur signed the measure into law.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, President Obama {{formed the}} <b>bipartisan</b> BowlesSimpson Commission to {{recommend}} steps {{that could be}} taken to reduce future budget deficits. The commission released its report on November 10, 2010, which recommended deep domestic and military spending cuts, reforming the tax system by eliminating many tax breaks in return for lower overall rates, and reducing benefits for Social Security and Medicare. The plan did not receive the supermajority vote within the commission which {{it needed to be}} directly sent to Congress, and portions of the plan were rejected by both parties.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{was born}} in the Panama Canal Zone. Had he been elected, he would have become the first {{president}} who was born outside the contiguous forty-eight states. This raised a potential legal issue, since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural-born citizen of the United States. A <b>bipartisan</b> legal review, and a unanimous but non-binding Senate resolution, both concluded that he is a natural-born citizen. Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency, and the second-oldest president to be inaugurated.|$|E
5|$|On March 3, 2013, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} Burwell {{to be the}} Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. A {{confirmation hearing}} was held on April10. Burwell's nomination received <b>bipartisan</b> support, culminating in the U.S. Senate confirming Burwell as Director by a 96–0 vote. With her confirmation, Burwell became only the second woman to serve as OMB Director, the first being Alice Rivlin, who held the position from 1994 to 1996.|$|E
5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from the disputed states. The counts of the disputed ballots were inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a <b>bipartisan</b> Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of the disputed electoral votes.|$|E
5|$|Rice also {{hoped to}} sponsor {{legislation}} supported by Ritter to raise vehicle registration fees {{in order to}} fund road and bridge repairs, but failed to find a suitable cosponsor for the bill. Late in the session, though, Rice signed on as House sponsor on a measure to raise registration and rental fees to create trust funds for transportation; the measure was later dropped {{in favor of a}} <b>bipartisan</b> study committee between legislative sessions.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, had suggested to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate <b>bipartisan</b> support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
5|$|The 2016–17 budget {{forecasts}} that defence expenditure will increase to $39.3 billion in 2019–20, which {{is estimated to}} represent 1.97% of GDP. This reflects a <b>bipartisan</b> commitment to increase defence expenditure to 2% of GDP. The 2016 Defence White Paper included a commitment to further increases in spending beyond this time, with nominal expenditure being projected to be around $58.8 billion in 2020–25; the Australian Strategic Policy Institute has estimated that this would represent about 2.16% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|The Ngô Đình Diệm presidential {{visit to}} Australia from 2 to 9 September 1957 was an {{official}} visit {{by the first}} president of the Republic of Vietnam. It was part of a year of travelling for Diệm, who made official visits to the United States and other anti-communist countries. As with his American trip, Diệm was warmly and lavishly received {{during the height of the}} Cold War, garnering <b>bipartisan</b> praise from both the Liberal Party of Australia of Prime Minister Robert Menzies and the opposition Australian Labor Party (ALP).|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} the 2010 midterm elections, Obama {{announced}} a compromise deal with the Congressional Republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. The compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858billion Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 passed with <b>bipartisan</b> majorities {{in both houses of}} Congress before Obama signed it on December 17, 2010.|$|E
