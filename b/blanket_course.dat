40|$|Fatigue {{calculations}} {{show that}} the service life of asphalt pavements can be increased at high temperatures {{through the use of}} harder binders and at low temperatures, through the use of softer binders. The research project was therefore designed to calculate the optimum bitumen viscosity for asphalt pavement of differing thickness in relation to the carrying capacity of the base and the tensile stress distribution resulting from temperature distribution and traffic load distribution using a suitable law of fatigue. A bitumen viscosity was to be calculated which promised the longest possible service life with a view to structural considerations rather than the asphalt used. In order to carry out this task: structural variants needed to be categorised according to construction method and construction class; assumptions needed to be made with regard to carrying capacity of the base in relation to the time of year and the construction method selected; frost <b>blanket</b> <b>course,</b> broken stone sub-base on frost <b>blanket</b> <b>course</b> or hydraulically bound road base on frost blanket course; spatial and time distribution of the asphalt body temperatures needed to be developed from the asphalt surface temperatures; assumptions needed to be drawn up based on traffic volumes - DTV and DTV(SV) - and traffic time series with regard to spatial and time distribution of traffic; tensile stress distribution caused by temperature and traffic load needed to be calculated in relation to geometrical location and time; estimates of the probable service life needed to be made based on these constraints and load stresses which make clear which bitumen viscosity guarantees the longest possible undamaged service life as seen from a structural point of view.

40|$|For {{ecological}} and economic reasons, there has {{in recent years}} been an increased tendency also to use broken-up asphalt {{in the manufacture of}} asphalt mixes. In the case of broken-up materials having higher tar contents, this is possible only with the aid of cold-processing methods. For this reason, the environmental compatibility and practical applicability of two of these methods were tested in experiments in the laboratory and on site. Use of granulated material having pure tar as a binder created a very critical boundary condition in terms of the material composition. The leached contents of harmful substances from granulated material with pure tar also showed that, for water conservation reasons, such a material cannot be used unbound. After binding of such tarry broken-up road materials with asphaltic emulsion and cement, or cement alone, the leaching is reduced, with the result that such construction material mixtures can be placed in base courses above a frost <b>blanket</b> <b>course.</b> (orig.)

60|$|It was {{impossible}} to distinguish anything. We {{might have been in}} a sphere of steel for all that we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it became opaque again with freshly condensed moisture mixed with an increasing quantity of <b>blanket</b> hairs. Of <b>course</b> I ought not to have used the blanket. In my efforts to clear the glass I slipped upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our bale.|$|R

The Merrill Lynch Skins Game was held in La Quinta each Thanksgiving and drew some of the biggest names in golf. The PGA has a major presence in La Quinta as well with the PGA WEST golf and residential complex. One of the host courses of the aforementioned Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, a PGA WEST fairway represents the area in Soarin' Over California, an IMAX-based attraction at Disney California Adventure Park theme park.|$|R
