25|$|On 11 March Gripenberg {{suggested}} truce of {{six weeks}} which the Russians Major General Muchanoff promptly rejected but agreed for a truce of {{three days after}} which hostilities would continue anew. Gripenberg agreed to a surrender on 14 March before the truce had run out. On 17 March Russian General commanding the armies in Finland, Friedrich Wilhelm von Buxhoeveden, accepted the surrender. Swedes surrendered the fortress with all its weapons intact to the Russians who in turn agreed just to dismiss the mostly Finnish garrison of Svartholm. The reasons for the capitulation are somewhat unclear <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the Swedish officers didn't believe in the Swedish capability, nor the fortress' capability to withstand the Russians in this war. As {{many of the other}} Swedish officers, Gripenberg entered Russian service after the capitulation. He was labeled a traitor in Sweden and was sentenced to death, along with other officers, for the loss of Finland. Due to a general amnesty, the death penalty process was interrupted, also for him.|$|E

500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days I was there, [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E

50|$|In the meantime, Dow Chemical {{was looking}} into {{how it might}} utilize large lignite {{deposits}} in Texas to reduce its dependence on natural gas to fuel its vast on-site power generating facilities. Not that its on-site power operations were necessarily impacted by the Fuel Use Act, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a good hedge {{just in case the}} natural gas shortage {{turned out to be the}} real thing.|$|R
500|$|The {{adductor}} injury kept Raonic out {{of competition}} for six weeks, {{during which he}} withdrew from the Delray Beach Open and the Mexican Open, and Canada's Davis Cup clash with France. He returned to action at the Indian Wells Masters, reaching the final against world No. 1 Djokovic {{with a string of}} four victories over top20 opponents: Bernard Tomic, Berdych, Monfils, and David Goffin. In the semifinal victory over Goffin, Raonic's average second serve (112mph) was faster than Goffin's average first serve (110mph). Before the final, Djokovic said: [...] "Milos is probably playing the best tennis that he has ever played. His serve was phenomenal before the start of this season, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> he has improved even more, especially the second serve. He's going for it more. He's not giving you the same look." [...] Raonic lost a lopsided straight sets match to Djokovic in the final, his third consecutive loss in an ATP 1000 final.|$|E
500|$|Jon Snow {{was killed}} in the fifth-season finale, [...] "Mother's Mercy", and in the lead up to the sixth season, actor Kit Harington, who portrays the character, stated {{that he would not be}} {{returning}} to the series except to play a corpse, and would not be resurrected despite rampant speculation. Following the airing of [...] "Home", Harington issued a public apology to fans of the show, stating that he would [...] "like to say sorry for lying to everyone. I'm glad that people were upset that he died. I think my biggest fear was that people were not going to care. Or it would just be, 'Fine, Jon Snow's dead.' <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> people had a, similar to the Red Wedding episode, kind of grief about it. Which means something I'm doing — or the show is doing — is right." [...] Harington was simply referred to as [...] "LC", for Lord Commander, in all scripts, call sheets, props or wardrobe materials, in order to maintain the secrecy involved with his eventual resurrection in the episode. It was also revealed that during production of the season, even verbal communication of the name 'Jon Snow' was disallowed, except in on-camera dialogue during actual taping of the series.|$|E
500|$|Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses is Slipknot's {{first album}} {{that does not}} warrant a Parental Advisory label, mainly because the lyrics of Vol. 3, {{compared}} to other Slipknot albums, are much less explicit in terms of profanity and obscure dark themes. The special edition still has a Parental Advisory label. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Mick Thomson explained that vocalist Corey Taylor {{made a point of}} avoiding the use of profanity in response to claims that he relied on use of it. Only two instances of profanity occur; {{the use of the word}} [...] "bitched" [...] in Duality and [...] "bastards" [...] which appears in the monologue leading into [...] "Pulse of the Maggots". According to AllMusic, the lyrics of Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) include metaphors and touch on themes that include anger, disaffection, and psychosis. Taylor's diversity in his vocal delivery was praised; Burns considered tracks like [...] "Vermilion Pt. 2" [...] to have [...] "stately vocal harmonies". Taylor's performance on the closing track [...] "Danger – Keep Away" [...] was specifically praised; Stylus called it the most [...] "depressing and emotional" [...] track on the album. Burns concluded that overall [...] "the riffs have lost none of their impact, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> finally the group also wants you to appreciate their vocal and lyrical impact." ...|$|E
5000|$|From {{the summer}} 2008, {{he not only}} {{apparently}} gained a basic spot in the lineup, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> he found an absolute chemistry with another 2 superstars of Aris: Sergio Contreras Pardo [...] "Koke" [...] and Mario Regueiro. All three have teamed up and formed a magical triangle that did stuffs and marvels, for example, in the summer 2008 friendlies with Werder Bremen and Club Brugge.|$|R
5000|$|Others {{felt that}} the use of celebrities diminished the {{relevance}} of the message; Roisin Donnelly of Procter & Gamble commented: [...] "In this print campaign, the celebrities, complete with injuries provided by the make-up artist, do get attention, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was a trick just to get attention, and was focused more on the celebrity and fake make-up rather than the central issue of domestic violence." ...|$|R

6000|$|We {{paused a}} moment in the hall to look at the big [...] "Grandfather" [...] clock. It was not going, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> an old, {{familiar}} acquaintance to us, with the gilt balls on its three peaks; the little dial and pointer which would indicate the changes of the moon, and the very dent in its wooden door which father had made when he was a boy, by kicking it in a fit of naughtiness.|$|R
5000|$|Among our rowdy amusements in Siberia was {{a popular}} knife game. You place {{the palm of your}} hand flat on a table with fingers apart.

[...] In 1980 he published [...] "'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'", which {{became one of the most}} frequently-cited papers in the temporal logic literature.

60|$|At Savernake {{there is}} nothing so {{humanised}} as the pig, even of the old type; you may roam for long hours and see no man and no domestic animal.

There you are at liberty to ramble all day unchallenged by any one; to walk, and run to warm yourself; to disturb a herd of red deer, or of fallow deer, which are more numerous; to watch them standing still to gaze back at you, then all with one impulse move rapidly away, showing their painted tails, keeping a kind of discipline, row behind row, moving over the turf with that airy tripping or mincing gait that strikes you as quaint and somewhat bird-like. Or you may coil yourself up, adder-like, beside a thick hawthorn bush, or at the roots of a giant oak or beech, and enjoy the vernal warmth, while outside of your shelter the wind blows bleak and loud.|$|E
5000|$|According to Waggoner, [...] "It {{looked like}} {{everything}} new that happened with MDOC, Cecil McCrory was involved in... They {{of the center}} {{were not supposed to}} be out at all." [...] He said, [...] "If I ran my facility like that, Epps would have shut me down, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> there was no problem when McCrory did it." [...] After Sims was reported to have taken a female inmate to a motel in nearby Carthage for sex in November 2009, Sheriff Waggoner became involved. He reported the allegation to MDOC, which assigned an internal investigator to assist the sheriff in an investigation.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} by Josh Holliday, of Virgin Media, as to the disparity between the album on the whole and this particular single, Pringle had the following comment: [...] We still love the track, and we did make a few songs that were more similar to <b>it</b> <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would survive on its own butwe wanted to make songs that were perhaps more conventional in their construction, incorporating more guitars etc. But yeah, in the future I think there'll be room for more single-orientated releases like 'I Love London'.

But there is no use talking about that! At first she would n't regard me seriously; she chaffed me and made light of me. But at last I forced her to admit I was a great man. Think of that, sir! Christina Light called me a great man. A great man was what she was looking for, and we agreed to find our happiness for life in each other. To please me she promised not to marry till I gave her leave. I was not in a marrying way myself, but it was damnation to think of another man possessing her. To spare my sensibilities, she promised to turn off her prince, and the idea of her doing so made me as happy as to see a perfect statue shaping itself in the block. You have seen how she kept her promise! When I learned it, {{it was as if the}} statue had suddenly cracked and turned hideous. She died for me, like that!" [...] And he snapped his fingers.

He was in an automobile; I never did know exactly how it happened,--we looked at each other, and he slowed up and came back and asked us to take a ride. I had never been in one of those things--but that wasn't why I went, I guess. Well, the rest was easy. He lost his head, and I was just as bad. You wouldn't believe me if I told you how rich he was: it scared me when I found out about him, and he was so handsome and full of fun and spirits, and generous! I never knew anybody like him. Honest, I never expected he'd want to marry me. He didn't at first,--it was only after a while. I never asked him to, and when he began to talk about it I told him it would cut him off from his swell friends, and I knew his father might turn him loose. Oh, it wasn't the money! Well, he'd get mad all through, and say he never got along with the old man, and that his friends would have to take me, and he couldn't live without me. He said he would have me educated, and bought me books, and I tried to read them. I'd have done anything for him. He'd knocked around a good deal since he'd been to Harvard College,--he wasn't what you'd call a saint, but his heart was all right. And he changed, too, I could see it. He {{said he was going to}} make something out of himself.|$|E

From c. 1988 to 1993 Pete performed all over the Los Angeles area with Kraig Grady, playing a purely acoustic music in just intonation. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> every time Kraig set down to record, Pete went on tour.
