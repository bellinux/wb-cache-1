5|$|Back in New Orleans, St. Clare debates slavery {{with his}} Northern cousin Ophelia who, while {{opposing}} slavery, is prejudiced against black people. St. Clare, however, {{believes he is}} not biased, {{even though he is}} a slave owner. In an attempt to show Ophelia that her views on <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> wrong, St. Clare purchases Topsy, a young black slave, and asks Ophelia to educate her.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E

5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|They have a 77% {{winning record}} in test match rugby, {{and are the}} only {{international}} side with a winning record against every opponent. Since their international debut in 1903, they have lost to only six of the 19 nations they have played in test matches. Since {{the introduction of the}} World Rugby Rankings in 2003, New Zealand has held the number one ranking longer than all other teams combined. The All <b>Blacks</b> <b>are</b> statistically the best side to have played the game, and jointly hold the record for the most consecutive test match wins for a tier one ranked nation.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention {{for lack of a}} passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting the loss of the French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E

25|$|Research {{shows that}} {{segregation}} {{along racial lines}} contributes to public goods inequalities. Whites and <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> vastly more likely to support different candidates for mayor than whites and blacks in more integrated places, which makes them less able to build consensus. The lack of consensus leads to lower levels of public spending.|$|E
25|$|Poor inner-city {{residents}} {{also must}} contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> {{far more likely to}} be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins. Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} in the literature that <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> more likely to commit violent crimes than are whites in the United States. Whether {{this is the case}} for less serious crimes is less clear. Black majority cities have similar crime statistics for blacks as do cities where majority of population is white. For example, white-plurality San Diego has a slightly lower crime rate for blacks than does Atlanta, a city which has black majority in population and city government.|$|E

25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War.

Featherston is so sure that <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> a threat to the Confederacy that, even as the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Black</b> pigment <b>is</b> an {{important}} pigment in the ceramic decoration. The traditional <b>black</b> pigment <b>is</b> spinel type matter containing Co, Fe or Cr elements. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> the best <b>black</b> pigment and <b>is</b> nontoxic. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> oxygenated in the ceramic sintering process at atmosphere. Carbon black enclosed in the crystal latter of ZrSiO 4 was reported. However, {{the content of}} carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> little which decreases the color generation. Carbon black coated with SiO 2 was prepared by sol-gel method using combustion method using SiO 2 sol and black ink as raw materials. The obtained <b>black</b> pigment <b>was</b> characterized by XRD, TEM and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The {{results show that the}} black pigment does not change its color after calcinations at 1300 °C at atmosphere implying the carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> coated completely with SiO 2...|$|R

50|$|Carbon <b>black</b> (subtypes <b>are</b> {{acetylene}} <b>black,</b> channel black, furnace black, {{lamp black}} and thermal <b>black)</b> <b>is</b> a material {{produced by the}} incomplete combustion of heavy petroleum products such as FCC tar, coal tar, ethylene cracking tar, and a small amount from vegetable oil. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> a form of paracrystalline carbon that has a high surface-area-to-volume ratio, albeit {{lower than that of}} activated carbon. It is dissimilar to soot in its much higher surface-area-to-volume ratio and significantly lower (negligible and non-bioavailable) PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) content. However, carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> widely used as a model compound for diesel soot for diesel oxidation experiments. Carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> mainly used as a reinforcing filler in tires and other rubber products. In plastics, paints, and inks carbon <b>black</b> <b>is</b> used as a color pigment.|$|R
25|$|Stoneman and his protégé Silas Lynch, a mulatto exhibiting psychopathic tendencies, head to South Carolina {{to observe}} the {{implementation}} of Reconstruction policies firsthand. During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> observed stuffing the ballot boxes, while many Whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on stereotypically African American fare such as fried chicken.|$|E
25|$|How {{distressing}} {{it is to}} {{be unable}} to send missionaries to Virginia, where there are five hundred thousand Negroes! It is indubitable that had we missionaries and funds to support them, prodigies would be effected in this vast and untilled field. In Maryland <b>blacks</b> <b>are</b> converted every day, {{and many of them are}} good Catholics and excellent Christians. At Baltimore many are frequent communicants, and three hundred or four hundred receive the Blessed Sacrament the first Sunday of every month. It is the same throughout Maryland, where there are a great many Catholics among the Negroes.|$|E
