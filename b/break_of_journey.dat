50|$|Travel tickets can be singles (SGL), {{the outward}} {{portion of a}} return (OUT) or the return portion of a return (RTN). Some tickets issued for special trains and {{charters}} were single-portion returns showing OUT&RTN, although ordinary tickets for scheduled services were never issued in this format. In the illustrated example, this is the journey back to Bradford-on-Avon. The {{distinction between the two}} portions of a return ticket is required because certain ticket types have different restrictions for the outward and return portions. For example, Savers allow a <b>break</b> <b>of</b> <b>journey</b> on the return portion, but not the outward portion; also the outward portion must be on the date shown, but the return portion can be on days within a month of the date shown.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of the latter, {{privatisation}} has resulted in a highly complex fare structure, with passengers regularly mis-sold tickets, or not aware of the full entitlement a ticket gives them. Enthusiasts, and those with connections to the industry, use the Great Britain railway technical manuals to identify which fares offer best value. This often involves purchasing tickets for stations which one has no intention of actually visiting, for a number of reasons. Since rail journeys in Great Britain are not always priced on mileage, often it is cheaper to buy a ticket from A to D via B and C, solely to travel from B to C (in some cases A = B or C = D). UK train operators have responded by often levying stiff penalty fares on passengers who attempt to leave the train before their ticketed destination when using an 'Advance Ticket' which does not allow a <b>Break</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Journey.</b> [...] When splitting a journey {{it is important that the}} entire journey is covered by tickets and that where you transfer from one ticket to another the train must stop at that station. It is even possible for two or more legs to involve the same train with no need to alight, this is called a [...] "tickety split".|$|E
60|$|In a {{first-class}} carriage {{of a train}} speeding Balkanward across the flat, green Hungarian plain two Britons sat in friendly, fitful converse. They had first foregathered in the cold grey dawn at the frontier line, where the presiding eagle takes on an extra head and Teuton lands pass from Hohenzollern to Habsburg keeping—and where a probing official beak requires to delve in polite and perhaps perfunctory, but always tiresome, manner into the baggage of sleep-hungry passengers. After a day’s <b>break</b> <b>of</b> their <b>journey</b> at Vienna the travellers had again foregathered at the trainside and paid one another the compliment of settling instinctively into the same carriage. The elder of the two had the appearance and manner of a diplomat; {{in point of fact}} he was the well-connected foster-brother of a wine business. The other was certainly a journalist. Neither man was talkative and each was grateful to the other for not being talkative. That is why from time to time they talked.|$|R
60|$|The intense cold had chilled his {{temperate}} blood, even as {{the rigors}} and conventions of Eastern life had checked his sincerity and spontaneous flow of animal spirits begotten in the frank intercourse and brotherhood of camps. He had just fled from the artificialities of the great Atlantic cities to seek out some Western farming lands in which he might put his capital and energies. The unlooked-for interruption of his progress by a long-forgotten climate only deepened his discontent. And now--that train was actually backing! It appeared they must return to the last station {{to wait for a}} snow-plough to clear the line. It was, explained the conductor, barely a mile from Shepherdstown, where there was a good hotel and a chance <b>of</b> <b>breaking</b> the <b>journey</b> for the night.|$|R
