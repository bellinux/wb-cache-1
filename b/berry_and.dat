The wine varieties viz., Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon blanc reported higher leaf phenolic content {{as compared to}} a table grape variety- Thompson Seedless. Significant increase in total phenolic content of leaves was registered with increase in foliar disease severity. <b>Berries</b> <b>and</b> wines of Cabernet Sauvignon exhibited polynomial pattern of total phenolic content with increase at lower levels of infection followed by decreasing trend. However, Sauvignon blanc wines reported linear negative relationship with powdery mildew infection levels. Phenolic profile of the leaves, <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> wines was significantly altered by the disease. The foliar infection in general resulted into accumulation of phenolic compounds in leaves <b>and</b> reduction in <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> wines due to cluster disease infection.

5|$|After their 2010 separation, <b>Berry</b> <b>and</b> Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where <b>Berry</b> <b>and</b> Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it would interfere with their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E

5|$|British {{rhythm and}} blues (or R) was a musical {{movement}} that developed in the United Kingdom between the late 1950s and the early 1960s, and reached a peak in the mid-1960s.

On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County.

5|$|Keith Richards and Mick Jagger became {{childhood}} {{friends and}} classmates in 1950 in Dartford, Kent, before the Jagger {{family moved to}} Wilmington, five miles (8.05km) away, in 1954. In the mid-1950s, Jagger formed a garage band with his friend Dick Taylor; the group mainly played material by Muddy Waters, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley. Jagger met Richards again in 1960 on Dartford railway station, and the Chuck <b>Berry</b> <b>and</b> Muddy Waters records that Jagger was carrying revealed a common interest. A musical partnership began shortly afterwards. Richards joined Jagger and Taylor at frequent meetings at Jagger's house. The meetings switched to Taylor's house in late 1961, where the three were joined by Alan Etherington and Bob Beckwith; the quintet called themselves the Blues Boys.|$|E
