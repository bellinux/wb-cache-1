2500|$|Besides black powder, {{there are}} other {{historically}} important types of gunpowder. [...] "Brown gunpowder" [...] is cited as composed of 79% nitre, 3% sulfur, and 18% charcoal per 100 of dry powder, with about 2% moisture. Prismatic Brown Powder is a large-grained product the Rottweil Company introduced in 1884 in Germany, which {{was adopted by the}} British Royal Navy shortly thereafter. The French navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called Slow Burning Cocoa (SBC) or [...] "cocoa powder". These brown powders reduced <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> even further by using as little as 2 percent sulfur and using charcoal made from rye straw that had not been completely charred, hence the brown color.|$|E

A new concept termed fire layer is introduced and defined to char-acterize the spatial locations of fire points by which the complex spatial variations of <b>burning</b> <b>rates,</b> under different conditions, are analyzed and physically interpreted. Analysis shows that the fire layer <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> vary from outer to inner in definite nonlinear modes. This indicates that the two fire interaction effects, heat feedback enhancement and air supply restriction, involve distinct spatial fluctuations in fire arrays. The spatial fluctuations of the two interaction effects are significantly affected by the two major parameters, fire spacing and fire array size. Definite spatial regions and parameter ranges for the spatial fluctuations and high competitions of the two interaction effects are clearly distinguished. It is demon-strated that the average <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> of all fire layers involve consistent variations versus fire spacing or fire array size, especially with high comparability to the entire fire array. It is found that by varying fire spacing, the average <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> for all fire layers vary linearly versus the fire area ratio, within the same ranges as the entire fire array, while there exist different fluctuation modes of fire layer <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> wit...|$|R

5000|$|In chemistry, {{the burn}} rate (or <b>burning</b> <b>rate)</b> {{is a measure}} of the linear {{combustion}} rate of a compound or substance such as a candle or a solid propellant. It is measured in length over time, such as [...] "mm/second" [...] or [...] "inches/second". Among the variables affecting burn rate are pressure and temperature. Burn rate is an important parameter especially in the area of propellants because it determines the rate at which exhaust gases are generated from the burning propellant which in turn decides the rate of flow through the nozzle. The thrust generated in the rocket of missile depends on this rate of flow. Thus Knowing quantitatively the <b>burning</b> <b>rate</b> of a propellant, and how it changes under various conditions, is of fundamental importance in the successful design of a solid rocket motor. The concept of <b>Burning</b> <b>rate</b> is also relevant in case of liquid propellants.|$|E

The research program utilizes a reduced gravity environment so that buoyancy effects are rendered negligible. Use of large droplets also facilitates visualization of droplet internal flows, which is important for this research. In the experiments, droplets composed of low- and high-volatility species are burned. The low-volatility components are initially present in small amounts. As combustion of a droplet proceeds, the liquid surface mass fraction of the low-volatility component will increase with time, resulting in a sudden and temporary decrease in droplet <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> as the droplet rapidly heats to temperatures close to the boiling point of the low-volatility component. This decrease in <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> causes a sudden and temporary contraction of the flame. The decrease in <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> and the flame contraction can be observed experimentally. Measurements of <b>burning</b> <b>rates</b> as well as the onset time for flame contraction allow effective liquid-phase species diffusivities to be calculated, e. g., using asymptotic theory.
