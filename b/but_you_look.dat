And if I catch you and my son again in any public {{restaurant}} I will thrash you" [...] to which Wilde responded: [...] "I don't know what the Queensberry rules are, but the Oscar Wilde rule is to shoot on sight". His account in De Profundis was less triumphant: [...] "It was when, in my library at Tite Street, waving his small hands in the air in epileptic fury, your father... stood uttering every foul word his foul mind could think of, and screaming the loathsome threats he afterwards with such cunning carried out". Queensberry only described the scene once, saying Wilde had [...] "shown him the white feather", meaning he had acted in a cowardly way. Though trying to remain calm, Wilde saw that he was becoming ensnared in a brutal family quarrel. He did not wish to bear Queensberry's insults, but he knew to confront him could lead to disaster were his liaisons disclosed publicly.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2010–11 season, Perry won the Hart Memorial Trophy, {{prevailing}} over finalists Daniel Sedin and Martin St. Louis, as the League's {{regular season}} MVP. [...] "You don't know what to expect when you come to this thing," [...] Perry said by phone. [...] "You don't want to expect to win. But then you hear your name. I thought I had a great chance, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the other two guys and they had great chances as well." [...] He became the first Ducks player to win the Hart Trophy and the first Ducks player to win the Maurice [...] "Rocket" [...] Richard Trophy since Teemu Selänne in 1999.|$|E
2500|$|Men - In {{the second}} {{installment}} of the series, Trinny and Susannah investiage the fashion issues of men, and ultimately aim to get a nation of well-dressed British men. To start their campaign, Trinny and Susannah attend a dress-down day at a civil engineers where they entice the engineers into their pink box {{to talk about their}} outfits. They duo are shocked at {{the way in which the}} men dress, with Susannah remarking [...] "You've got amazing coloured eyes <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like you've just crawled from under a stone." [...] Trinny and Susannah then monitor how men shop via secret cameras. They find that the men they have observed do not actually shop but get taken shopping by their wives.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in words, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> a whole {{volley of}} 'Can't I goes?' and I {{answered}} it. No girl <b>but</b> <b>you</b> would dream {{of such a}} thing; you hate picnics, and as {{this will be a}} long and rough one, don't you see how absurd it would be for you to try it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't mean to, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> {{so funny}} I really couldn't help it," [...] replied Meg, passing {{over the first}} part of his reproach, for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the Moffat party and the talk after it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How goes it, my {{cherished}} friend!' said he. 'How {{goes the}} world, my Flintwinch? Rose-coloured? So much the better, {{so much the}} better! Ah, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> charming! Ah, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> young and fresh as the flowers of Spring! Ah, good little boy! Brave child, brave child!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you--pardon me, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> very young, and a {{great deal}} too fresh and healthy for a town man--you don't know much of London life, do you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he responded, [...] "I {{suppose there}} was very little use in warning you to keep quiet; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> as if you had {{suffered}} for your rashness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Grace, {{it almost}} <b>looked</b> as if <b>you</b> were terrified {{at the sound}} of Julian's name! He is a public celebrity, I know; and I have seen ladies start and stare at him when he entered a room. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> {{perfectly}} panic-stricken." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Good-night, my dear," [...] said Sir John. [...] "I don't know what's {{the matter}} with you, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> as though you'd been doing {{something}} that you were ashamed of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{everything}} fixed," [...] he said jubilantly. [...] "Three men {{will start at}} sunrise. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> {{as if you had}} been discussing something important. What's it all about?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He went out, and Harry {{laughed as}} he said, [...] "Always the same! Weighs out the week's sugar to the teaspoonful. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> tired. If you feed I'll work the infernal chopper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Illustration: <b>But</b> if <b>you</b> <b>look,</b> {{and they}} fear {{there is no}} time to hide, they stand quite still pretending to be flowers (missing from book)] ...|$|R
6000|$|The Maynard's car was {{carrying}} his comrades away. His first feeling {{was one of}} gladness--the next of relief. He could be alone now--alone {{to find out what}} had happened to him, and to this strange Middleville. An old negro wearing a blue uniform accosted Lane, shook hands with him, asked him if he had any baggage. [...] "Yas sir, I sho knowed you, Mistah Dare Lane. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>looks</b> powerful bad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You might {{certainly}} have seen me. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> never <b>looked</b> towards me. It's useless {{to ask the}} question. I am sure you never saw me." ...|$|R
60|$|My sweet Eva, Where {{have you}} lain in ambush all the morning? They say your sister, Dora, has return'd, And that should make you happy, {{if you love}} her! <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> troubled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} {{what you are going}} to do, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> the part well," [...] he answered shortly. And, indeed, until that moment he had never known how beautiful she was.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, so I've {{always told}} the ladies--'there {{is no other}} matrimony in Wallingford,' I've said often, 'than that which will make him a ship's husband.' <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> confoundedly well--the sea agrees with you, famously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Speak! <b>But</b> if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> up {{and smile}} with that countenance, I shall swear {{concession}} before I know to what, {{and that will}} make a fool of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was plain," [...] said Cartwright, [...] "Well, I {{agree with}} her mother--Barbara was very lucky when she met <b>you,</b> <b>but</b> since <b>you</b> <b>look</b> embarrassed, we'll let this go. Did she repay your loan?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{in those}} words, perhaps; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> it and thought it, though you phrased it more mildly. I {{deserved}} it, but I shall deserve it no longer. I am beginning to wake from my disgraceful idleness, and long for some work that shall {{make a man}} of me. Why do you go? I annoy you with my confessions. Pardon me. They are the first I ever made; they shall be the last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Horton, [...] "you know best, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> a {{long way}} more fit to be sitting beside the stove up there at the ranch. That was a tolerably bad {{accident}} you had?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Knock me asunder, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> rosy, man!" [...] he cried. [...] "It's easy to {{see that}} you have not been lying off Fernando Po, or getting the land mist into your lungs in the Gaboon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed; I {{think you}} are not a bad old man. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> sorry about something. Tell me, is there {{anything}} you shall cry about when I leave you by yourself? I used to cry once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps because I {{have seen}} things to sadden me, Amada. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> too <b>look</b> well <b>but</b> {{somewhat}} lovelier than you used, I think, if that be possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{look very}} nice," [...] she said. [...] "Your clothes fit {{you and you}} are most becomingly tanned, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>look</b> half so awkward and so adorable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{think you}} {{understand}} me, of course, one could scarcely expect {{it from a}} lady; <b>but</b> if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the thing {{from our point of}} view, it's quite easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Keith's {{heart sank}} and Foster noticed her expression. [...] "It's {{a good way}} from Hazlehurst, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> {{as if you had}} been hurrying," [...] he remarked. [...] "Are you very much {{disappointed}} that you didn't meet us earlier?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Clytie {{bit her lip}} with vexation. [...] "Yes, she's always running away. She'll be back again. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> interested. Do you know," [...] she {{continued}} with exceeding archness, [...] "I sometimes think, Mr. Gray, if M'liss were a little older"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Annon having mercifully set me free, I came to try {{to cheer}} your {{solitude}}; <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> as if solitude made you happier than society does the rest of us," [...] she said without her usual affectation, for his manner impressed her.|$|E
5000|$|Hauer's enthusiasm {{caught the}} {{imagination}} of his colleague at Yale, Norman Carlberg. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist Josef Albers. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit formalism and even minimalism which held itself aloof {{from some of the}} other artistic trends of the time, such as the pop art and post-modernism that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle [...] "you analysed, <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at something, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

6000|$|... "Then God, perhaps, {{will have}} mercy upon me! <b>But</b> do <b>you</b> <b>look</b> to it, man, {{that you get}} {{something}} for yourself out of it, besides the remorse that shall overtake you some day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, don't call {{yourself}} old, Richard; {{you are only}} forty-five, the boldest, handsomest man in Warwickshire. <b>But</b> lately <b>you</b> <b>look</b> worried; what is it? Tell me, and let me advise or comfort you." ...|$|R
