40|$|As researcher-designer {{at his own}} company, Barron {{develops}} award-winning {{products for}} international markets. This device for CyDen was launched by Boots in February 2009. Intense Pulsed Light had been developed and patented by CyDen to remove hair and treat skin marks by directing an extremely short, intense pulse of filtered light into the skin, disabling the hair follicle and preventing hair re-growth, making chemical treatment unnecessary. Barron worked with the CyDen team at all levels to produce a desirable, easy to use, ergonomic consumer product which took {{the essence of the}} i 400 clinical device (previously designed by Barron) and brought it into the home. His engineering research expertise was crucial {{to the success of the}} design, enabling him to understand Cyden’s technical patents and to create a new kind of product, which was subsequently design-registered in Barron’s name internationally (from European application 000807748 - 001). Key technical breakthroughs were the miniaturisation of the power supply and development of effective cooling for the glass block through which the intense pulsed light passes, as well as the development of a safe interlock mechanism for disabling the device if it is not secured against the skin (to protect the eyes, for example). The device won a number of awards including Winner, Pure Beauty Awards 2010 and a (European) Telva Beauty Award for 'best <b>beauty</b> <b>device</b> for in home use'. iPulse was the European version of the same device as sold in Boots as 'Smooth Skin' and which became the company's best selling electrical item as well as the top-selling product on Boots. com In April 2012, CyDen secured an international agreement for a new generation of products with Proctor and Gamble, worth an estimated £ 250 m. This subsequently resulted in Braun and Gillette’s joint development of the next generation of products...|$|E

Providing them the ability refresh they facial appearance. These products must provide the consumer with portability without sacrificing functionality and effectively.

The growing demand for portable easy to use <b>beauty</b> <b>devices</b> in Japan led to the trending term, Moba Beau. This term has been made popular by working women in Japan and refers to small <b>beauty</b> <b>devices,</b> both electronic and non-electronic, that are designed to be on the go with a purpose to be used on the face of body. With a notable increase in the popularity of portable <b>beauty</b> <b>devices,</b> Procter and Gamble (P 2 ̆ 6 G) Japan KK has identified a market need for a hot portable facial steamer because of the popularity of home and professional use of hot facial steamers and the increasing trend for portable <b>beauty</b> <b>devices.</b> This combination of hot steam and in a portable form factor does not exist in the beauty market today.

50|$|The Dun Emer {{studio and}} press were named after Emer, {{daughter}} of Forgall Monach, {{wife of the}} hero Cúchulainn in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, a figure famous for her artistic skills {{as well as her}} <b>beauty.</b> The title-page <b>device</b> of the Dun Emer Press was designed by Elinor Monsell and shows Emer standing underneath a tree. Monsell also created the symbol of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, which depicts Maeve with a wolfhound. The focus of the Press was on publishing literary work by Irish authors, and Elizabeth and Lily Yeats's younger brother, the artist Jack Butler Yeats, did much of the illustration work.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- A {{growing demand}} for traffic data {{concerning}} traffic flow and automatic vehicle identification, led researchers {{around the world to}} adopt advanced electronic and computer vision technologies to monitor and control traffic. Increasing levels of road traffic ask for real time analysis of a moving car in order to extract important data, in this case the vehicle registration number. This paper describes a system based on image processing technology to meet the increasing needs of efficient traffic management. System detects and recognizes a license plate of the car registered in NWFP province of the Pakistan. It performs the recognition in almost real-time, watching cars slowing down in front of video recording <b>device.</b> <b>Beauty</b> of the system lies in a fact that it is using very low cost devices to accomplish this task even in real time...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of this dissertation is that contemporary Norwegian painter, Odd Nerdrum (b 1944), uses tenebrism as {{a mode of}} <b>beauty</b> and a <b>device</b> to emphasise psychological states of being. Tenebrism is an effective kitsch device to create an impression of realism and so-called truthfulness while pointing to the deepest human sentiments and emotions. I argue that Nerdrum’s tenebrist art questions dark truths about modernity and its effect on the self. The darkness of his tenebrist style amplifies the emotional states of his human characters, and becomes a negative form of transcendence into absence and the power of its nothingness. Nerdrum’s paintings are a visual record of the human capacity to withstand selfdestruction and strive for restoration from the inane. His physical act of painting opens and refines consciousness by slowing down time, for insight and contemplation. Dissertation (MA (Fine Arts)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|The {{gateways}} in Orbetello fortified walls {{represent a}} relevant example of decorative devices wisely integrated into technical and military apparati. Every passage has a specific functional connotation in the defensive {{system of the}} city, within curtains and powerful bastions. Thus, they comply with symbolic and representative criteria. They display Spanish Governors’ emblems, a sort of seal on the magnificent fortifications of the Stato dei Presidii. Coats of arms and heraldic symbols stand out solemnly and are visible from a long distance. The order of architecture frames the gateways and houses the systems to raise and lower drawbridges. Beyond these fortified passage areas, sheltered by wide embankments, the massive building of the Guzmán Powder Magazine stands. As {{the rest of the}} fortifications, the building was raised on essentially utilitarian purposes. However, it has the same symbolic power as the bastion gateways, sign of the Spanish military supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea in the XVII century. The historical analysis, preparatory to restoration, aims at highlighting the <b>beauty</b> of these <b>devices,</b> that must be available, regarding their didactic and museum value...|$|R
50|$|Santa Cruz {{is popular}} for its wide {{commercial}} offerings, including zona Centro (Central part) - Pedestrian calle Castillo, San José, del Pilar, Viera y Clavijo Zona Rambla (Rambla area) or Rambla de Pulido, calle Ramón y Cajal, {{and the big}} shopping centres and department stores in Avenida de 3 Mayo, plus the big malls in Añaza on the southern suburbs. The most upmarket and high street shopping is located along Calle del Pilar and nearby Parque Bulevar Shopping Centre, where many designer shops can be found. International and local brands of shops and restaurants, such as Zara, Mango, H&M, El Corte Inglés, IKEA, C&A, McDonald's and Burger King are much present on the island. Not only {{the wide range of}} shops makes the city attractive but the lower prices found in many items, such as tobacco, alcohol, electronic <b>devices,</b> <b>beauty</b> products, sunglasses or even food or coffee. They are indeed much lower than in most cities of Western Europe including Spain, due to the very special and much lighter taxation on goods enjoyed on the Canary Islands.|$|R
