6000|$|... "I {{noticed that}} his own clerks {{witnessed}} the signature, so I supposed {{it was done in}} the office. He made a point that I should get the transfer passed with some others without the attention of the directors being called to the matter. I got the transfer signed and sealed by two of the directors while there was a talk going on about other things, and they signed without looking at names. So far as I am concerned that was the beginning and ending of the matter. Oh, there was another point, the transfer was ante-dated three weeks. Of course, it might have been lying in <b>Brander's</b> office all the time. It was dated on the day after the previous board meeting, so that in the ordinary course it would not be passed until the next meeting, and it might very well have remained in <b>Brander's</b> hands until he knew that the directors were going to meet again. I have often wondered what <b>Brander's</b> game was, and of course I thought all the more of it when I saw that he had bought Fairclose. He was a crafty old fox, Brander, but I {{have never been able to}} understand why he permitted your father to ruin himself." ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{recent changes}} in the Norwegian agrifood industry from the analytical perspective of quality conventions. Storper and Salais’ “worlds of production” plus Boltanski and Thévenots’ “orders of worth” are used {{as a basis for}} the empirical study. First, the paper discusses how the largest Norwegian <b>branders</b> try to strategically adapt to “novel” quality attributes like health-enhancing food, origin/terroir, environmental sustainability and ethics. Second, the paper investigates the companies’ quality signalling strategy: How are these “novel” qualities communicated to consumers? Multiple options are available: Do they attempt to systematically incorporate “novel qualities” into their private brand equity (“conventionalizing qualities”) ? Do they prefer a co-labelling scheme with a third party control, or do they use any other measures for quality signalling? The paper thereby discusses how the largest Norwegian <b>branders</b> in the food sector cope with conflicting and competing quality conventions. Food quality, economics of convention., Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R
50|$|Karl Brandner (1898-1961) {{was born}} in Oak Park, Illinois and trained as an artist at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Fine Art Academy, Brander is best remembered as a {{regional}} artist who worked primarily in landscapes. <b>Brander's</b> landscapes and cityscapes were exhibited during his lifetime at the Hoosier Salon, the Chicago Gallery Association, and the Palette and Chisel Club.|$|R

60|$|Mary <b>Brander's</b> heart gave a bound {{as she saw}} {{the wounded}} man brought in, for she {{recognized}} the uniform at once. A glance, however, at the dark head reassured her.

6000|$|... "That {{would be}} so indeed," [...] Mr. Harford exclaimed, excitedly; [...] "it would {{be a piece of}} {{evidence}} there would be no getting over, and that fact would account for <b>Brander's</b> anger, which seemed to me was out of all proportion to the accident. If you could show that the mortgage deed on which Brander claimed is really that document we witnessed, it would be all up with him. As to the receipts for the payments of interest they proved nothing as they were, of course, in <b>Brander's</b> own handwriting and were found where he put them. If you could find out that Brander had knowledge of Mr. Hartington's state of health about the time that transfer was produced you would strengthen your case. It seems to me that he must have got an inkling of it just before he filled up the transfer, and that he ante-dated it a week so that it would appear to have been signed before he learnt about his illness. I can see no other reason for the ante-dating it." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the two {{workhorse}} theories {{of international trade}} under imperfect competition - Krugman's taste for variety model and <b>Brander's</b> strategic intra-industry trade model - are integrated into a single analytical framework. A quadratic utility function allows for a nesting of these two theories by postulating a consumer taste for variety over differentiated products, where the extent of product differentiation {{is linked to the}} intensity of strategic interaction among firms. The model yields intuitive predictions on the effects of the degree of product differentiation on the volume of trade and on the composition of the gains from trade under imperfect competition. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} role and {{function}} of corporate branding in organizational identity change, contributing to the increased scholarly interest in the organizing effects of branding, particularly corporate branding. Based on an ethnographic case study of corporate brand planning and implementation at a European telecommunications corporation, MGP, this paper demonstrates how corporate branding logic functions as a management fantasy that settles the tensions of planned organizational identity change. The findings illuminate the important implications of corporate branding logic for the professionalized practices of organizational identity work, with branding fantasized as a “silver bullet” by the organizational <b>branders</b> while in practice emerging as a self-defeating prophesy...|$|R
