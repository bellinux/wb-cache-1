Soil-consuming invertebrates such as earthworms speed PAH degradation, either through direct metabolism or by improving the conditions for microbial transformations. Abiotic degradation in the atmosphere and the top layers of surface waters can produce nitrogenated, halogenated, hydroxylated, and oxygenated PAHs; some of these compounds can be more toxic, water-soluble, and mobile than their parent PAHs.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{components}} of anthropogenic emissions are fertilized agricultural soils and livestock manure (42%), runoff and leaching of fertilizers (25%), biomass burning (10%), fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (10%), <b>biological</b> <b>degradation</b> of other nitrogen-containing atmospheric emissions (9%), and human sewage (5%). [...] Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation, {{the use of}} nitrogen fertilisers, and animal waste handling. These activities stimulate naturally-occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space, {{and the majority of}} a year's emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during [...] "hot moments" [...] and/or at favorable locations known as [...] "hotspots".|$|E
30|$|HS can {{be defined}} as {{ubiquitous}} natural compounds arising from the chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>degradations</b> of plant and animal residues [23]. A general consensus regards HS as supramolecular associations of heterogeneous and relatively small molecules, which are held together in only apparently large molecular sizes by weak forces, such as hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds [24], and whose conformations can be disrupted by the action of weak organic acids [25]. Based on their solubility in aqueous solutions as a function of pH, HS can be divided into three fractions: humic acids (HA) is the fraction that is soluble under alkaline pH conditions, fulvic acids (FA) is the fraction soluble in water at all pH values, and humin is the insoluble fraction.|$|R

2500|$|Soils {{represent}} a short to long-term carbon storage medium, and contains more carbon than all terrestrial vegetation {{and the atmosphere}} combined. Plant litter and other biomass including charcoal accumulates as organic matter in soils, and is degraded by chemical weathering and <b>biological</b> <b>degradation.</b> [...] More recalcitrant organic carbon polymers such as cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, aliphatic compounds, waxes and terpenoids are collectively retained as humus. [...] Organic matter tends to accumulate in litter and soils of colder regions such as the boreal forests of North America and the Taiga of Russia. Leaf litter and humus are rapidly oxidized and poorly retained in sub-tropical and tropical climate conditions due to high temperatures and extensive leaching by rainfall. Areas where shifting cultivation or slash and burn agriculture are practiced are generally only fertile for 2–3 years before they are abandoned. [...] These tropical jungles are similar to coral reefs {{in that they are}} highly efficient at conserving and circulating necessary nutrients, which explains their lushness in a nutrient desert. [...] Much organic carbon retained in many agricultural areas worldwide has been severely depleted due to intensive farming practices.|$|E
2500|$|Oil is {{generally}} {{a product of}} thermal breakdown of type I and type II kerogen during catagenesis. The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, isotopic exchange and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the isotope fractionation from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete residual oil as it gets evaporated. <b>Biological</b> <b>degradation</b> of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another source region, interacting with water. No data has been published to confirm the fractionation associated with migration, yet theoretical prediction shows that this is likely to be very small.|$|E

25|$|Two-ring PAHs, and to {{a lesser}} extent three-ring PAHs, {{dissolve}} in water, making them more available for <b>biological</b> uptake and <b>degradation.</b> Further, two- to four-ring PAHs volatilize sufficiently to appear in the atmosphere predominantly in gaseous form, although the physical state of four-ring PAHs can depend on temperature. In contrast, compounds with five or more rings have low solubility in water and low volatility; they are therefore predominantly in solid state, bound to particulate air pollution, soils, or sediments. In solid state, these compounds are less accessible for <b>biological</b> uptake or <b>degradation,</b> increasing their persistence in the environment.|$|R

Such highly energetic events can inject substantial quantities of material into the atmosphere. In turn, this changes the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and modifies atmospheric temperatures to produce {{a wide range of}} global effects. One consequence is the introduction of serious stresses in both plants and animals throughout the Earth's biosphere. For example, recent studies predict that forest lands, crop lands, and range lands would suffer specific physical and <b>biological</b> <b>degradations</b> if major physical and chemical disruptions occurred in our atmosphere. Forests, which cover over 4 times 10 to the 9 th power hectares (4 times 10 to the 7 th power sq km) of our planet, or about 3 times the area now cultivated for crops, are critical to many processes in the biosphere.

40|$|In this study, {{the use of}} {{polyvinyl}} alcohol (PVA) as boron fixative agent was investigated. Two levels of PVA (2. 5 and 4 %) were evaluated with disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT) at three concentrations (1, 2 and 4 % boric acid equivalent (BAE)) using a double vacuum impregnation process on Scots pine sapwood specimens. Leaching was performed according to a laboratory leaching procedure. Boron analysis using atomic absorption spectrometer showed {{a significant reduction in}} boron leachability for the samples treated with both concentrations of PVA when compared to the stand-alone boron treatment leading to boron retentions capable of preventing wood <b>biological</b> <b>degradations.</b> Decay resistance of the leached specimens was evaluated using the brown rot fungus Poria placenta. Even if complete protection was not fully achieved, an improvement in decay resistance was observed for the samples treated with DOT in presence of PVA. This leak of efficacy was attributed to a decrease in the biological activity of the complexed boron against fungi.
