50|$|A builder, for example, {{might use}} a <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage</b> {{to pay for}} {{construction}} of several homes in one neighborhood. When a home is sold, {{the portion of the}} mortgage that was used to fund that home is paid back to the lender, and then retired. The remaining outstanding balance is adjusted accordingly, and the <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage</b> continues phase by phase in that manner, until all houses are sold and the entire mortgage is repaid and retired.|$|E
5000|$|Traditional {{mortgages}} {{typically have}} a [...] "due-on-sale clause", which stipulates that if property secured by the mortgage is sold, the entire outstanding mortgage debt {{must be paid}} in full immediately. With a <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage,</b> a “release clause” allows the sale of portions of the secured property and corresponding partial repayment of the loan. This is done to facilitate purchases and sales of multiple units of property with the convenience of a single mortgage.|$|E
50|$|As a {{national}} factor, the Disconto-Gesellschaft lent its greatest support to industry through the promotion and financing of enterprises {{for the development}} of Germany's natural resources: the mining of coal and metals, smelting, iron and steel, potash, shipbuilding, electrical development, railways, fire and life insurance, etc. It assisted in the underwriting of the 10,000,000 thaler (30,000,000 marks) 5 per cent loan for the Krupp Works, in 1874 — the first instance in Germany of the issue of fractional form bonds secured by <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage</b> and providing for common representation of the holders of these bonds.|$|E
50|$|A blanket loan, or <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage,</b> {{is a type}} of loan used to {{fund the}} {{purchase}} of more than one piece of real property. Blanket loans are popular with builders and developers who buy large tracts of land, then subdivide them to create many individual parcels to be gradually sold one at a time. Rather than securing a new mortgage each time a portion of the development is sold, the borrower uses the blanket loan to buy them all. Once a parcel is sold, a portion of the mortgage is released, {{with the rest of the}} mortgage remaining intact.|$|E
40|$|A holds a first {{mortgage}} covering two {{parcels of}} land, B holds {{a second mortgage}} covering one of these parcels, and C holds a second mortgage covering the other parcel, B 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage being prior in time to C 2 ̆ 7 s. B 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage contains the following clause [...] 2 ̆ 2 The property described in the within indenture is subject to an existing <b>blanket</b> <b>mortgage</b> held by A, with release clause of 10 per front foot. 2 ̆ 2 Upon a bill to foreclose A 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage, how should the burden of that mortgage be distributed? In Savings Investment 2 ̆ 6 Trust Co. v. United Realty 2 ̆ 6 Mortgage Co., 94 Atl. 588, the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey held that both parcels should be sold, separately, and the paramount mortgage paid out of the proceeds, each parcel contributing in proportion to its price at the sale. The court 2 ̆ 2 assumes 2 ̆ 2 (as it can hardly avoid doing upon the authorities) that the 2 ̆ 2 rule of sale in inverse order of alienation is applicable in favor of mortgagees, {{as it is in}} favor of grantees, 2 ̆ 2 but holds that the language of B 2 ̆ 7 s mortgage makes the rule inapplicable in this case...|$|E
