5|$|In around 1270, Peckham {{returned}} to England, where he {{taught at the}} University of Oxford, and was elected the provincial minister of England (Minoriten) in 1275. After a brief stint in Rome, he was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in 1279. His time as archbishop was marked by efforts to improve discipline in the clergy as well as reorganize the estates of his see. Pluralism, or holding more than one clerical benefice, {{was one of the}} abuses that Peckham combatted. He served King Edward I of England in Wales, where he formed a low opinion of the Welsh people and laws. Before and during his time as archbishop, he wrote a number of works on optics, philosophy, and theology, as well as writing hymns. Numerous manuscripts of his works survive. On his death, his body was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> was given to the Franciscans for burial.|$|E

[...] Columnist Mitch Albom wrote: [...] "Denard Robinson redefined the term 'offensive weapon' on Saturday against Notre Dame." [...] ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit noted the [...] "confident aura" [...] around Robinson:"The body language he exudes is, 'I'm a winner.'

500|$|Declan {{was then}} portrayed as having even more trouble battling his {{feelings}} for Kate, but tried {{hard not to}} forget Bridget.

[...] After the couple began dating it attracted a bigger mixed response from viewers, many felt it was still too soon after Bridget. Sorensen then spoke out once more defending his character stating: The storyline then carried on progressing and viewers saw the two characters grow closer until they started a relationship, despite the mixed response received from fans of Declan and Bridget.|$|E

2500|$|Four RCMP officers, Constables Gerry Rundel, Bill Bentley, Kwesi Millington, and {{supervisor}} Corporal Benjamin Robinson, {{arrived and}} entered the Customs room where Dziekański was pacing about. They apparently directed him to stand near a counter, to which Dziekański complied but picked up a stapler sometime after being told to place his hands on a counter. Shortly thereafter, about 25 seconds after arriving at the scene, Corporal Robinson ordered the Taser to be used. Constable Millington tasered Dziekański. He began to convulse and was tasered several more times after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned, handcuffed, and continued to taser him. One eyewitness, who recorded the incident on her cellphone, told CBC News that Dziekański had been tasered four times. [...] "The third and fourth ones were at the same time" [...] delivered by the officers at Dziekański's right and left, just before Dziekański fell. According to B.C. Crown counsel spokesman Stan Lowe, Dziekański was tasered {{a total of five}} times. Constable Millington testified that he deployed the Taser four times, but he believed that in some of those instances the probes may not have contacted Dziekański's body. Dziekański writhed and screamed before he stopped moving. Cpl. Benjamin Monty Robinson stated he then checked for a pulse, <b>but</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> had stopped. [...] Testimony from the other RCMP officers state they never saw anyone including Robinson check for a pulse. Dziekański did not receive CPR until paramedics arrived on the scene approximately 15 minutes later. They were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead at the scene.|$|E
