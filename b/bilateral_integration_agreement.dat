The main conclusion of the study is that the responses to an <b>integration</b> <b>agreement</b> largely depend on the environmental change brought about by the agreement and the locational advantages of the participating countries and industries.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic relationship between trade and income. While most economists agree that increased trade {{leads to an}} increase in average income, economic theory is ambiguous about the possible effects on the long-run growth rate of the economy. Using a dynamic panel data model, the hypotheses of no long-run effects of trade on income and on income growth are tested explicitly. The possibility of endogeneity is addressed by constructing an instrument for trade by extending Frankel and Romer''s (1999) cross-sectional approach to the case of a panel data model. The empirical results indicate that trade has a large and significant effect on the level of income, but the effect on income growth is small and non-robust to model specification.

The {{results indicate that the}} impact of RIAs vary depending on different kinds of regional integration. The response to integration between developed countries (North-North integration) may differ from the response to integration between developing countries (South-South integration) or to an agreement between countries at different levels of development (North-South integration), depending on the significance and nature of environmental change brought about by the RIAs, the locational advantage of the country or region and the degree of integration at the outset. The RIAs between developed countries had relatively little influence on foreign bank entry, since much of the financial service trade between the member countries had been liberalized long before the agreement was established. By contrast, North-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> and South-South <b>integration</b> <b>agreements</b> brought about significant region’s policy environment changes and more proximity institutional, which suggests that they may have a notable (although varying) impact on banking sector FDI in the member countries...|$|R

A country's share in the world trade, a proxy for the world integration channel, is able to explain about 12 % of abnormal return variation, while the liquidity channel exhibits the lowest predictive power, with the value of stock trading explaining about 6 %.

40|$|Ethiopia, {{the most}} populous least-developed country outside of the World Trade Organization, is {{on the process of}} {{accession}} since 2003. What the potential implications of this accession will be for the financial service sector, which is widely closed from foreigners participation, is an interesting question since liberalization commitments under the GATS have different impact on different modes of supply and for different stakeholders. Financial services are key to any properly functioning economy and hence their liberalization which caries many advantages and risks is a sensitive issue requiring acceding governments to carefully handle the negotiation process by addressing their basic needs. This thesis discusses the impact of Ethiopian accession on its financial service sector focusing on the banking, insurance and micro finance sectors, and market access and national treatment issues. It identifies different commitment scenarios under each mode of supply considering the potential legal and economic impacts on stakeholders i. e. consumers, domestic financial institutions and the government of Ethiopia. It asserts that Ethiopian poor financial service sector which is dominated by the banking sector and public financial institutions will highly benefit from the conditional liberalization of mode 1 and mode 4; full liberalization of mode 2; and liberalization of mode 3 through branches, equity participation and/or subsidiaries. This combination of scenarios seems the most feasible that allows Ethiopia {{to take advantage of the}} liberalization process while simultaneously minimizing the spill-over risks. Moreover, acceding to the WTO alone will not enable Ethiopia to achieve growth in the financial service sector or economically. Therefore, the Ethiopian government should equally pay attention to solving domestic problems of regulation, corruption and lack of competition. It should also exploit other alternatives and privileges like regional <b>integrations,</b> <b>bilateral</b> trade <b>agreements</b> and general system of preferences...|$|R
