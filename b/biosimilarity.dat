40|$|PURPOSE: Population {{pharmacokinetic}} analyses (PPK) {{have been}} used to establish bioequivalence for small molecules and some biologicals. We investigated whether PPK could also be useful in <b>biosimilarity</b> testing for monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). METHODS: Data from a <b>biosimilarity</b> trial with two trastuzumab products were used to build population pharmacokinetic models. First, a combined model was developed and similarity between test and reference product was evaluated by performing a covariate analysis with trastuzumab drug product (test or reference) on all model parameters. Next, two separate models were developed, one for each drug product. The model structure and parameters were compared and evaluated for differences. RESULTS: Drug product could not be identified as statistically significant covariate on any parameter in the combined model, and the addition of drug product as covariate did not improve the model fit. A similar structural model described both the test and reference data best. Only minor {{differences were found between the}} estimated parameters from these separate models. CONCLUSIONS: PPK can also be used to support a <b>biosimilarity</b> claim for a MAb. However, in contrast to the standard non-compartmental analysis, there is less experience with a PPK approach. Here, we describe two methods of how PPK can be incorporated in <b>biosimilarity</b> testing for complex therapeutics...|$|E

In practice, {{access to these}} life-saving biological products is limited due to their expensive cost. In the next few years, patents of the early biological products will expire. This provides other biopharmaceutical/biotech companies the opportunity to manufacture follow-on biologics. For the conventional pharmaceuticals of small molecules, regulations and statistical methods {{for the assessment of}} bioequivalence for generic approval are well established. However, unlike the conventional drug products, the complexity and heterogeneity of the molecular structure, complicated manufacturing process, different analytical methods, and the possibility of severe immunogenicity reactions make evaluation of equivalence (similarity) between an innovator and its follow-on biologics a great challenge for both the scientific community and regulatory agencies. This article reviews past experiences for the assessment of bioequivalence for conventional drug products. Detailed descriptions of the fundamental differences and assumptions between the chemical generic products and follow-on biologics are given. An overview of current regulatory requirements for assessing <b>biosimilarity</b> of follow-on biologics is provided.

The first guidance “Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating <b>Biosimilarity</b> to a Reference Product” assists {{companies in}} demonstrating that a proposed therapeutic protein product is biosimilar to a reference product {{for the purpose}} of submitting an application, called a “ 351 (k)” application, to the FDA. It also describes a risk-based “totality-of-the-evidence” approach that the FDA intends to use to evaluate the data and information submitted in support of a determination of <b>biosimilarity</b> of the proposed product to the reference product (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al. 2015 a). The second guidance entitled “Quality Considerations in Demonstrating <b>Biosimilarity</b> to a Reference Protein Product” provides an overview of analytical factors to consider when assessing <b>biosimilarity</b> between a proposed therapeutic protein product and a reference product {{for the purpose of}} submitting a 351 (k) application. This includes the importance of extensive analytical, physico-chemical and biological characterization in demonstrating that the proposed biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al. 2015 b). Also in May 2015, the FDA released a draft guidance on “Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ”. This guidance document is being distributed for comment purposes only and provides answers to common questions from people interested in developing biosimilar products. The question and answer format addresses questions that may arise {{in the early stages of}} product development, such as how to request meetings with the FDA, addressing differences in formulation from the reference product, how to request exclusivity, and other topics (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|As most {{adaptive}} {{clinical trial}} designs are implemented in stages, well-understood methods of sequential trial monitoring are needed. In the frequentist paradigm, examples of sequential monitoring methodologies include the p-value combination tests, conditional error, conditional power, and alpha spending approaches. Within the Bayesian framework, posterior and predictive probabilities are used as monitoring criteria, with the latter being analogous to the conditional power approach. In a placebo or active-contolled dose response clinical trial, {{we are interested in}} achieving two objectives: selecting the best therapeutic dose and confirming this selected dose. Traditional approach uses the parallel group design with Dunnett's adjustment. Recently, some two- stage Seamless II/III designs have been proposed. The drop-the-losers design considers selecting the dose with the highest empirical mean after the first stage, while another design assumes a dose-response model to aid dose selection. These designs however do not consider prioritizing the doses and adaptively inserting new doses. We propose an adaptive staggered dose design for a normal endpoint that makes minimal assumption regarding the dose response and sequentially adds doses to the trial. An alpha spending function is applied in a novel way to monitor the doses across the trial. Through numerical and simulation studies, we confirm that optimistic alpha spending coupled with informative dose ordering jointly produce some desirable operating characteristics when compared to drop-the-losers and model-based Seamless designs. In addition, we show how the design parameters can be flexibly varied to further improve its performance and how it can be extended to binary and survival endpoints. In a <b>biosimilarity</b> trial, we are interested in establishing evidence of comparable efficacy between a follow-on biological product and a reference innovator product. So far, no standard method for <b>biosimilarity</b> has been endorsed by regulatory agency. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical bias model and a non-inferiority hypothesis framework to prove <b>biosimilarity.</b> A two-stage adaptive design using predictive probability as early stopping criterion is pro- posed. Through simulation study, the proposed design controls the type I error better than the frequentist approach and Bayesian power is superior when <b>biosimilarity</b> is plausible.

With the development of several enoxaparin biosimilars, real medical concerns about their safety and efficacy have been raised. This repeated dose toxicity study consists of preclinical toxicological evaluation of a biosimilar biological version of enoxaparin, the drug product ``Enoxa'', compared to the enoxaparin reference drug product, ``Lovenox''. Eighty white Wistar rats were treated with ``Enoxa'' versus the reference product, using subcutaneous therapeutic and toxic doses, varying from 3. 5 to 100 mg/kg/day. Dose levels were adjusted and ultimately fixed at 3. 5 and 20 mg/kg/day as therapeutic and toxic doses, respectively. A sodium chloride solution (0. 9 %) {{was used as the}} control, and the comparative study was conducted over periods of 14 and 28 days. Comparable effects were observed with few adverse effects at the administration dose of 20 mg/kg/day, for both enoxaparin biosimilar and reference products.

40|$|As {{products}} of living cells, biologics {{are far more}} complicated than small molecular-weight drugs not only with respect to size and structural complexity but also their sensitivity to manufacturing processes and post-translational changes. Most of {{the information on the}} manufacturing process of biotherapeutics is proprietary and hence not fully accessible to the public. This information gap represents a key challenge for biosimilar developers and {{plays a key role in}} explaining the differences in regulatory pathways required to demonstrate <b>biosimilarity</b> versus those required to ensure that a change in manufacturing process did not have implications on safety and efficacy. Manufacturing process changes are frequently needed for a variety of reasons including response to regulatory requirements, up scaling production, change in facility, change in raw materials, improving control of quality (consistency) or optimising production efficiency. The scope of the change is usually a key indicator of the scale of analysis required to evaluate the quality. In most cases, where the scope of the process change is limited, only quality and analytical studies should be sufficient while comparative clinical studies can be required in case of major changes (e. g., cell line changes). <b>Biosimilarity</b> exercises have been addressed differently by regulators on the understanding that biosimilar developers start with fundamental differences being a new cell line and also a knowledge gap of the innovator's processes, including culture media, purification processes, and potentially different formulations, and are thus required to ensure that differences from innovators do not result in differences in efficacy and safety. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} biosimilars has spreadfrom Europe to other regions {{throughout}} the world, and many regions have drafted regulatory guidelines for their development.

The mainstay for the establishment of <b>biosimilarity</b> is the pharmaceutical comparability based on extensive physicochemical and biological characterization.

40|$|When {{the patent}} of a brand-name, marketed drug expires, new, generic {{products}} are usually offered. Small-molecule generic and originator drug products {{are expected to}} be chemically identical. Their pharmaceutical similarity can be typically assessed by simple regulatory criteria such as the expectation that the 90 % confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of some pharmacokinetic parameters be between 0. 80 and 1. 25. When such criteria are satisfied, the drug products are generally considered to exhibit therapeutic equivalence. They are then usually interchanged freely within individual patients. Biological drugs are complex proteins, for instance, because of their large size, intricate structure, sensitivity to environmental conditions, difficult manufacturing procedures, and the possibility of immunogenicity. Generic and brand-name biologic products can be expected to show only similarity but not identity in their various features and clinical effects. Consequently, the determination of <b>biosimilarity</b> is also a complicated process which involves assessment of the totality of the evidence for the close similarity of the two products. Moreover, even when <b>biosimilarity</b> has been established, it may not be assumed that the two biosimilar products can be automatically substituted by pharmacists. This generally requires additional, careful considerations. Without declaring interchangeability, a new product could be prescribed, i. e. it is prescribable. However, two products can be automatically substituted only if they are interchangeable. Interchangeability is a statistical term and it means that products can be used in any order in the same patient without considering the treatment history. The concepts of interchangeability and prescribability have been widely discussed in the past but only in relation to small molecule generics. In this paper we apply these concepts to biosimilars and we discuss: definitions of prescribability and interchangeability and their statistical implementation; the relation between bioequivalence and interchangeability for small-molecule drug products; regulatory requirements and expectations of biosimilar products in various jurisdictions; possible statistical approaches to establish the similarity and interchangeability of biologic drug products; definition of other technical terms such as switchability and automatic substitution.

40|$|Many of {{the best-selling}} ‘blockbuster’ {{biological}} medicinal products are, or will soon be, facing competition from similar biological medicinal products (biosimilars) in the EU. <b>Biosimilarity</b> {{is based on the}} comparability concept, which has been used successfully for several decades to ensure close similarity of a biological product before and after a manufacturing change. Over the last 10 years, experience with biosimilars has shown that even complex biotechnology-derived proteins can be copied successfully. Most best-selling biologicals are used for chronic treatment. This has triggered intensive discussion on the interchangeability of a biosimilar with its reference product, with the main concern being immunogenicity. We explore the theoretical basis of the presumed risks of switching between a biosimilar and its reference product and the available data on switches. Our conclusion is that a switch between comparable versions of the same active substance approved in accordance with EU legislation is not expected to trigger or enhance immunogenicity. On the basis of current knowledge, it is unlikely and very difficult to substantiate that two products, comparable on a population level, would have different safety or efficacy in individual patients upon a switch.

40|$|Early phase, or phase I and phase II, {{trials are}} {{the first step in}} testing new {{medicines}} that have been developed in the lab. The main goal of phase I clinical trials is to establish the recommended dose of new drugs for phase II trials. For the cytotoxic drugs, the goal is to find maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Therefore, dose escalation methods, especially Bayesian designs, are recommended to be used in phase I trials. There are many proposed Bayesian phase I adaptive designs, among them, continual reassessment method (CRM) is the firstly proposed pioneered Bayesian design. The CRM needs pre-specification of a series of prior guesses of toxicity probabilities of each investigated doses, known as the skeleton, using a parametric model, and then continuously updates the estimate of the dose-toxicity curve based on accumulating data. By using a dose-toxicity model, the CRM efficiently pools data across doses and adaptively makes the decision of dose assignment and selection. Two chapters of the thesis devote to development of the CRM design (chapter 2) and to extend the CRM design (chapter 3). Specifically, chapter 2 deals with the issue of skeleton pre-specification in the CRM design. We propose an automatic way to generate multiple skeletons for Bayesian model averaging CRM (BMA-CRM), an extension of robust version of the CRM, to avoid arbitrary specification of skeletons with improving performances compared to the original CRM and BMA-CRM designs. Chapter 3 deals with bridging studies, or follow-up trials. The emergence of bridging studies is due to different ethnic populations with different responses to a same drug and consequentially attaining different MTDs. Therefore, conventional one-size-fit-all paradigm cannot work. But, despite variations among different ethnic populations, their drug responses still show somewhat similarities. Commonly, a landmark trial has been conducted and a MTD dose has also been established for a certain population. Thus, independent conducting a trial for a new population of ignoring information of the landmark trial is wasteful. Therefore, challenges of the bridging studies include: how to effectively use/borrow information of the historical landmark trial, and how to design trials to accommodate heterogeneities of different populations. In this chapter, we develop a novel design, Bridging-CRM, B-CRM, to borrow the landmark trial information based on a proposed mixture estimator and the CRM framework, and to acknowledge different populations 2 ̆ 7 heterogeneities of using the idea of multiple skeletons. Chapter 4 focuses on phase II design for biosimilar drug development. Biosimilar is a term that describes the equivalence of a generic version to an innovator 2 ̆ 7 s biologic drug product; biosimilars are close, but not exact copies of biologic drugs already on the market. Guidelines for statistical methods to establish <b>biosimilarity</b> remain nonspecific because of the newness of biosimilars. It is therefore of high urgency to develop appropriate and reliable statistical methodologies for developing biosimilars. Some statistical methods have been proposed to assess <b>biosimilarity,</b> but none of them proposed designs in this field. However, biosimilar trials come with several challenges that are beyond the scope of the conventional randomized comparative trial design. First, when a biosimilar is ready to be tested in a randomized trial, the innovative reference drug has been in the market for many years and a huge amount of data on that drug has accumulated. It is critical to incorporate these rich historical data into the biosimilar trial design to improve trial efficiency. Another challenge when designing biosimilar trials is determining how to quantify and monitor the biosimilar during the trial. To address these issues, in chapter 4, we develop a new approach, the calibrated power prior (CPP), to allow the design to adaptively borrow information from the historical data according to the congruence between the historical data and the data collected in the current trial. We also propose the Bayesian <b>biosimilarity</b> index (BBI) to assess the similarity between the biosimilar and the innovative reference drug. In our design, we evaluate the BBI in a group sequential fashion based on the accumulating interim data, and stop the trial early once there is enough information to conclude or reject the similarity...|$|E

However, they require complex manufacturing processes, resulting in high cost and occasional shortages in supply. The cost of biologics limits accessibility of cancer treatment for many patients. Effective and affordable cancer therapies are needed globally, more so in developing countries, where health care resources can be limited. Biosimilars, which have biologic activity comparable to their corresponding reference drugs and are often more cost effective, have the potential to enhance treatment accessibility for patients and provide alternatives for decision makers (ie, prescribers, regulators, payers, policymakers, and drug developers). Impending patent expirations of several oncology biologics have opened up a vista for the development of corresponding biosimilars. Several countries have implemented abbreviated pathways for approval of biosimilars; however, challenges to their effective use persist.

Inference {{on the model}} curve can {{be based on the}} estimated parameters, from which pointwise confidence intervals for the mean profile at any single point in the covariate region (time, dose, etc.) can be derived. These pointwise confidence intervals, however, should not be used for simultaneous inferences beyond that single covariate value.

In this paper we consider simultaneous confidence bands for the mean profile over the covariate region of interest and propose two large-sample methods for their construction. The first method is based on the Schwarz inequality and an asymptotic ? 2 distribution. The second method relies on simulating from a multivariate normal distribution. We illustrate the methods with the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. In addition, we report the results of an extensive simulation study to investigate the operating characteristics of the two construction methods.

Concerns around extrapolation are exemplified using the biosimilar infliximab, CT-P 13, focusing on mechanisms of action, immunogenicity and trial design. The opportunities and cautions for using biologics and biosimilars in unlicensed inflammatory conditions are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Biosimilars offer many potential opportunities in improving treatment access and increasing treatment options. The high cost associated with marketing approval means that many bio-originators may never become licenced for rarer inflammatory conditions, despite clinical efficacy. Biosimilars, with lower acquisition cost, may improve access for off-label use of biologics in {{the management of}} these patients. They may also provide opportunities to explore off-label treatment of conditions where biologic therapy is less established. However, this potential advantage must be balanced with the awareness that off-label prescribing can potentially expose patients to risky and ineffective treatments. Post-market monitoring is critical to developing long-term evidence to provide assurances on efficacy as well as safety...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe charge {{variations}} of therapeutic monoclonal antibody reveal important information of the post-translational modifications that may potentially impact the potency {{and safety of}} pharmaceutical products, especially during the evaluation of <b>biosimilarity</b> of therapeutic proteins. In this work, a novel SpeB-based proteolysis strategy coupling with imaged capillary isoelectric focusing was developed for the determination of domain-specific charge heterogeneities of innovator and generic Rituximab drug products from United States, European and Indian markets. It was observed that innovator Rituximab from the United States and Europe share highly similar peak distributions and charge heterogeneities with 26. 2 – 26. 6 % Fc/ 2, 28. 9 – 29. 3 % LC and 44. 4 – 44. 5 % Fd peak areas detected, respectively, while multiple basic {{variations of}} Fc/ 2 and less acidic LC and Fd species were found from generic Rituximab from India with 20. 9 % Fc/ 2, 32. 3 % LC and 46. 9 % Fd peak areas detected. It was also demonstrated that structural changes caused by Carboxypeptidase B treatment and deamidation study at pH extremes could be sensitively captured with the established method, with the results further indicating that the generic product’s basic variations of Fc/ 2 were un-cleaved Lysine residues, while the lack of certain acidic peaks on LC and Fd probably {{was due to the}} lower level of deamidation. This new strategy could become a useful tool to reveal domain-specific charge heterogeneities profiles of a variety of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies in regulated environments...|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of therapeutic antibodies with fragment crystallizable γ (Fcγ) receptors and neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) are measured in vitro {{as indicators of}} antibody functional performance. Antibodies are anchored to immune cells through the Fc tail, and these interactions are important for the efficacy and safety of therapeutic antibodies. High-throughput binding studies {{on each of the}} human Fcγ receptor classes (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb) as well as FcRn have been developed and performed with human IgG after stress-induced modifications to identify potential impact in vivo. Interestingly, we found that asparagine deamidation (D-N) reduced the binding of IgG to the low-affinity Fcγ receptors (FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb, FcγRIIIa, and FcγRIIIb), while FcγRI and FcRn binding was not impacted. Deglycosylation completely inhibited binding to all Fcγ receptors, but showed no impact on binding to FcRn. On the other hand, afucosylation only impacted binding to FcγRIIIa and FcγRIIIb. Methionine oxidation at levels below 7 %, multiple freeze/thaw cycles and short-term thermal/shake stress did not influence binding to any of the Fc receptors. The presence of high molecular weight species, or aggregates, disturbed measurements in these binding assays; up to 5 % of aggregates in IgG samples changed the binding and kinetics to each of the Fc receptors. Overall, the screening assays described in this manuscript prove that rapid and multiplexed binding assays may be a valuable tool for lead optimization, process development, in-process controls, and <b>biosimilarity</b> assessment of IgGs during development and manufacturing of therapeutic IgGs...|$|E
40|$|Three biosimilar {{products}} are now licensed {{for the treatment}} of rheumatic diseases in Europe. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) requires that similarity between a biosimilar and its reference product is demonstrated using a rigorous, stepwise process that includes extensive physicochemical and biological analytical testing, non-clinical pharmacology, clinical evaluations, and pharmacovigilance plans. Each step is highly sensitive to any differences between products and progressively reduces any uncertainty over similarity; all steps must be satisfied to demonstrate <b>biosimilarity.</b> The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires a similar stringent biosimilar development process. The etanercept biosimilar SB 4 (Benepali®), recently approved {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis, non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis), and plaque psoriasis, is herein used to demonstrate the detailed analytical characterisation and clinical testing that are required by the EMA before biosimilars are approved for use. A comprehensive characterisation study involving > 55 physiochemical and > 25 biological assays demonstrated that SB 4 has highly similar structural, physicochemical, and biological quality attributes to reference etanercept. A Phase I study demonstrated pharmacokinetic equivalence between SB 4 and reference etanercept in healthy male subjects. Furthermore, a Phase III, randomised, controlled trial performed in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with methotrexate (MTX) showed that SB 4 was equivalent to etanercept in terms of efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. In conclusion, the biosimilar development process performed according to EMA or FDA guidelines is highly rigorous and comprehensive. Biosimilars such as SB 4 are now available in clinical practice and are likely to improve access, reduce costs, and ultimately, improve health outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Biologic {{drugs such}} as {{infliximab}} and other anti–tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies have transformed the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (collectively known as inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]). However, the complex manufacturing processes involved in producing these drugs mean their use in clinical practice is expensive. Recent or impending expiration of patents for several biologics has led to development of biosimilar versions of these drugs, {{with the aim of}} providing substantial cost savings and increased accessibility to treatment. Biosimilars undergo an expedited regulatory process. This involves proving structural, functional, and biological <b>biosimilarity</b> to the reference product (RP). It is also expected that clinical equivalency/comparability will be demonstrated in a clinical trial in one (or more) sensitive population. Once these requirements are fulfilled, extrapolation of biosimilar approval to other indications for which the RP is approved is permitted without the need for further clinical trials, as long as this is scientifically justifiable. However, such justification requires that the mechanism(s) of action of the RP in question should be similar across indications and also comparable between the RP and the biosimilar in the clinically tested population(s). Likewise, the pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and safety of the RP should be similar across indications and comparable between the RP and biosimilar in the clinically tested population(s). To date, most anti–tumor necrosis factor biosimilars have been tested in trials recruiting patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Concerns have been raised regarding extrapolation of clinical data obtained in rheumatologic populations to IBD indications. In this review, we discuss the issues surrounding indication extrapolation, with a focus on extrapolation to IBD...|$|E
40|$|A biosimilar drug or {{follow-on}} {{biologic drug}} {{is defined by}} the Public Health Service Act as a product that is "highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically active components and there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biologic product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. " The advantage of biosimilar drugs is that they are significantly less expensive than the reference products, allowing for increased accessibility and cost savings. Recognizing these advantages, the US Congress passed the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act in 2009 as part of health care reform. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act allows sponsors of biosimilar agents to seek approval by showing structural and functional similarity to the reference agent, with the extent of required clinical studies to be determined {{on the basis of the}} degree of <b>biosimilarity</b> with the reference product. The goal is to bring biosimilar agents to the market more efficiently while still protecting the safety of the public. The European Union has had such a process in place for a number of years. Two biosimilar epoetin agents have been approved in the European Union since 2007, and their companies are conducting trials to seek approval in the United States, because Amgen's patent protection for epoetin alfa expires in 2014. Trials completed for European Union approval of both agents showed similar efficacy and safety to the reference epoetin alfa. As with all biologics, immunogenicity concerns may persist because of the fragility of the manufacturing process and the worldwide experience with pure red cell aplasia as a result of epoetin therapy. The uptake of biosimilar epoetins after approval in the United States will depend on the balance of cost advantage against safety concerns. Competition in the marketplace will likely decrease the cost of the reference agent as well...|$|E
40|$|ONS- 3010 {{is being}} {{developed}} by Oncobiologics Inc. (Cranbury, NJ, USA) as a biosimilar of Humira®. This randomized, double blind, single-center phase I study (EudraCT registration # 2013 - 003551 - 38) was performed to demonstrate pharmacokinetic <b>biosimilarity</b> between two reference products (Humira® EU and US) and ONS- 3010 in healthy volunteers, and to compare the safety and immunogenicity profiles. In addition, the intended pharmacological activity was assessed and compared by application of a whole blood challenge. Hundred-ninety-eight (198) healthy volunteers received a single 40 mg subcutaneous dose of ONS- 3010, Humira® EU or US. The pharmacodynamic effects were assessed by LPS/aluminium hydroxide whole blood challenges (n= 36; n= 12 per treatment arm; male:female, 1 : 1). Equivalence was demonstrated on the pharmacokinetic endpoints (AUC 0 -inf, Cmax and AUC 0 -last) based on bounds of 80 - 125 % for {{the ratio of the}} geometric means (ONS- 3010 /Humira®). The immunogenicity profiles were comparable between treatment groups and there were no indications for differences in routine safety parameters. Administration of adalimumab resulted in the observation of dramatically reduced TNFα levels upon stimulation with LPS/aluminium hydroxide (> 99 %), with no differences between the three treatment groups in terms of magnitude or duration Adalimumab also resulted in a reduction of LPS/aluminium hydroxide-induced IL- 8 release (maximally 30 %), suggested to have a causal relationship with the anti-TNFα treatment. LPS/aluminium hydroxide-induced release of IL- 1 β and IL- 6 was not inhibited by anti-TNFα treatment. Taken together, these data are promising for the further clinical development of ONS- 3010, demonstrate the relevance of the LPS/aluminium challenge to monitor Humira® effects, and emphasize the value of whole blood challenges for monitoring of proximal drug effects in healthy volunteers, and potentially in the target population...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Biosimilars {{are required to}} be similar or highly similar in structure to their biologic reference product but are neither expected nor required to contain identical active substances. For example, glycosylated biosimilars approved to date demonstrate quantitative and qualitative structural differences from their reference product and exemplify the latitude of variations permitted for biosimi-lars. Although differences between a candidate biosimilar and its reference product will be evaluated for differential clinical effects during <b>biosimilarity</b> assessment, it is unli-kely that potential differences between any two indirectly related biosimilars will be formally evaluated. Further-more, biosimilar pathways permit variations in pharma-ceutical attributes, clinical development approaches, and regulatory outcomes, resulting in further diversity of attributes among approved biosimilars. Because biosimi-lars may vary across the ranges of structural and functional acceptance criteria, {{they should not be}} treated like multi-source, generic drugs. Key Points Although biosimilars are highly similar to their reference products, they are not identical to them. Regulatory pathways permit slight differences in structural and other product quality attributes of biosimilars; such difference are unlikely to be formally evaluated among indirectly related biosimilars, resulting in a potential for a broader range of potential differences in quality attributes among approved biosimilars. Policies and practices related to the identification and use of biosimilars should take into account potential molecular differences among multiple biosimilars of the same reference product and should not treat them like generics. Specific recommendations to distinguish biologics from generic drugs in practice include ensuring that all biologics have distinguishable names and are prescribed by a distinguishable name, that a clinician is involved in decisions to switch among non-interchangeable biologics, and that patient medical records track biologics by their distinguishable names. ...|$|E
