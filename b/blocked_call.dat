40|$|It {{is known}} that {{efficient}} call handling mechanisms can greatly improve cellular network performance. However, modern cellular mobile network dimensioning is often based on rough estimates than on realistic analytical models for the applied protocols and expected traffic behavior. The application of more detailed traffic models shows, that actual load and probabilistic traffic properties considerably differ from those used for estimation. This can lead to inaccurate calculation of QoS parameters and network operator costs. In this paper we consider call handling schemes in cellular mobile networks based on complete sharing and guard channels for the case of <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> retries. We present a simple analytical method for approximate calculation of blocking probabilities for this case. As {{a part of the}} method we derive the average number of failed repeated attempts per one <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> which we consider to be an important parameter in cost calculation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} capacity allocation scheme at the call level for a <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> cleared loss system. The scheme aims {{to maintain the}} connection blocking probability around a specified target value by dynamically adjust-ing the allocated capacity. Based on a fluid flow model of the loss system, Lyapunov Stability theory is used to derive an adaptive capacity adjustment scheme which guarantees overall system stability around the target call blocking probability. Numerical results are given which show that the Lyapunov control based scheme is robust to load variations and performs better than existing schemes in the literature...|$|E
40|$|A {{frequency}} division/demand assigned {{multiple access}} (FD/DAMA) network architecture for the first-generation land mobile satellite services is presented. Rationales and technical approaches are described. In this architecture, each mobile subscriber must follow a channel access protocol {{to make a}} service request to the network management center before transmission for either open-end or closed-end services. Open-end service requests will be processed on a <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> cleared basis, while closed-end requests will be processed on a first-come-first-served basis. Two channel access protocols are investigated, namely, a recently proposed multiple channel collision resolution scheme which provides a significantly higher useful throughput, and the traditional slotted Aloha scheme. The number of channels allocated for either open-end or closed-end services can be adaptively changed according to aggregated traffic requests. Both theoretical and simulation results are presented. Theoretical results have been verified by simulation on the JPL network testbed...|$|E

Two types of call requests {{arrive to the}} base station of each cell: arrivals stream 1, that are those calls in progress that were originated in another cell and are subsequently handed over to our cell; and arrival stream 2, that are calls originated in our cell. Three new handoff prioritization schemes for channel assignment have been considered. In all of them, traffic stream 1 (handoff traffic) is treated with priority with respect to traffic stream 2 (fresh calls). New call requests are queued in case no channels {{are available at the}} arrival instant. Handover calls are treated according to a <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> model. We apply the generating function method combined with spectral expansion tools to the analysis of the models. As a result, numerically efficient and stable closed-from expressions for performance evaluation are obtained. ...|$|E

These challenges were main driving forces which moved author forward, in order to specifically find that, which are critical, major and minor, and furthermore propose adequate solutions based on analysed data, tested hypotheses, available advanced technical schemes, and conducted interviews with end users, operators, the MCIT and the ATRA. Among main findings belong, gender inequality, generational divide, and low level literacy in access to mobile service in Afghanistan. Obtained data further illustrates, the satisfaction degree of end users from the presence of network coverage, quality of service of mobile telephony and mobile internet. It furthermore indicates, the most annoying situations which end user experience during telephony conversation and mobile internet in the country. The Results show that, the majority of end users use mobile phone for telephony service, most of the complaints have raised from low signal intensity, low data rate, <b>blocked</b> <b>call,</b> dropped call, and low signal intensity in rural area (e. g. villages, countryside and borders). The dependency between specific categorical variables have been also tested, and based on the result of the chi square test, the level of dependency between them are determined. Advanced schemes of network coverage and quality of service proposed by various research scholars have been also reviewed in order to study and furthermore address the existing challenges technically. Based on the results, author recommends deployment of small cells, increasing number of drive tests, appropriate location for BTSs installation, deployment of recent self configured/self optimized schemes of handover and neighbouring cell list, increasing the value of the base station parameters, deployment of high order Sectorization, and increasing of numbers of TRXs of base station as adequate solutions for removing existing challenges in the areas of network coverage and quality of service of mobile telephony and mobile internet in Afghanistan...|$|E

From the analysis of test performance based on KPI parameters {{can be seen that}} the performance of the BTS Kota Baru and BTS Purnama still below ideal standards set by the company for parameter CSSR (> 97 %), respectively 95. 63 % and 95. 95 %. As for the parameters to meet the standard KPI (0 - 2 %) DCR respectively 0. 26 % and 0. 27 %. Quality calls for CSSR during test drive is also bad (still below the standard KPI) by 85 %. DCR is still below the standard of 5 %.

40|$|In this lesson, {{we learn}} about models used for {{circuit-switched}} networks. We start with an M/M/m/ m model, also called the m-server loss system [1]. We note here that [2], page 379 states that a system with a finite customer population will always be stable, no matter what value of ρ. This statement is made for any finite state space MC. Does this explain why in M/M/m/m model we often talk about ρ being 1, 10, 100 - see [3], pg. 235. Unlike in the M/M/m case, here ρ or offered load is defined to be λ ⁄ µ. In the M/M/m case, recall, we defined ρ to be λ ⁄ (mµ). In Section 1, we derive the Erlang-B formula for an infinite population. In Section 2, we derive the simple time congestion or blocking probability for a finite population model, called the Engset for-mula. In Section 3, we show the difference between call congestion or call loss probability and time congestion. For these two sections, refer to [6], page 518 - 521. Both [4] and [6] refer to [5] for the dif-ference between time congestion and call congestion. Section 4 describes the recursion formulation for numerically computing the Engset call loss probabilities from [4]. Section 5 derives the <b>Blocked</b> <b>Call</b> Queueing (BCQ) equations. Only the system in Section 1 is characterized using the queueing theory notation. In Sections 2 - 5, we are modeling {{a system in which}} the number of sources is limited. There is no place to indicate the number of sources from which jobs arrive in the Kendall notation. The last two numbers are for num-ber of servers, and number of jobs in the system. Thus the BCQ derivation for mean waiting delay is different from the mean delay derivations for M/M/ 1, M/M/m type queues that we learned in an ear-lier lesson. This lesson is entirely on the single-link case and is hence more about TDM/FDM sharing on a single link rather than circuit-switched networks...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{utilization}} of the spectrum has become a fundamental requirement in modern wireless networks, due mainly to spectrum scarcity and the ever-increasing demand for higher data rate applications and internet services. A particularly interesting proposal to meet this requirement is the cognitive radio (CR) system which can adapt its transmission parameters according to the environment. CRs, as will be shown in later chapters, are very efficient in maximizing spectrum utilization due to their inherent spectrum sensing capability. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate and analyze two main components of CR. First is the sensing or exploring component, which {{is the core of}} a CR device as it is the first stage to discover spectrum holes (SHs) in a spectrum band. For this component, a new algorithm to compute the detection probability in the case of odd degrees of freedom and a closed-form expression for the detection probability in Nakagami-m fading channels are presented, both for a local spectrum sensing scenario. For a cooperative scenario, the errors of CRs decisions which are caused by erroneous feedback channels are analyzed. In addition, the optimal number of CRs that are required to mitigate against such errors is derived. The second component is the access or exploiting component, i. e. how a CR device can exploit SHs efficiently. To study the second component, the interactions between the primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) are modeled as a continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). Based on the CTMC model, the effect of two inevitable sensing errors (misdetection and false alarm) on the <b>blocked</b> <b>call</b> probability, the dropped call probability and system utilization is investigated for two access schemes. In the first scheme, the PUs are considered to access the system using a standard access policy. In the second scheme, the PUs use non-standard access policies. In both schemes, the overall (primary and secondary) system utilization is analyzed and compared under both perfect and imperfect sensing. The simulation results obtained concur with the analytical ones and it is determined that spectrum utilization can be improved by choosing a suitable non-standard access policy...|$|E
