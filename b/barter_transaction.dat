[...] For example, by the fourth century, advocates had to be {{enrolled}} on the bar of a court to argue before it, they could only be attached to one court at a time, and there were restrictions (which came and went depending upon who was emperor) on how many advocates could be enrolled at a particular court. By the 380s, advocates were studying law in addition to rhetoric (thus reducing {{the need for a}} separate class of jurisconsults); in 460, Emperor Leo imposed a requirement that new advocates seeking admission had to produce testimonials from their teachers; and by the sixth century, a regular course of legal study lasting about four years was required for admission.

The Ordinary Least Squares, and Cointegration and Error Correction Models are employed as two alternative empirical techniques to analyse the data.

40|$|A <b>barter</b> <b>transaction</b> {{allows for}} two parties to {{exchange}} {{goods or services}} without using money. Direct barter {{is often referred to}} as the “double coincidence of wants ” and requires that each of the two parties involved in the transaction each have a good satisfying a specific need of the other party. This results in high transaction costs, primarily associated with the search to find the “double coincidence ” necessary for a direct <b>barter</b> <b>transaction.</b> There is an additional cost due to the uncertainty of the value of the goods traded. This cost is primary associated with the need for the receiving party to use the traded good or to trade it in another transaction. Indirect barter uses an intermediary good in the exchange, such as a trade token. The prevalence of barter is expected to be limited due to high transaction costs because the time and effort involved in the transactions would be costly. However, the use of barter appears to be increasingly on the rise. A major contributing factor to this growth is the use of existing and emerging electronic commerce technologies, such as search engines and transaction processing systems, that may be used over a global network of hundreds of millions of users. This paper gives an overview to barter, gives some examples of Internet-based barter net-works, and introduces likely characteristics of electronic based barter market mechanisms.

40|$|The virtual economy {{argument}} for Russia suggests that barter -a payment in goods rather than cash - allows {{the parties to}} pretend that the manufacturing sector is producing value added by enabling this sector to sell its output at a higher price than its market value. We confront this prediction with the actual pricing behaviour of industrial sectors in the Ukraine in 1997. Based on pricing data of 165 barter deals we find no systematic difference in the pricing behaviour in non-cash transactions across sectors. What appears to matter for the pricing behaviour is whether the firm is on the selling or buying end of the <b>barter</b> <b>transaction.</b> We offer a model that sees this pricing behaviour as a mechanism {{to deal with the}} absence of trust and liquidity in the economy.

40|$|In a <b>barter</b> <b>transaction</b> {{involving}} barter credits, {{an enterprise}} enters into a transaction to exchange a nonmonetary asset (for example, inventory) for barter credits. Those transactions may occur directly between principals to the transaction or include {{a third party}} whose business is to facilitate those types of exchanges (for example, a barter company). The barter credits {{can be used to}} purchase goods or services, such as advertising time, from either the barter company or members of its barter exchange network. The goods and services to be purchased may be specified in a barter contract or limited to items made available by members of the exchange network. Some arrangements may require the payment of cash in addition to the barter credits to purchase goods or services. Barter credits also may have a contractual expiration date, at which time they become worthless. The issue is whether Opinion 29 should be applied to an exchange of a nonmonetary asset for barter credits and, if so, the amount of profit or loss, if any, that should be recognized.

40|$|A general {{consensus}} in the transition economies literature links the existence of enterprise restructuring with {{the pace of the}} transition process and the potential for economic growth. The existing literature is less clear, however, about whether the lack of economic growth is caused by the lack of enterprise restructuring. Complicating the debate in Russia is the confusion regarding the role of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> in enterprise restructuring. Much of the confusion is generated by proponents of a "virtual economy" interpretation of how the Russian economy and Russian enterprise managers operate. This paper dispels much of the confusion about the existence of enterprise restructuring and the corresponding role of barter by demonstrating why the virtual economy model fails to accurately depict economic actions or outcomes in Russia. We develop the argument that barter is closely related to an absence of liquidity in the Russian economy, using both macro-level and micro-level data to document the consequences of "structural illiquidity. " Our results are unambiguous: both the incidence and volume of <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> are inversely related to liquidity. We conclude that analyses using <b>barter</b> <b>transactions</b> as evidence of the lack of enterprise restructuring in Russia stem from: (1) the lack of clear consensus about what constitutes enterprise restructuring in transition economies and how it varies with the stage of the transition process; (2) errant assumptions about managers' objective functions; (3) the relative mix of formal and informal restructuring mechanisms; (4) the lack of attention to industry variation and, within industry, to managerial characteristics; and (5) the Texan complex (if it ain't big, it ain't [...] .) which causes analysts to ignore changes in enterprise operations unless they occur on a grandiose scale.
