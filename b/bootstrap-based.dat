An important consequence of this assumption is that tests of difference in location (like a permutation t-test) require equal variance. In this respect, the permutation t-test shares the same weakness as the classical Student's t-test (the Behrens-Fisher problem). A third alternative in this situation {{is to use a}} <b>bootstrap-based</b> test. Good (2005) explains the difference between permutation tests and bootstrap tests the following way: [...] "Permutations test hypotheses concerning distributions; bootstraps test hypotheses concerning parameters.

The key innovation in {{this paper is to}} employ an alternative asymptotic framework to assess the properties of these inference procedures. This theoretical approach is conceptually distinct from the traditional approach (based on asymptotic linearity of the estimator and Edgeworth expansions), and leads to different theoretical prescriptions for bootstrapbased semiparametric inference. First, we show that the conventional <b>bootstrap-based</b> approximations to the distribution of the estimator and its classical studentized version are both invalid in general. This result shows a fundamental lack of “robustness” of the associated, classical <b>bootstrap-based</b> inference procedures with respect to the bandwidth choice. Second, we present a new <b>bootstrap-based</b> inference procedure for density-weighted average derivatives that is more “robust ” to perturbations of the bandwidth choice, and hence exhibits demonstrable superior theoretical statistical properties over the traditional <b>bootstrap-based</b> inference procedures.

Furthermore, it can be utilized to the case where more than two populations of functional data are considered. We illustrate the bootstrap procedure by considering the important problems of testing the equality of mean functions or the equality of covariance functions (resp. covariance operators) between two populations. Theoretical results that justify the validity of the suggested <b>bootstrap-based</b> procedure are established. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate very good size and power performances in finite sample situations, including the case of testing problems and/or sample sizes where asymptotic considerations do not lead to satisfactory approximations.

The poly-k test (Bailer and Portier 1988) is a survival-adjusted Cochran-Armitage test, which achieves robustness to effects of differential mortality across dose groups. The original poly-k test is asymptotically standard normal under the null hypothesis. However, the asymptotic normality is not valid if there is a deviation from the tumor onset distribution that is assumed in this test. Our age-adjusted <b>bootstrap-based</b> poly-k test assesses the significance of assumed asymptotic normal tests and investigates an empirical distribution of the original poly-k test statistic using an age-adjusted bootstrap method. A tumor of interest is an occult tumor for which the time to onset is not directly observable.
