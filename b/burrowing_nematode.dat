This genetic modification drastically reduces pesticide use. Herein, we used the SIMBA model (a model to simulate phenology, growth, and plant-parasitic nematode/banana interactions) to examine the population dynamics of plant-parasitic nematodes in cropping systems with hybrid FB 920 in various initial conditions. Results from field observations and simulations show that in the long-term, the spiral nematodes (Helicotylenchus multicinctus) can overtake the <b>burrowing</b> <b>nematodes</b> and that nematode populations are smaller than in Cavendish banana fields.

We performed phylogenetic analyses of small subunit rDNA sequences from 97 species including an analysis that account for the RNA secondary structure in the models of evolution. The present study confirms the sister relationship of the bacteriovore Cephalobidae with the predominantly plant-parasitic Tylenchomorpha. All analyses appoint the fungal-feeding Aphelenchidae and Aphelenchoididae as being polyphyletic but the morphology based hypothesis of their monophyly could not be significantly rejected. Within the Tylenchomorpha, the families that exclusively parasitize higher plants are joined in a single clade. However, only the monophyletic position of the (super) families Hoplolaimidae and Criconematoidea were supported; Anguinidae Tylenchidae, Belonolaimidae and Pratylenchidae appeared to be paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Parsimony and likelihood ancestral state reconstruction revealed that burrowing endoparasitism and sedentary endoparasitism each evolved respectively at least six and {{at least three times}} independently, mostly from migratory ectoparasitic ancestors.

40|$|Trichostrongylus tenuis is a {{nematode}} {{that lives}} in the caeca of wild red grouse. It causes disease in red grouse and can cause fluctuations in grouse pop ulations. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to study aspects of {{the ecology of the}} infective-stage larvae of T. tenuis, and also certain aspects of the pathology and immunology of red grouse and chickens infected with this nematode. The survival of the infective-stage larvae of T. tenuis was found to decrease as temperature increased, at temperatures between 0 - 30 C? and larvae were susceptible to freezing and desiccation. The lipid reserves of the infective-stage larvae declined as temperature increased and this decline was correlated to a decline in infectivity in the domestic chicken. The occurrence of infective-stage larvae on heather tips at caecal dropping sites was monitored on a moor; most larvae were found during the summer months but very few larvae were recovered in the winter. The number of larvae recovered from the heather showed a good correlation with the actual worm burdens recorded in young grouse when related to food intake. Examination of the heather leaflets by scanning electron microscopy showed that each leaflet consists of a leaf roll and the infective-stage larvae of T. tenuis migrate into the humid microenvironment' provided by these leaf rolls. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the adult <b>nematodes</b> <b>burrowed</b> into the mucosa as well as lying on its surface and that the caecal mucosa of heavily infected grouse became disrupted in areas of nematode activity. The caecal mucosa of lightly infected grouse exhibited little damage and the caecal mucosa of grouse treated with an anthelmintic and shot 5 - 6 months later was similar to that of lightly infected birds. Some of the nematodes from these treated birds were covered in rosette-shaped cells which have been tentatively identified as adherent lymphocytes. The cuticle of adult T. tenuis was superficially annulated but did not possess cuticular ridges, as described in some other trichostrongyle nematodes. Primary and challenge infections with T. tenuis were established in the domestic chicken and these reached patency but nematodes were expelled in blood-stained balls of mucus and all adult nematodes had been expelled from the birds 30 days after dosing with infective-stage. Following trickle doses of larvae,,there was a rise and then a fall in nematode egg output but larvae administered later in the trickle infection appeared to fail to establish. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed haemorrhagic lesions and blood spots on the caecal mucosa of infected chickens and nematodes were found to burrow beneath mucus secreted on the mucosal surface. There were significant increases in the proportions of circulating leucocytes in infected chickens, but only on certain days of infection. No antibodies to T. tenuis were detected in the blood of infected chickens. There was a decrease in the length of the caeca of infected chickens during the period when the Ill nematodes were being expelled from the caeca. Nematode egg output continued to rise during an infection in young red grouse and there was no expulsion of nematodes from these infected birds. Infective-stage larvae that had been attenuated by cobalt 60 irradiation stimulated some degree of resistance to challenge infection in the domestic chicken but not in the red grouse.

Cultures of Radopholus spp. were also obtained from Florida, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Ivory Coast. The aggressiveness (defined as reproductive fitness and root necrosis) of these populations was evaluated by inoculating banana plants (Musa AAA, cv. Grande Naine) with 200 nematodes/plant. Banana plants produced by tissue culture were grown in 0. 4 -liter styrofoam cups, containing a 1 : 1 mix of a coarse {{and a fine}} sand, at ca. 27 °C and 80 % RH. Banana plants were acclimated and allowed to grow for 4 weeks prior to inoculation.

The phylogenetic analysis based on sequence comparison of 18 S, D 2 D 3 regions of these populations with those of Radopholus sp., R. similis and other Tylenchomorpha from GenBank confirmed the close molecular relationship between the genus Radopholus and the Hoplolaimidae. The consensus tree based on the comparison of ITS 1 - 5. 8 -ITS 2 rDNA sequences of the Colombian populations with R. similis (many sources), R. arabocoffeae and R. duriophilus from GenBank grouped the Colombian populations in a clade which also included R. similis from different localities. Other R. similis populations grouped in separated clades, which were closely related to the clade containing R. arabocoffeae and R. duriophilus. The high genetic variability among the R. similis populations was observed and confirmed by the high ITS 1 - 5. 8 -ITS 2 sequence divergence within the R. similis populations studied (5. 4 %) which was comparable to the divergence (4. 2 - 6. 9 %) between the Radopholus species included in the analysis.

The AMF suppressed the R. similis population by almost 50 % and thus increased protection of the root against the nematode. This reduction was significant for both females and males within roots. There was no correlation between nematode population density and either AMF interval root colonization, external hyphal development or spore production. These results demonstrate that the dixenic system, although artificial, is a valuable tool for studying AMF-nematode interactions, complementing the classical experimental approaches. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Summary – In the Lake Victoria {{region of}} East Africa bananas are a starchy staple of major importance. Whilst {{concerns}} over banana cultivation {{in the region}} have been expressed for well over 50 years, over the last 30 years these have grown more serious, with data suggesting that banana yields have halved in some areas since the 1970 s. Historical and survey evidence demonstrate that the banana <b>burrowing</b> <b>nematode,</b> Radopholus similis, and the associated ‘black-head toppling disease ’ were absent from the region prior to the 1960 s. It is suggested that the introduction of R. similis to Uganda and its subsequent rapid spread in many of the banana growing areas of the Lake Victoria region is a major component of the severe production difficulties the crop is presently facing. Evidence for the continuing spread of R. similis in East and Central Africa and the implications of this are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} was to {{undertake}} a survey of researchers working with plant-parasitic nematodes {{in order to determine}} a ‘top 10 ’ list of these pathogens based on scientific and economic importance. Any such list will not be definitive as economic importance will vary depending on the region {{of the world in which}} a researcher is based. However, care was taken to include researchers from as many parts of the world as possible when carrying out the survey. The top 10 list emerging from the survey is composed of: (1) root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.); (2) cyst nematodes (Heterodera and Globodera spp.); (3) root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.); (4) the <b>burrowing</b> <b>nematode</b> Radopholus similis; (5) Ditylenchus dipsaci; (6) the pine wilt nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus; (7) the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis; (8) Xiphinema index (the only virus vector nematode to make the list); (9) Nacobbus aberrans; and (10) Aphelenchoides besseyi. The biology of each nematode (or nematode group) is reviewed briefly...|$|E
40|$|The <b>burrowing</b> <b>nematode</b> Radopholus similis {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{constraints}} to banana (Musa spp.) production worldwide. Resource-poor farmers can potentially manage R. similis by using naturally occurring banana endophytes, such as nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum, that are inoculated into tissue culture banana plantlets. At present, it is unclear at what stage in the R. similis infection process the endophytes are most effective. In this study, the effect of three endophytic F. oxysporum isolates (V 5 w 2, Eny 1. 31 i and Eny 7. 11 o) on R. similis host preference of either endophyte-treated or untreated banana plants was investigated. No differences were observed between the proportion of nematodes attracted to either root segments excised from endophyte-treated or untreated plants, or in experiments using endophyte-treated and untreated tissue culture banana plantlets. These results imply that the early processes of banana plant host recognition by R. similis are not affected by endophyte infection...|$|E
