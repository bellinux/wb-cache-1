5|$|The lungs {{also serve}} a {{protective}} role. Several <b>blood-borne</b> substances, {{such as a}} few types of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, serotonin and bradykinin, are excreted through the lungs. Drugs and other substances can be absorbed, modified or excreted in the lungs. The lungs filter out small blood clots from veins and prevent them from entering arteries and causing strokes.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. <b>Blood-borne</b> {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of the Galapagos Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species of worms, {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels of worms may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting <b>blood-borne</b> parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a <b>blood-borne</b> infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to <b>blood-borne</b> infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} {{frequent}} mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products. <b>Blood-borne</b> transmission can be through needle-sharing during intravenous drug use, needle stick injury, transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product, or medical injections with unsterilized equipment. The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0.63 and 2.4% per act, {{with an average}} of 0.8%. The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV-infected person is estimated as 0.3% (about 1 in 333) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0.09% (about 1 in 1000) per act. In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12% of all new cases of HIV in 2009, and in some areas more than 80% of people who inject drugs are HIV positive.|$|E
25|$|Ticks, fleas, and {{mosquitoes}} often carry multiple <b>blood-borne</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blood-borne</b> stimuli, {{including}} leptin, ghrelin, angiotensin, insulin, pituitary hormones, cytokines, plasma {{concentrations of}} glucose and osmolarity etc.|$|E
25|$|Central {{nervous system}} TB may be {{secondary}} to <b>blood-borne</b> spread: therefore some experts advocate the routine sampling of CSF {{in patients with}} miliary TB.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemoreceptor}} {{trigger zone}} {{is an area}} of the medulla in the brain that receives inputs from <b>blood-borne</b> drugs or hormones, and communicates with the vomiting center.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms usually appear 2 to 4 {{weeks after}} exposure. There are four general types of {{infection}} including localized, pulmonary, <b>blood-borne,</b> or disseminated throughout the body. The type {{and location of}} the infection usually determines which symptoms appear first as well as which symptoms are more prominent.|$|E
25|$|Red {{blood cells}} {{may be given}} {{as part of a}} blood transfusion. Blood may be donated from another person, or stored by the {{recipient}} at an earlier date. Donated blood usually requires screening to ensure that donors do not contain risk factors for the presence of <b>blood-borne</b> diseases, or will not suffer themselves by giving blood. Blood is usually collected and tested for common or serious <b>Blood-borne</b> diseases including Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV. The blood type (A, B, AB, or O) or the blood product is identified. This relates to the presence of antigens on the cell's surface. After this process, the blood is stored, and within a short duration is used. Blood can be given as a whole product or the red blood cells separated as packed red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Infection of the incisions or of {{the inside}} of the abdomen (peritonitis, abscess) may occur due to release of {{bacteria}} from the bowel during the operation. Nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, bladder or kidney infections, and sepsis (<b>blood-borne</b> infection) are also possible. Effective short-term use of antibiotics, diligent respiratory therapy, and encouragement of activity within a few hours after surgery can reduce the risks of infections.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{requires}} breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating {{depending on the}} area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have <b>blood-borne</b> pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) {{there have been no}} reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.|$|E
25|$|Biological hazards (biohazards) include {{infectious}} microorganisms such as {{viruses and}} toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax. Biohazards affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad population of workers. Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal bites and stings, urushiol from poisonous plants, and diseases transmitted through {{animals such as}} the West Nile virus and Lyme disease. Health care workers, including veterinary health workers, risk exposure to <b>blood-borne</b> pathogens and various infectious diseases, especially those that are emerging.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} bloodless {{surgical}} techniques {{have been developed}} for use on patients who refuse blood transfusions for reasons that include concern about AIDS, hepatitis, and other <b>blood-borne</b> infections, or immune system reactions. Thousands of physicians throughout the world have expressed a willingness to respect patients' preferences and provide bloodless treatment and about 200 hospitals offer bloodless medicine and surgery programs for adult and pediatric patients who wish to avoid or limit blood transfusions, or to avoid treatment contrary to Jehovah's Witnesses' blood doctrine. Bloodless surgery has been successfully performed in such invasive operations as open-heart surgery and total hip replacements.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} Advanced Wind Turbine Test Facility, West Texas A University {{utilizes}} the Killgore Research Center, which houses the Attebury Honors Program, Ronald E. McNair Scholars Program, and the WTAMU Academic and Research Environmental Health and Safety office, to conduct {{state of the}} art research on <b>blood-borne</b> pathogens, biosafety, and occupational health. WTAMU also teams up with several other institutions like the Alternative Energy Institute, Athletic Training Room and Education Laboratory, Computer Information Systems Software and Network Security Testing Lab, Cooperative Research, Education, and Extension Team (CREET), and Dryland Agricultural Institute to conduct research initiatives.|$|E
25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, he {{must not}} leave the scene until {{it is necessary to}} call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This {{can be as simple as}} a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against <b>blood-borne</b> pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} <b>blood-borne</b> infection which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include Listeria monocytogenes and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a <b>blood-borne</b> virus, with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E
25|$|Vectors may be {{mechanical}} or biological. A mechanical vector {{picks up}} an infectious agent {{on the outside}} of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a housefly, which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious <b>blood-borne</b> diseases, such as malaria, viral encephalitis, Chagas disease, Lyme disease and African sleeping sickness. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, arthropods, such as mosquitoes, ticks, fleas and lice. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.|$|E
25|$|The blood–brain barrier acts very {{effectively}} {{to protect the}} brain from most pathogens. Thus, <b>blood-borne</b> infections of the brain are very rare. Infections {{of the brain that}} do occur are often very serious and difficult to treat. Antibodies are too large to cross the blood–brain barrier, and only certain antibiotics are able to pass. In some cases, a drug has to be administered directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), where it can enter the brain by crossing the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. However, not all drugs that are delivered directly to the CSF can effectively penetrate the CSF barrier and enter the brain. The blood–brain barrier becomes more permeable during inflammation. This allows some antibiotics and phagocytes to move across the BBB. However, this also allows bacteria and viruses to infiltrate the BBB. Examples of pathogens that can traverse the BBB and the diseases they cause include toxoplasma gondii which causes toxoplasmosis, spirochetes like Borrelia which causes Lyme disease, Group B streptococci which causes meningitis in newborns, and Treponema pallidum which causes syphilis. Some of these harmful bacteria gain access by releasing cytotoxins like pneumolysin which have a direct toxic effect on brain microvascular endothelium and tight junctions.|$|E
500|$|Hepatitis is {{a disease}} of the liver that has been {{recognised}} since antiquity. [...] Symptoms include jaundice, a yellowing of the skin, eyes and body fluids. [...] There are numerous causes, including viruses– particularly hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. [...] Throughout history epidemics of jaundice have been reported, mainly affecting soldiers at war. This [...] "campaign jaundice" [...] was common in the Middle Ages. It occurred among Napoleon's armies and {{during most of the}} major conflicts of the 19th and 20th centuries, including the American Civil War, where over 40,000 cases and around 150 deaths were reported. The viruses that cause epidemic jaundice were not discovered until the middle of the 20th century. The names for epidemic jaundice, hepatitis A, and for <b>blood-borne</b> infectious jaundice, hepatitis B, were first used in 1947, following a publication in 1946 giving evidence that the two diseases were distinct. In the 1960s, the first virus [...] that could cause hepatitis was discovered. This was hepatitis B virus, which was named after the disease it causes. Hepatitis A virus was [...] discovered in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|As a biohazardous material, {{injuries}} from sharps waste can pose a large public health concern. [...] By penetrating the skin, {{it is possible}} for this waste to spread <b>blood-borne</b> pathogens. [...] The spread of these pathogens is directly responsible for the transmission of <b>blood-borne</b> diseases, such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and HIV. [...] Health care professionals expose themselves to the risk of transmission of these diseases when handling sharps waste. The large volume handled by health care professionals on a daily basis increases the chance that an injury may occur.|$|E
2500|$|With {{control over}} the game, the AFL began a rush of new rules, {{many of which were}} aimed at {{cleaning}} up the game, reducing [...] "thuggery" [...] and making it more attractive to spectators. A player tribunal system was introduced to more effectively deliver penalties. The blood rule was introduced (players must be removed from ground when bleeding, also when having blood on their body/playing uniforms) to protect players from the transmission of <b>blood-borne</b> disease. The sin bin rule was discarded in favour of player reports and the allocation of free kicks against the aggrieved side.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the early}} to mid-1990s a network of {{businessmen}} and government workers, known as [...] "bloodheads", set up hundreds of official and unofficial blood donation stations in Henan Province to supply the market for blood plasma created by hospitals and manufacturers of health products. [...] The common practice of reusing needles, not screening for diseases, sellers traveling from station to station with false records to maximize their income, and the mixing the blood prior to centrifuging and re-injecting the separated red blood cells back into the peasant blood-sellers guaranteed the rapid spread of <b>blood-borne</b> diseases such as HIV and Hepatitis B.|$|E
2500|$|Bloodborne is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by FromSoftware {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. Officially announced at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the game was released worldwide in March 2015. Bloodborne follows the player character, the Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian era inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal <b>blood-borne</b> disease. Upon mysteriously awakening in Yharnam during the night of [...] "The Hunt", the Hunter seeks out something known only as [...] "Paleblood" [...] for reasons unknown. The Hunter begins to unravel Yharnam's intriguing mysteries while hunting down its many terrifying beasts. Eventually, the Hunter's objective is to locate and terminate {{the source of the}} plague, and escape the nightmare.|$|E
