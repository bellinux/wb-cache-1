5|$|Obama entered Harvard Law School in {{the fall}} of 1988, living in nearby Somerville, Massachusetts. He was {{selected}} as an editor of the Harvard Law Review {{at the end of his}} first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe while at Harvard for two years. During his summers, he returned to Chicago, where he worked as an associate at the law firms of Sidley Austin in 1989 and Hopkins & Sutter in 1990. After graduating with a JD degree magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago. Obama's election as the first <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the Harvard Law Review gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. The manuscript was published in mid-1995 as Dreams from My Father.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{was born}} in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{two years after the}} {{territory}} was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Raised largely in Hawaii, Obama also spent one year of his childhood in Washington State and four years in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988 Obama enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he was the first <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of the Harvard Law Review. After graduation, he became a civil rights attorney and professor, and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. Obama represented the 13th District for three terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S. Senate. Obama received national attention in 2004, with his unexpected March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate. In 2008, Obama was nominated for president, a year after his campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over Republican John McCain, and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later, Obama was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.|$|E

Wilder did not endorse Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, and later said that he hoped for an Obama victory despite having gone to a Romney fundraiser.|$|E

25|$|The Richard Pryor Show premiered on NBC in 1977, but was {{cancelled}} {{after only}} four episodes probably because television audiences {{did not respond}} well to his show's controversial subject matter, and Pryor was unwilling to alter his material for network censors. During the short-lived series, he portrayed the first <b>black</b> <b>President</b> of the United States, spoofed the Star Wars cantina, took on gun violence, and in another skit, used costumes and visual distortion to appear nude.|$|E

25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial president. Although he may have been the first <b>black</b> <b>president</b> to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, Alan Keyes, and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither {{candidate}} was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E
500|$|Newsweek {{used one}} of Winston Smith's {{statements}} {{to argue that the}} rise in popularity of white nationalism and supremacy is due to the combination of the late-2000s recession and the election of a <b>black</b> <b>president.</b> Many such groups have been attempting to gain new recruits and increase their political influence by rebranding themselves as defenders of [...] "white heritage" [...] while de-emphasizing their dislike of minorities and Jews. Smith states, [...] "he emphasis is different now. We don't talk as much about what blacks have done to us; we're more focused on ourselves and our own culture." ...|$|E
500|$|On Day of Reconciliation, {{cultural}} groups participate in parades and various festivities take place throughout the country. On Day of Reconciliation 2013, {{a statue of}} Nelson Mandela, the first <b>black</b> <b>president</b> of South Africa, was unveiled in Pretoria. During the celebration in 2009, President Jacob Zuma honored forgotten heroes of South Africa, including inscribing around 100 dead veteran's names on the Wall of Names at Freedom Park. In 2008, the first victim of [...] "necklacing," [...] Maki Skosana, was given a tombstone and remembered. For the celebration in 2001, the African National Congress (ANC) remembered the police raid {{that led to the}} Rivonia trial. Some of the communities take part in a walk which also serve as a memorial to Mandela. Other parts of South Africa have chosen to emphasize their need for racial harmony in their communities.|$|E

500|$|Knight was {{selected}} as President of Pacific Union College in July 2009 and took office in September 2009. She was officially inaugurated on April 15, 2010 in a ceremony at the Pacific Union College Church. Her selection was historical, in that she is both the first <b>black</b> <b>president</b> and first female president in Pacific Union College history. Furthermore, {{she is the first}} (and currently only) black woman to lead a North American Adventist college. When Knight took over, Pacific Union College had experienced two consecutive years of decline in enrollment, however, in her first year as president enrollment increased by 11%. After taking over at Pacific Union College, Knight has been noted for her wide experience at both Christian and secular schools and her ability to build consensus between various constituent parties. In December 2010, Knight received an award from the local Chamber of Commerce recognizing her attentiveness to and willingness to work with the community. [...] Knight completed her presidency at PUC in January, 2017.|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It has a {{traditional}} soul style fashioned after the 1960s Motown Sound and Philadelphia soul. It is {{a departure from}} Saadiq's previous work with neo soul, which bears a hip hop influence. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer said that Saadiq expands further beyond {{his work as a}} producer for other recording artists, for whom he encouraged a [...] "classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas". BBC Music's Chris Jones interpreted Saadiq's use of 1960s soul as the album's source material to be a reflection of [...] "America's most recent great political and cultural shift ... the first true post-Obama expression of hope in record form." [...] Saadiq viewed his rootsy direction {{as a response to the}} state of popular music and found it analogous to modern politics: [...] "You force so many terrible things on people, they get tired of it. We have a <b>black</b> <b>president</b> now." ...|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that [...] "there is no {{question}} that [...] is a fan service." [...] He called it a [...] "mixed bag"; on one hand, he noted that some of the scenes were clever, such as Darryl's opinion on portraying a <b>black</b> <b>president</b> before Obama was elected. On the other hand, however, he felt that Michael's [...] "juvenile" [...] response to Holly was uncharacteristic, and the [...] "oddly high production values and camera work" [...] were unrealistic for the show. He also felt the inclusion of some characters—such as Roy, Jan, or Karen—did not make sense {{in the context of the}} series. He concluded, however, that while the episode had issues, [...] "the actual content of Threat Level Midnight was successful in more ways than I had expected". Rick Porter of Zap2it gave the episode a more mixed review, saying that it [...] "had moments that were a huge amount of fun, both inside Michael's labor of love and in people's reaction to it. But it also felt a little bit clip-showy." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Natural Order" [...] is one {{of several}} 30 Rock episodes to deal with race. In this episode, when Tracy leaves the first {{rehearsal}} accusing Liz of racism he shouts [...] "race card!" [...] and hands Liz a card with [...] "race card" [...] written on it ("playing the race card" [...] is an expression that means introducing the issue of race into an argument in order to gain the upper hand). During their disagreement Tracy also says that [...] "we have a <b>black</b> <b>president</b> now", referring to Barack Obama, but Liz says that he voted for Ralph Nader. According to J. Jeremy Wisnewski in [...] "Race At The Rock: Race Cards, White Myths, And Postracial America", this plotline is an example of people [...] "want to have race and do away with it too." [...] Tracy wants to be treated equally but also wants to continue behaving the way he is used to. Wisnewski says {{that by the end of}} the episode, Liz and Tracy, in reverting to [...] "the natural order", have come to understand the concept of equality; rather than forcing people [...] "to be equivalent to one another ... considering the different interests of people equally." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{had some}} {{controversial}} interactions with Jewish leaders {{in his early}} years in office. In 1996, his message of unity and cooperation with the Jews was met with skepticism. In 1997, Jackson was criticized for stating simple disagreement with anti-Semitic remarks made by Louis Farrakhan {{while he was in}} New York City for the mayoral race; Jewish leaders were unsatisfied by Jackson's response to Farrakhan. In 1997, Newsweek mentioned Jackson in their list of 100 people to watch in the new century, dubbed [...] "the Century Club", and raised the question of whether he would be the first <b>black</b> <b>president.</b> Jackson criticized the Bill Clinton administration for working with Republicans and voted in dissent on several notable bills that were the products of compromise between Democrats and Republicans. Jackson preferred direct aid and debt relief to trade reform as a method of helping impoverished nations such as those of sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean Basin, fearing that relaxed trade regulations would possibly benefit corporations and exploit labor. He is also an opponent of incentives for corporations to invest in developing nations. He was outspoken on issues of minority hiring in information technology. Jackson voted against the impeachment of Bill Clinton, voting against all four articles of impeachment considered by the House.|$|E

Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said [...] "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's quite clear that Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E
