5000|$|Creator {{codes are}} four-byte OSTypes. They allow {{applications}} to launch and open a file whenever {{any of their}} associated files is double-clicked. Creator codes could be any four-byte value, but were usually chosen so that their ASCII representation formed a word or acronym. For example, the creator code of the HyperCard application and its associated [...] "stacks" [...] <b>is</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> as WILD. Occasionally they represented inside jokes. For instance, the Marathon computer game had a creator code of 26.2 (the approximate length, in miles, of a marathon) and Marathon 2: Durandal had a creator code of 52.4.|$|R
40|$|A complex {{manifold}} X is said {{to satisfy}} the Oka-Grauert property if the inclusion [Multiple line equation(s) cannot <b>be</b> <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> text] <b>is</b> a weak equivalence for every Stein manifold S, where the spaces of holomorphic and continuous maps from S to X are given the compact-open topology. Gromov's Oka principle states that if X has a spray, then it has the Oka-Grauert property. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate the Oka-Grauert property using homotopical algebra. We embed the category of complex manifolds into the model category of simplicial sheaves on the site of Stein manifolds. Our main result is that the Oka-Grauert property is equivalent to X representing a finite homotopy sheaf on the Stein site. This expresses the Oka-Grauert property in purely holomorphic terms, without reference to continuous maps...|$|R
50|$|FIELDATA is the {{original}} character set used internally in UNIVAC computers of the 1100 series, represented by the sixth of the 36-bit word of that computer. The direct successor to the UNIVAC 1100 is the Unisys 2200 series computers, which use FIELDATA to this day (although ASCII is now also common with each character encoded in 1/4 of a word, or 9 bits). Because some of the FIELDATA characters <b>are</b> not <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII,</b> the Unisys 2200 uses '^', '"' and '_' characters for codes 004oct, 076oct and 077oct respectively.|$|R

50|$|In Rogue, players {{control a}} {{character}} as they explore several levels of a dungeon {{as they seek}} the Amulet of Yendor located in the dungeon's lowest level. The player-character must fend off an array of monsters that roam the dungeons. Along the way, they can collect treasures that can help them offensively or defensively, such as weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, and other magical items. Rogue is turn-based taking place on a square grid <b>represented</b> <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> or other fixed character sets, allowing players {{to have time to}} determine the best move to survive. Rogue implements permadeath as a design choice to make each action by the player meaningful: should the player-character lose all their health from combat or other means, the character is dead, and the player must restart a brand new character and cannot reload from a saved state. The dungeon levels, monster encounters, and treasures are procedurally generated on each playthrough, so that no game is the same as a previous one.|$|R
2500|$|As a {{very common}} character, the slash (as [...] "slant") was {{originally}} encoded <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> with the decimal code 47 (hexadecimal: 2F).

5000|$|First, an encoder {{must decide}} which {{characters}} to <b>represent</b> directly <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> form, which [...] {{has to be}} escaped as , and which to place in blocks of Unicode characters. A simple encoder may encode all characters it considers safe for direct encoding directly. However the cost of ending a Unicode sequence, outputing a single character directly <b>in</b> <b>ASCII</b> and then starting another Unicode sequence is 3 to 3⅔ bytes. This {{is more than the}} 2⅔ bytes needed to represent the character {{as a part of a}} Unicode sequence. Each Unicode sequence must be encoded using the following procedure, then surrounded by the appropriate delimiters.|$|R
