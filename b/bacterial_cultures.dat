40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the value of a urine <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> performed before prostate biopsy. Methods: We performed a prospective study on 353 patients who underwent prostate biopsy. All patients had a urine <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> performed before biopsy. We compared the outcomes of patients with bacteriuria (left untreated) to those of patients without bacteriuria. Results: Of the 353 men, 12 had a pre-biopsy positive <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> and underwent prostate biopsy without any infectious complication. Fifteen patients with a negative pre-biopsy culture developed a post-biopsy positive <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> but remained asymptomatic without any treatment. Only 4 men from the group without pre-biopsy bacteriuria developed an infectious complication, requiring 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy. The complication rates were similar for both groups. Conclusion: Our results suggest that routine urine <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> before prostate biopsy is not useful when antibiotic prophylaxis and enema are is performed. We do however suggest performing a urine <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> before prostate biopsy for patients with a previous history of urinary tract infections...|$|R
40|$|Rapid and {{accurate}} identification of mastitis pathogens {{is important for}} disease control. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> and isolate identification is considered the gold standard in mastitis diagnosis but is time consuming and results in many culture-negative samples. Identification of mastitis pathogens by PCR has been proposed as a fast and sensitive alternative to <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture.</b> The results of <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> and PCR for {{the identification of the}} aetiological agent of clinical mastitis were compared. The pathogen identified by traditional culture methods was also detected by PCR in 98 per cent of cases indicating good agreement between the positive results of <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> and PCR. A mastitis pathogen could not be recovered from approximately 30 per cent of samples by <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> however, an aetiological agent was identified by PCR in 79 per cent of these samples. Therefore, a mastitis pathogen was detected in significantly more milk samples by PCR than by <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> (92 per cent and 70 per cent, respectively) although the clinical relevance of PCR-positive culture-negative results remains controversial. A mixed infection of two or more mastitis pathogens was also detected more commonly by PCR. Culture-negative samples due to undetected Staphylococcus aureus infections were rare. The use of PCR technology may assist in rapid mastitis diagnosis, however, accurate interpretation of PCR results in the absence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> remains problematic. peer-reviewe...|$|R

25|$|Another {{method for}} {{producing}} cultured butter, {{developed in the}} early 1970s, is to produce butter from fresh cream and then incorporate <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> and lactic acid. Using this method, the cultured butter flavor grows as the butter is aged in cold storage. For manufacturers, this method is more efficient, since aging the cream used to make butter takes significantly more space than simply storing the finished butter product. A method to make an artificial simulation of cultured butter is to add lactic acid and flavor compounds directly to the fresh-cream butter; while this more efficient process is claimed to simulate the taste of cultured butter, the product produced is not cultured but is instead flavored.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess (ALA) in {{patients}} on anti-amoebic drugs is difficult. There is scanty data {{on this issue}} using Entamoeba histolytica (E. histolytica) lectin antigen and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We studied utility of lectin antigen, PCR, and IgG antibody in diagnosis of liver abscess {{in patients}} on anti-amoebic treatment. Liver aspirate of 200 patients, of which 170 had anti-amoebic drug prior to drainage, was tested for E. histolytica lectin antigen by (ELISA), PCR, <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> and serum IgG antibody by (ELISA). Classification of abscesses was based on result of anti-amoebic IgG antibody and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> E. histolytica PCR and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> and E. histolytica lectin antigen and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture.</b> Findings Using anti-amoebic IgG antibody and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> 136 / 200 (68. 0 %) were classified as ALA, 12 / 200 (6. 0 %) as pyogenic liver abscess (PLA), 29 / 200 (14. 5 %) as mixed infection, and 23 / 200 (11. 5 %) remained unclassified. Using amoebic PCR and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture</b> 151 / 200 (75. 5 %) were classified as ALA, 25 / 200 (12. 5 %) as PLA, 16 / 200 (8. 0 %) as mixed infection, and 8 / 200 (4. 0 %) remained unclassified. With E. histolytica lectin antigen and <b>bacterial</b> <b>culture,</b> 22 / 200 (11. 0 %) patients were classified as ALA, 39 / 200 (19. 5 %) as PLA, 2 / 200 (1. 0 %) as mixed infection, and 137 / 200 (68. 5 %) remained unclassified. Conclusions E. histolytica lectin antigen was not suitable for classification of ALA patients who had prior anti-amoebic treatment. However, PCR {{may be used as}} alternative test to anti-amoebic antibody in diagnosis of ALA. </p...|$|R
25|$|The {{source of}} {{luminescence}} is symbiotic bacteria that dwell {{in and around}} the esca. In some species, the bacteria recruited to the esca are incapable of luminescence independent of the anglerfish, suggesting they have developed a symbiotic relationship and the bacteria are unable to synthesize all of the chemicals necessary for luminescence on their own. They depend on the fish to make up the difference. Electron microscopy of these bacteria in some species reveals they are Gram-negative rods that lack capsules, spores, or flagella. They have double-layered cell walls and mesosomes. A pore connects the esca with the seawater, which enables the removal of dead bacteria and cellular waste, and allows the pH and tonicity of the culture medium to remain constant. This, as well as the constant temperature of the bathypelagic zone inhabited by these fish, is crucial for the long-term viability of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures.</b>|$|E

2500|$|When {{raw milk}} is left {{standing}} for a while, it turns [...] "sour". This {{is the result}} of fermentation, where lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose in the milk into lactic acid. Prolonged fermentation may render the milk unpleasant to consume. This fermentation process is exploited by the introduction of <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures</b> (e.g. Lactobacilli sp., Streptococcus sp., Leuconostoc sp., etc.) to produce a variety of fermented milk products. The reduced pH from lactic acid accumulation denatures proteins and causes the milk to undergo a variety of different transformations in appearance and texture, ranging from an aggregate to smooth consistency. Some of these products include sour cream, yogurt, cheese, buttermilk, viili, kefir, and kumis. See Dairy product for more information.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 1970s, our {{understanding}} of genetics and molecular biology was severely hampered by an inability to isolate and study individual genes from complex organisms. This changed dramatically {{with the advent of}} molecular cloning methods. Microbiologists, seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms through which bacteria restricted the growth of bacteriophage, isolated restriction endonucleases, enzymes that could cleave DNA molecules only when specific DNA sequences were encountered. They showed that restriction enzymes cleaved chromosome-length DNA molecules at specific locations, and that specific sections of the larger molecule could be purified by size fractionation. [...] Using a second enzyme, DNA ligase, fragments generated by restriction enzymes could be joined in new combinations, termed recombinant DNA. By recombining DNA segments of interest with vector DNA, such as bacteriophage or plasmids, which naturally replicate inside bacteria, large quantities of purified recombinant DNA molecules could be produced in <b>bacterial</b> <b>cultures.</b> The first recombinant DNA molecules were generated and studied in 1972.|$|E
