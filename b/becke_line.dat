This is an optical staining technique and requires no stains or dyes to produce a color effect. There are five different microscope configurations used in the broader technique of dispersion staining.

40|$|Digital {{holography}} {{has some}} desirable properties for refractometry of microscopic objects since it gives phase and amplitude information {{of an object}} in all depths of focus from one set of exposures. The refractive index of the object can be determined by observation of {{the movements of the}} <b>Becke</b> <b>lines</b> between diﬀerent focus depths. It is also shown that one single phase image provides an independent technique to determine sign of the relief between an object and the surrounding medium...|$|R

40|$|Valparaiso University {{recently}} {{approved a}} minor in forensic science. Development {{of a new}} laboratory-based course, CHEM 340 : Forensic Chemistry, is one requirement for the minor. Described here are three experiments developed for CHEM 340, along with modified versions {{that can be used}} for the existing course NS 101 : Introduction to Forensic Science. In one experiment, a solution containing gold chloride or mercurous chloride is combined with a suspected drug material. Many drugs, including cocaine and heroin, react with the reagents to form characteristic crystals that can be observed under a microscope. This micro-chemical technique can often quickly identify unknown drugs recovered from crime scenes. Caffeine serves as a surrogate drug to minimize safety and health concerns. In a second experiment, glass submitted from a crime scene as trace evidence is immersed in a series of oils with slightly different optical properties. Through the microscopic observation of <b>Becke</b> <b>lines</b> and the application of Snell’s Law, the refractive index of the glass can be determined and the type of glass can be identified or matched with other pieces of glass. In the final experiment, a series of acids are used to restore serial numbers that have been obliterated from metal parts of firearms...|$|R

5000|$|When an {{isotropic}} crystal is viewed, {{it appears}} dark {{because it does}} not change the polarization of the light. However, when it is immersed in a calibrated liquid with a lower index of refraction and the microscope is thrown out of focus, a bright line called a <b>Becke</b> <b>line</b> appears {{around the perimeter of the}} crystal. By observing the presence or absence of such lines in liquids with different indices, the index of the crystal can be estimated, usually to within [...]|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Becke</b> <b>line</b> test is a {{technique}} in optical mineralogy that helps determine the relative refractive index of two materials. It is done by lowering the stage (increasing the focal distance) of the petrographic microscope and observing which direction the light appears to [...] "move" [...] toward. This movement will always go into the material of higher refractive index. Typically, this is done by comparing 1) two (or more) minerals, 2) a mineral versus thin section epoxy (or other cement such as Canada Balsam which has a moderate refractive index of 1.54), and/or 3) a mineral versus an oil of known refractive index (as in oil immersion studies). They are also used for the addition of gold to gold or in gold to gold extractions.|$|E

40|$|Background. Asbestos and {{artificial}} mineral (ceramic, glass and rock) fibers {{are used as}} thermal insulating materials; both are agents harmful to human health. The current exposure limit values for respirable ceramic fibers are twice sharper than for glass- and rock fibers. Fibrous materials used {{for a long time}} at elevated temperatures wear out and require replacement. The aim {{of the study was to}} establish physical characteristics enabling identification of the types of thermally destroyed man-made mineral fibers. No such data are available in the literature. Materials. Bulk samples of thermal insulating fibrous material were investigated in this study. One sample was unknown. Methods. Microscopic determination of artificial mineral fibers was performed by assessment of a number of physical properties, such as crystallinity and refractive index. Crystallinity of fibrous materials was estimated using an X-ray diffractometer. Morphological and optical observations were achieved with a phase contrast and a polarized light microscope. The refractive index of fibers was assessed by observing relief and <b>Becke</b> <b>line.</b> It was evaluated by using immersion liquids controlled with an Abbe refractometer. Results. Compared to new man-made mineral fibers, those which had been used at high temperature for long time performance changed color and gloss, and their refractive indices were increased. So was their fragility. Conclusions. Optical properties alone may not be sufficient to distinguish between non-crystalline glass or ceramic man-made fibers. Identification requires significant operator training and experience...|$|E
