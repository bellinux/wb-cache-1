Edward Albert Stone was the architect, Griggs & Son Ltd of Westminster were the main building contractors, Major C.H. Bell acted as consultant engineer and local firm H. Lasenby Bros. were contracted to demolish and clear the site. The main concrete structure of the building was supplied by British Reinforced Concrete Engineering Co. Ltd of Stafford. The cast stone façade was produced by the Patent Impervious Stone and Construction Co Ltd of Leyton. Another London firm, Dawnay & Sons Ltd, provided the steelwork, but the brickwork was produced locally by the Sussex Brick Co. Ltd of Horsham. Tiling company Ramsdens of Westminster {{were responsible for the}} terrazzo floors and wall decoration, and the plasterwork was by H.E. Gaze Ltd of London. Two other London firms, the Carrier Engineering Co. Ltd and Berkeley Electrical Engineering Co. Ltd, respectively supplied ventilation and heating equipment and installed the electric systems and lighting. Furnishings were by W.W. Turner & Co. Ltd of Birmingham, and Henri & Laverdet Ltd (the firm of Marc-Henri Levy and Gaston Laverdet) were the interior designers. The John Compton Organ Co. of Acton installed the organ. Several other national and local firms supplied other products and services, from projectors to ticket machines.|$|E

The 1513 Storehouse was a rectangular building of brick construction c.50m x 10m and two stories high. It stood parallel to the river, on the river front, some 40 metres upstream of the (extant) Master Shipwright's House. (Both buildings are visible in Cleveley's painting of HMS St Albans, above.) The original Storehouse was added to, bit by bit over time, {{and in the early}} part of the 18th century it became the north range of a quadrangle of Storehouse buildings. This Storehouse complex, with cupola and clock atop the southern range, formed a prominent landmark for ships on this part of the river for over 200 years.|$|E
2500|$|The large parish {{has several}} hamlets, {{and in the}} late 19th and early 20th century there were two chapels of ease serving {{outlying}} areas. [...] Both were linked to St Giles' Church, and neither survive. [...] Freshfield Mission Church, located at [...] in the hamlet of Freshfield, opened for worship on 15 November 1897 after a dedication ceremony by the Archdeacon of Lewes. [...] It was built during that year {{through the efforts of}} Rev. C.R. Heald, who served St Giles' Church at the time. [...] A local man donated the land, but <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out the chapel cost £140 (£ as of [...] )). [...] A Sunday school was held in the building, and by 1939 it was still [...] "used for occasional services". [...] The 1965 Ordnance Survey map indicates that it was latterly called St John the Baptist's Chapel.|$|E

As {{navigation}} {{was at a}} stop, our ships neither {{coming in}} or going out as before, so the seamen were all out of employment, {{and many of them}} in the last and lowest degree of distress. And with the seamen were all the several tradesmen and workmen belonging to and depending upon the <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out of ships; such as ship-carpenters, calkers, ropemakers, dry coopers, sailmakers, anchor-smiths, and other smiths, blockmakers, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and the like. The masters of those, perhaps, might live upon their substance; but the traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all their workmen discharged. Add to these, that the river was in a manner without boats, and all or most part of the watermen, lighter-men, boat-builders, and lighter-builders, in like manner idle and laid by.|$|E
60|$|While {{all these}} {{movements}} {{were going on}} in the interior of the country, all the sea-ports and towns along the coast of Normandy presented a very busy scene of naval preparation. Naval architects were employed in great numbers in <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out vessels. Some were constructed and furnished for the transportation of men, others for conveying provisions and munitions of war; and lighters and boats were built for ascending the rivers, and for aiding in landing troops upon shelving shores. Smiths and armorers were occupied incessantly in manufacturing spears, and swords, and coats of mail; while vast numbers of laboring men and beasts of burden were employed in conveying arms and materials to and from the manufactories to the ships, and from one point of embarkation to another.|$|E
60|$|The other inlet of the sea, as I term it, is on {{the other}} side of the town, and is called Hamoaze, being the mouth of the River Tamar, a {{considerable}} river which parts the two counties of Devon and Cornwall. Here (the war with France making it necessary that the ships of war should have a retreat nearer hand than at Portsmouth) the late King William ordered a wet dock--with yards, dry docks, launches, and conveniences of all kinds for building and repairing of ships--to be built; and with these followed necessarily the building of store-houses and warehouses for the rigging, sails, naval and military stores, &c., of such ships as may be appointed to be laid up there, as now several are; with very handsome houses for the commissioners, clerks, and officers of all kinds usual in the king's yards, to dwell in. It is, in short, now become as complete an arsenal or yard for <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> men-of-war as any the Government are masters of, and perhaps much more convenient than some of them, though not so large.|$|E
50|$|The Penzance Mining and Science School {{opened on}} 7 October 1890, {{at a cost}} for <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> of nearly £1,900. The school {{consisted}} of two floors, the ground floor housed the technical instruction hall and the lecture theatre and upstairs chemical lecture rooms, class rooms and a laboratory filled with working benches for 24 students, a furnace room for metallurgical work and a balance room. Andrew Ketcham Barnett was the first principal of the Mining and Science School at Penzance, which had been established due to his classes on mineralogy in 1873. Philip Burne Corin (1860-1933) was a master here from 1893 to 1910.|$|R

60|$|But at {{this present}} time an {{occasion}} offers {{to speak in}} favour of this port; namely, the Greenland fishery, lately proposed to be carried on by the South Sea Company. On which account I may freely advance this, without any compliment {{to the town of}} Ipswich, no place in Britain is equally qualified like Ipswich; whether we respect the cheapness of <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> out their ships and shallops; also furnishing, victualling, and providing them with all kinds of stores; convenience for laying up the ships after the voyage, room for erecting their magazines, warehouses, rope walks, cooperages, etc., on the easiest terms; and especially for the noisome cookery, which attends the boiling their blubber, which may be on this river (as it ought to be) remote from any places of resort. Then their nearness to the market for the oil when it is made, and which, above all, ought to be the chief thing considered in that trade, the easiness of their putting out to sea when they begin their voyage, in which the same wind that carries them {{from the mouth of the}} haven, is fair to the very seas of Greenland.|$|E
6000|$|My {{requirement}} of [...] "elegance" [...] in that last letter contemplates chiefly architecture and fittings. These {{should not only}} be perfect in stateliness, durability, and comfort, but beautiful to the utmost point consistent with due subordination to the objects displayed. To enter {{a room in the}} Louvre is an education in itself; but two steps on the filthy floor and under the iron forks, half scaffold, half gallows, of the big Norwood glass bazaar, debase mind and eye at once below possibility of looking at anything with profit all the day afterwards. I have just heard that a French picture dealer is to have charge of the picture gallery there, and that the whole interior is to become virtually a large café, when--it is hoped--the glass monster may at last [...] "pay." [...] Concerning which beautiful consummation of Mr. Dickens's [...] "Fairyland" [...] (see my pamphlet[5] on the opening of the so-called [...] "palace"), be it here at once noted, that all idea of any [...] "payment," [...] in that sense, must be utterly and scornfully abjured on the foundation stone of every National or Civic Museum. There must be neither companies to fill their own pockets out of it, nor trustees who can cramp the management, or interfere with the officering, or shorten the supplies of it. Put one man of reputation and sense at its head; give him what staff he asks for, and a fixed annual sum for expenditure--specific accounts to be printed annually for all the world's seeing--and let him alone. The original expenditure for <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> must be magnificent, and the current expenditure for cleaning and refitting magnanimous; but a certain proportion of this current cost should be covered by small entrance fees, exacted, not for any miserly helping out of the floor-sweepers' salaries, but {{for the sake of the}} visitors themselves, that the rooms may not be incumbered by the idle, or disgraced by the disreputable. You must not make your Museum a refuge against either rain or ennui, nor let into perfectly well-furnished, and even, in the true sense, palatial, rooms, the utterly squalid and ill-bred portion of the people. There should, indeed, be refuges for the poor from rain and cold, and decent rooms accessible to indecent persons, if they like to go there; but neither of these charities should be part of the function of a Civic Museum.|$|E

5000|$|The monastery was {{dissolved}} in 1538 during the English Reformation. The <b>building</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> suffered heavy damage in this period. Tombs disappeared, sold for their marble and other valuable materials; monuments were defaced. In 1546 Henry VIII gave the priory and its church, {{along with the}} churches of St Nicholas Shambles and St Ewin, Newgate Market, to the City Corporation. A new parish of Christ Church was created, incorporating those of St Nicholas and St Ewin, {{and part of that}} of St Sepulchre,. [...] The priory buildings later housed Christ's Hospital school, founded by Edward VI, and the church became its pupils' principal place of worship.In 1640s Christ Church was the church of the Presbyterian polemicist Thomas Edwards, and during May 1647 became a centre of operations for attempts to disband and pay arrears to members of the New Model Army.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{some local}} {{residents}} regarded the changing scene of Hornsey with dismay, {{it is clear}} from the local press that the changes were welcomed by the majority. This attitude, no doubt, reflected the Victorian obsession with the magic of size. The excitement with the scale and speed of the area's development can be discerned form comments made by the Chairman of the Hornsey School Board In 1883 during a visit to assess developments in the light of the possible need to provide a new school:-Harringay House itself and three acres of ground around it was put up for auction on 29 October 1883. [...] The British Land Company had hoped to sell the house as a viable building. The advertisement announcing its auction described it as being suitable for occupation by a large family or a charitable institution. However, with all the development going on in the immediate area and the whole character of the district changing rapidly, there was no interest in the building itself. In April 1885 there an advertisement appeared in the local press announcing the auction of the first portion of the <b>building</b> materials <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> of the house; [...] obviously the house had been demolished. At intervals of approximately two months there were three further auctions selling off the remaining <b>building</b> materials <b>and</b> <b>fittings</b> of the house.

In return he was to receive a fee, the exclusive right to weave tapestries of all sorts for 21 years and they were to be free of customs duties. Since there was no effective pool of labour in England Flemish workers were brought in great secrecy mainly from Brussels and the Low Countries (Belgium) where tapestry weaving was a major industry. It was agreed that some of the masters would be naturalized on the word of Sir Francis. The craft was to be taught to suitable boys in the orphanages of the City of London. The City agreed to pay their maintenance during the seven-year apprenticeship and Sir Francis would supply the looms and the materials.|$|E
