The profiles of total phenolic compounds (TPC) and tannins contents in water and dilute alkali {{as a function of}} extraction temperature and time led to the selection of the best conditions concerning extraction yield and selectivity. The selectivity profile for TPC and tannins was established, and a maximum of 20 g per kg of bark was found, representing 2. 5 g per L of extract produced. On the basis of these results, the conditions selected to produce the extract for the application envisaged in this work were: water, 140 degrees C and 120 min. To increase the extract concentration, recirculation of the extracts over fresh bark (similar to a continuous bark extraction process) was performed and evaluated. The increment in phenolic compounds was about 4, attaining the final concentration of 8. 6 g/L for TPC and 6. 5 g/L for tannins. The final extracts showed leather retanning aptitude equivalent to a commercial extract of chestnut and revealed good performance in the production of leather articles like <b>box-calf</b> and nubuck...|$|E
