2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1944–45, the Japanese sent 9000 fire {{balloons}} toward the West Coast of North America. It was believed 1000 succeeded in reaching the United States; [...] 312 balloon bombs have been found. After three days, each balloon dropped an incendiary bomb. The balloon bombs employed a <b>ballast</b> <b>system</b> designed to maintain an average altitude of 30,000 feet. [...] Incendiary bombs would be dropped {{one at a time}} (four 11 pounders) and a single high-explosive bomb (33 pounds) would be dropped followed by a self-destruct device. [...] In order to conceal the efficacy of these attacks, the missions of the 555th PIB was kept clandestine in nature. [...] By January 1945, however, both Time and Newsweek reported the mission. [...] Despite the fear of the incendiary bombs, none of the 1945 season were attributed to the balloon incendiaries, nor were any fires started by the balloon bomb program at all. [...] Stationed at Pendleton Field, Oregon (formerly the base of the pilots and aircraft selected for the Doolittle raid on Japan), with a detachment in Chico, California, unit members participated in fire-fighting missions throughout the Pacific Northwest during the summer and fall of 1945. The 555th worked on twenty-eight fires during the 1945 season. [...] Of these, fifteen fires were [...] "jumped" [...] or parachuted to. [...] While some United States Forest Service reports refer to some employees as smokejumpers, the 555th were reported as paratroopers on all fire reports. [...] The only fatality in the unit died while jumping on 6 August 1945.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an architecture for model-based diagnosis {{that was developed}} during the BEHAVIOR joint project. The focus of BEHAVIOR was the application of model-based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to the domain of dynamic, technical systems. Within this context, Fraunhofer IITB and the University of Hamburg developed a tool box to integrate different modeling approaches {{to be used in}} model-based diagnosis. Toward this end, a diagnostic engine derived from the general framework Generic Diagnostic Engine (GenDE) was used. This engine was able to treat all model types uniformly. The basic approach for modeling the behavior of the system was to focus on the components, supplemented by an approach that focused on the processes. This allowed modeling of the domain using either components, processes, or combinations of both. In addition, models of spatial interactions were used to describe structural changes for diagnostic purposes. This repertory was supplemented by a language that described combinations of quantitative and qualitative descriptions. This approach, along with the use of event models, was used to describe the kinds of behavior that are difficult to explain using purely quantitative methods. The functionality and usefulness of the integrated approach was demonstrated using the domain of water <b>ballasting</b> <b>systems.</b> Water <b>ballasting</b> <b>systems</b> can be found on offshore-platforms or ships. The purpose of such systems is to keep the platform or ship balanced even when the sea is rough or when moving heavy loads. The water <b>ballasting</b> <b>system</b> of the ship under investigation consisted of more than 40 tanks. Example faults from this domain were used that required several modeling and analysis methods...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{ladder track}} {{produces}} lower {{pressures on the}} road bed: both the maximum pressure and the amplitude of pressure pulses are smaller than transverse sleepered track, which can reduce maintenance costs in <b>ballasted</b> <b>systems.</b> An additional benefit in ballasted ladder track is increased resistance to ballast wash out {{and other forms of}} ballast degradation due the addition longitudinal support and rigidity in ladder track.; the same structural rigidity also adds to buckling resistance.|$|R

30|$|This paper reviews <b>ballast</b> water {{treatment}} <b>systems</b> in three parts regarding data and methods: multi-criteria analysis, survey on real experience, {{reliability and availability}} study. According to the multi-criteria analysis results, the electrolysis + oxidant technology treatment system had a high success rate of 68.1  %. Many aspects were relevant and important. The electrolysis management system that uses oxidants was the most appropriate system from an ecological standpoint, while determining {{the quality of the}} treated ballast water was the most acceptable from an environmental point of view. The multi-criteria analysis parameters and scenarios did not consider the functional and operational problems of the systems. It can be clearly concluded from the survey result of 7.3  % from all participants and interviews that ship officers by-pass <b>ballast</b> {{water treatment}} <b>systems</b> due to lack of time for rectifying malfunctions, failures, maintenance or spare parts replacement in <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>systems.</b> The survey results indicate that <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>systems</b> can become faulty and shut down when operation sensors indicate improper function of the sub-systems. Even the system which utilises oxidant, which was successful in the multi criteria analysis, was shown to have many problems regarding controlling oxidants. This implies an unclear future for port environment protection management, where the ballast water is pumped into the harbour in order to load cargo. The research in this paper aids in understanding {{how important it is to}} learn more about <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>system</b> experiences from crewmembers, since the survey of operational experiences from ships has proven that more time would be needed for the maintenance of <b>ballast</b> water management <b>systems.</b> The total calculated reliability of the entire computing subsystem as part of a particular <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>system</b> on board ships which consists of the two units of which one is software redundant, was 0.916 or 91.6  %. This means that for 8.4  % of the operational time, any of the mentioned systems could be in failure or under repair. This is a significant risk for the operation of <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>systems.</b> The results of this research are a warning to relevant stakeholders in the maritime industry. If the system does not operate well, or not at all, the price of treatment is higher, as is air and water pollution, and the active substances used, e.g. oxidant residue, become unmanageable and out of control. Environmental hazards need to be managed. One possibility would be a mechanism to monitor <b>ballast</b> water <b>systems</b> operation continually on board ships. A check-up system should be close as possible to real time. Sensors should report malfunctions to the port authorities immediately after any questionable or doubtful performance of <b>ballast</b> water treatment <b>system</b> occur.|$|R
