40|$|The {{movement}} of an inviscid vortex pair in a compressible atmosphere including <b>bouyancy</b> effects {{is described by}} analytic solutions. The effects of compressibility are dealt with in an isentropic atmosphere. The work of compression done by the atmosphere onthe vortex is entirely consumed by the isentropic change of the thermodynamic state of the vortex pair. The acceleration of the accompanying and apparent mass is given by the displacement of the two vortices towards each other. The effects of <b>bouyancy</b> are investigated {{by means of a}} two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid vortex pair which is heavier than the ambient fluid. It turns out that the condition of pressure continuity across the separating streamline can be achieved only by assuming an increase in circulation of the two vortices. The mass accompanying the vortex pair under the effect of non-conservative forces converts a fraction of its gravity potential into an increase of stagnation pressure...|$|E

Two larval diets (Feed A and Feed B) were formulated {{and prepared to}} contain 45 % protein and 10 % lipid. Several larval diet preparation techniques were tried and diets produced were assessed in terms of feed particle size and <b>bouyancy,</b> water stability, and feed acceptability. The larval diet preparation that gave the best particle size and <b>bouyancy</b> as well as good water stability was the one prepared as microbound diet (using K-carrageenan as a binder) and flaked using a drum drier. A series of feeding experiments were then conducted to determine growth and survival of milkfish larvae reared on various feeding schemes involving {{the use of these}} artificial diets. The artificial diets were fed either alone or in combination with live foods. Larvae in control treatments were reared on live foods such as Brachionus and Artemia. Larvae were observed to ingest the diets indicating that the feeds had suitable physical characteristics and were attractive to the larvae. Over-all results of the feeding trials showed that the artificial diets could be fed to milkfish larvae in combination with the rotifer Brachionus starting Day 8 or could be fed alone to milkfish larvae starting Day 15 onward. These promising results would reduce dependence of milkfish larvae on live foods and would have significant economic benefits in the form of simplified milkfish hatchery procedures...|$|E

The required fields in this zone reach 5 MG for the AGB case and 0. 5 - 0. 05 MG for the RGB case.

40|$|Thermocapillary Convection (TC) {{is acting}} at free liquid {{surfaces}} with a temperature gradient, both at normal gravity (1 -g) as under microgravity (#mu#-g) and {{is especially important}} under #mu#-g because of lacking <b>bouyancy.</b> TC has often been observed already but not as quantitatively as in this work what regards streamlines, heat fluxes and temeprature distributions. It was our goal to characterize pure thermocapillarity (stationary and timedependent states) under #mu#-g in a volume of the size in which thermocapillarity and buoyancy are of the same order of magnitude and to compare it with corresponding 1 -g-measurements. The 20 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm large reactangular testvolume has been characterized optically with light-cut technique (stream-lines), holographic interferometry (temperature-field) and with thermal sensors. The D 2 spacelab-experiment was not very successful (only a few qualitative data) but the same experiment under 14 min #mu#-g-time on the sounding rocket MAXUS 1 b was a full success. Stream line-pictures showed that the TC penetrates into the whole volume of the liquid sample whereas it is pushed near the free surface due to buoyancy under 1 -g. We observed {{a bend in the}} velocity-profile under #mu#-g, indicating a thermocapillary driven free vortex. The oscillatory and the turbulent flow-state sets in for smaller #DELTA#T (Marangoni number) under #mu#-g compared to 1 -g. We observed further interesting results under 1 -g and for flat layers like multi-roll structure and intermittency. The results are important for crystal growth from the melt and for arc-welding and laser-cutting.

30|$|Observed dynamo {{properties}} that require boundary heterogeneity may alternatively {{be explained by}} lateral anomalies at the inner core boundary. Olson and Deguen (2012) showed that the dipole eccentricity in archeomagnetic field models can be reproduced by dynamo simulations with heterogeneous Y_ 1 ^ 1 inner boundary <b>bouyancy</b> flux pattern, corresponding to the east-west seismic anomalies at the upper inner core (Tanaka and Hamaguchi 1997). Aubert et al. (2013) showed that the localization of the westward drift of the geomagnetic field at the Atlantic hemisphere {{is controlled by the}} same heterogeneous inner boundary buoyancy flux. In these studies, the inner boundary heterogeneity amplitude was set to be significantly larger than that of the outer boundary, therefore the role of the CMB heterogeneity becomes secondary. It would be interesting to explore dynamo models with comparable amplitude heterogeneities on both boundaries to investigate competing effects.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} under certain conditions, {{multiple}} {{solutions for the}} flow rate exist in a natural ventilation system, induced by the non-linear interaction between <b>bouyancy</b> and wind forces. Under certain physical simplifications, the system is governed in steady state by a non-linear algebraic equation or a system of equations. Three examples are given here: a single-zone building with two openings, a channel with two end openings, and a two-zone building with two openings in each zone. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented. It is shown that in all three cases the flow rate exhibits hysteresis. These results have significant implications for multi-zone modelling of natural ventilation and smoke spread in buildings.
