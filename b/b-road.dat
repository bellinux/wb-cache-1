25|$|The {{crash site}} was a field west of Peeks Brook Lane, south of Fernhill Lane {{and east of}} Balcombe Road, a <b>B-road</b> which forms the eastern {{boundary}} of the airport. Antlands Lane is further to the south. A house called Longfield south of Fernhill Lane was destroyed by the impact.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991 and 2006 {{the route}} through and around Kingsbridge was redrawn twice, when the section {{northwest}} of Kingsbridge was downgraded to <b>B-road</b> status leaving {{a gap in}} the route, and subsequently diverted to the former route of the B3197 around {{the west side of the}} town leaving the original section through West Alvington as a spur of the new road.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{main roads}} cross at Guisborough, the A171 and the A173. The A171 leads west to Middlesbrough and east to Whitby whilst the A173 goes {{south-west}} to Stokesley and north-east {{as far as}} Skelton, where it joins the A174 coast road. Before the bypass was built, the A171 ran along Westgate, the town's main street, crossing the A173 at Chapel Beck Bridge. Just outside the bypass to the north-east, a <b>B-road</b> heads north from the A173 to Redcar. Another minor route out of the town, Wilton Lane, is a windy almost single-track road northwards {{to the village of}} Wilton and onto the ICI Wilton chemical works. In addition, there are two lanes that lead out of town into the hills. Hutton Lane ends at Hutton Village, a tiny settlement built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers. Belmangate is an ancient funeral route.|$|E
50|$|It lies in {{the civil}} parish of Leintwardine, {{on the other side}} of the River Clun 2.5 mi {{northwest}} of that village. Two equidistant routes between Leintwardine and Heath are possible: via the <b>B-roads</b> and Broadward Bridge, or via Jay Bridge (both bridges crossing the Clun).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the M6 motorway it was the main route from the Midlands to Ipswich and to the Haven ports. When the A1-M1 link road section of the current A14 opened in 1994 most of the A45 to the east of Cambridge was re-designated as the A14 and some sections to the west were downgraded to <b>B-roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Roads in Northern Ireland are {{classified}} as either Highways, motorways (shown by the letter M followed by a route number, e.g. M1), A-roads (shown by the letter A followed by a route number, e.g. A6), <b>B-roads</b> (shown by the letter B followed by a route number, e.g. B135) and other roads. There {{are two types of}} A-roads: primary and non-primary.|$|R
5000|$|Some fingerpost arm {{examples}} include the A- or <b>B-road</b> number {{as well as the}} destination, although many more of these examples were removed and replaced after the 1964 regulations were introduced. It appears that the original convention was for A-road numbers to be in white on a black background and the converse arrangement for <b>B-road</b> numbers, although there are few fingerposts with this as their current scheme.|$|E

50|$|On the {{completion}} of the M42 motorway in the early 1980s, the phase of the A423 between Tamworth and Coventry was downgraded to become a <b>B-road.</b>|$|E
50|$|Out of Townhill {{the route}} uses country lanes and some <b>B-roads,</b> {{climbing}} into the Cleish Hills and passing through Blairadam Forest, then back under the M90 {{on its way to}} Kinross. NCN 1 now uses the Loch Leven Heritage Trail around the loch, before making its way east {{around the base of the}} Lomond Hills. In Falkland it links with NCN 776, which travels north towards Newburgh.|$|R
25|$|West Ewell {{is a large}} {{residential}} area with several local centres. Its main centre is the area around Ewell West railway station, which contains a parade of shops. Its largest roads are Chessington Road and Ruxley Lane. These are both <b>B-roads</b> which contain several parades of shops. A section of the Hogsmill Open Space, including the Bonesgate Stream is in the northern fringes of the area. Ruxley Farm Bridge {{is located in the}} centre of Ruxley Lane over the Hogsmill River, {{on the site of the}} former Ruxley Splash. West Ewell is served by buses travelling between Epsom and Kingston, as well as Chessington.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} primary routes within the borough. One of these, the A12, {{is also a}} trunk road and runs from London and the M25, {{centrally}} in a north-easterly direction through the borough bypassing the city of Chelmsford onwards to Suffolk and Norfolk. Two other significant primary routes are the A130 which runs north-south across Essex and the A414, which begins as a primary route in Chelmsford but its terminus us Maldon in Essex. The A414 then runs west through Essex, meets the M11 and then its path continues into Hertfordshire via Harlow. Various other A- and <b>B-Roads</b> connect the borough, especially the city of Chelmsford {{to the rest of}} the county and beyond.|$|R
50|$|In August 2007, Coltrane {{presented}} a series for ITV called <b>B-Road</b> Britain, {{in which he}} travelled from London to Glasgow, stopping in towns and villages along the way.|$|E
50|$|Elberton is {{a village}} in South Gloucestershire, England, in the civil parish of Aust. It is just beyond Alveston and Olveston and is on a <b>B-road</b> that leads towards the Severn Bridge. It is mostly a farming community, with a small church St John's, and it {{contains}} a popular garage.|$|E
50|$|The {{crash site}} was a field west of Peeks Brook Lane, south of Fernhill Lane {{and east of}} Balcombe Road, a <b>B-road</b> which forms the eastern {{boundary}} of the airport. Antlands Lane is further to the south. A house called Longfield south of Fernhill Lane was destroyed by the impact.|$|E
50|$|Some highway {{authorities}} {{chose to}} apply {{the spirit of the}} Worboys regulations in a fingerpost style, including the use of the Transport Heavy typeface. Arm materials have tended either to be aluminium or plastic. Devon County Council introduced triangular-ended fingerposts with edges in four different colours to illustrate the suitability of the route for various types of vehicles, from black (for most vehicles, on A- and <b>B-roads),</b> through blue and brown to fully white fingers, indicating local access only. This system was entitled the Functional Road Network. Suffolk County Council, too, adopted the use of Transport Heavy typefaces on square-ended fingers, and here distances over three miles are still given to the nearest quarter.|$|R
5000|$|The A130 was a {{much longer}} route. It {{originally}} started on the old A10 just south of Cambridge at Trumpington, and ended on the A129 near Rayleigh. When the M11 Cambridge Western Bypass section {{was built in the}} early 1980s, the A10 through Cambridge was reclassified as A1309, whilst the A130 was truncated as far south as Great Dunmow on the A120, due east of London Stansted Airport. The section between Trumpington and Stump Cross (M11 junction 9A, the A11 spur) became A1301, whilst the section between there and Great Dunmow became an extension of the B184. The A11 was also reclassified to minor A-roads and <b>B-roads</b> at this time (qv.). In early 2008, the section between Great Dunmow and Little Waltham was declassified to become an extension of the B1008, itself a product of earlier re-routing.|$|R
50|$|At {{the road}} enters Surrey, it meets the B2230 again at a {{roundabout}} {{to the south}} of Belmont before entering the notorious 'Mad Mile' section (Brighton Road). The speed limit changes from 40 to 60 mph (96 km/h) and returns to 40 mph at the Banstead Crossroads junction with the A2022. In this area the road passes Banstead Downs, and its golf course. After passing the Banstead Crossroads, it acts as a boundary between Nork and Banstead as it heads towards Burgh Heath, passing the junctions with Garratts Lane (B2219) and Tattenham Way (B2221) before reaching the A240 (Reigate Road) at the centre of Burgh Heath. to It passes near the large suburban villages of Tadworth and Kingswood, passing several <b>B-roads,</b> including the B2032. It travells beside Banstead Heath (still as Brighton Road) before reaching the small settlement of Lower Kingswood. After passing a roundabout near Kingswood Manor, the road arrives at the Reigate Hill Interchange, which is also Junction 8 of the M25.|$|R
50|$|The {{data are}} {{supplied}} in Geography Markup Language file format. The network is a link-and-node based network containing details about each link such as: {{the class of}} road (A-road, <b>B-road,</b> etc.) nature of road (Single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout, etc.), road names and road routing information (RRI) (banned turns, one-way streets etc.).|$|E
50|$|There is {{a parish}} {{church in the}} hamlet. The civil parish is small and borders the even smaller parish of Deuxhill. The Borle Brook flows to the {{northeast}} of the hamlet, and Glazeley Bridge takes the <b>B-road</b> over this small river. The smaller Crunells Brook forms the southern boundary of the parish.|$|E
50|$|Aultgrishan {{is reached}} {{from the main}} B8021 {{single-track}} <b>B-road</b> that forks from the A832 in Gairloch and follows the north coast of the sea loch, Loch Gairloch, travelling west through Lonemore to Big Sand, before travelling north past North Erradale through Peterburn and Aultgrishan before terminating at Melvaig. The road then becomes narrower and continues about four miles to Rua Reidh Lighthouse.|$|E
2500|$|The Greater Manchester and Merseyside {{areas are}} home to almost 4 million people, and over half the region's population. The road {{networks}} intertwining these metropolitan areas are extremely important {{to the economy and}} are largely motorway, including the M62 which crosses the entire country (east to west â€“ Hull to Liverpool), this motorway directly connects the cities of Manchester and Liverpool. The M62 sees 78,000 vehicles using the motorway in the North West per day. The Merseyside-Manchester region has many motorways, that serve many millions on a daily basis, other include the M61 which connects Manchester to Preston, the M56 which runs south of Manchester to Cheshire and Wales, The M57 and M58 motorways run north of Liverpool, and connect towns such as St. Helens and Wigan. The M60 is Manchester's ring road, the M67 and M66 motorways run east and north respectively, both of these motorways are under [...] and link Manchester to smaller outlying settlements. On top of this there are countless numbers of A-roads, <b>B-roads</b> and minor roads which circle, entwine and serve these two major metropolises. For more information, see: Transport in Manchester.|$|R
50|$|Today, the <b>B-road</b> which {{connects the}} village of Stow Longa {{to the town of}} Kimbolton crosses over the remains of RAF Kimbolton's main runway. The {{crumbling}} concrete is visible just past the shoulder of the road. Additionally, a public footpath crosses the main area where the control tower once stood, the foundations of which are still recognizable among the farmland.|$|E
5000|$|In 1991 and 2006 {{the route}} through and around Kingsbridge was redrawn twice, when the section {{northwest}} of Kingsbridge was downgraded to <b>B-road</b> status leaving {{a gap in}} the route, and subsequently diverted to the former route of the B3197 around {{the west side of the}} town leaving the original section through West Alvington as a spur of the new road.|$|E
50|$|In Ceredigion Sarn Helen runs {{as part of}} a <b>B-road</b> in Bronant, and {{six miles}} south there is a long stretch through the hamlet of Stag's Head. It passes down to Llanio, where there was a small Roman fort named Bremia, and crosses over to Dolaucothi before {{reaching}} Llandovery. The route survives as a minor road here, although severely affected by potholes where it crosses the mountains.|$|E
50|$|Scammonden or Dean Head was {{a village}} close to Huddersfield, in the Dean Head Valley, England, before the valley was flooded to create Scammonden Reservoir in the 1960s. The M62 {{motorway}} crosses the dam wall and then {{passes through a}} cutting to the west over which Scammonden Bridge carries a <b>B-road.</b> The Chapel of St Barthelomew still exists, as does the old vicarage, now a boat club.|$|E
50|$|Then, in 1995, the Black Country Route was {{completed}} between Bilston and Junction 10 of the M6. The final {{section of this}} route (which began as the A463) was numbered the A454, which led to Wolverhampton Road West on the Willenhall-Walsall border being downgraded to a <b>B-road,</b> as {{had happened to the}} rest of the original A454 through Willenhall when The Keyway was opened some 20 years previously.|$|E
50|$|The Manifold Way {{was opened}} in July 1937 by Staffordshire County Council after the LMS {{handed over the}} {{trackbed}} to them. Tarmacked throughout, and with only a slight downhill gradient from north to south, the path is also ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. However, for about 1+1/2 mi, near Wetton Mill, the route is shared with motor traffic where the <b>B-road</b> has been diverted along its route. This section includes Swainsley tunnel.|$|E
50|$|The section between Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum {{is almost}} {{completely}} unimproved and {{in at least}} one location the road is not wide enough to allow two lorries to pass safely, with the remainder of this section being narrow with several dangerous blind corners, that could be described as resembling almost <b>B-Road</b> status. The road passes through the hamlet of Cann and the villages of Compton Abbas, Fontmell Magna, Sutton Waldron, Iwerne Minster and Stourpaine before reaching Blandford Forum.|$|E
50|$|It is {{concurrent}} for a {{short distance}} with the A361, then emerges as Bradley Road. There are three roundabouts as the road goes through North Bradley via the White Horse Business Park, to the south. Until the 1980s it passed through North Bradley's residential lane, but since {{the opening of the}} business park, the older road through North Bradley became declassified and no longer has A- or <b>B-road</b> status. The A363, then terminates at a roundabout with the A350, in Yarnbrook.|$|E
50|$|The {{village has}} always relied on road communications. Historically, the most {{important}} road ran south from Beckbury and turned sharply at Badger to run east to Pattingham. This has now been reshaped so that the priority lies with traffic turning south to Stableford, where the minor road joins a <b>B-road</b> connecting Telford with the Black Country. The First Series of the Ordnance Survey shows that until Victorian times a road also used to run across the Dingle directly to Ackleton, but this has dwindled into a footpath.|$|E
50|$|An {{association}} {{football club}} {{exists in the}} village, called Newcastle A.F.C. or Newcastle Football Club, whose home ground is the Mill Field, situated to the southwest of the village between the <b>B-road</b> and the Folly Brook. Despite being based in England they play in the Mid Wales South League (part of the Welsh football league system) and were the League Champions in the 2011-12 season. They are currently sponsored by the Crown Inn. Another Shropshire village, also in the southwest of Shropshire, have a team playing in the same league: Bucknell.|$|E
50|$|The B4413 also {{provides}} a connection to Botwnnog which houses the nearest high school ('Ysgol Botwnnog') amongst other amenities. The B4413 also links up to the A499 which provides the connection to the nearest town, Pwllheli where the nearest railway station is situated, {{along with many other}} larger stores such as an Iceland (supermarket), which help to provide the locals with more than their local store can provide. Botwnnog is approximately 11 minutes away, whilst Pwllheli is 20 minutes away when taking the route via the A497, as it is closer to 30 when taking the <b>B-road</b> through Botwnnog.|$|E
5000|$|The Manifold Valley {{footpath}} and cycle way (now {{called the}} Manifold Way) was opened in July 1937 after the LMS {{handed over the}} trackbed to Staffordshire County Council. It continues on to Waterhouses, via Hulme End, as a bridle path, and, being tarmacked throughout, is ideal for wheelchair users, prams, etc. For about 1+1/2 mi, near Wetton Mill, the route is shared with motor traffic where the <b>B-road</b> has been diverted, and this section includes Swainsley tunnel, built by Sir Thomas Wardle who, despite being a shareholder in the railway, {{did not want to}} see it crossing his land. Some spectacular scenery can be found along the 8 mi route, including Thor's Cave, Wetton Hill and Beeston Tor. Many consider that this section bears comparison with the better-known Dovedale a few miles to the east. (The National Trust own several of these sites, as part of their South Peak Estate.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Two {{main roads}} cross at Guisborough, the A171 and the A173. The A171 leads west to Middlesbrough and east to Whitby whilst the A173 goes {{south-west}} to Stokesley and north-east {{as far as}} Skelton, where it joins the A174 coast road. Before the bypass was built, the A171 ran along Westgate, the town's main street, crossing the A173 at Chapel Beck Bridge. Just outside the bypass to the north-east, a <b>B-road</b> heads north from the A173 to Redcar. Another minor route out of the town, Wilton Lane, is a windy almost single-track road northwards {{to the village of}} Wilton and onto the ICI Wilton chemical works. In addition, there are two lanes that lead out of town into the hills. Hutton Lane ends at Hutton Village, a tiny settlement built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers. Belmangate is an ancient funeral route.|$|E
