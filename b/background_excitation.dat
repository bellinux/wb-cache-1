40|$|To help {{clarify the}} use of {{measurements}} of ‘excitability’, a simple model motoneurone receiving noisy tonic <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> was tested with brief stimuli. Its response was determined from its PSTH (post-stimulus time histogram). The tonic background was varied from well below to well above the threshold for tonic firing. The conclusions should apply to many other neurones. The response of the model to a stimulus depended upon a number of factors, including stimulus strength, synaptic membrane noise and especially {{whether or not the}} background drive elicited tonic firing. With the onset of firing, the shape of the stimulus-response curve changed drastically and the model then responded to the smallest stimulus without a threshold. When the drive was subthreshold, increasing the <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> always increased the response to a given stimulus. However, what happened when the tonic drive exceeded the threshold for tonic firing depended upon the stimulus strength. With weak stimuli, the response increased with the drive to reach a plateau level where it was independent of the background firing rate; this occurred for stimuli comparable in size to the synaptic noise. With stronger stimuli, the response rose to a maximum for very low firing rates, but then decreased by up to 50 % to a plateau for high firing rates. Increasing the membrane noise reduced or abolished the maximum. The model was also used to simulate a monosynaptic conditioning-testing paradigm. The effect of a given conditioning stimulus was then found to change with the onset of firing, including when the strength of the testing stimulus was adjusted to make the size of the test response the same in the presence and absence of firing. The behaviour of real motoneurones can be expected to be at least as complex with the transition from silence to firing, so H reflex and other tests of ‘excitability’ must then be treated with caution. In particular, as has been observed experimentally, the response of a unit may decrease with increasing <b>background</b> <b>excitation,</b> as well as with inhibition. Transferring the findings to corticospinal neurones makes it unlikely that the magnitude of the descending volley elicited by a given cortical stimulus (‘excitability’) will always increase with the initial level of cortical activity. In addition, the appreciable threshold for transcranial magnetic stimulation during voluntary contraction suggests that it first excites axons rather than the neural pacemakers...|$|E

40|$|Persistent {{activity}} in neuronal populations {{has been shown}} to represent the spatial position of remembered stimuli. Networks that support bump attractors are often used to model such persistent activity. Such models usually exhibit translational symmetry. Thus activity bumps are neutrally stable, and perturbations in position do not decay away. We extend previous work on bump attractors by constructing model networks capable of encoding the certainty or salience of a stimulus stored in memory. Such networks support bumps that are not only neutrally stable to perturbations in position, but also perturbations in amplitude. Possible bump solutions then lie on a two-dimensional attractor, determined by a continuum of positions and amplitudes. Such an attractor requires precisely balancing the strength of recurrent synaptic connections. The amplitude of activity bumps represents certainty, and is determined by the initial input to the system. Moreover, bumps with larger amplitudes are more robust to noise, and over time provide a more faithful representation of the stored stimulus. In networks with separate excitatory and inhibitory populations, generating bumps with a continuum of possible amplitudes, requires tuning the strength of inhibition to precisely cancel <b>background</b> <b>excitation.</b> Comment: 23 pages, 9 figure...|$|E

30|$|We {{choose to}} vary these {{parameters}} for three reasons. Firstly, although these parameters {{are important for}} reliable functioning of the CPG and, in particular, for reliable swimming, {{it is difficult to}} measure their values in experiments. Simulations of the full physiological model show that the swimming regime is very robust: swimming exists even when these parameter values are varied in a wide range [34]. However, in a recent work [43] we investigated the effect of axon fasciculation in the spinal network, and we found that a proper balance between excitatory and inhibitory connection strengths is needed for generating a reliable CPG swimming activity. Secondly, experimental recordings [12] show that occasional synchrony appears more frequently soon after a stimulus that initiates swimming, at a time when excitatory drive is stronger than during later swimming [44]. Moreover, synchrony appears less frequently when glycinergic inhibition is artificially reduced by application of inhibitory blockers [12]. We hypothesise that these excitatory and inhibitory contributions are mainly driven from cINs and dINs. Thirdly, a previous experimental work [45] showed how strong <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> and phasic inhibition can influence the swimming period. We used the reduced model to explore how variations in excitatory and inhibitory strengths shape the period of the synchrony and swimming limit cycles. The strength of the conductance driven by dINs and cINs synaptic transmissions represents two major contributions of these two components. By computing the period of synchrony and swimming limit cycles under variation of the synaptic strengths, we explored changes in the swimming and synchrony periods.|$|E

Electrical stimuli to the ulnar nerve at wrist level produced an excitation in FCR motoneurones with characteristics typical of a propriospinally mediated effect: low threshold (0. 6 x motor threshold (MT)), a group I effect that was not reproduced by purely cutaneous stimuli, long central delay (4. 1 +/- 0. 4 ms in single units), suppression when the stimulus intensity was increased, and facilitation of the corticospinal excitation at the premotoneuronal level. Ulnar-induced propriospinally mediated excitation was compared during selective voluntary contractions of the FCR and, at equivalent level of FCR EMG, during tasks in which the FCR was activated automatically in postural contractions rather than voluntarily (grip, pinching and pointing). The excitation was significantly greater during grip (and pinching) than during voluntary FCR contractions and pointing, whether measured in single motor units or tonic EMG activity, or whether the response to motor cortex stimulation was assessed as the compound motor-evoked potential or the corticospinal peak in single units. The discrepancy between the tasks appeared with ulnar intensities above 0. 8 x MT and was then present across {{a wide range of}} stimulus intensities.

40|$|Presynaptic NMDA receptors {{facilitate}} {{the release of}} glutamate at excitatory cortical synapses and are involved in regulation of synaptic dynamics and plasticity. At synapses in the entorhinal cortex these receptors are tonically activated and provide a positive feedback modulation {{of the level of}} <b>background</b> <b>excitation.</b> NMDA receptor activation requires obligatory occupation of a co-agonist binding site, and in the present investigation we have examined whether this site on the presynaptic receptor is activated by endogenous glycine or d-serine. We used whole-cell patch clamp recordings of spontaneous AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents from rat entorhinal cortex neurones in vitro as a monitor of presynaptic glutamate release. Addition of exogenous glycine or d-serine had minimal effects on spontaneous release, suggesting that the co-agonist site was endogenously activated and likely to be saturated in our slices. This was supported by the observation that a co-agonist site antagonist reduced the frequency of spontaneous currents. Depletion of endogenous glycine by enzymatic breakdown with a bacterial glycine oxidase had little effect on glutamate release, whereas d-serine depletion with a yeast d-amino acid oxidase significantly reduced glutamate release, suggesting that d-serine is the endogenous agonist. Finally, the effects of d-serine depletion were mimicked by compromising astroglial cell function, and this was rescued by exogenous d-serine, indicating that astroglial cells are the provider of the d-serine that tonically activates the presynaptic NMDA receptor. We discuss the significance of these observations for the aetiology of epilepsy and possible targeting of the presynaptic NMDA receptor in anticonvulsant therapy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Recent {{experimental}} advances {{enabled the}} realization of mobile impurities immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms. Here we consider impurities with two or more internal hyperfine states, and study their radio-frequency (RF) absorption spectra, which correspond to transitions between two different hyperfine states. We calculate RF spectra for the case {{when one of the}} hyperfine states involved interacts with the BEC, while the other state is non-interacting, by performing a non-perturbative resummation of the probabilities of exciting different numbers of phonon modes. In the presence of interactions the impurity gets dressed by Bogoliubov excitations of the BEC, and forms a polaron. The RF signal contains a delta-function peak centered at the energy of the polaron measured relative to the bare impurity transition frequency with a weight equal to the amount of bare impurity character in the polaron state. The RF spectrum also has a broad incoherent part arising from the <b>background</b> <b>excitations</b> of the BEC, with a characteristic power-law tail that appears {{as a consequence of the}} universal physics of contact interactions. We discuss both the direct RF measurement, in which the impurity is initially in an interacting state, and the inverse RF measurement, in which the impurity is initially in a non-interacting state. In the latter case, in order to calculate the RF spectrum, we solve the problem of polaron formation: a mobile impurity dynamically gets dressed by Bogoliubov phonons. Our solution based on a time-dependent variational ansatz of coherent states of Bogoliubov phonons, becomes exact when the impurity is localized. Moreover we show that such an ansatz compares well with a semiclassical estimate of the propagation amplitude of a mobile impurity in the BEC. Our technique can be extended to cases when both initial and final impurity states interact with the BEC. Comment: 18 pages, including 7 figures and 2 Appendice...|$|R

Propofol {{is known to}} increase GABAA inhibition and decrease H-current strength, but how it generates these rhythms and their interactions is still unknown. To investigate both generation of the alpha rhythm and its PAC to SWO, we simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley network model of a hyperpolarized thalamus and corticothalamic inputs. We find, for the first time, that the model thalamic network is capable of independently generating the sustained alpha seen in propofol, which may then be relayed to cortex and expressed on the EEG. This dose-dependent sustained alpha critically relies on propofol GABAA potentiation to alter the intrinsic spindling mechanisms of the thalamus. Furthermore, the H-current conductance and <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> of these thalamic cells must be within specific ranges to exhibit any intrinsic oscillations, including sustained alpha.

Hyperpolarization level is the main determinant of whether the thalamus exhibits trough-max PAC, which is associated with lower propofol dose, or peak-max PAC, associated with higher dose. These findings suggest: the thalamus generates a novel rhythm under GABAA potentiation such as under propofol, its hyperpolarization may determine whether a patient experiences trough-max or peak-max PAC, and the thalamus is a critical component of propofol-induced cortical spectral phenomena. Changes to the thalamus may be a critical part of how propofol accomplishes its effects, including unconsciousness...|$|E
40|$|The {{neuronal}} {{basis of}} the excitation received by motoneurones during swimming in curarized Xenopus embryos has been investigated further. Extracellular stimulation of axons in the fibre tracts of the spinal cord {{has been used to}} evoke unitary excitatory post-synaptic potentials (p. s. p. s) in motoneurones. The p. s. p. s. had a rise time of 3 - 5 ms and a long falling phase lasting up to 200 ms. These potentials consist of two components: a 'fast' p. s. p. which is insensitive to 50 microM-(+/-) - 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovaleric acid (APV) but is blocked by 2 mM-cis- 2, 3 -piperidine dicarboxylic acid (PDA) and is therefore probably mediated by kainate/quisqualate receptors, and a 'slow' p. s. p. which is blocked by both APV and PDA and is therefore probably mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Paired intracellular recordings from motoneurones and interneurones have revealed a class of spinal cord interneurone which makes descending excitatory amino-acid-dependent synapses onto motoneurones and commissural interneurones. The p. s. p. s evoked by intracellular stimulation of these excitatory interneurones consist of 'fast' and 'slow' components identical in shape and pharmacological properties to those of the extracellularly evoked potentials. One neurone may, therefore, be able to release a transmitter which activates both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors on the same post-synaptic neurone generating fast and slow post-synaptic potentials.

Biophysical mechanisms {{that have been}} proposed to underlie this phenomenon include the balance of excitation and inhibition within local PFC networks along with certain intrinsic membrane mechanisms such as the afterdepolarization. Using a biophysical compartmental network model of PFC layer V pyramidal neurons that incorporates anatomical data, we investigated the role of synaptic input, intrinsic currents and local interconnectivity in the following features of Up and Down states: (a) the emergence of Up and Down states, (b) the duration of Up states, (c) the frequency of Up states and (d) the firing frequency during the Up state. We found that Up and Down states could emerge in our model microcircuit, provided the existence of background synaptic activity. Among the various conditions we examined, statistically significant results were obtained when: ‐ Increasing the firing frequency of the background synaptic input {{or the number of}} activated background synapses. ‐ Blocking the NMDA current, while compensating for the reduced excitability by enhancing the AMPA current (no emergence of Up and Down states). ‐ Increasing the iNMDA‐to‐iAMPA ratio. ‐ Activating the dADP mechanism at a physiological value (4 mV). Our results indicate that the generation of Up states in PFC is likely to involve not only a balance of excitation/inhibition provided within a microcircuit but also single‐neuron dynamics shaped by intrinsic mechanisms. Interestingly, the duration of the Up state was significantly altered in three of the conditions tested, namely, increased frequency of the <b>background</b> <b>excitation,</b> the enhancement of the NMDA current and the activation of the dADP mechanism.

40|$|Multiphoton {{microscopy}} (MPM) {{has become}} {{a powerful tool for}} imaging biological samples due to its ability to perform optical sectioning. MPM yields many advantages over standard one-photon imaging: a deeper penetration depth due to longer wavelength excitation, confinement of the focal volume, and reduced photodamage. These properties allow MPM to image samples non-invasively, acting as a form of optical biopsy for cancer research. Simultaneous spatial and temporal focusing (SSTF), when combined with nonlinear microscopy, can improve the axial excitation confinement of wide-field and line-scanning imaging. Because two-photon excited fluorescence depends inversely on the pulse width of the excitation beam, SSTF decreases the <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> of the sample outside of the focal volume by broadening the pulse width everywhere but at the geometric focus of the objective lens. Also, SSTF can scan the temporal focal plane axially by adjusting the group-delay dispersion (GDD) in the excitation beam path. We further discuss this technique for axial-scanning multiphoton fluorescence fiber probes without any moving parts at the distal end. The temporal focusing effect in SSTF essentially replaces the focusing of one spatial dimension in conventional wide-field and line-scanning imaging. Although the best axial confinement achieved by SSTF cannot surpass that of a regular point-scanning system, this trade-off between spatial and temporal focusing can provide significant advantages in applications such as high-speed imaging and remote axial scanning in an endoscopic fiber probe. We also present two new techniques for tunable dispersion compensation that are low cost, high speed, broadband, capable of high intensities, and have a large tuning range. By rotating a cylindrical lens at the Fourier plane of a folded 4 -f grating pair system, the group-delay dispersion can be tuned over a range greater than 105 fs 2, sufficient for compensating the dispersion of several meters of optical fiber. We also show that a single-element piezo bimorph mirror can generate GDD in a folded 4 -f grating pair setup. With a kilohertz sinusoidal drive voltage applied to the piezo bimorph, we demonstrate high-speed axial scanning in an SSTF setup at a rate of 2 kilohertz over a range of 100 microns...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{applications of}} fluorescence lifetime imaging in multiple chemical sensing approaches. Using fluorescence lifetime as an analytical parameter allows extracting more {{information out of}} probes than fluorescence intensity measurements and it is therefore attractive in order to quantitate multiple species. It leads to better data quality as fluorescence lifetime measurements are not or less affected by many sources of noise in fluorescence signals such as straylight and other scattering phenomena, background fluorescence, inhomogeneous fluorophore concentration in the sensing layer, excitation light intensity, or filter transmissions, and photobleaching. It is also superior for FRET measurements as no errors due to <b>background</b> <b>excitation</b> of the acceptor molecule are monitored when observing lifetime decrease of the donor molecule. 		Chapter 2 introduced a novel oxygen probe, the fullerene compound C 70, which displays the unusual phenomenon of thermally activated, delayed fluorescence (TADF) with a lifetime in the ms domain. Due to the long lifetime of this process, which involves repeated cycles of this molecule between the singlet and the triplet state, it is exceptionally sensitive to oxygen. We embedded C 70 into highly oxygen permeable polymeric matrices, a phenyl-substituted organosilica, and an ethyl cellulose and observed ppb (v/v) sensitivities of the delayed fluorescence lifetime in the temperature range of 0 to 120 °C. These properties make the fullerene layers superior {{both in terms of}} oxygen sensitivities and usable temperature range compared to fluorescent oxygen probes known to date. 		Those materials were then used in chapter 3 along with the Ruthenium-tris-phenanthroline complex in a dual sensing layer that is able to measure both temperature and trace oxygen amounts simultaneously. In order to avoid interference of oxygen to the Ru-complex it was embedded into a poly(acrylonitrile) matrix. The oxygen permeable matrix containing C 70 in organosilica or ethyl cellulose can be applied on top of the temperature sensitive layer containg the Ru-complex and both analytes can be monitored in the range of 0 - 50 ppm oxygen and 0 - 120 °C. The separation of the signals was achieved by spectral as well as luminescence lifetime discrimination, as the emission of the Ru-complex was monitored between 550 and 610 nm, and in the µs domain, and the fullerene was monitored between 650 and 710 nm and in the ms domain. 		In chapter 4, a method that allows for discrimination of two species purely based on luminescence lifetimes without spectral separation was introduced. It is based on a dual application of the Rapid Lifetime Determination (RLD) method, that records four time gates within the emission period whereby the last two are used for measuring the analyte sensed by the longer-lived probe and this information was used to decipher the second species from the first two windows that gives a mixed signal of both analytes. By appropriate choice of the experimental conditions both sensitivity and operating range could be adjusted as desired. The scheme was demonstrated in a dual oxygen and temperature sensor using a platinum porphyrin compound as the oxygen sensitive probe and a europium chelate as the temperature probe. 		In chapter 5 uses of luminescent nanoparticles in multiple sensing were pointed out. Novel poly(methacrylonitrile) -based copolymer nanobeads were presented with diameters down to less than 30 nm that can be used as biological labels as demonstrated on a homogeneous FRET-based protein assay using a platinum porphyrin inside biotinylated nanoparticles as donors and the red-emitting cyanine dye Cy 5 coupled to streptavidin as FRET acceptors. When stained with a palladium benzoporphyrin compound those nanoparticles can be used as red-excitable, long lifetime, high brightness probes. Poly(methacrylonitrile) -based nanospheres stained with a europium compound were found to be efficient temperature-sensitive components. Syntheses, staining, and determination of oxygen sensitivities of metalloporphyrins in polystyrene beads were shown. The spheres do also possess a carboxylic acid group that allows further manipulation. 		In chapter 6 fluorescence lifetime imaging with sub-ns resolution on protein microarrays was presented in a model assay. Alexa 555 -stained biotinylated BSA was immobilized on various surfaces and FRET to Alexa 647 -dyed streptavidin was observed in a competitive assay approach using the fluorescence lifetime decrease in the donor channel. Excitation was carried out using a ps Ar+-laser operating at 514. 5 nm at 80 kHz and the temporal characteristics of the emission were recorded using an intensified CCD camera. The maximum lifetime decrease on an epoxysilane-based surface was found to be almost 90 % meaning that the method has is able to monitor minute concentration changes...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} test for the {{circular}} Unruh effect using certain atoms - fluorine and oxygen. For these atoms the centripetal acceleration {{of the outer shell}} electrons implies an effective Unruh temperature in the range 1000 - 2000 K. This range of Unruh temperatures is large enough to shift the expected occupancy of the lowest energy level and nearby energy levels. In effect the Unruh temperature changes the expected pure ground state, with all the electrons in the lowest energy level, to a mixed state with some larger than expected occupancy of states near to the lowest energy level. Examining these atoms at low background temperatures and finding a larger than expected number of electrons in low lying excited levels, beyond what is expected due to the <b>background</b> thermal <b>excitation,</b> would provide experimental evidence for the Unruh effect.

The harvesting device we considered is composed of two small magnets, attached to piezoelastic oscillators, which are moving in the magnetic field produced by the static magnets fastened directly to the device. The moving magnets are coupled together by an electrical circuit. The nonlinearity {{of the system is}} achieved by the variable distance between the moving and static magnets, and additionally by the mass difference between them. The stochastic noise applied to the system obeys the Gaussian distribution. We examine the power output generated on the electric load at different excitation frequencies for different values of mistuning parameters and different stochastic amplitudes. We also present the mean value of the power generated averaged over a range of considered frequencies. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
