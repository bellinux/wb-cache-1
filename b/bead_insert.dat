40|$|Positron Emission Tomography is a coincidence-detection-based nuclear imaging {{modality}} that {{has increased in}} clinical prevalence {{over the last two}} decades. Measures have recently been taken to improve the practice, specifically the synergistic combination with CT, and implementation of iterative reconstruction. The time-of- flight (TOF) technique is another improvement theorized early in PET development, which reduces image noise by measuring the difference in coincident photon detection times. It was difficult to implement at the time of inception because of limited technologies, but better detectors and electronics have recently made TOF feasible for clinical use. Its gain in image quality has been measured by various methods, but is difficult to quantify because of tradeoffs inherent in count-based imaging. This work set out to investigate the image quality gained with TOF imaging by determining the effective non-TOF scan time required to achieve equivalent image quality as TOF. Methods: We used the TOF-capable GE Discovery 690 PET/CT scanner with ~ 600 ps timing resolution to acquire high-count list-mode data of hot spheres, cold bottles, and a novel low-contrast <b>bead</b> <b>insert</b> housed in three phantoms of increasing diameters. These data were reconstructed with and without TOF information into shorter images of 30 sec, 1, 2, 4 and 8 min, using the OS-EM reconstruction algorithm with 16 subsets and 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 iterations each. Up to 16 replicates of each image were produced. Regions of interest were drawn on the high-count images and subsequently applied to all images in each set. These data were averaged across the replicate image sets for statistical power and were used to calculate contrast, background variability and replicate variability for regions within each phantom scan. Background variability was measured as the standard deviation of 1 cm ROI means spread throughout the background, while replicate noise was measured as the pixel deviation across replicated images. The contrast for each unique phantom region and scan time were plotted versus the two noise measures, and a unique quantification method was devised to calculate the scan time equivalent for images reconstructed with TOF versus those without. Results: Visual evaluation showed universal improvement in image quality. Hot spheres were more easily resolved, cold regions were colder, and the low-contrast phantom became clearer overall. Gains were also higher as a function of phantom size. Plotting contrast versus the two variability measures demonstrated greater gains for larger phantoms than small. The quantification method delivered easily interpretable results that correlated with visual and graphical evaluation. Hot spheres showed between 1. 6 × and 2. 5 × scan time gain factor, while cold bottles showed between 3. 8 × and 4. 3 × gain, when measuring background variability as the noise component. Three areas of the low- contrast insert were considered, and showed results generally lying between those of the cold and hot inserts, with one exception demonstrating 9. 15 × and 10. 35 × gains for the background and replicate variability measures, respectively. Measuring gains using the replicate noise demonstrated similar quality gain as the background variability. Conclusions: The results of this work agree with previous studies stating that TOF information contributes significantly to PET image quality when utilized during reconstruction, specifically for hot lesions and cold regions. This was shown visually, graphically, and quantitatively. The unique quantification method devised, which uses image quality plots to generate gain factors in terms of equivalent non-TOF scan time, was successfully implemented and yielded relatively consistent results. The new phantom insert developed to mimic lower-contrast regions present in human abdominal images was successfully imaged, showing a 1. 3 × to 4. 2 × overall gain in equivalent scan time across all phantom sizes. Trends were observed in several aspects of these results that may subjugate TOF quality gain even further. Cold areas recover better than hot lesions, as expected, but low-contrast areas show varying levels of TOF improvement, and tend to lie between those demonstrated for hot and cold regions. Finally, similar results were found when considering background variability and replicate variability noise measures, which can be considered further validation of the image quality results.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{assessment}} and conventional imaging, which are currently {{used to monitor}} fracture healing, do not provide information on the mechanical properties of the healing construct. This limits their use in patient management decisions. Differentially loaded radiostereometric analysis (DLRSA) is a technique developed to assess the mechanical properties of healing fractures in vivo. DLRSA measures the relative micromotion of tantalum <b>beads</b> <b>inserted</b> into bone fracture fragments in response to load across the fracture site. To date, these loads have been applied axially, although in fractures fixed with devices which are highly resistant to axial loads, such as locked intramedullary nails, torsional testing may {{be more sensitive to}} healing. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a method to investigate DLRSA using torsional loading for clinical application. METHODS: A device was designed and built to apply torsional loads to the tibia. The test case was an oblique plain corrective osteotomy of a tibial diaphysis stabilized with an intramedullary nail and with tantalum <b>beads</b> <b>inserted</b> into the two adjacent bone segments. Post surgical examinations were made at 2 weeks, 2, 4, and 6 months as well as 1 and 2 years. Healing was monitored with the use of plain film radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and DLRSA. Axial loads of 30 kg and an external torsion of 5 Nm were applied during DLRSA examinations and the resultant displacement and stiffness were calculated. RESULTS: Torsional DLRSA demonstrated progressive changes in angular displacements and torsional stiffness consistent with the fracture healing observed by CT. By contrast, axial DLRSA was not informative and was more reflective of the stability of the fixation than healing bone. CONCLUSION: The addition of torsional assessments to DLRSA provides an important investigative option in assessing the biomechanical properties of bone healing in vivo. M. J. Chehade, I. A.

In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of endocannabinoids in regulating intestinal propulsion in the mouse colon in vivo. Methods: Intestinal motility was studied measuring the expulsion of a glass <b>bead</b> <b>inserted</b> into the distal colon; endocannabinold levels were measured by isotope-dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; anandamide amidohydrolase activity was measured by specific enzyme assays. CB 1. receptors were localized by immunohistochemistry. Results: Anandamide, WIN 55, 212 - 2, cannabinol (nonselective cannabinoid agonists), and ACEA (a selective CB 1 agonist) inhibited colonic propulsion; this effect was counteracted by SR 141716 A, a CB 1. receptor antagonist. Administered alone, SR 141716 A increased motility, whereas the inhibitor of anandamide cellular reuptake, VDM 11, decreased motility. High amounts of 2 -arachidonylglycerol and particularly anandamide were found in the colon, together with a high activity of anandamide amidohydrolase. CB 1. receptor immunoreactivity was colocalized to a subpopulation of choline acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons and fiber bundles in the myenteric plexus.

40|$|Abstract. The distal ends of ciliary microtubules are {{attached}} to the membrane by microtubule-capping structures. The capping structures are located at the sites of tubulin addition and loss in vivo and may be part of the regulatory system that directs ciliary and flagellar microtubule assembly. This study describes conditions for the release and stabilization of microtubule capping structures as a first step in their purification. Two types of capping structures, the distal filaments and the central microtubule caps, are selectively and independently released from the axoneme by CaCI 2 and MgCI 2 but not by MgSO 4, ZnC 12, NaC 1, KCI, or KI. The release of the caps and filaments is specific for Ca ÷ 2, Mg ÷ 2, and CI- and is not simply a function of ionic strength. The capping structures are released without major disruption of the axonemal structure.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: Stereotactic {{radiosurgery}} using frame-based positioning is {{a well-established}} technique {{for the treatment}} of benign and malignant lesions. By contrast, a new trend toward frameless systems using image-guided positioning techniques is gaining mainstream acceptance. This study was designed to measure the detection and positioning accuracy of the ExacTrac/Novalis Body (ET/NB) for rotations and to compare the accuracy of the frameless with the frame-based radiosurgery technique. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A program was developed in house to rotate reference computed tomography images. The angles measured by the system were compared with the known rotations. The accuracy of ET/NB was evaluated with a head phantom with seven lead <b>beads</b> <b>inserted,</b> mounted on a treatment couch equipped with a robotic tilt module, and was measured with a digital water level and portal films. Multiple hidden target tests (HTT) were performed to measure the overall accuracy of the different positioning techniques for radiosurgery (i. e., frameless and frame-based with relocatable mask or invasive ring, respectively). RESULTS: The ET/NB system can detect rotational setup errors with an average accuracy of 0. 09 ° (standard deviation [SD] 0. 06 °), 0. 02 ° (SD 0. 07 °), and 0. 06 ° (SD 0. 14 °) for longitudinal, lateral, and vertical rotations, respectively. The average positioning accuracy was 0. 06 ° (SD 0. 04 °), 0. 08 ° (SD 0. 06 °), and 0. 08 ° (SD 0. 07 °) for longitudinal, lateral and vertical rotations, respectively. The results of the HTT showed an overall three-dimensional accuracy of 0. 76 mm (SD 0. 46 mm) for the frameless technique, 0. 87 mm (SD 0. 44 mm) for the relocatable mask, and 1. 19 mm (SD 0. 45 mm) for the frame-based technique. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed high detection accuracy and a subdegree positioning accuracy. On the basis of phantom studies, the frameless technique showed comparable accuracy to the frame-based approach. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Linac-based {{stereotactic}} radiosurgery (SRS) {{was introduced}} in our department in 1992, and since then, more than 200 patients have been treated with this method. An in-house-developed algorithm for target localization and dose calculation has recently been replaced with a commercially available system. In this study, both systems have been compared, and positional accuracy, as well as dose calculation, have been verified experimentally. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The in-house-developed software for target localization and dose calculation is an extension to George Sherouse's GRATIS(R) software for radiotherapy treatment planning, and {{has been replaced by}} a commercial (BrainSCAN version 3. 1; BrainLAB, Germany) treatment planning system (TPS) for SRS. The positional accuracy for the entire SRS procedure (from image acquisition to treatment) has been investigated by treatment of simulated targets in the form of 0. 2 -cm lead <b>beads</b> <b>inserted</b> into an anthropomorphic phantom. Both dose calculation algorithms have been verified against manual calculations (based on basic beam data and CT data from phantom and patients), and measurements with the anthropomorphic phantom applying ionization chamber, thermoluminescent detectors, and radiographic film. This analysis has been performed on a variety of experimental situations, starting with static beams and simple one-arc treatments, to more complex and clinical relevant applications. Finally, 11 patients have been evaluated with both TPS in parallel for comparison and continuity of clinical experience. RESULTS: Phantom studies evaluating the entire SRS procedure have shown that a target, localized by CT, can be irradiated with a positional accuracy of 0. 08 cm in any direction with 95 % confidence. Neglecting the influence of dose perturbation when the beam passes through bone tissue or air cavities, the calculated dose values obtained from both TPSs agreed within 1 % (SD 1 %) for phantom and patient studies. The application of a one-dimensional path length correction for tissue heterogeneity influences the treatment prescription 4 % on average (SD 1 %), which is in compliance with theoretical predictions. The phantom measurements confirmed the predicted dose at isocenter within uncertainty for the different treatment schedules in this study. CONCLUSION: The full SRS procedure applied to an anthropomorphic phantom has been used as a comprehensive method to assess the uncertainties involved in dose delivery and target positioning. The results obtained with both TPSs are in agreement with AAPM Report 54, TG 42 and clinical continuity is assured. However, the use of a one-dimensional path length correction will result in an increase of 4 % in dose prescription, which is slightly more than that predicted in the literatur...|$|R

A promising class of new agents are the antimicrobial peptides. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the efficacy of the antimicrobial peptide Dhvar- 5 in a prophylactic, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis model. Methods: Dhvar- 5 (12 mg or 24 mg/rabbit) was incorporated into polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads as a local drug delivery system. For comparison, plain beads (control) and beads containing gentamicin as a sulphate (10 mg or 24 mg per rabbit) were also prepared. The <b>beads</b> were <b>inserted</b> into the inoculated femoral cavity of 36 rabbits, and 1 week later they were killed. The presence and severity of MRSA osteomyelitis was assessed by culture and histology.

Although a 24 mg Dhvar- 5 dose inhibited MRSA growth, it did not completely sterilize the femora. Sterilization occurred only in some of the gentamicin-treated specimens.

The question was whether our model showed comparable meniscal displacements to those found in earlier meniscal movement studies in vivo. Furthermore, we determined the influence of tibial torque on the meniscal displacement during knee-joint flexion. Three tantalum <b>beads</b> were <b>inserted</b> in the medial meniscus of six human-cadaver joints. The knee joints were placed and loaded in a loading apparatus, and the movements of the beads were determined by means of RSA during knee-joint flexion and extension with and without internal tibial (IT) and external tibial (ET) torque. During flexion without tibial torque, all menisci moved in posterior and lateral direction. The anterior horn showed significantly greater excursions than the posterior horn in both posterior and lateral direction. Internal tibial torque caused an anterior displacement of the pathway on the tibial plateau. External tibial torque caused a posterior displacement of the pathway. External tibial torque restricted the meniscal displacement during the first 30 degrees of knee-joint flexion. The displacements of the meniscus in this experiment were similar to the displacements described in the in vivo MRI studies. Furthermore, the application of tibial torque confirmed the relative immobility of the posterior horn of the meniscus. During external tibial torque, the posterior displacement of the pathway on the tibial plateau during the first 30 degrees of flexion might be restricted by the attached knee-joint capsule or the femoral condyle. This model revealed representative meniscal displacements during simple knee-joint flexion and also during the outer limits of passive knee-joint motion...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} an electro-osmotic micro pump is developed. The {{scientific}} novelty {{of this work}} is the fabrication of the electrodes, which are constructed inside micro fluidic channels by means of electro less silver deposition. The fabrication process of the electrodes is based on pumping Tollens solution through micro fluidic channels. While the solution reacts, silver is formed which adheres to the sidewall of the channel. The top fraction of the silver in the channel is then transformed further into silverchloride. This way silver/silverchloride electrodes were formed that can transfer current based on a redox reaction. The benefit of this production process is that electrodes can be fabricated in a closed micro fluidic chip, such as the SFM-micropipette as is developed in our group. The theory behind electro-osmotic and electrophoretic phenomena is explained {{in the first part}} of this work, followed by the principles and relations that are important for electro-osmotic pump design.

40|$|The precise {{positioning}} of the mitotic spindle to the cell center during mitosis is a fundamental process for chromosome segregation and the division plane definition. Despite its importance, the mechanism for spindle centering remains elusive. To study this mechanism, the dynamic of the microtubules was characterized at the bulk and at the cortex in the C. elegans embryo. Then, this dynamic was correlated to the centering forces of the spindle that were studied by applying calibrated magnetic forces via super-paramagnetic <b>beads</b> <b>inserted</b> into the cytoplasm of one- and two-cell C. elegans embryos. Finally, these results were confronted with the different centering models: cortical pushing model, cortical pulling model and the cytoplasmic pulling model. This thesis shows that: (i) The microtubules dynamic of the spindle aster is controlled spatially in the C. elegans embryo, with not rescues and catastrophes in the cytoplasm but in the centrosome and the cortex, respectively. (ii) The centering mechanism of the spindle behaved roughly as a damped spring with a spring constant of 18 12 pN/ m and a drag coefficient of 127 65 pN s/ m (mean SD). This viscoelastic behavior is evidence of a centering force that recovers and/or maintains {{the position of the}} spindle in the cell center. (iii) It seems to be two mechanisms that recover/maintain the spindle position. A fast one that may work for transient displacements of the spindle and a slow one that work over large and long perturbations. (iv) The centering forces scale with the cell size. The centering forces are higher in the two-cell embryo. This result argues against a centering mechanism mediated by cytoplasmic factors. It seems to be a limit for the relation of centering force to size, as the forces found in the four-cell embryo are comparable to the single-cell ones. (v) The centering forces scale with the amount of microtubules in the cell. This strengthens the belief that the microtubules are the force transmission entities of the centering mechanism. (vi) The boundary conditions are important to maintain the centering forces. A transient residency time of microtubules at the cortex, which is controlled by cortical catastrophe factors, is indispensable for a proper force transmission by the microtubules. (vii) The elimination of cortical catastrophe factors provides evidence for microtubules buckling, which is taken as a proof of polymerization forces. (viii) The cortical pulling forces mediated by the gpr- 1 / 2 pathway {{do not seem to be}} involved in centering and it is proposed they are present in the cell for off-center positioning purposes. (ix) The forces generated by vesicle transport are enough to displace the spindle and they are suggested to be auxiliary forces to centering. (x) The forces associated with the spindle change dramatically during cell division. From metaphase to anaphase the forces associated with the spindle scale up to five times. This behavior was consistent during the development of the embryo as the same pattern was observed in the one-, two- and four-cell embryo. (xi) The higher forces found during anaphase are not cortical pulling (via pgr- 1 / 2 pathway) depended, and it is proposed the spindle is `immobilised' by tethering or by an unknown cortical pulling pathway. To this date, this thesis presents the most complete in-vivo measurements of the centering forces in association with the microtubules dynamics. Taken together the results constrain molecular models of centering. This thesis concludes that most probably the predominant forces of the spindle centering mechanism during mitosis are generated by astral microtubules pushing against the cortex.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: We {{report what}} is to our {{knowledge}} the initial experience with a new 3 -dimensional ultrasound robotic system for prostate brachytherapy assistance, focal therapy and prostate biopsies. Its ability to track prostate motion intraoperatively allows it to manage motions and guide needles to predefined targets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A robotic system was created for transrectal ultrasound guided needle implantation combined with intraoperative prostate tracking. Experiments were done on 90 targets embedded {{in a total of}} 9 mobile, deformable, synthetic prostate phantoms. Experiments involved trying to <b>insert</b> glass <b>beads</b> {{as close as possible to}} targets in multimodal anthropomorphic imaging phantoms. Results were measured by segmenting the <b>inserted</b> <b>beads</b> in computerized tomography volumes of the phantoms. RESULTS: The robot reached the chosen targets in phantoms with a median accuracy of 2. 73 mm and a median prostate motion of 5. 46 mm. Accuracy was better at the apex than at the base (2. 28 vs 3. 83 mm, p < 0. 001), and similar for horizontal and angled needle inclinations (2. 7 vs 2. 82 mm, p = 0. 18). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this robot for prostate focal therapy, brachytherapy and targeted prostate biopsies is the first system to use intraoperative prostate motion tracking to guide needles into the prostate. Preliminary experiments show its ability to reach targets despite prostate motion...|$|R
40|$|Perchlorate anion {{interferes with}} the uptake of iodide by the human thyroid gland and {{consequently}} disrupts the regulation of metabolism. Chronic exposure {{to high levels of}} perchlorate may lead to the formation of thyroid gland tumors. Although the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not set a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for perchlorate, a draft drinking water range of 4 - 18 ppb based on 2 liter daily consumption of water has been established. The current EPA approved method for detecting perchlorate uses ion chromatography which has a detection limit of ~ 1 ppb and involves lengthy analytical time in the laboratory. A unique combination of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect and the bifunctional anion exchange resin’s high selectivity may provide an alternative way to detect perchlorate at such low concentrations and with high specificity. SERS, which uses laser excitation of adsorbed perchlorate anions on silver nanoparticles, has been shown to detect perchlorate anions at concentrations as low as 50 ppb. Normal micro-Raman analysis of perchlorate sorbed onto the resin beads has detected an even lower concentration of 10 ppb. In an effort to integrate these two effects, silver nanoparticles were coated with N-trimethoxysilylpropyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride, a functional group similar to that found on the resin <b>bead,</b> and subsequently <b>inserted</b> into different perchlorate concentration environments. This method has resulted in perchlorate detection down to ~ 10 ppb and a more consistent detection of perchlorate anion at ~ 50 ppb than that of earlier methods. As suggested by the direct insertion of functionalized silver colloids into perchlorate samples, this technique may potentially allow {{for the development of a}} probe using on-site Raman spectrometry to detect significantly low concentrations of perchlorate in situ rather than in the laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) {{have shown}} {{promising}} potential to stop intervertebral disc degeneration in several animal models. In order {{to restore a}} healthy state, though, this potential should be further stimulated. Notochordal cells (NCs), influential in disc development, {{have been shown to}} stimulate BMSC differentiation, but it is unclear how this effect will translate in an environment where resident disc cells (nucleus pulposus cells [NPCs]) could also influence BMSCs. The goal of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the effects of NCs on BMSCs when cocultured with NPCs, in a simplified 3 D in vitro system. Bovine BMSCs and NPCs were mixed (Mix) and seeded into alginate <b>beads.</b> Using culture <b>inserts,</b> the Mix was then cocultured with porcine NCs (alginate beads) and compared to coculture with empty beads or porcine skin fibroblasts (SFs, alginate beads). NPCs alone were also cocultured with NCs, and BMSCs alone cultured under chondrogenic conditions. The effects of coculture conditions on cell viability, matrix production (proteoglycan and collagen), and gene expression of disc markers (aggrecan, type II collagen, and SOX 9) were assessed after 4 weeks of culture. The NC phenotype and gene expression profile were also analyzed. Coculture with NCs did not significantly influence cell viability, proteoglycan production, or disc marker gene expression of the Mix. When compared to NPCs, the Mix produced the same amount of proteoglycan and displayed a higher expression of disc marker, indicating a stimulation of the BMSCs (and/or NPCs) in the Mix. Additionally, during the 4 weeks of culture, the NC phenotype changed drastically (morphology, gene expression profile). These results show that NCs might not be as stimulatory for BMSCs in an NPC-rich environment, as believed from individual cultures. This absence of effects could be explained by a mild stimulation provided by (de) differentiating NCs and the costimulation of BMSCs and NPCs by each other...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveHelically {{oriented}} {{left ventricular}} fibers assemble into transmural sheets, which {{are important for}} wall-thickening mechanics: 15 % fiber shortening results in 40 % cross-fiber left ventricular wall thickening and a 60 % ejection fraction through sheet extension, thickening, and shear. Normal cardiac microstructure and strains are optimized; deviations could result in apoptosis and deleterious matrix remodeling, which degenerates into global cardiomyopathy. We studied alterations in transmural strains adjacent to ischemic myocardium during acute midcircumflex occlusion. MethodsNine sheep had radiopaque markers implanted to measure left ventricular systolic fractional area shortening; 3 transmural <b>bead</b> columns were <b>inserted</b> into the midlateral wall for strain analysis. Three-dimensional marker coordinates were obtained with biplane videofluoroscopy before and during 70 seconds of ischemia. Systolic strains were quantified along circumferential, longitudinal, and radial axes (n = 9) and were transformed into fiber-sheet coordinates by using quantitative microstructural measurements (n = 5). ResultsA functional border was defined in the midlateral left ventricle; ischemia decreased posterolateral fractional area shortening, and anterolateral fractional area shortening increased. In this demarcation junction, subepicardial end-systolic radial wall thickening decreased (0. 16 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 11 ± 0. 06) and sheet-normal shear was abolished (0. 08 ± 0. 04 vs − 0. 01 ± 0. 03). Longitudinal shortening decreased in the subepicardium and midwall (− 0. 05 ± 0. 04 vs ± − 0. 01 ± 0. 06), but circumferential-radial shear increased at these depths (0. 04 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 11 ± 0. 05). Subendocardial fiber stretch occurred during early systole (− 0. 01 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 02 ± 0. 03), and end-systolic fiber-sheet shear increased (0. 07 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 11 ± 0. 04, all P <. 05). ConclusionsIncreased circumferential-radial shear and altered fiber-sheet strains reflect mechanical interactions between ischemic and nonischemic myocardium, which might be important in triggering remodeling processes that evolve into global ischemic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the pelvic nerve pathway in stress-induced acceleration of colorectal transit and defecation in rats. METHODS: Surgical transection of rectal nerves (rectal branches of the pelvic nerve), vagotomy (Vag) or adrenalectomy (Adx) were performed bilaterally in rats. Number of fecal pellet output of these rats was measured during 1 -h water avoidance stress (WAS). To evaluate the colonic transit, rats were given phenol red through the catheter indwelled in the proximal colon and subjected to WAS. After WAS session, entire colon and rectum were isolated and distribution of phenol red was measured. Distal colonic and rectal transit was evaluated using glass <b>bead.</b> Rats were <b>inserted</b> the glass <b>bead</b> into the distal colon and evacuation rate of the bead was measured. Neural activation was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of c-Fos and PGP 9. 5 in colonic whole-mount preparations of longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus (LMMP). RESULTS: In the sham-operated rats (sham op), WAS significantly increased defecation and accelerated colorectal transit with marked elevation of plasma corticosterone level. Compared with sham-operated rats, increase in the excretion of fecal pellets during WAS was significantly reduced by rectal nerve transection (RNT) (sham op: 6. 9 1; 0. 8 vs RNT: 4. 3 1; 0. 6, P < 0. 05) or Vag (sham op: 6. 4 1; 0. 8 vs Vag: 3. 7 1; 1. 1, P < 0. 05), although corticosterone level remained elevated. Adx-rats significantly increased the defecation despite the lower corticosterone level. Distribution pattern of phenol red showed RNT inhibited distal colonic and rectal transit accelerated by WAS, while Vag inhibited proximal colonic transit. Suppression of distal colonic and rectal transit by RNT was further confirmed by the bead evacuation rate (sham op: 80. 0 % vs RNT: 53. 8 %). WAS significantly increased the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive neural cells in the LMMP of the proximal and distal colon, whereas c-Fos expression was decreased by RNT in the distal colon (sham op: 9. 0 1; 2. 0 vs RNT: 4. 4 1; 1. 0, P < 0. 05) and decreased by Vag in the proximal colon. CONCLUSION: Pelvic nerve conveys WAS stimuli from the brain to the distal colon, and directly activate the myenteric neurons, followed by the increase of its motility...|$|R
40|$|Este estudo objetivou caracterizar plantas e frutos de araticum (Annona crassiflora), avaliar a frequência de consumo, predação e dispersão de suas sementes por animais e seus efeitos na germinação, em área de Cerrado, entre fevereiro de 2007 a junho de 2008. Baseado em armadilhas de pegadas, registrou-se a frequência de visitação (FV) e o consumo de frutos por animais, além da ação de insetos em frutos caídos no solo, sob as plantas. Estrumes de antas, Tapirus terrestris, foram amostrados para verificar a frequência de ocorrência (FO) e os danos causados por elas e por insetos. Para analisar a dispersão por antas, foram inseridas miçangas coloridas em frutos maduros caídos sob plantas-mãe. Posteriormente, foi medida a distância entre o local das fezes com miçanga até a planta-mãe da cor específica da miçanga. Realizou-se teste de germinação com sementes de amostras fecais e de frutos intactos. Dentre os animais que se alimentaram dos frutos, antas contribuíram com maior frequência de visitação e consumo de frutos de araticum, o qual representou 54 % de frequência de ocorrência nas amostras fecais e as sementes não foram significativamente danificadas. Besouros (Scarabaeidae) se alimentaram da polpa de frutos e enterraram sementes de araticum próximo da planta-mãe. Insetos curculionídeos e euritomídeos predaram as sementes de araticum nos frutos. Os danos causados nas sementes por esses insetos foram significativamente maiores que aqueles provocados pelas antas. Foram encontradas duas fezes com miçangas distantes 1, 7 km e 1, 8 km das plantas-mãe, respectivamente. A germinação das sementes foi baixa neste período de estudo, no entanto, as antas podem proteger as sementes de insetos predadores, defecando-as intactas para longas distâncias. Assim, T. terrestris é um possível dispersor, enquanto que curculionídeos e euritomídeos são possíveis predadores de sementes de araticum. Essas relações provavelmente contribuem para o controle da população de araticum no Cerrado brasileiro. This study {{aimed to}} {{characterize}} araticum (Annona crassiflora) plants and fruits, {{and evaluate the}} frequency of consumption, predation and dispersal of the seeds by animals {{and its effect on}} germination, in Cerrado vegetation area, between February 2007 and June 2008. Using track traps installed on araticum plants, the frequency of visitation (FV) and the fruit consumption by the animals was assessed, as well as, the action of insects in fallen fruits under the trees was registered. Sample of tapirs excrement Tapirus terrestris were analyzed to verify the occurrence frequency (FO) and the damage caused on the seeds by tapirs and insects. To analyze the dispersal by tapirs, colored <b>beads</b> were <b>inserted</b> in fallen mature fruits under the parent trees. Then, the distance between the location of the excrements with beads to the parent tree in the specific color of the bead was measured. Germination test was performed with excrement samples and unbroken fruit seeds. Among the animals that fed on fruits, tapirs contributed with the largest frequency of visitation and consumption of araticum fruits, representing 54 % of the frequency occurrence in excrement samples, and the seeds were not damaged significantly. Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) fed the pulp of the fruit and buried araticum seeds next to the parent tree. Curculionid and eurytomid insects predated the araticum seeds on the fruits. The damage caused by these insects in the seeds was significantly higher than those caused by tapirs. Two excrements with beads were found at 1, 7 and 1, 8 km distant from the parent trees, respectively. The seeds had low germinability in this period of study, however the tapirs can protect the seeds of predator insects, defecating the intact seeds for long distances. Thus, T. terrestris is a possible disperser of seeds, whereas curculionids and eurytomids can be considered predators of araticum seeds. These relations probably contribute with the control of araticum population in the Brazilian Cerrado...|$|R
40|$|Three {{treatments}} {{were tested}} on blacklip pearl oysters, Pinctada margaritifera, during the bead insertion process {{as part of}} research to improve the efficiency of round pearl culture. The oysters (100 to 150 mm shell height) were maintained on a commercial farm at Manihiki atoll, Cook Islands. The three treatments were: (1) immersion of the oysters in 2 ml/l propylene phenoxetol for 15 min to relax them before operating; (2) disinfection of the operation site with an antiseptic (1 : 50 aqueous dilution of 10 % povidone iodine solution); and (3) closure of the surgical incision with a flexible cyanoacrylate adhesive. The three treatments were applied or not applied to oysters in a 3 -factor arrangement to give eight treatment combinations. The treatment combinations were applied to two groups of oysters: Group I, consisting of 96 oysters (12 sets× 8 treatment combinations), and Group II, consisting of 768 oysters (12 sets× 8 treatment combinations× 8 oysters per set). After 6 weeks, all oysters were inspected for mortality and bead rejection, and Group I oysters were sacrificed. Group I oysters were necropsied and checked {{for the presence of}} pearl sacs. After 18 months, the pearls from Group II oysters were harvested and graded for quality; scoring for lustre, surface perfection, main colour, tint, shape, diameter, length and weight. <b>Inserted</b> <b>beads</b> ranged from 6. 3 – 7. 8 mm diameter and their size was not correlated significantly with shell size. Relaxant use was associated with significantly higher mortality in both Groups of oysters and total failures (deaths+bead rejections) in Group II oysters compared with controls. Relaxant use was also associated with pearls of significantly lighter weight, i. e., with lower nacre secretion, further suggesting that there was an adverse effect from this treatment. Adhesive use was associated with more deaths (significant in Group II) and with more bead rejections (significant in Group I). Adhesive use, however, had a positive effect on pearl quality through improved shape. Seventy-six of the 78 Group I oysters that retained beads for 6 weeks had formed pearl sacs, but 55 of the beads (71 %) already had imperfections in the form of projecting calcified ‘tails' from the bead. Histological examination showed that the ‘tails' enclosed accumulations of inflammatory cells in the incision pathway. Adhesive use significantly reduced the prevalence of beads with ‘tails', apparently by better closing the incision pathway. The reduction in ‘tails' at 6 weeks was reflected in a significant reduction in the mean length/diameter ratio of pearls at harvest, i. e., a higher level of symmetry. This was the only significant, positive effect of the three treatments on pearl quality parameters. Antiseptic application to the operation site had no significant effect on mortality, bead rejection rate or ‘tail' formation. However, antiseptic was the only treatment that resulted in a lower percentage of total failures compared to controls. Inflammatory cells, arising from suspected bacterial infections, were associated with failures to produce a pearl sac and the ‘tails' imperfection. Better hygiene with beads, instruments, cloths, cutting boards and graft tissue should control infection levels. The additional times taken to apply the three treatments of this study were not excessive and encourage further innovative approaches to the bead insertion proces...|$|R
