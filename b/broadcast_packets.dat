40|$|MasterThere is {{a problem}} in {{spreading}} a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> in contention-based wireless networks like IEEE 802. 11 when available physical channels are not sufficient. The problem is that some nodes don’t receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> {{due to the fact that}} the frequency of packet collisions depends on the probability. Thus all the nodes may not receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> sent by the source node. It is against the purpose of broadcast that all the nodes in the network should receive the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> The packet loss problem caused by collisions can be more serious in delivering a stream of <b>broadcast</b> data <b>packets.</b> We propose a broadcast tree which is dynamically modified depending on the channel status and a channel assignment algorithm which is reliable, fast and collision reducing for broadcast in multi-radio multi-channel multi-rate wireless mesh networks...|$|R

40|$|The Wi-Fi {{broadcast}} system using the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> transmits the multimedia contents to many local mobile users {{in real time}} and it must use the FEC technology to recover the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss, because Media Access Control layer retransmission is not supported for <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss. Equally adding the redundant packet is not very efficient {{due to the nature}} of the multimedia data. So, several studies have been made on the Unequal Loss Protection (ULP). Proposed ULP system can efficiently add the redundant packet to the source video data with experimentally modeling the deterioration of video according to the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> loss in Wi-Fi based broadcasting system. In order to predict the video deterioration, we use the Expected Quality Ratio (EQR). It is a ratio of the video deterioration of compression to the video deterioration of packet loss. And, we design the framework of ULP system to predict the video quality using the EQR. We implement and experiment the proposed algorithm. Experiment results show how our algorithm outperforms other recovery methods of packet loss...|$|R

50|$|Halvorsen {{and others}} show how {{to modify the}} Beck-Tews attack to allow {{injection}} of 3 to 7 packets having a size of at most 596 bytes. The downside is that their attack requires substantially more time to execute: approximately 18 minutes and 25 seconds. In other work Vanhoef and Piessens showed that, when WPA is used to encrypt <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets,</b> their original attack can also be executed. This is an important extension, as substantially more networks use WPA to protect <b>broadcast</b> <b>packets,</b> than to protect unicast packets. The execution time of this attack is on average around 7 minutes, compared to the 14 minutes of the original Vanhoef-Piessens and Beck-Tews attack.|$|E

40|$|The {{clustered}} {{architecture of}} a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) has {{the virtue of}} keeping the node information locally which is suitable for scalability. Reducing broadcast redundancy in a clustered network can avoid the broadcast storm problem and save scarce resources such as bandwidth and energy. In this paper, we propose an approach that chooses a subset of nodes, called forward node set, to relay the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> Each clusterhead computes its forward node set that connects its adjacent clusterheads. A non-clusterhead node just relays the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> if it is selected as a forward node or else it does nothing. Therefore, the broadcast operation can be restricted only to clusterheads and nodes in locally selected forward node sets. We also utilize the information of clusterheads that are piggybacked with the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> to further reduce each forward node set.

50|$|One major {{limitation}} of traditional VPNs {{is that they}} are point-to-point, and do not tend to support or connect broadcast domains.

We present specific problems related to broadcasting in MANETs, as well as four broadcast protocols aimed at providing MANET-wide broadcast. Further, three protocol-independent modifications are presented. One aimed at ensuring that a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> traverses at least the ``shortest path'' to its destinations, and two aimed at increasing the fraction of nodes which receive a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> Through simulation studies, we evaluate the performance characteristics of the broadcast protocols and generic modifications under different conditions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMultiple Rendezvous {{approaches}} utilized multi-channel {{which was}} only with a single transceiver radio may enhance Mac throughputs of multi-channel ad hoc network no {{less than that of}} other approaches which need extra radios or hardware for time synchronization. However, for the media-access methods of Multiple Rendezvous, nodes in ad hoc network should be listening on different channels to preserve the control packets of any data transmission with noneinterference each other. Therefore, for any <b>broadcast</b> data <b>packet</b> or multicast data packet, it should be transmitted to its destinations like a set of single-cast data packets. And then other performances of ad hoc network as routing may be reduced by the high overload of <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet.</b> In order to reduce the transmission number of a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet,</b> a method of using prepare tones (single-cast tone and broadcast tone) before data-packet transmission is presented, we called it PTMC (Prepare Tone for Media-access Control). In the method of PTMC, any <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> will be send out only once to preserve it can reach any idle destination, which is not sending or receiving any data-packets at that time, nevertheless any single-cast packet will be matched and send out just as MAXM done. Simulation results among PTMC, MAXM and SSCH show: If every <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> was send to potential receivers one by one, the throughputs of ad hoc network routed by AODV and media controlled by MAXM or SSCH may not be improved as the available channel number is increasing, for reasons of the routing discovery time increasing. Using PTMC to solve this problem, whatever data-traffics or available channels are provided, the throughput of PTMC will be better than the other two. Thus with available channels increasing, the throughput of PTMA is improved...|$|R

In the proposed protocol, {{to reduce the}} number of retransmissions, a <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> is retransmitted according to NACK instead of ACK. Moreover, the <b>broadcast</b> <b>packet</b> is retrans-mitted only to the area including nodes that re-quest retransmission by using directional anten-nas. By computer simulations, we show that the proposed protocol can improve throughput per-formance keeping high reliable broadcasting com-pared with the BACK protocol. Especially, the proposed protocol 2 achieves the high throughput of 6, keeping the high success rate of data packet reception of approximately 0. 7. I...|$|R
