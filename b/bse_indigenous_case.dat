40|$|BACKGROUND:Cross-border malaria {{transmission}} poses {{a challenge}} for countries to achieve and maintain malaria elimination. Because of a dramatic increase of cross-border population movement between China and 14 neighbouring countries, the malaria epidemic risk in China's land border regions needs to be understood. METHODS: In this study, individual case-based epidemiological data on malaria in the 136 counties of China with international land borders, from 2011 to 2014, were extracted from the National Infectious Disease Information System. The Plasmodium species, seasonality, spatiotemporal distribution and changing features of imported and <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> were analysed using descriptive spatial and temporal methods. RESULTS:A total of 1948 malaria cases were reported, with 1406 (72. 2 %) imported cases and 542 (27. 8 %) <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases.</b> Plasmodium vivax is the predominant species, with 1536 malaria cases occurrence (78. 9 %), following by Plasmodium falciparum (361 cases, 18. 5 %), and the others (51 cases, 2. 6 %). The magnitude and geographic distribution of malaria in land border counties shrunk sharply during the elimination period. Imported malaria cases were with a peak of 546 cases in 2011, decreasing yearly in the following years. The number of counties with imported cases decreased from 28 counties in 2011 to 26 counties in 2014. <b>Indigenous</b> malaria <b>cases</b> presented a markedly decreasing trend, with 319 <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> in 2011 reducing to only 33 <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> in 2014. The number of counties with <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> reduced from 26 counties in 2011 to 10 counties in 2014. However, several bordering counties of Yunnan province adjacent to Myanmar reported <b>indigenous</b> malaria <b>cases</b> in the four consecutive years from 2011 to 2014. CONCLUSIONS:The scale and extent of malaria occurrence in the international land border counties of China decreased dramatically during the elimination period. However, several high-risk counties, especially along the China-Myanmar border, still face a persistent risk of malaria introduction and transmission. The study emphasizes the importance and urgency of cross-border cooperation between neighbouring countries to jointly face malaria threats to elimination goals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dengue fever {{has been}} a major public health concern in China since it re-emerged in Guangdong {{province}} in 1978. This study aimed to explore spatiotemporal characteristics of dengue fever <b>cases</b> for both <b>indigenous</b> and imported <b>cases</b> during recent years in Guangdong province, so as to identify high-risk areas of the province and thereby help plan resource allocation for dengue interventions. Methods: Notifiable cases of dengue fever were collected from all 123 counties of Guangdong province from 2005 to 2010. Descriptive temporal and spatial analysis were conducted, including plotting of seasonal distribution of cases, and creating choropleth maps of cumulative incidence by county. The space-time scan statistic was used to determine space-time clusters of dengue fever cases at the county level, and a geographical information system was used to visualize the location of the clusters. Analysis were stratified by imported and indigenous origin. Results: 1658 dengue fever cases were recorded in Guangdong province during the study period, including 94 imported <b>cases</b> and 1564 <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases.</b> Both imported and <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> occurred more frequently in autumn.

Results: A total of 45 224 dengue fever cases and 6 deaths were notified in Guangdong Province in 2014, with an incidence of 47. 3 per 100 000 people. The elderly (65 + years) represented 11. 7 % of total <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> with the highest incidence (72. 3 per 100 000).

This study describes the changing epidemiology of dengue in China during this period, to identify high-risk areas and seasons and to inform dengue prevention and control activities. METHODS: We describe the incidence and distribution of dengue in mainland China using notifiable surveillance data from 1990 - 2014, which includes classification of imported and <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> from 2005 - 2014. RESULTS: From 1990 - 2014, 69, 321 cases of dengue including 11 deaths were reported in mainland China, equating to 2. 2 cases per one million residents. The highest number was recorded in 2014 (47, 056 cases). The number of provinces affected has increased, from a median of three provinces per year (range: 1 to 5 provinces) during 1990 - 2000 to a median of 14. 5 provinces per year (range: 5 to 26 provinces) during 2001 - 2014. During 2005 - 2014, imported cases were reported almost every month and 28 provinces (90. 3 %) were affected. However, 99. 8 % of <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> occurred between July and November.

The morbidity rates of <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> showed a steady decline from 5. 9 per 100, 000 population in 1980 to 1. 2 per 100, 000 population in 1989. The mean case fatality was 0. 8 %. Children, {{adolescents and young}} adults were most susceptible to typhoid fever. There {{was no significant difference in}} morbidity rates between the major ethnic groups. The vast majority of <b>indigenous</b> <b>cases</b> were sporadic while outbreaks accounted for almost one third of them. Food was the main vehicle of transmission. The commonest indigenous phage types were B 1, D 1 and A. Antimicrobial resistance was infrequently seen. The proportion of imported cases rose from 32 % in 1980 to 72 % in 1989. Almost half (48. 5 %) of all imported cases were local residents who contracted typhoid fever while travelling in endemic countries. As imported cases assume greater importance in the epidemiology of typhoid fever in Singapore, further drop in typhoid fever incidence would require reduction of travel-related cases through greater awareness of food hygiene and effective vaccination...|$|R
