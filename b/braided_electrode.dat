We {{assessed}} {{the feasibility of}} low energy endocardial defibrillation in a canine model of atrial fibrillation, comparing catheters with large surface area electrodes and standard electrode catheters, and evaluated the effects of lead configuration and circuit impedance on defibrillation energy requirements. Background. Although recent animal studies have demonstrated the feasibility of low energy endocardial atrial defibrillation, their results have been conflicting with regard to important methodologie aspects. Methods. In 14 anesthetized greyhounds, atrial fibrillation was induced by rapid atrial pacing and maintained by vagal stimulation. Two large surface area <b>braided</b> <b>electrode</b> catheters and two standard electrode catheters were introduced percutaneously, one of each, in the right atrial appendage and right ventricular apex. A cutaneous patch electrode {{was placed on the}} left thorax. Biphasic shocks synchronized to the ventricular electrogram were used to terminate atrial fibrillation. Seven configurations were evaluated. Three used standard electrodes: proximal atrial cathode to distal atrial, ventricular or cutaneous anode. Four used braided electrodes: three with atrial cathode to ventricular, cutaneous or combined anode; one with ventricular cathode to atrial anode. Results. Defibrillation with standard electrode catheters was associated with high impedance (576 ± 112 Ω) and low success rates for all configurations (28 % success at ≤ 40 J, no successes at 10 J). Low energy defibrillation was readily achieved with the braided electrodes with significantly lower impedance (75 ± 13 Ω, p < 0. 0001). Ventricular fibrillation did not occur. The success rate of cardioversion increased in a dose-response manner, allowing fitting of a sigmoid curve and calculation of energy associated with 50 % (ED 50) and 90 % (ED 90) success. The most successful configuration was ventricular cathode/atrial anode (ED 501. 5 ± 0. 4 J), and the least successful was atrial anode/cutaneous patch (ED 506. 5 ± 3. 2 J, p = 0. 0001). Conclusions. Low energy atrial defibrillation is feasible using large surface area electrodes but not with standard electrode catheters owing to high impedance. An intracardiac anode provides lower impedance and higher success rates than are provided by a cutaneous anode...|$|E

Survival procedures were accompanied by pre- and post-operative care as described previously (Frank et al., 2001; Jha et al., 2005 a). Experiment 1 Formation of groups: At postnatal days P 24 - 28, cats {{were randomly assigned to}} control or experimental groups. Whenever possible, siblings were distributed evenly across different groups to minimize potential litter effects. Circadian factors are unlikely {{to play a role in}} sleep-dependent ODP because circadian rhythms in sleep/wake and other parameters are extremely weak in cats (Kemppainen and Peterson, 1996; Lancel et al., 1991; Randall et al., 1985) and entirely absent in critical period kittens (Jouvet-Mounier et al., 1970). Nevertheless, whenever possible, experimental manipulations were done at the same time of day. 1 Surgical procedures: Five EEG electrodes were placed bilaterally in frontal and parietal bones of the skull (1 - 2 cm away from V 1), and three EMG <b>electrodes</b> (<b>braided</b> stainless-steel wire) were placed deep into the nuchal muscle. Electrodes were connected to an electrical socket fixed to the skull with bone screws and dental acrylic. A 1. 5 × 1. 5 mm opening was made bilaterally over V 1, the dura was partially reflected, and a dual cannula/electrode (Plastics One; Roanoke, VA) was lowered into V 1 bilaterally. Infusion procedure: Vehicle (VEH; aCSF; Harvard Apparatus; Holliston, MA) and APV were infused for the first 3 h of the post-MD sleep period as previously described (0. 33 µl/min) (Jha et al., 2005 a). APV (Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was infused at a concentration of 5 mM, yielding an infusion rate of 100 nmol/h, which has been shown previously to block ODP when administered continuously via mini-pump (Bear et al., 1990). PKA inhibitor Rp- 8 -Cl-cAMPS (1 mM; Sigma-Aldrich) was infused at a rate of 0. 33 µl/min over the entire 6 -h post-MD sleep period, yielding a rate of delivery (20 nmol/h) which has previously been shown to block ODP when administered continuously via mini-pump (Beaver et al. ...|$|R
