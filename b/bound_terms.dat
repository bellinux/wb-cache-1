Fourth, the entry notes that 道 itself is used as a measure word for courses during a meal. Fifth, dàor 道兒 or dàozi 道子 (tz denotes the noun suffix 子) can mean [...] "streak", counted with tiáo 條 or ge [...] "general measure word". Sixth, dàor 道兒 can also be used as a measure word for streaks. Seventh, the free word (F) dào 道 dao means [...] "to say".

40|$|A self-action {{problem for}} a {{pointlike}} charged particle arbitrarily moving in flat spacetime of three dimensions is considered. Outgoing waves carry energy-momentum and angular momentum; the radiation removes energy and angular momentum from the source which then undergoes a radiation reaction. We decompose Noether quantities carried by electromagnetic field into bound and radiative components. The <b>bound</b> <b>terms</b> are absorbed by individual particle’s characteristics within the renormalization procedure. Radiative terms together with already renormalized 3 -momentum and angular momentum of pointlike charge constitute the total conserved quantities of our particle plus field system. Their differential consequences yield the effective equation of motion of radiating charge in an external electromagnetic field. In this integrodifferential equation the radiation reaction is determined by Lorentz force of pointlike charge acting upon itself plus nonlocal term which provides finiteness of the self-action.

Firstly, the local image containing single building used to model the energy function is constructed by digital line graphic data. And the <b>bound</b> <b>terms</b> of the energy function are defined by the location, shape, edge and corner of buildings, respectively. Then, the energy function is minimized through max-flow/min-cut method, and the similarity of the buildings in the pre-and post-event images {{is measured by the}} minimum cut energy. Finally, the EM algorithm is exploited to select the classification threshold value of the minimum cut energy, and post-processing is performed according to the misclassification rate estimation to obtain the final detection result. Images taken in Ishinomaki before and after the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake are used in this paper.
