5|$|Gaiman {{revisited}} Hell {{as depicted}} by Alan Moore in Swamp Thing, {{beginning with a}} guest appearance by Jack Kirby's Etrigan the Demon in issue No. 4 (April 1989). The story introduces Hell's Hierarchy (as their entry is titled in Who's Who in the DC Universe), headed by Lucifer (who would spin off into his own series in 1999), Beelzebub (later adversary to Kid Eternity), and Azazel, whom Dream defeated later in the series. Dream visited the Justice League International in the following issue, No. 5 (May 1989). Although multiple mainstream DC characters appeared in the series throughout its run, such as Martian Manhunter and Scarecrow, this would not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> Gaiman and artist Mike Dringenberg introduced Death, the older sister of Dream, in issue No. 8 (August 1989).|$|E
5|$|Through {{much of the}} Middle Ages and Renaissance the Catholic Church {{had only}} a small number of {{cardinals}} at any one time, down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV (1254-1261) or Pope John XXI (1276-1277). Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at conclaves. With a small electorate an individual vote was significant, and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines. Conclaves could last months and even years. In addition to the decree in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion, Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants, and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope. The cardinals disliked these strict rules of the conclave; Pope Adrian V temporarily suspended them in 1276 and John XXI's Licet felicis recordationis formally revoked them later that same year - both these Popes had intended to promulgate a new constitution governing papal elections, but died before doing so. Lengthy elections resumed and continued to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> until 1294, when a Benedictine hermit was elected as Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave, but soon resigned the papacy. Long interregna occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave: in 1314–1316 during the Avignon Papacy, where the original conclaves were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened until almost two years had passed; and in 1415–1417, as a result of the Western Schism.|$|E
25|$|As for a {{sequence}} nominative-genitive, it may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> in Latin {{in a similar}} ratio. E.g. “Systema Naturae”. Indeed, the sequence nominative-genitive must always <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> in Peano’s Interlingua, since the preposition de must introduce the genitive. Thus, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica would turn into Principio Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might infer that the sequence noun-adjective might always <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b>|$|E

25|$|While many British {{passenger}} ships {{had been}} called into duty for the war effort, Lusitania remained on her traditional route between Liverpool and New York. She departed Pier 54 in New York on 1 May 1915 on her return trip to Liverpool with 1,959 people aboard. In addition to her crew of 694, she carried 1,265 passengers, mostly British nationals {{as well as a}} large number of Canadians, along with 128 Americans. Her First Class accommodations, for which she was quite famous on the North Atlantic Run, were booked at just over half capacity at 290. Second Class was severely overbooked with 601 passengers, far exceeding the maximum capacity of 460 which had been designated to Second Class. While a large number of small children and infants helped reduce the squeeze into the limited number of two and four berth cabins, the situation was ultimately rectified by allowing some Second Class passengers to occupy empty First Class cabins. In Third Class, the situation was considered to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for an eastbound crossing, with only 373 travelling in accommodations designed for 1,186.|$|E

A strong case has been made that declarative knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> of assertion, which is our primary way of telling others information. This paper presents an analogous case for the hypothesis that procedural knowledge <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> of instructional demonstration, which is a primary way of showing others how to do things.

25|$|Although {{widespread}} tolerance {{seems to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm</b> for ectomycorrhizal fungi, adaptive metal tolerance {{has been suggested}} for a few fungi such as Pisolithus tinctorius, P. albus and species in the genus Suillus. Fungal ecotypes specialized {{to high levels of}} heavy metals {{have been found to be}} adapted to high levels of Al, Zn, Cd and Cu. Interestingly, a reduced number of species is known to be adapted to different metals with different ecotypes arising recurrently. This suggests that some species are more prone to adapt to chemically inhospitable edaphic environments. Suillus luteus and S. bovinus are good examples, with known ecotypes adapted to Zn, Cd and Cu. These differentiated populations accumulate lower heavy metal concentrations in their mycelia and in a slower fashion compared to sensitive ecotypes. More specifically, the accumulation of heavy metals in the fungal tissue is prevented through a mechanism that efficiently exports metals to the outside of the cell. When compared to non-mycorrhizal fine roots, ectomycorrhizae may contain very high concentrations of trace elements, including toxic metals (cadmium, silver) or chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Atatürk was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of coeducation and the education of girls. Coeducation was established as the norm throughout the educational system by 1927. Centuries of sex segregation under Ottoman rule had denied girls equal education, Atatürk thus opposed segregated education as a matter of principle. The matter of coeducation was first raised {{as a result of a}} controversy in Tekirdağ in 1924, where, due to the lack of a high school for girls, girls requested enrollment in the high school for boys. Upon this, works on coeducation began and the Minister of Education declared that both sexes would follow the same curriculum. In August 1924, it was decided that coeducation would be introduced to primary education, giving boys the right to enroll in girls' high schools and vice versa. Atatürk declared in his Kastamonu speech in 1925 that coeducation should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>norm.</b> Whilst the educational committee had agreed in 1926 to abolish single-sex education in middle schools that were not boarding schools, segregation persisted in middle and high schools, and statistics in the 1927–28 educational year revealed that only 29% of those enrolled in primary schools were girls. This figure was 18.9% for middle schools and 28% for high schools. Acting on these figures, 70 single-sex middle schools were converted to coeducational schools in 1927–28 and new coeducational middle schools were established. This was despite the opposition of Köprülüzade Fuat Bey, the Undersecretary for Education. Whilst the policy was transition to coeducational high schools based on the success in middle schools from 1928–29 onwards this policy could only be implemented effectively from 1934–35 onwards.|$|E
