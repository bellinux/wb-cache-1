50|$|The X2 Defender has an {{effective}} range of 4.6 m (15 ft). The {{operating temperature range}} and storage temperature range is -4 °F (-20 °C) to 122 °F (50 °C). The X2 Defender’s dimensions with the battery pack (length x width x height) are 7.8″ (19.8 cm) x 1.7″ (4.3 cm) x 4.2″ (10.7 cm) and it weighs 454 grams with two full <b>battery</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
40|$|While most {{commercial}} battery {{back-up systems}} fall below government-required reporting levels, very large UPS and DC plant batteries {{may have to}} comply. Failure to comply can result in costly penalties. For lead acid batteries, environmental compliance focuses {{on the amount of}} sulfuric acid and lead at a particular location. Power ratings for VRLA batteries and modular <b>battery</b> <b>cartridges</b> are much higher than for flooded batteries at the same reporting threshold. This paper gives a high level summary of the regulations and guides the reader to sources of full information...|$|R

5000|$|PB-4-1 (ПБ-4-1) - {{model with}} {{built-in}} laser sight, 18×45 mm <b>cartridge,</b> <b>battery</b> priming, user-controlled electronic barrel selector, production started in 2003 ...|$|R
50|$|They may be {{a single}} unit {{comprising}} a battery, coil and filling saturated with e-juice in a single tube to be used and discarded after the battery or e-liquid is depleted. They {{may also be a}} reusable device with a <b>battery</b> and <b>cartridge</b> called a cartomizer. The cartomizer cartridge can be separated from the battery so the battery can be charged and the empty cartomizer replaced when the e-juice runs out.|$|R
50|$|The Remington-Rider Magazine Pistol had a manually-actuated block {{rolled back}} {{to pull a}} {{cartridge}} from a tubular magazine set below the barrel and simultaneously cock the weapon. The block was rolled back into <b>battery,</b> loading the <b>cartridge</b> into the chamber, by spring pressure while the hammer remained in the cocked position.|$|R
5000|$|The {{expanded}} {{recycling program}} launched on July 1, 2007. Since its launch, {{the program has}} continued to grow and refine its procedures to better accommodate a growing campus' needs. Currently there are programs in place for paper, cardboard, aluminum, <b>batteries,</b> glass, printer <b>cartridges,</b> wooden pallets and plastics #1 and #2.|$|R
2500|$|MSX systems {{generally}} did {{not have}} a built-in disk drive, so games were published mainly on cartridge and cassette tape. Sony created a <b>battery</b> backed RAM <b>cartridge</b> the HBI-55 [...] "data cartridge" [...] for a few computers of their [...] "Hit-Bit" [...] line of MSX systems, {{that could be used to}} store programs or data as an alternative to cassette tapes.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} R-Zone unit {{consisted of}} a headset and a separate controller containing <b>batteries.</b> Each game <b>cartridge</b> had its own transparent LCD display screen which was projected onto a mirrored surface held {{in front of the}} player's eye. It is thought that this original design, including the red color scheme, was designed to capitalize on popular buzz for the Nintendo Virtual Boy at the time.|$|R
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit <b>battery</b> backed-up <b>cartridge</b> to work properly, and was {{expensive}} to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency to darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the secure memory mentioned above, they have the CryptoAuthentication product lines that provide hardware authentication capability with both symmetric and asymmetric-key algorithm authentication. These ICs are used in many applications, including secure access, communications, control, and to prevent cloned products like <b>batteries</b> or ink <b>cartridges</b> not approved by the product manufacturer. Atmel's CryptoRF products add hardware encrypted security to RFID applications. Finally Atmel offers a trusted platform module that gives strong hardware-based public key (RSA algorithm) security for both personal computers and embedded processors on a single chip.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{enrolment}} in the school, {{each student}} is placed {{into one of}} six [...] "houses": Champlain, Bishop Mountain, MacDonald, Thorne, Rose or Langton. Throughout the year, the houses compete in both academic and athletic competitions to earn [...] "house points". At {{the end of the}} year, a winner is announced. House points are earned from specific organized events throughout the year. House points can also be earned by bringing in assorted items to the various food or gift drives that are organized throughout the year or items like old cell phones, <b>batteries</b> and ink <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mindset had dual {{front-mounted}} ROM cartridge ports with a {{locking knob}} {{on the left}} side of the main computer module to lock the ROM modules into place. The Mindset had the option (through its System Configuration Utility) to be able to select whether the system booted from left or right ROM carts, or disk drive. Cartridges could also contain CMOS RAM, which would be retained when unplugged by a <b>battery</b> in the <b>cartridge</b> case. Cartridges were envisioned to be a primary medium for software distribution on the Mindset, but sales of the system were too low for cartridges to be economical, and software was distributed on disk instead.|$|R
50|$|Not {{all of the}} Italian planes sent to aid {{the rebel}} faction reached Morocco - the plane {{commanded}} by Angelini crashed in the Mediterranean, Mattalia's crashed near Saïda in French Morocco, and Lo Forte had to make an emergency landing near Berkane (also in French Morocco) and was seized by the local authorities. The nine survivors of the Moroccan crashes were provided with nationalist papers and transportation to the airport at Tetuan, from which, over the following days, they helped escort the transport ships Araujo, Ciudad de Alicante, and Ciudad de Ceuta, which together carried 4,000 men, 4 artillery <b>batteries,</b> 2 million <b>cartridges,</b> and 12 tons of other munitions to mainland Spain.|$|R
50|$|Originally console games had no {{additional}} storage memory for saving game related data. During the Nintendo Entertainment System's {{time on the}} market, <b>battery</b> backed <b>cartridge</b> games that could retain {{a limited number of}} game files were introduced. When the original PlayStation was released it included support for an external memory source, called a memory card. Its purpose was to store important information about the games, such as game states or scoring info. That memory card used a memory of type EEPROM. To support the growing use of these cards in normal game play and the different amounts of data to be saved, larger memory cards were created. Other consoles also adopted the use of memory cards, such as the Sega Dreamcast, whose memory card was called the Visual Memory Unit or VMU. The Dreamcast’s memory unit was unique in that it had a monochrome LCD display, a D-pad, and two buttons. A large third party memory card market also sprung up, offering cards that were often much cheaper and larger than the official released memory cards. Some unique third party cards required extra software to access the cards, or possibly increase the data capacity by compressing the contained data.|$|R
50|$|The bolt {{contained}} no firing pin or striker, just a ceramic cap that would electronically detonate the primer via the <b>battery</b> charge. The <b>cartridge</b> {{was designed by}} Hubert Usel and {{is known as the}} Usel Caseless Cartridge (UCC). The round was encased in a block of solid nitrocellulose and because it was not an automatic rifle it did not have the problems with cooking-off that plagued earlier military attempts such as the Heckler & Koch G11, in which the built up heat of sustained fire caused rounds to detonate immediately upon entering the chamber, releasing more heat, and often resulting in an uncontrollable burst of automatic fire until the magazine was emptied (although this is a risk in normal metallic cartridge firearms as well).|$|R
5000|$|In March 2015, it {{was made}} public that some inkjet {{printers}} using ultrasonic heads can be read back using high frequency MEMS microphones to record the unique acoustic signals from each nozzle and using timing reconstruction with known printed data, that is, [...] "confidential" [...] in 12-point font. Thermal printers can also be read using similar methods but with less fidelity as the signals from the bursting bubbles are weaker. The hack also involved implanting a microphone, chip storage IC and burst transmitter with long-life Li+ <b>battery</b> into doctored <b>cartridges</b> substituted for genuine ones sent by post to the target, typically a bank, then retrieved from the garbage using challenge-response RFID chip. A similar work on reconstructing printouts made by dot-matrix printers was publicized in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The R-Zone Headgear (1995) {{was largely}} {{different}} from later units {{in that the}} game cartridge was inserted into a device that was strapped onto the user's head. The user would flip down a transparent lens {{that was designed to}} reflect the game images into the user's right eye. The head unit held the game being played and was connected to a controller with a cable approximately 2.5 ft long. The controller required 4 AAA <b>batteries,</b> sported a <b>cartridge</b> storage slot (for keeping an additional game protected and available), volume adjustment dial, and brightness adjustment dial. This unit as a whole is sometimes thought to have been designed to compete against the Virtual Boy. The very first game to be distributed with this console was Batman Forever, based on the 1995 movie of the same name, followed by Sega's [...] arcade racing game Indy 500.|$|R
40|$|Since 1989 the U. S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories (USACERL) {{have been}} active {{participants}} in {{the research and development}} toward establishing Plasma Arc Technology (PAT) as an efficient, economical, and safe hazardous waste immobilization tool. A plasma torch capable of generating high temperatures makes this technology a viable and powerful tool for the thermal destruction of various military industrial waste streams into an innocuous ceramic material no longer requiring hazardous waste landfill (Class 1) disposal. The emerging pl asma environmental thermal treatment process, has been used to safely and efficiently meet the waste disposal needs for various demilitarized components disposal needs, such as: pyrotechnic smoke assemblies, thermal <b>batteries,</b> proximity fuses, <b>cartridge</b> actuated devices (CAD's), and propellant actuated devices (PAD's). MSE Technology Applications, Inc., (MSE) has proposed and fabricated a Mobile Plasma Treatment System to be a technology demonstrator for pilot-scale mobile plasma waste processing. The system is capable of providing small-scale waste remediation services, and conducting waste stream applicability demonstrations. The Mobile Plasma Treatment System's innovative concept provides the flexibility to treat waste streams at numerous sites and sites with only a limited quantity of waste, yet too hazardous to transport to a regional fixed facility. The system was designed to be operated as skid mounted modules; consisting of a furnace module, controls module, offgas module, and ancillary systems module. All system components have been integrated to be operated from a single control station with both semi-continuous feeding and batch slag-pouring capability...|$|R
