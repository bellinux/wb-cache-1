40|$|This study investigates how {{employment}} in large-scale organizations affects the work lives of practicing physicians. Well-established theory associates larger organizations with <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraint,</b> loss of workplace control, and dissatisfaction, but this author finds that large scale is {{also associated with}} greater schedule and career flexibility. Ironically, the bureaucratic processes that accompany large-scale organization also allow for a reduction of patient demands on individual physicians, freeing those physicians to pursue other career activities or to fulfill family responsibilities. Large-scale organizations thus appear to represent a trade-off between workplace control and temporal flexibility, and many physicians appear to embrace this trade-off. The data come from surveys and interviews conducted in 2002. Implications extend to other professional and managerial labor markets in which client demands constrain schedules and careers...|$|E
40|$|Research on the {{practical}} problems of allocating homes according to need {{has recently been}} eclipsed by heated debate on the privatisation of public housing. In {{the wake of the}} British government's new commitment to the idea of state-subsidised accommodation, this paper reconsiders the problem of discretion in effecting welfare transfers. It explores how nine local authority housing departments process applications from people with health problems and mobility needs. We argue, contrary to the prevailing wisdom, that discretion is inevitable, necessary and often desirable when assessing housing needs and matching needy applicants to homes. Neither total market freedom nor complete <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraint</b> seem likely to solve the problem with social housing.

40|$|Many workers, {{employers}} and enterprises {{around the world}} are, to varying degrees, {{in a situation of}} 'informality'. Although intuitive, the notion of 'informality' is however not easy to define. For many, it evokes a sense of hardship, characterized by precarity, vulnerability, poverty, exploitation and exclusion, for example. It can however have very different connotations for others, who might associate 'informality' with autonomy, entrepreneurialism, or freedom from <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraint.</b> Whatever the perspective, however, 'informality' can have a whole range of different potential causes, and their identification, as well as the remedies suggested to overcome them, will vary. Having said this, the concept of 'informality' arguably poses a number of specific challenges from a legal perspective, more specifically concerning how the notion fits within the international and national legal framework relating to the protection of workers. This article proposes to examine these challenges, and the evolution of the understanding of 'informality' within the International Labour Organization (ILO), in light of the recent suggestion that the ILO adopt a recommendation on 'facilitating gradual transitions from the informal economy to the formal economy'. The ILO is an important reference point when discussing informality, on the one hand because of its role in introducing the notion into global development debates, and on the other hand, because of its important role with regards to improving working conditions, and the concerns raised by informality in this respect...|$|E

40|$|Since Max Weber 2 ̆ 7 s classic {{writings}} on bureaucracy, {{the relationship between}} professionalization and bureaucracy has been a central focus of organization theory and research (e. g., Parsons, 1947; Goulduer, 1954; Blauner, 1964; Blau, 1968, Meyer, 1968 b; Blau and Schoenherr, 1971). Some research suggests that professionalization and bureaucratization are alternative or conflicting modes of organization (Udy, 1959; Stinchecombe, 1959; Litwak, 1961; Burns and Stalker, 1961; Thompson, 1961; Hall, 1963; Rage, 1965). While other research suggests that professionalization and bureaucratization are actually congruent because structural accommdation minimizes dissension between professionals and bureaucrats (e. g., Blau, 1968; Meyer, 1968 b; Kirsch and Lengermann, 1972). However, the resolution of professional bureaucratic discord does not always occur and may {{vary depending on the}} status or legitimation of the profession. In the case of an emerging profession or semi-profession, like social work (Scott, 1969; Toren, 1969), this conflict may remain unresolved and produce alienation and work dissatisfaction. This research investigates the impact of <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraint</b> and professionalism on one aspect of alienation among social workers: powerlessness, or disaffection regarding one 2 ̆ 7 s participation in organizational decision-making. This research treats powerlessness as an organizationally - specific phenomenon. With some exceptions (e. g., Blauner, 1964; Clark, 1959; Lefton, et. al., 1959; Segal, 1969), powerlessness has been dealt with in a societal context (Lystad, 1972). In most research, powerlessness (or any form of alienation) has been viewed as a generalized manifestation of person-toworld or person-to-society relations. Intraorganizational powerlessness has been of interest primarily because of its alleged ramifications beyond the organizational context in which it is generated. Seeman (1967) found little support for this 2 ̆ 2 generalization hypothesis 2 ̆ 2, and suggests that this is due to persons 2 ̆ 7 propensity to segmentalize different spheres of life.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 PURPOSE-Administrators {{of nursing}} homes are turning over at very high rates in the present industry. With the growth of older populations needing skilled nursing care, this {{presents}} a risk {{to the needs of}} the elderly. Satisfaction and turnover have been correlated in the literature. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore dimensions of satisfaction and dissatisfaction among nursing home administrators in order to ascertain constructs potentially contributing to dissatisfaction in the industry. METHODS-Informational letters were mailed to all licensed administrators in the state (N= 143) who were then randomized to receive follow-up invitational phone calls to join the study. Those interested in participating were asked a few short screening questions about their tenures in the industry and overall perceptions of satisfaction. Interested participants were then divided into 3 different strata based on their tenures. Purposive sampling informed the choices of participants and selected 10 from each of the shortest, longest, and most dynamic tenures. Interviews occurred on nursing home sites around Oregon. Grounded theory was used in a priori analysis by means of a coding paradigm in order to allow emergent data to reveal substantive categories in a theoretically directed pattern of coding, contrasting, verifying, and eventually grounding new theory in data. FINDINGS-Allowing the data to emerge in analysis of satisfaction and dissatisfaction revealed two corresponding core categories, Constraints to the Job and Meaningful Work. Constraints to the Job included 4 categories: <b>Bureaucratic</b> <b>Constraints,</b> Budgetary Constraints, Personnel Constraints, and Ethical Constraints. Meaningful Work included Working Conditions and Meaningful Interiors. As dissatisfaction and satisfaction were further compared and verified, theory grounded in data emerged and revealed that constraints to the job obstruct an administrator's autonomy, which in turn impedes the ability to engage in meaningful work and contributes to dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS-While constructs of dissatisfaction emerged, administrators on the whole revealed high satisfaction with their positions. Future studies should concentrate on the <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraints</b> to the job as these constraints were perceived as extremely dissatisfying and hold political implications for state and corporate policies...|$|R

In addition, most controls appear to be complements rather than substitutes, casting doubts on the claims of NPM that traditional controls should be abandoned.

40|$|Abstract –This paper {{looks at}} {{innovation}} in school choice programs-appraising this presumed causal relationship between market mechanisms and innovation in two ways. First, the analysis reviews market-oriented school reforms in four systems (New Zealand, Chile, England and Wales, and North America), examining how competition and choice foster innovation in education. These systems include publicly funded and privately administered schools, schools run by corporations, newly autonomous established schools, and new schools created {{to be free}} of <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraints</b> in order to develop innovative practices. This review indicates that, despite widely held assumptions about the power of markets, hypothetical predictions about competition and choice are largely unfulfilled in practice. In fact, interventions by public bureaucracies have often succeeded in encouraging classroom innovations, while market mechanisms appear to contribute to standardization. Second, this paper engages in an interpretive exploration of the logic of markets-particularly as they are applied to education. Insofar as reformers refer to markets for consumer goods as appropriate models for education, this paper examines the logic of such markets, as well as the logic of quasi-markets in education. In fact, while competitive environments often serve as catalysts for innovative practices, competition and choice can also lead toward emulation and standardization-trends that are missed in simplistic portrayals of markets.

40|$|The {{recognition}} {{of the role of}} a viable small business sector in sustainable development has fuelled the debate as to the most effective and cost-efficient ways of promoting entrepreneurs and small-scale enterprises (SSE). The established pattern of supply side support for new and small businesses has been marked by heavy investment in the provision of key inputs- credit, training, advice, technical assistance and infrastructure. But increasingly questions are being asked as to the cost-efficiency of such measures and the efftcacy of the institutions providing such services. Research has not only highlighted the limited return on much of this support in terms of long-term growth, profits generated or jobs created; but has also stressed the importance of appropriate delivery systems and the institutional culture of enterprise support agencies. An increasing number of commentators suggest that it is the wider policy environment that is the key to whether any small business can survive profitably.

40|$|Purpose - This paper investigates {{resilience}} {{to extreme}} weather events (EWE) {{in a sample}} of Italian local councils (LC), impacted by flood disasters. Whether resilience as a concept is adopted by the affected councils and factors that promote or inhibit local council resilience are explored. Design/methodology - Using semi-structured interviews, we investigate seven Italian local councils that were severely impacted by the flood event. An interview protocol was developed and background information collected. A number of themes were drawn from the interview transcripts and relationships with the relevant literature were examined. Findings - The findings highlight that the adoption of the concept of resilience is at an early stage in the LCs decision and policy-making. We find that the financial resources and the external relations management with other public entities, NGOs and local communities, promote the LCs resilience during and after an EWE.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} cost-efficiency in Switzerland’s nursing homes, an issue of concern to policy makers because of {{the rapid growth of}} elderly care expenditure and the aging of the population. The fact that nursing homes in Switzerland exist in different institutional forms, private for-profit, government and non-profit status, raises the issue of their relative cost efficiency. A panel data of 17 public and 19 nonprofit nursing homes operating over the 9 -year period from 1993 to 2001, in one of the 26 Swiss cantons, Ticino, is studied. Ticino’s nursing homes are heavily regulated and monitored by the canton’s authorities. However, given that in public firms there are more <b>bureaucratic</b> <b>constraints</b> and agency problems, one can expect a relatively low level of cost-efficiency. In this paper the effect of institutional form on efficiency is studied using a translog stochastic cost-frontier model. Several specifications are used to study the robustness of the results. The results suggest that the institutional form influences the efficiency of the studied nursing homes in that non-profit foundations {{are likely to be more}} cost-efficient than the nursing homes operated by government administration. The results also suggest that a great majority of the nursing homes in the sample do not fully benefit from the scale economies. This implies that efficiency gains can be obtained with larger capacities or joint operations...|$|R
