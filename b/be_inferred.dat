5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. This can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred {{several times during}} evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
5|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that a flaw in a code library developed by Infineon, which had been in widespread use in security products such as smartcards and TPMs, enabled private keys to <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from public keys. This could allow an attacker to bypass BitLocker encryption when an affected TPM chip is used. Microsoft released an updated version of the firmware for Infineon TPM chips that fixes the flaw via Windows Update.|$|E
5|$|More generally, an {{historical}} or literary tradition concerning {{events in the}} time of Djedkare seems to have flourished toward the end of Old Kingdom as can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the tombs of Harkuf and Iny. These two officials were in charge of expeditions to foreign lands–Punt and Byblos– under Merenre I and Pepi II and both relate similar expeditions that took place during the time of Djedkare Isesi.|$|E

5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal they refer to. Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{great auk}} was never {{observed}} and described by modern scientists during its existence, {{and is only}} known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is not well known and difficult to reconstruct.

5|$|All {{of these}} treasures are later copies {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the Eiga Monogatari, the complete content of the works has to be assembled from several of these (and other) fragmentary manuscripts or <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from other sources. The Kojiki, long neglected by scholars until the 18th century, was not preserved as well as the Nihon Shoki which has been studied from soon after its compilation. While being the oldest text in this list, the extant manuscript dating to the 14th century is the earliest entry.|$|E

The accepted toll for Operation Atlantic is 1,349, with about 300 fatalities. Operation Spring's losses were about 500 killed with a further 1,000 captured or wounded. Working from these figures, historians estimate around 800 Canadian dead and 2,000 wounded or captured. The Canadian dead are buried in Bretteville-sur-Laize Canadian War Cemetery, between Caen and Falaise.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} first movement, copied by Voigt, is fully {{accepted}} as having been completed, the intended scale and general character of the Eighth Symphony may <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from several sources. Sibelius's correspondence with Voigt and with his binders, in 1933 and 1938 respectively, indicates {{the possibility of a}} notably large-scale work. Apart from Nils-Eric Fougstedt's 1947 observation, there are also indications from Voigt that the work may have contained choral elements, along the lines of Beethoven's Ninth.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. Through his own written work, it can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch {{makes no}} further mention of events until the initial {{confrontation}} between Marcus Licinius Crassus and Spartacus {{in the spring}} of 71 BC, omitting the march on Rome and the retreat to Thurii described by Appian. However, as Plutarch describes Crassus forcing Spartacus' followers to retreat southwards from Picenum, it could <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that the rebel slaves approached Picenum from the south in early 71 BC, implying that they withdrew from Mutina into southern or central Italy for the winter of 72–71 BC.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|The Eta Carinae {{star system}} is {{currently}} {{one of the}} most massive that can be studied in great detail. Until recently Eta Carinae was thought to be the most massive single star, but the system's binary nature was proposed by the Brazilian astronomer Augusto Damineli in 1996 and confirmed in 2005. Both component stars are largely obscured by circumstellar material ejected from Eta Carinae A and basic properties such as their temperatures and luminosities can only <b>be</b> <b>inferred.</b> Rapid changes to the stellar wind in the 21st century suggest that the star itself may be revealed as dust from the great eruption finally clears.|$|E

5|$|The {{television}} {{portrayal of}} Sarah Boyer {{is probably the}} closest character to her portrayal in the novelisation. In the book, her companion was named Vic, not Bob, and in the 1970s series, she was named Anne Tranter. Vic's fate is not revealed in the novelization, but it can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that he starved to death. In the 2008 television series, Bob survives his initial abandonment. In the 1970s series, Anne (Sarah in the 2008 version) leaves during Episode 11; in the 2008 version, she dies from a mutated version of the virus.|$|E
5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of the alignment as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in the alignment. Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E

5|$|Comparisons {{between the}} scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and {{reptiles}} have <b>been</b> used to <b>infer</b> daily activity patterns of pterosaurs.

As a result, the possibly fish-eating Ctenochasma and Rhamphorhynchus may have had similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding Pterodaustro may have had similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs Ctenochasma, Rhamphorhynchus, Scaphognathus, and Pterodactylus may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.|$|R

5|$|Stela 16 {{celebrates the}} {{accession}} {{of a local}} sajal, or Maya leader, at the nearby satellite kingdom of La Mar. Tatiana Proskouriakoff had originally used this stela to misidentify the sixth ajaw of Piedras Negras, assigning the title to the sajal, instead of Ha' K'in Xook. The uniqueness of a La Mar ruler being celebrated on a Piedras Negras stela seems to signify that La Mar had, {{at the time of}} Yo'nal Ahk III and possibly earlier, attained a certain degree of importance in the Piedras Negras hegemony. The front of the stela is eroded, but according to Megan O'Neil, it can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> that the monument had an image of Yo'nal Ahk III on the front, based on comparisons with other stelae at Piedras Negras, like Stelae 6 and 11.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal {{years of the}} emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{senses of}} Psittacosaurus can <b>be</b> <b>inferred</b> from the endocast. Large {{olfactory}} bulbs are present, indicating the genus had an acute sense of smell. The size of these bulbs {{are comparable to}} large predatory theropods, although they likely evolved to avoid predators instead of to seek out prey. The sclerotic rings in reptiles directly show {{the size of the}} eyeball. The rings are not well preserved in Psittacosaurus, with one individual preserving them likely contracted postmortem, but if they {{are similar to those of}} Protoceratops, Psittacosaurus would have had large eyes and acute vision. The curvature of the semicircular canals is related to the agility of reptiles, and the large curved canals in Psittacosaurus show that the genus was much more agile than later ceratopsians. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Psittacosaurus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day and for short intervals at night.|$|E
