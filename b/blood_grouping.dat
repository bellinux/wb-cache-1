40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} breast cancer in Greek women and ABO <b>blood</b> <b>groups.</b> Material-methods: In 166 female patients with breast cancer factors such as <b>blood</b> <b>group,</b> histological type, family history, {{presence or absence of}} nodal and/or distant metastases were examined. These patients had similar demographic, clinical, surgical, immunohistochemical, laboratory, and follow-up data and this group is representative of general population of women in Greece. Results: The ductal type of breast cancer was differentially distributed in <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> Rh (+) (P ≤ 0. 001). In patients with A (+) <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> the ductal type of breast cancer was present in 49. 6 % of cases, in relation to the other <b>blood</b> <b>groups</b> and in AB <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> the same type occurred rarely (3. 6 %).

There was no difference between patients in the two groups in terms of smoking, alcohol use, hypertension and diabetes (p > 0. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: One of {{the major}} {{determinants}} of von Willebrand factor (VWF) plasma levels is ABO <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> status, and individuals with <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O have ~ 25 % lower plasma levels. The exact mechanism behind this relationship remains unknown, although effects on clearance have been postulated. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether clearance of VWF is directly dependent {{on the presence of}} ABH antigens on VWF. METHODS: Three type 3 von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients were infused with Haemate-P, and the relative loading of VWF with ABH antigens at different time points was measured. VWF-deficient mice were injected with purified plasma-derived human VWF obtained from donors with either <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B, or <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O. RESULTS: In mice, we found no difference in clearance rate between plasma-derived <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B and <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF. Faster clearance of the <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF present in Haemate-P infused in type 3 VWD patients would have resulted in a relative increase in the loading of VWF with A and B antigens over time. However, we observed a two-fold decrease in the loading with A and B antigens in two out of three patients, and stable loading in the third patient. CONCLUSION: There is no direct effect of ABH antigens on VWF in VWF clearance. We demonstrate that, in a direct comparison within one individual, <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O VWF is not cleared faster than <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A or <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> B VWF. Clearance differences between <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O and non-blood group O individuals may therefore be related to the <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> status of the individual rather than the ABH antigen loading on VWF itself...|$|R

A strain-specific preference of rosetting was observed for either <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A/AB or B/AB RBC for all parasites tested. The higher affinity of rosette binding of <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A, B, or AB vs. O RBC was reflected in larger rosettes when a given parasite was grown in RBC of the preferred <b>blood</b> <b>group.</b> The small size of the rosettes formed when P. falciparum was grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O RBC may be the in vitro correlate of the relative protection against cerebral malaria afforded by belonging to <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O rather than to <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A or B. Rosettes of a <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A-preferring parasite could be completely disrupted by heparin only when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> O or B RBC, but not when grown in <b>blood</b> <b>group</b> A RBC.
