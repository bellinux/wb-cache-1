25|$|In some states, a {{burglary}} committed during {{the hours of}} daylight is technically not burglary, but housebreaking. In many jurisdictions in the U.S., burglary <b>is</b> <b>punished</b> more severely than housebreaking. In California, for example, burglary <b>was</b> <b>punished</b> as burglary in the first degree, while housebreaking <b>was</b> <b>punished</b> as burglary in the second degree. California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building, with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment.|$|R

This {{provides}} that anyone who attempts to commit an offence will <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> with {{the same period in}} prison as if they had succeeded; since theft carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison, for example, someone convicted of attempted theft would also find themselves sentenced to a maximum of seven years.|$|E

5|$|In Blockburger v. United States (1932), the Supreme Court {{announced}} the following test: {{the government may}} separately try and punish the defendant for two crimes if each crime contains an element that the other does not.

6000|$|... [63] The {{non-observance}} of {{a regulation}} of police <b>was</b> always heavily <b>punished</b> by barbarous nations; a slighter punishment was inflicted upon {{the commission of}} crimes.

So among the Druids,--to enforce exactness in time at their meetings, he that came last after the time appointed <b>was</b> <b>punished</b> with death.|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} Zbyněk Zeman, broadcasting {{became the}} most important medium for propaganda throughout the war. Posters were also used domestically and leaflets were dropped behind enemy lines by air-ship. In regions conquered by Germany, citizens could <b>be</b> <b>punished</b> by death for listening to foreign broadcasts. Britain had four organizations involved in propaganda and was methodical about understanding its audiences in different countries. US propaganda focused on fighting for freedom and the connection between war efforts and industrial production. Soviet posters also focused on industrial production.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in front of his accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|Göth {{believed}} if {{one member}} of a work team escaped or committed some infraction, the entire team must <b>be</b> <b>punished.</b> On one occasion he ordered the shooting of every second member of a work detail {{because one of the}} party had escaped. On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E

5|$|In 1600, the Satake {{sided with}} the Western Army at the Battle of Sekigahara, and were {{discovered}} to be in secret communication with Ishida Mitsunari, {{the leader of the}} Western Army.

5|$|The {{tower was}} {{constructed}} sometime between the Dissolution and the Union of the Crowns but the exact date is not known.
