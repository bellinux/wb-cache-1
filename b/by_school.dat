On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E

5|$|Residential school {{deaths were}} common {{and have been}} linked to the {{persistence}} of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting <b>by</b> <b>school</b> officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with retention and disposition policies for government records.

Randy's house is firebombed <b>by</b> <b>school</b> bullies for his cooperation with the police, leaving his caring foster mother hospitalized and sending him back to a group home.

5|$|In Seattle, {{two friends}} argue about {{applying}} for college. Landon Bryce (Christopher Kennedy Masterson) tells his friend Howard Gordon (Michael R. Coleman) to apply, but Gordon has been convinced <b>by</b> <b>school</b> counselor Teresa Roe (Mariangela Pino) that his progress is too mediocre {{to make it}} worthwhile. Bryce accosts Roe, calling her a failure. That night, Gordon is killed, and Bryce is kidnapped. Millennium Group criminal profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) learns that Gordon {{died of a heart}} attack, which the coroner believes was caused by fear. Black visits the crime scene, and sees visions of Lucy Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond), a woman who killed his friend and colleague Bob Bletcher (in season one's Lamentation). Meanwhile, Bryce is bound and gagged in a remote farmhouse, then left in a room with the would-be escapee. The woman from earlier tells Bryce she loves him.|$|E
5|$|In {{a review}} <b>by</b> <b>School</b> Library Journal, Smith's {{encyclopedia}} was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful appendices including a glossary, lists of executive staff {{members of the}} CIA, and a large bibliography and index. Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E

5|$|Kurt is menaced <b>by</b> <b>school</b> bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) {{and badly}} shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt's plight, she can only punish Karofsky if he {{physically}} attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) convinces the glee club girls {{to have their}} football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) do confront Karofsky, and demand that he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam defends them by fighting with him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions, and decides to accept his promise ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts {{them in front of}} Burt. Burt is angered by this, but becomes livid when Kurt admits that Karofsky has threatened to kill him. He instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father (Daniel Roebuck) and the two boys, at which Sue expels Karofsky.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping <b>by</b> <b>school</b> and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E
5|$|The {{floors of}} the rooms on this level are made from lime-ash plaster pressed into a bedding of straw and oak laths, which would have offered some {{protection}} against the ever-present risk of fire. All the first-floor rooms in the east range and all except the Prayer Room in the west range are closed to the public, some having been converted into accommodation for the National Trust staff who live on site. The Education Room in the east range, above what is today the restaurant, was in the mid-16th century a solar, and is now reserved for use <b>by</b> <b>school</b> groups.|$|E

5|$|The reserve has free admission. It is {{maintained}} by London Wildlife Trust staff {{with the help}} of volunteers. There is a varied programme of activities including wildlife walks, fungus forays, open days and talks. The reserve is used regularly <b>by</b> <b>school</b> and community groups, and for team-building work days by corporate groups. Its entrance, with a wooden five-bar gate flanked by hedges, is on the south of Bollo Lane, a few yards from Chiswick Park tube station.|$|E
5|$|Visitation, {{for those}} {{able to make}} the journey, was {{strictly}} controlled <b>by</b> <b>school</b> officials {{in a manner similar to}} the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the pass system. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the North-West Rebellion, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.|$|E
