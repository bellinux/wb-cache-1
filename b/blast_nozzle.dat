Effect of Aviation Fuel Type and Fuel Injection Conditions on the Spray Characteristics of Pressure Swirl and Hybrid Air Blast Fuel Injectors. Major Professor: Dr. Paul E. Sojka, School of Mechanical Engineering Spray {{performance}} of pressure swirl and hybrid air blast fuel injectors {{are central to}} combustion stability, combustor heat management, and pollutant formation in aviation gas turbine engines. Next generation aviation gas turbine engines will optimize spray atomization characteristics of the fuel injector {{in order to achieve}} engine efficiency and emissions requirements. Fuel injector spray atomization performance is affected by the type of fuel injector, fuel liquid properties, fuel injection pressure, fuel injection temperature, and ambient pressure. Performance of pressure swirl atomizer and hybrid air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle</b> type fuel injectors are compared in this study. Aviation jet fuels, JP- 8, Jet A, JP- 5, and JP- 10 and their effect on fuel injector performance is investigated. Fuel injector set conditions involving fuel injector pressure, fuel temperature and ambient pressure are varied in order to compare each fuel type. One objective of this thesis is to contribute spray patternation measurements to the body of existing drop size data in the literature. Fuel droplet size tends to increase with decreasing fuel injection pressure, decreasing fuel injection temperature and increasing ambient injection pressure. The differences between fuel types at particular set conditions occur due to differences in liquid properties between fuels. Liquid viscosity and surface tension are identified to be fuel-specific properties that affect the drop size of the fuel. An open aspect of current research that this paper addresses is how much the type of aviation jet fuel affects spray atomization characteristics. Conventional aviation fuel specifications are becoming more important with new interest in alternative fuels. Optical patternation data and line of sight laser diffraction data show that there is significant difference between jet fuels. Particularly at low fuel injection pressures (0. 345 MPa) and cold temperatures (- 40 C), the patternation data shows that the total surface area in the spray at 38. 1 mm from the pressure swirl injector for the JP- 10 fuel type is one-sixth the amount of the JP- 8. Finally, this study compares the atomizer {{performance of}} a pressure swirl nozzle to a hybrid air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle.</b> The total surface area for both the hybrid air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the pressure swirl nozzle show a similar decline in atomization performance at low fuel injection pressures and cold temperatures. However, the optical patternator radial profile data and the line of sight laser diffraction data show that the droplet size and spray distribution data are less affected by injection conditions and fuel type in the hybrid air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle,</b> than they are in the pressure swirl nozzle. One explanation is that the aerodynamic forces associated with the swirler on the hybrid air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle</b> control the distribution droplets in the spray. This is in contrast to the pressure swirl nozzle droplet distribution that is controlled by internal geometry and droplet ballistics. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this test is to confirm that CO{sub 2 } blasting is capable of effectively removing smearable contamination from the external surface of the Immobilized Low Activity Waste(ILAW) stainless steel container after glass pouring. The smearable contamination level limits specified in the approved test specification are: (1) 367 Bq/m{sup 2 } (220 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 }) alpha and 3670 Bq/m{sup 2 } (2202 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 }) beta-gamma (qualification limits); and (2) 100 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } alpha and 1000 dpm/ 100 cm{sup 2 } beta-gamma (design limits). The removal of smearable contamination from radioactively contaminated coupon was demonstrated by varying the following operating parameters: Nozzle standoff distance; Blast air pressure; Pellet rate; and Nozzle travel speed.

40|$|Recent DOE-OHVT {{studies show}} that diesel {{emissions}} and fuel consumption can be greatly reduced at truck stops by switching from engine idle to auxiliary-fired heaters. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has studied high performance diesel burner designs that address the shortcomings of current low fire-rate burners. Initial test results suggest a real opportunity {{for the development of}} a truly advanced truck heating system. The BNL approach is to use a low pressure, air-atomized burner derived form burner designs used commonly in gas turbine combustors. This paper reviews the design and test results of the BNL diesel fueled cabin heater. The burner design is covered by U. S. Patent 6, 102, 687 and was issued to U. S. DOE on August 15, 2000. The development of several novel oil burner applications based on low-pressure air atomization is described. The atomizer used is a pre-filming, air <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle</b> of the type commonly used in gas turbine combustion. The air pressure used can b e as low as 1300 Pa and such pressure can be easily achieved with a fan. Advantages over conventional, pressure-atomized nozzles include ability to operate at low input rates without very small passages and much lower fuel pressure requirements. At very low firing rates the small passage sizes in pressure swirl nozzles lead to poor reliability and this factor has practically constrained these burners to firing rates over 14 kW. Air atomization can be used very effectively at low firing rates to overcome this concern. However, many air atomizer designs require pressures that can be achieved only with a compressor, greatly complicating the burner package and increasing cost. The work described in this paper has been aimed at the practical adaptation of low-pressure air atomization to low input oil burners. The objective of this work is the development of burners that can achieve the benefits of air atomization with air pressures practically achievable with a simple burner fan...|$|E
40|$|Blast wave induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (bTBI) is a modality of injury that has come into prominence at the current time due to {{the large number of}} military and civilian personnel who have experienced the localized shock wave produced by explosive devices. The shock wave will travel concentrically outward from the explosive center, being absorbed and transmitted thru soft objects, such as tissue, and reflecting off stationary obstructions. Transmission and absorption in tissues can result in a number of physiological measureable injuries, the most common of which being what is frequently called “blast lung”. Blast lung involves the spalling effect at air-tissue interfaces. Another documented effect involves the asynchronous motion of tissue, particularly in the cranium, as the shock wave passes by. This predominately manifests itself in what is believed to be diffuse axonal injury and initiation of secondary injury mechanism. 	This study is designed to explore the relationship between shock waves and bTBI. A blast device was constructed for generating a free field shock wave through the high pressure rupture of a polycarbonate membrane. Air pressure in a small chamber is increased to a value several orders of magnitude greater than ambient air pressure and is held in place with the polycarbonate member. At the rupture of this membrane a shock wave is created. Measurements of this blast event, carried out with a piezoelectric pressure transducer, have shown that this shock wave is reproducible for the different membrane materials tested and is symmetrical with respect to the central axis of the high pressure chamber and exit nozzle. Having characterized the shock wave properties in the blast field, a location was chosen at which maximum shock wave pressure could be applied to the cranium for inducing bTBI. 	Experiments involving blast wave exposure were performed on two separate groups of animals in an attempt at establishing injury. One group was placed at a fixed distance directly below the <b>blast</b> <b>nozzle,</b> thereby experiencing both the shock wave and the associated air blast from the residual air in the chamber, and one placed at a defined distance off-axis to avoid the air blast, yet receiving two sequential blast exposures. All animal studies were approved by the VCU Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 	The degree of injury was then assessed with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS). Image Data was acquired on a 2. 4 Tesla magnet for assessing changes in either the total percent water concentration or the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of selected regions of interest in the brain of rats. Localized proton spectroscopic data was acquired from a voxel placed centrally in the brain. The baseline values of these parameters were established before the induction of bTBI. After the blast exposure, the animals were followed up with MRI and MRS at defined intervals over a period of one week. 	The first group of animals received blast exposure directly underneath the blast device nozzle and the MR data does suggest changes in some of the measureable parameters from baseline following blast exposure. This blast wave data though is confounded with additional and undesirable characteristics of the blast wave. The second group of animals that received a pure shock wave blast exposure revealed no remarkable changes in the MR data pre- to post- blast exposure. The percent water concentration, ADC and spectroscopic parameters were for statistical purposes identical before and after the blast. The resolution of this negative result will require reconsideration of the free field blast exposure concept...|$|E

In particular, it will be shown that the solvent composition affects the crystallographic orientation of the deposited films, {{as well as their}} roughness and electrical properties. Using water leads to higher resistive films than methanol. The choice of precursor salts also has an effect on the electrical properties, as using organic precursors leads to lower resistivity films. In both cases post-annealing helps to reduce the overall resistivity of the films. The reduction in resistivity will change depending on the initial deposition condition of the films, with lower values observed for films deposited at lower temperature.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. In {{the last}} few years a new method for surface {{preparation}} has evolved, namely thermo-abrasive blasting. This technique utilises a high enthalpy thermal jet to propel abrasive particles. The thermo-abrasive blasting gun, also called a thermal gun, is based on the principles of High Velocity Air Fuel (HVAF) processes. Nozzles used for thermo-abrasive blasting are subjected to thermal loading, wear and mechanical stresses. Therefore, the nozzle geometry and materials are critical for reliable performance of a thermo-abrasive system. In this investigation, the thermal stresses developed in the nozzle materials for thermo-abrasive blasting were analysed. The analytical and the computational models of the thermo-abrasive gun and the nozzle were developed. The computational fluid dynamics, thermal and structural finite element analyses have been employed in this study. The nozzle materials investigated were tungsten carbide, hot pressed silicon carbide, nitride-bonded cast silicon carbide and SIALON. The simulation and experimental results show that the highest thermal stresses occur during the first two minutes {{from the start of the}} thermal gun. However, thermal stresses are also high after the system is shut off. The nozzle geometry was optimised, which provided high cleaning rates with evidence of improved thermal loading, based on the experimental results.

It is also concluded that the computation fluid dynamic and the finite element technique can be used to optimise the design of thermo-abrasive <b>blasting</b> <b>nozzles.</b> Doctora...|$|R

40|$|Pulse {{detonation}} rocket engines (PDREs) {{have generated}} research interest {{in recent years}} as a chemical propulsion system potentially offering improved performance and reduced complexity compared to conventional rocket engines. The detonative mode of combustion employed by these devices offers a thermodynamic advantage over the constant-pressure deflagrative combustion mode used in conventional rocket engines and gas turbines. However, while this theoretical advantage has spurred considerable interest in building PDRE devices, the unsteady blowdown process intrinsic to the PDRE has made realistic estimates of the actual propulsive performance problematic. The recent review article by Kailasanath highlights some of the progress that has been made in comparing the available experimental measurements with analytical and numerical models. In recent work by the author, a quasi-one-dimensional, finite rate chemistry CFD model was utilized to study the gasdynamics and performance characteristics of PDREs over a range of blowdown pressure ratios from 1 - 1000. Models of this type are computationally inexpensive, and enable first-order parametric studies of the effect of several nozzle and extension geometries on PDRE performance over a wide range of conditions. However, the quasi-one-dimensional approach is limited in that it cannot properly capture the multidimensional blast wave and flow expansion downstream of the PDRE, nor can it resolve nozzle flow separation if present. Moreover, the previous work was limited to single-pulse calculations. In this paper, an axisymmetric finite rate chemistry model is described and utilized to study these issues in greater detail.
