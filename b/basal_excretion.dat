This study attempted to demonstrate {{the value of this}} system in the investigation of metabolite patterns in urine in two metabolic problems of prematurity, transient tyrosinemia and late metabolic acidosis. Serial 24 -hr urine specimens were analyzed in 9 infants. Transient tyrosinemia, characterized by 5 - 10 -fold increases over <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of tyrosine, p-hydroxyphenyllactate, and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate in urine, was noted in five of the infants.

40|$|Ascorbic acid {{levels in}} plasma and leucocytes and urinary {{excretion}} of tyrosyl derivatives (TD) were determined in 11 normal, 18 preterm, and 4 small-for-dates infants. Concentrations of ascorbic acid in both plasma and leucocytes {{were found to}} be similar in the 3 groups. There was no difference in the basal levels of TD between normal and small-for-dates infants, but preterms showed higher <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of TD than the other two groups. After protein load the excretion of TD was higher than the basal level in preterms. It was concluded that the altered metabolism of tyrosine observed in preterms is not the result of poor ascorbic acid status; and that tyrosine metabolism is influenced by the period of gestation rather than the body weight of the infant...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{clinical}} and biochemical {{outcome of a}} liver transplantation in a seven-year-old boy with acute porphyria due to aminolaevulinate dehydratase deficiency is described. Before transplantation standard liver function tests were normal and the rationale for transplantation was that the new liver would reduce the metabolic disturbance and thus avert the porphyric symptoms. During {{the year after the}} transplantation, the functioning of the new liver has been excellent. <b>Basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of porphyrin and porphyrin precursors has remained unchanged but, with the new liver transplant the patient has been able to withstand several porphyrinogenic challenges without increasing the excretion. Episodes of neurological and respiratory crises may have been due to persistent porphyric vulnerability. Alternatively, two early attacks may have been caused by neurotoxic effects of cyclosporin in combination with the existing damage to nervous tissue...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the relationship between}} prechemotherapy cortisol and 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) excretion and chemotherapy-induced emesis. The urinary excretion of cortisol and the serotonin metabolite 5 -HIAA in the night before chemotherapy administration were measured in 28 and 49 female patients receiving > 300 mg m- 2 carboplatin. Vomiting and nausea were documented over a 3 day observation period. Lower <b>basal</b> cortisol <b>excretion</b> was significantly correlated with vomiting with or without nausea occurring within the observation period. 5 -HIAA showed only a weak correlation with emesis on days 1 - 3, but low 5 -HIAA excretion was correlated with {{a higher proportion of}} patients vomiting on days 2 - 3 following chemotherapy. Low <b>basal</b> cortisol <b>excretion</b> might be useful as a predictor for chemotherapy-induced emesis and therefore should be evaluated prospectively in future studies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hydrogen breath {{tests are}} widely used in {{clinical}} practice. For a correct evaluation of data, low <b>basal</b> H 2 <b>excretion</b> is required, thus, 12 -hour fasting is usually prescribed. An additional reduction in the intake of complex carbohydrates in the preceding 24 h is suggested in some centers. The issue, however, has never been directly investigated. Aim: The aim {{of the present study}} was to analyze the effect of the pretest diet on the <b>basal</b> H 2 <b>excretion</b> and the number of subjects excluded from the test due to high <b>basal</b> H 2 <b>excretion.</b> Methods: Two cohorts of 500 consecutive patients undergoing a lactose tolerance test in the years 19971998 (when 12 -hour fasting was required) and in 2007 - 2008 (when a low-carbohydrate diet in the preceding 24 h was also prescribed) were retrospectively reviewed. Results: The mean <b>basal</b> H 2 <b>excretion</b> was significantly lower (p < 0. 0001) in the low-carbohydrate diet group (2. 46 +/- 6. 8 vs. 4. 73 +/- 3. 3 ppm). In 1997 - 1998, 46 / 500 patients (9. 2 %) were excluded from the test due to basal H 2 values as compared to 7 / 500 (1. 4 %) in the period 2007 - 2008. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to provide objective data on the advantage offered by reducing the intake of complex carbohydrates before H 2 breath tests.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that urinary {{excretion}} of ADH {{can be detected}} readily and quantitated accurately. The ADH excretion in normal subjects is inhibited following the administration of a water load and stimulated following water deprivation. It appears that measurement of ADH excretion in man provides a means of quantitating alterations in neurohypophyseal ADH secretion. By determining not only the <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of ADH but also the response to such physiological influences as water loading and dehydration, it becomes possible to study the dynamics of ADH release.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{platelet}} inhibitory effect of {{high doses of}} fish oils and relate it to alterations in eicosanoid synthesis, we used a canine model in which coronary thrombosis, the time to reperfusion induced by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), {{and the rate of}} spontaneous reocclusion are sensitive to platelet inhibition. In the animals fed fish oil, the time to rt-PA induced thrombolysis was accelerated (mean, 63 vs. 27 minutes;p< 0. 003). The time to thrombotic occlusion and the rate of reocclusion were unaltered. The ratio of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) to arachidonic acid rose in platelet and endothelial cell membranes, whereas serum thromboxane (Tx) B levels fell a mean 86 %, and <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of 2, 3 -dinor-TxB 2 (TxA 2 -M) declined. Basal prostaglandin (PG) 12 formation was unaltered, whereas biosynthesis of EPA-derived TxA 3 and PGI 3 increased. In control animals, TxA 2 formation increased during thrombosis; there was a further, more marked rise during reperfusion. PGI 2 formation also increased, probably as a response to platelet-vascular interactions. Stimulated production of both eicosanoids was strikingly suppressed in the animals fed fish oil. Fish oils significantly enhance the efficacy of rt-PA in vivo, albeit to a modest extent.

Parathyroid hormone caused a marked increase in excretion of 3 ′, 5 ′-AMP in all subjects except those with pseudohypoparathyroidism; nine patients with this disorder {{did not respond to}} the hormone and four showed a markedly deficient response. Radioimmunoassay showed that parathyroid hormone circulated in increased amounts in plasma from patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism and became undetectable when serum calcium was increased above 12 mg/ 100 ml. Suppression of parathyroid hormone secretion by induction of hypercalcemia did not alter the deficient response to exogenous hormone. The results indicate that: (a) parathyroid hormone circulates in abnormally high concentrations in pseudohypoparathyroidism and secretion of the hormone responds normally to physiological control by calcium; (b) testing urinary excretion of 3 ′, 5 ′-AMP in response to infusion of purified parathyroid hormone appears to be an accurate and sensitive index for establishing the diagnosis of pseudohypoparathyroidism; and (c) the metabolic defect of the disorder can be accounted for by a lack of or defective form of parathyroid hormone-sensitive adenyl cyclase in bone and kidney...|$|E
40|$|Three cattle {{calves and}} three buffalo calves were weaned after {{receiving}} colostrum and reared by bottle feeding of milk. During {{the first month}} the animals did {{not have access to}} solid food. Urinary purine derivatives (PD), <b>basal</b> PD <b>excretion</b> and glomerular filtrate rate (GFR) were determined. After one month the animals were given access to solid feed (urea-treated rice straw) to stimulate rumen development. After three months of age, during which time the solid food was given, urinary PD, <b>basal</b> PD <b>excretion</b> and GFR were again determined. Urinary PD excretion, both during fasting and milk feeding, was not different between buffaloes and cattle in the milk feeding period, but there were differences between cattle and buffaloes after 3 months of age and two months of access to solid feed. The GFR was lower in buffaloes in both milk fed and solid fed calves, while the excretion of PD in the milk feeding period was similar between the two species. It is concluded that the lower GFR in buffaloes is a condition allowing PD to stay longer in the blood thus there is more time for recycling to the rumen and to be metabolized by bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Renal sodium {{handling}} was {{studied in}} 23 children at three {{different stages of}} the minimal change nephrotic syndrome [...] the oedema forming state, proteinuric steady state, and remission. Clearances of inulin and para-aminohippuric acid and urinary sodium excretion were determined basally, after intravenous infusion of isotonic saline and hyperoncotic albumin, and after furosemide injection. Absolute and fractional <b>basal</b> sodium <b>excretion</b> were significantly lower in oedema forming patients than in proteinuric patients in steady state, and non-proteinuric patients. In contrast to proteinuric patients in steady state and non-proteinuric patients, the oedema forming patients {{failed to respond to}} isotonic saline infusion with increased sodium excretion. After diuretic blockade with furosemide, the fractional sodium excretion of the oedema forming patients increased to values no {{different from those of the}} non-proteinuric patients, whereas the fractional sodium excretion of the steady state patients increased to significantly higher values. The plasma aldosterone concentration was within normal limits in 11 of 14 proteinuric patients, and did not correlate with the <b>basal</b> sodium <b>excretion.</b> Thus, sodium retention in the minimal change nephrotic syndrome was found only in oedema forming patients, and since this is not related to the plasma aldosterone concentration it may be caused by an intrarenal mechanism, probably sited in distal parts of the nephron...|$|R
40|$|Role of {{glucocorticoid}} in excretion of {{an acute}} potassium load {{in patients with}} Addison's disease and panhypopituitarism. Glucocorticoid (GC) {{has been shown to}} stimulate potassium (K) excretion in various conditions, but it is still incompletely resolved whether its presence is essential for the normal K homeostasis. We addressed this question in patients with selective GC deficiency (panhypopituitarism) and with combined GC and mineralocorticoid deficiency (Addison's disease), studied 24 hours after withdrawal of their regular substitution therapy. Compared to data in healthy subjects, both <b>basal</b> K <b>excretion</b> and the kaliuresis after a KCl load (1 mmol/kg body wt orally) were impaired in either patient group (P < 0. 05). Physiological Cortisol supplementation (20 mg 3 hr prior to test, and 1 mg/hr during test) increased <b>basal</b> K <b>excretion</b> (from 10. 6 ± 1. 8 to 19. 2 ± 1. 9 mmol/ 5 hr, P < 0. 01) and KCl stimulated kaliuresis (from 47. 9 ± 6. 1 to 54. 8 ± 4. 7 mmol/ 5 hr, P = 0. 06) to normal levels in panhypopituitarism. Cortisol also improved <b>basal</b> K <b>excretion</b> (from 10. 2 ± 1. 5 to 16. 9 ± 3. 5 mmol/ 5 hr, P < 0. 05) and KCl-stimulated K excretion (from 31. 6 ± 2. 5 to 45. 2 ± 3. 8 mmol/ 5 hr, P < 0. 05) in Addison's disease, although KCl-stimulated K excretion remained below normal (P < 0. 01). The effects of Cortisol on sodium excretion differed between the two patient groups (P < 0. 05) in that only in Addison's disease the improved K excretion was associated with sodium retention. Additional experiments with the purely GC compound dexamethasone (0. 5 mg 3 hr prior to test, and 0. 03 mg/hr during test) in the patients with Addison's disease also improved K excretion (P < 0. 05), but without the concomitant sodium retention observed after Cortisol. These data speak for a physiological role of GC in potassium homeostasis, and also suggest that Cortisol, as the important endogenous GC hormone, has mineralocorticoid-like effects specifically in the absence of aldosterone...|$|R

EPA and docosahexaenoic acid {{were incorporated into}} the total phospholipids of plasma, platelets, and erythrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. During omega- 3 fatty acid ingestion serum triacylglycerols were lowered and platelet aggregation upon low doses of collagen was reduced. Concomitantly, formation and excretion of prostanoids showed a characteristic change. As measured in serum from whole clotted blood, thromboxane A 3 was formed in small amounts, whereas thromboxane A 2 formation was reduced to 50 % of control values. Excretion of the main urinary thromboxane A metabolites was unaltered in subjects with low <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> rates, but decreased markedly in two subjects with high control values. As determined from the main urinary metabolite, prostaglandin I 3 was formed from EPA at rates up to 50 % of unaltered prostaglandin I 2 formation. The biochemical and functional changes observed lasted for the entire supplementation period of 5 mo and were reversible within 12 wk after cessation of cod liver oil intake. Favorable changes induced by long-chain omega- 3 fatty acids include a dose-related and sustained shift of the prostaglandin I/thromboxane A balance to a more antiaggregatory and vasodilatory state...|$|E

The metabolism and synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes by the isolated perfused pig kidney has been investigated. Kidneys were maintained {{for up to}} six hours in a recirculating perfusion system by using an oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing albumin and the perfluorinated oxygen carrier, FC- 43. Perfusion pressure was maintained at 12 - 13. 5 kPa, with perfusion flow rates of 150 - 250 ml/min resulting in a urine output of between 20 - 180 ml/hr. Infusion of 3 H-LTC 4 into the renal artery resulted in rapid and complete metabolism, with the major urinary metabolites comprising LTE 4, ω-hydroxy-LTE 4, ω-carboxy-LTE 4 and N-acetyl-ω-hydroxy-LTE 4. The capacity of the isolated kidney to synthesize cysteinyl leukotrienes was monitored by measuring urinary LTE 4 excretion; there was a basal urinary excretion of LTE 4 (median 43 pg/min, range 8 - 470 pg/min). Neither lipopolysaccharide or human recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha had any effect on <b>basal</b> <b>excretion.</b> Treatment with the calcium ionophore A 23187, however, resulted in a 38. 1 ± 9. 6 -fold increase in urinary LTE 4 excretion.

Previous studies characterized the main components of the disease: dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, 3 -methylglutaconic aciduria and diminished statural growth. Respiratory chain impairments have been found in several studies, without pinpointing a single enzyme complex. 3 -Methylglutaconic aciduria is shared with several other disorders that affect the respiratory chain. Previous studies excluded a block in the major pathway of leucine catabolism. We performed leucine loading, accompanied by fasting, in patients and observed a significant rise of 3 -methylglutaconic acid and 3 -methylglutaric acid. Taken together with the absence of an enzymatic block in the major leucine catabolic route, the possibility remains that the increased <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of 3 -methylglutaconic acid and other products of branched-chain amino acids is the result of overload of this pathway or [...] more likely [...] mitochondrial leakage. Linkage studies have localized the gene to the Xq 28 region. The associated tafazzin gene (TAZ), has been fully characterized recently, and mutations located in conserved regions have been reported. Carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis have now become possible through mutation analysis.

40|$|Interest {{in the in}} vivo {{biological}} {{activities of}} olive oil phenolics is rapidly growing, and different models and vehicles of administration are used worldwide. Matters of practicality determine the use of rats rather than humans as the model of choice. Also, growing interest in nutraceuticals is leading to the formulation of compounds containing olive oil phenols. In this study, we compared metabolism and urinary excretion of hydroxytyrosol [(HT); the most representative phenol of olive oil] between rats and humans by evaluating excretion of HT and its major metabolite, homovanillyl alcohol. Also, we compared human excretion of HT when consumed as a natural component of extra virgin olive oil, when added to refined olive oil, or when added to yogurt (as an approximation of functional food). Urinary excretion of HT was greater in humans than in rats, a species with a high <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of HT and its metabolites. The high (234 % of HT administered) excretion of free HT suggests that hydrolysis of oleuropein administered in humans (still an unresolved issue) occurs in vivo. Moreover, human HT excretion was much higher after its administration as a natural component of olive oil (44. 2 % of HT administered) than after its addition to refined olive oil (23 % of HT administered) or yogurt (5. 8 % of dose or similar to 13 % of that recorded after virgin olive oil intake).

40|$|Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) {{occurs in}} the {{majority}} of asthmatics following vigorous exercise. EIB is caused by a loss of water from the airways creating a hyperosmolar environment in the tissue that in turn triggers the release of bronchoconstrictive mediators. These bronchoconstrictive mediators, including histamine, cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and prostaglandins, act at their respective receptors on the airway smooth muscle to induce bronchoconstriction. Because the mechanism of EIB involves drying of the airways, provocations mimicking this drying, such as eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea (EVH) and mannitol inhalation can be used to study EIB. With repeated challenge, a smaller response is observed following the second challenge and this decreased responsiveness is called refractoriness. Defining the mechanism of refractoriness may lead to new treatments for asthma. In this thesis a range of airway challenges were performed to study the urinary excretion of mediators released in the lung following EIB and the effect of different interventions. Furthermore, urinary mediator excretion during refractoriness was also studied. For the first time we demonstrated urinary excretion of CysLT and Prostaglandin D 2 metabolites after EVH. Mediator release was no different in subjects who did not experience bronchoconstriction following EVH compared to those who did react with bronchoconstriction. This indicates that a necessity of EIB is for the airways {{to be sensitive to the}} mediators released. Pre-treatment with the mast cell stabilising drug sodium cromoglycate (SCG) inhibited the airway response to EVH, and the inhibition was accompanied by a decreased release of mediators into the urine. The same effects were observed following pre-treatment with a single high dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Pre-treatment with fish oil, rich in omega- 3 fatty acids, had no effect on the <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> of urinary mediators, or airway responsiveness to mannitol challenge. We also report the novel finding of refractoriness following repeated mannitol challenge. Mast cell mediators were excreted into the urine to the same extent after both the first challenge and the repeated challenge 90 min later. Also, those that were most refractory displayed the highest mediator release. This contradicts depletion of mediator release at the time of the second challenge as being the mechanism of refractoriness. These findings were then replicated by repeated EVH challenge. We also demonstrate for the first time an extended spectrum of urinary mediators excreted following EVH. Increased levels of the bronchoprotective mediators PGE 2 and PGI 2 were seen, which supports the release of protective prostaglandins as being a mechanism of refractoriness. In summary, this thesis provides evidence that the mechanism of refractoriness does not involve mediator depletion. Rather, it indicates that there is a decreased sensitivity at the level of the airway smooth muscle to the mediators released. The induction of this decreased sensitivity may include the release of PGE 2 and PGI 2, which are likely to mediate protective responses...|$|E
40|$|Clinical studies {{conducted}} since the 1970 s by the pediatric diabetology {{group of the}} Free University of Brussels have demonstrated that screening for subclinical retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy should be started at puberty and at least 3 years after the diabetes diagnosis {{with the goal of}} detecting early abnormalities responsible for subclinical disorders that can be reversed by improved metabolic control, thus preventing the occurrence of irreversible potentially incapacitating lesions. A 1974 retinal fluorescein angiography study showed that the development of microaneurysms, which are irreversible lesions, could be preceded by fluorescein leakage due to disruption of the blood-retinal barrier. Risk factors for early retinopathy include: duration of diabetes, age at diagnosis (with younger children having longer times to retinopathy), puberty and sex (with onset one year earlier in girls than in boys), long-term bad metabolic control over several years, high cholesterol levels and excessive body mass index (2002). On the other hand, rapid improvement of diabetic control may worsen diabetic retinopathy (1985). Minimal EEG abnormalities were found in relationship with frequent and severe hypoglycemic comas and/or convulsions, and retinopathy (1979). Desynchronization of action potentials in distal nerve fibers preceded conduction velocity slowing (1981). A single high glycated hemoglobin value was associated with peroneal motor nerve conduction slowing (1985), which was not observed in the femoral nerve (1987). Sympathetic skin response (1996) and statistical analysis of heart rate variability (2001) could have some interest for the diagnosis of early diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Early microproteinuria is of mixed origin, being both glomerular (microalbumin) and tubular (beta 2 -microglobulin). Exercise testing to exhaustion did not provide additional information than the <b>basal</b> <b>excretion</b> (1976). Microtransferrinuria (1984) and urinary acid glycosaminoglycans output (2001) could also be predictive markers of glomerular dysfunction. Physical training reduced exercise-related proteinuria by half (1988). High levels of serum lipoprotein (a) were not associated with the presence of subclinical complications (1996). On the other hand, ultra sensitive C-reactive protein could be an interesting indicator for the risk of developing early complications (2005). Poor metabolic control was associated with higher levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (1990). Decreased gluthatione peroxidase, gluthatione reductase, and of vitamin C levels, denoting moderate oxidative stress, were found (1996), although {{there was no evidence of}} increased LDL cholesterol peroxidation (1998). Erythrocytes exhibited increased glycolytic activity, and neutrophils decreased migration, in relationship with metabolic control (1992). The degree of metabolic control influenced serum triiodothyronine levels (1985), magnesium concentrations (1999). Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication are not related to HbA 1 c levels (2007). Insulin therapy could activate the complement pathway if intermediate and long-acting insulin preparations without protamine sulphate are used (1992), and provoke higher BMI in adolescents on 4 insulin injections (1988). Well-being was inversely related to glycated hemoglobin levels (1997). Family cohesiveness and parental alexithymia predict glycemic control (2008). Alexithymia factor explains 11. 5 % of the HbA 1 c total variance (2010). SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|Low-grade {{metabolic}} acidosis, consecutive {{to excessive}} catabolism of sulfur amino acids {{and a high}} dietary Na:K ratio, is a common feature of Western food habits. This metabolic alteration may exert various adverse physiological effects, especially on bone, muscle and kidneys. To assess the actual effects of various K salts, {{a model of the}} Westernised diet has been developed in rats: slight protein excess (20 % casein); cations provided as non-alkalinising salts; high Na:K ratio. This diet resulted in acidic urine (pH 5 · 5) together with a high rate of divalent cation excretion in urine, especially Mg. Compared with controls, K supplementation as KCl accentuated Ca excretion, whereas potassium bicarbonate or malate reduced Mg and Ca excretion and alkalinised urine pH (up to 8). In parallel, citraturia was strongly increased, together with 2 -ketoglutarate excretion, by potassium bicarbonate or malate in the diet. <b>Basal</b> sulfate <b>excretion,</b> in the range of 1 mmol/d, was slightly enhanced in rats fed the potassium malate diet. The present model of low-grade metabolic acidosis indicates that potassium malate may be as effective as KHCO 3 to counteract urine acidification, to limit divalent cation excretion and to ensure high citrate concentration in urine...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the in vivo state of both branches of the autonomic nervous system in children with chronic atopic dermatitis. In 15 patients, age 4 to 11, the following parameters were analyzed: (1) basal plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine; (2) poststimulation (standing and i. v. furosemide administration); (3) <b>basal</b> urinary <b>excretion</b> of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and vainillin mandelic acid; (4) 30 min postfurosemide administration; (5) parotid secretory response to intraoral 0. 1 M citric acid: flow rate, saliva pH, and concentrations of bicarbonate, chlorides, inorganic phosphates, total protein, and amylase activity. No differences in plasma and urinary basal levels of the catecholamines were observed. In response to standing, plasma norepinephrine from atopic children showed a greater increase than that seen in normal healthy children. From the salivary factors studied, no differences were found in parotid flow-rate, bicarbonates, chlorides, and inorganic phosphates. Protein concentration as well as amylase activity were significantly decreased in children with atopic dermatitis. These findings suggest that in atopic dermatitis, the β-sympathetic mediated responses are impaired; on the other hand, parasympathetic mediated responses remain preserved...|$|R

40|$|The natriuretic {{response}} was studied in anesthetized rats daring the intravenous infusion of L-arginine analogues to inhibit {{the production of}} endothelium-derived nitric oxide. In an initial experimental series, rats were administered saline vehicle or vehicle containing 300 /xmol/kg body wt /V"-monomethyl-L-arginine, W"-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, W-monomethyl-D-arginine, or L-arginine. Infusion of the competitive inhibitors jV"-monomethyl-L-arginine and JV-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester significantly increased mean arterial pressure to 155 ± 3 and 145 ± 5 nun Hg, respectively, compared with a mean arterial pressure of 118 ± 3 mm Hg determined in the vehicle control group. Sodium excretion averaged 3. 27 ± 1. 08 and 2. 52 ± 0. 78 /teq/min in the JV"-monomethyl-L-arginine- and /V"-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester-treated rats, respectively, and each {{was significantly higher than}} the <b>basal</b> sodium <b>excretion</b> of 0. 20 ± 0. 05 fieqlmin in the vehicle-treated control animals.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a 21 {{infusion}} of isotonic sodium chloride on renal haemodynamics and sodium excretion were measured in nine normotensive volunteers. Changes in these responses to volume expansion induced by cardioselective beta-adrenoceptor blockade by drugs with (epanolol) and without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (atenolol) were examined. Renal plasma flow was significantly lower before, during and after sodium chloride infusion whilst on treatment with atenolol compared with epanolol. Urinary sodium excretion was lower on atenolol than epanolol. Glomerular filtration rate was unchanged by either drug. <b>Basal</b> urinary kallikrein <b>excretion</b> was diminished by atenolol and both epanolol and atenolol inhibited the rise in urinary kallikrein excretion after sodium chloride infusion.

We propose that regular intake of a prebiotic, oligofructose (OF). {{might help to}} improve the altered gastrointestinal (GI) permeability observed in burn patients. A randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial {{was carried out in}} 41 burn patients (mean burn surface area = 17. 1 +/- 8. 2 %) who ingested daily 6 g of oligofructose (OF group) or sucrose as placebo (Control group) during 15 days. Gastrointestinal permeability to sucrose and lactulose/mannitol (L/M) was evaluated on days 1 (before treatment) 3. 7. 14 and 21. A permeability test was also performed in 18 healthy subjects as controls. Thirty-one patients completed the protocol (dropout rate = 24. 4 %). Healthy subjects had a <b>basal</b> sucrose <b>excretion</b> of 21. 3 mg (14. 0 - 32. 5 mg) and a basal L/M ratio of 0. 017 % (0. 009 - 0. 022 %).

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant attenuates the neuropeptide-Y-induced diuresis and natriuresis in anaesthetized rats (Am J Physiol 275 :F 502 -F 509, 1998). Therefore, we have now determined whether bradykinin mimics tubular responses to neuropeptide Y in acutely pentobarbital-anaesthetized rats. Infusion of the neuropeptide Y receptor agonist peptide YY (2 micrograms kg- 1 min- 1) enhanced diuresis and natriuresis approximately equal to 2 - and 4 -fold, respectively, but did not increase urinary bradykinin excretion. Intrarenal infusion of bradykinin (100 ng kg- 1 min- 1) reduced renal blood flow by approximately equal to 12 % and this was abolished by concomitant administration of icatibant (200 ng kg- 1 min- 1). However, intrarenal bradykinin infusion did not affect creatinine clearance, urine flow rate or sodium <b>excretion</b> (<b>basal</b> values: 0. 8 ml min- 1, 111 microliters/ 15 min and 7. 7 mumol/ 15 min, respectively).

40|$|Compared {{with young}} adults, older adults have {{significantly}} impaired capacities to resist oxidative damage {{when faced with}} acute stress such as ischemia/reperfusion. This impairment likely contributes to increased morbidity and mortality in older adults in response to acute trauma, infections, and the susceptibility to diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Consumption of foods high in polyphenols, particularly anthocyanins, {{have been associated with}} improved health, but the mechanisms contributing to these salutary effects remain to be fully established. This study tested the hypothesis that consumption of tart cherry juice containing high levels of anthocyanins improves the capacity of older adults to resist oxidative damage during acute oxidative stress. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 12 volunteers [6 men and 6 women; age 69 ± 4 y (61 – 75 y) ] consumed in random order either tart cherry juice or placebo (240 mL twice daily for 14 d) separated by a 4 -wk washout period. The capacity to resist oxidative damage was measured as the changes in plasma F 2 -isoprostane levels in response to forearm ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) before and after each treatment. The tart cherry juice intervention reduced the I/R-induced F 2 -isoprostane response (P < 0. 05), whereas placebo had no significant effect. The tart cherry juice intervention also reduced <b>basal</b> urinary <b>excretion</b> of oxidized nucleic acids (8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine, 8 -hydroxyguanosine) (P < 0. 05) but not urinary excretion of isoprostanes. These data suggest that consumption of tart cherry juice improves antioxidant defenses in vivo in older adults as shown by an increased capacity to constrain an oxidative challenge and reduced oxidative damage to nucleic acids...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{handling}} of urea {{in subjects with}} persistent axotemia and normal renal function. Fourteen subjects with persistent azotemia and normal glomerular filtration rate were studied by renal clearances and hormonal determinations to establish the nephron site of altered urea transport and the mechanism(s) responsible for their azotemia. During constant alimentary protein, urea nitrogen appearance was normal and urea clearance was much lower than in 10 age–matched control subjects (23. 3 ± 2. 1 ml/min and 49. 6 ± 2. 6 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2, P < 0. 001). Inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances, blood volume and plasma concentration of antidiuretic hormone were within normal limits. During maximal antidiuresis, in spite of greater urea filtered load, the urinary excretion of urea was less, and both the maximum urinary osmolality and the free–water reabsorption relative to osmolar clearance per unit of GFR were greater than in control subjects. After sustained water diuresis, the plasma urea concentration markedly decreased to near normal levels in azotemic subjects. The <b>basal</b> urinary <b>excretion</b> of prostaglandins E 2 was significantly reduced in azotemic subjects and was directly correlated with fractional urea clearance (r = 0. 857, P < 0. 001). An additional group of control subjects (N = 8) showed a marked reduction of fractional clearance of urea after inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (P < 0. 01). These data suggest that azotemia is due to increased tubular reabsorption of urea in the distal part of nephron, presumably because of increased back diffusion in the papillary collecting duct, accounting for the enhanced maximum urinary osmolality and free–water reabsorption. Renal prostaglandin E 2 may partecipate in the pathogenesis of azotemia by altering recycling of urea in the medulla...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Riboflavin {{status was}} {{assessed}} in 42 {{secondary school students}} before and after supplementing the food intake with 5 mg riboflavin daily for 7 days. Energy, protein, and riboflavin intakes were determined on foods actually consumed by each student. Riboflavin nutriture was based on urinary riboflavin excretion and erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient. The energy and riboflavin intakes {{of the students were}} 68 to 82 % and 80 to 88 %, respectively, of the recommended allowance. The <b>basal</b> urinary riboflavin <b>excretion</b> was 0. 335 mg/g creatinine and increased significantly to 3. 51 mg/g creatinine after supplementation. The basal erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient values indicated an overall prevalence of 38 % biochemical ariboflavinosis (erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient> 1. 30) and dropped significantly (p < 0. 001) from 1. 26 to 1. 08. The results confirm that urinary riboflavin is of limited value in the assessment of riboflavin status while erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient more precisely assesses metabolic availability of riboflavin and more accurately detects biochemical ariboflavinosis.
