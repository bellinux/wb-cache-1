40|$|Scripting {{languages}} like Python and Ruby allow {{rapid development}} of software, <b>but</b> <b>make</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> about the type {{safety of a}} program at compile time. While static languages like Java do make strong guarantees about the type safety of a program at compile time, they are not perceived to be as agile as their more dynamic counterparts. Is it possible to develop a statically-typed language that makes strong guarantees about type safety, but looks and acts like a scripting language?...|$|R
5000|$|In this example, the [...] {{field is}} not randomized; in {{practice}} {{it will be}} computed with a CRC generator, and the [...] field used to corrupt it to inject FCS errors. The two constraints shown are applicable to conforming Ethernet frames. Constraints may be selectively enabled; this feature would be required in the example above to generate corrupt frames. Constraints may be arbitrarily complex, involving interrelationships among variables, implications, and iteration. The SystemVerilog constraint solver is required {{to find a solution}} if one exists, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> as to the time it will require to do so.|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to use Newtons method for solving the above water equation, {{but there is a}} risk of converging to the wrong value of β; it is important to initialise the solver to a sensible initial value, such as (βmax+βmin)/2 (which is however not sufficient: Newtons method <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> on stability), or, alternatively, use a bracketing solver such as the bisection method or the Brent method, which are guaranteed to converge but can be slower.|$|R
25|$|Fate {{generally}} implies {{there is}} a set course that cannot be deviated from, and over which one has no control. Fate is related to determinism, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be fated externally (see for instance theological determinism). Destiny likewise is related to determinism, <b>but</b> <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> specific claim of physical determinism. Even with physical indeterminism an event could still be destined to occur.|$|R

25|$|Most {{categorical}} {{alcoholic beverages}} have regulations governing their classification and labelling, while those governing absinthe {{have always been}} conspicuously lacking. According to popular treatises from the 19th century, absinthe could be loosely categorised into several grades (ordinaire, demi-fine, fine, and Suisse—the latter does not denote origin), in order of increasing alcoholic strength and quality. Many contemporary absinthe critics simply classify absinthe as distilled or mixed, according to its production method. And while the former is generally considered far superior in quality to the latter, an absinthe's simple claim of being 'distilled' <b>makes</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> as {{to the quality of}} its base ingredients or the skill of its maker.|$|R
