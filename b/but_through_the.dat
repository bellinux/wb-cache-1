He was employed as one of several Consular attachés at that office, mainly doing clerical work. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, which drew the United States into World War II against Japan and Germany, Yasui resigned his position with the consulate on December 8, 1941.|$|E

On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, <b>but</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and sodomy, it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E
5|$|The motive behind Edward's {{change of}} heart could have been purely pragmatic; Montfort was in a good {{position}} to support his cause in Gascony. When the King left for France in November, Edward's behaviour turned into pure insubordination. He made several appointments to advance the cause of the reformers, causing his father to believe that his son was considering a coup d'état. When the King returned from France, he initially refused to see his son, <b>but</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mediation of the Earl of Cornwall and the Archbishop of Canterbury, the two were eventually reconciled. Edward was sent abroad, and in November 1260 he again united with the Lusignans, who had been exiled to France.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales on}} {{butterfly}} wings are pigmented with melanins {{that can produce}} the colours black and brown. The white colour in the butterfly family Pieridae is a derivative of uric acid, an excretory product. Bright blues, greens, reds and iridescence are usually created not by pigments <b>but</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> microstructure of the scales. This structural coloration {{is the result of}} coherent scattering of light by the photonic crystal nature of the scales. The specialised scales that provide structural colours to reflected light mostly produce ultra-violet patterns which are discernible {{in that part of the}} ultra-violet spectrum that lepidopteran eyes can see. The structural colour seen is often dependent upon the angle of view. For example, in Morpho cypris, the colour from the front is a bright blue but when seen from an angle changes very quickly to black.|$|E
