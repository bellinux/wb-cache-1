The presence of these materials as loose beads close to the bearing surfaces of joint replacements gives the potential for them to enter the joint becoming trapped between the articulating surfaces; the resulting damage to cobalt chrome counterfaces and the subsequent wear of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene is unknown. In this study, third-body damage to cobalt chrome counterfaces was simulated using particles of the calcium sulfate <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>fillers</b> Stimulan® (Biocomposites Ltd., Keele, UK) and Osteoset® (Wright Medical Technology, TN, USA) using a bespoke rig. Scratches on the cobalt chrome plates were quantified {{in terms of their}} density and mean lip height, and the damage caused by the <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>fillers</b> was compared to that caused by particles of SmartSet GMV PMMA bone cement (DePuy Synthes, IN, USA). The surface damage from Stimulan® was below the resolution of the analysis technique used; SmartSet GMV caused 0. 19 [*]scratches/mm with a mean lip height of 0. 03 [*]µm; Osteoset® led to a significantly higher number (1. 62 [*]scratches/mm) of scratches with a higher mean lip height (0. 04 [*]µm).

40|$|Nearly 1. 3 million total joint {{replacement}} {{procedures are}} {{performed in the}} United States annually, with numbers projected to rise exponentially in the coming decades.

Importantly, many revision surgeries, infected or not, require <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>fillers</b> to support the host bone and provide a sufficient tissue bed for new hardware placement. Antibiotic-eluting <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>fillers</b> (ABVF), providing both osteoconductive and antimicrobial properties, represent one approach for reducing rates of orthopedic device-related infections. Using a solvent-free, molten-cast process, a polymer-controlled antibiotic-eluting calcium carbonate hydroxyapatite (HAP) ceramic composite BVF (ABVF) was fabricated, characterized, and evaluated in vivo using a bacterial challenge in a rabbit radial defect window model. ABVF loaded with tobramycin eliminated the infectious burden in rabbits challenged with a clinically relevant strain of Staphylococcus aureus (inoculum as high as 10 ⁷ CFU). Histological, microbiological, and radiographic methods were used to detail the effects of ABVF on microbial challenge to host bone after 8 weeks in vivo.

The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to systematically review outcomes and complications after OWHTO with and without the use of bone void fillers.; The EMBASE, PubMedMEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar databases were searched to identify articles that reported OWHTO results using different bone void fillers until March 2016. Only articles reporting the exact <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler</b> type, the opening gap size and the fixation method were included. The extracted data included the study design, demographic data, the radiological and clinical results and complication rates. Outcomes were analysed with regard to <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler</b> type, and comparison was made between the groups (allograft, autograft, synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler</b> and OWHTO without bone void filling).; Twenty-two articles reporting the results of 1421 OWHTO met the inclusion criteria. In total, 647 osteotomies were completed with allogeneic graft as <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler,</b> 367 with synthetic materials, 199 with autograft and 208 without any bone void filling material. The maximum opening gap size was similar in all groups with mean of 9. 8  mm (range 4 - 17. 5  mm). Locking plate fixation was used in 90  % of the osteotomies that were completed without <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler,</b> while all allograft cases and more then 90  % of the autograft cases were done with non-locking systems.

In vitro tests demonstrate the significance of vaterite microspheres in the activation and promotion of 3 D skeletal tissue formation. Further in vitro experiments using functionalized microspheres with surface integrated RGD peptide activate co-cultured skeletal populations in pellets and promote secretion of extracellular matrix collagens and human osteocalcin. Specific temporal release of entrapped RNase A was successfully demonstrated using these specialized microspheres with integrated magnetic beads, which physically disrupted the inorganic macrostructure.

40|$|Purpose The bone {{regenerative}} medicine needs (i) in vitro functionally active osteoblasts, and/or (ii) the in vivo induction of the tissue. The bone tissue engineering {{seems to be}} a very promising approach for the effectiveness of orthopedic surgical procedures. Indeed, clinical applications are often hampered by the limited availability of bone allograft or substitutes. New biomaterials have been recently developed for the orthopaedic applications. The main characteristics of these scaffolds are the ability to induce the bone tissue formation by generating an appropriate environment for (i) the cell growth and (ii) recruiting precursor bone cells for the proliferation and differentiation. A new prototype of biomaterials known as “bioceramics” may own these features. Bioceramics are bone substitutes mainly composed by calcium and phosphate complex salt derivatives. Methods In this study the characteristics bioceramics bone substitutes have been tested with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) obtained from the bone marrow of adult orthopaedic patients. Results These cellular models can be employed to characterize in vitro the behavior of different biomaterials, which are used as <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>fillers</b> or three dimensional scaffolds. Conclusions The cellular model used in our study, suggests that this in vitro model is an useful tool for investigating cytocompatibility and biological features of HA-derived scaffolds...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Infected bone {{defects and}} {{osteomyelitis}} are encountered fre-quently in trauma cases. Currently, {{the standard of}} care for osteomyelitis cases is prolonged systemic antibiotic therapy and implantation of antibiotic carrier beads. However, this method requires a secondary surgery to remove the beads after the infection has cleared. In the present study a common <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler</b> was investigated {{for its ability to}} be infused with an antibiotic. This study demonstrates that the xenograft material tested can be loaded with gentamicin and release clinically relevant levels of the drug for at least 14 days in vitro allowing for the inhibition of bacterial growth on the graft. This study also demonstrates that the levels of gentamicin released did not have an adverse effect on primary osteoblast cell proliferation or ability to generate alkaline phosphatase.

Materials were placed for 4, 8, or 24 weeks in 5 -mm cortical bone defects in sheep long bones. Histological sections in a plane perpendicular to the long axis of the bone were used to measure the total repair area (original defect plus callus) and the area of bone within the total repair area. The incidence of defect union was also evaluated. At 4 and 8 weeks, defects treated with COLLOSS and COLLOSS E with or without OSSAPLAST had total repair and bone areas equivalent to autograft, and larger than OSSAPLAST-treated defects.

40|$|The current {{reference}} {{standard for the}} treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures is open reduction and internal fixation using an extended lateral approach. In the present retrospective study, we evaluated the results of a consecutive series of patients treated in the same fashion from June 2005 to September 2011 using a subcuticular single-layer closure technique. We also determined the risk factors for the development of wound complications and the rate of wound complications. Also, we assessed which patient, fracture, and surgical characteristics affected these complications. During the 75 -month study period, we operated on 53 displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures in 50 patients using the extended lateral approach. The incision was closed using the subcuticular technique in 49 cases (92. 45 %). In the subcuticular closure group 2 (4. 1 %) deep infections and 2 (4. 1 %) superficial wound complications (1 dehiscence and 1 infection) occurred. Wound edge or flap necrosis was not encountered. The use of bone-void filler and the experience of the surgical team were significantly (p <. 001 and p =. 026, respectively) associated with the occurrence of wound complications. The subcuticular single-layer suture technique is a suitable closure technique in the treatment of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures. It was associated with a low complication rate combined with the extended lateral approach.

The peak polymerization temperatures, times to achieve the peak polymerization temperature, porosities, densities, modulus and maximum compression strengths of standard (without castor oil), and modified cements were investigated following storage at ambient temperature (22 °C) or under precooling conditions (3 °C). Six specimens were tested in each group of the aforementioned parameters. Increasing castor oil content and precooling treatment effectively decreased the peak polymerization temperatures and increased the duration to achieve the peak polymerization temperature (P 0. 05) on these mechanical properties.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the physicochemical and biological properties of a newly developed calcium phosphate cement (CPC). The novel cement was compared with two other commercially available CPCs. After mixing the powder and liquid phase, the CPCs were injected as a paste into a rabbit distal femoral defect model. The CPCs were evaluated after 24 h, 6 weeks, 26 weeks, and 52 weeks. The novel CPC was easy to handle and was fast setting. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry (FTIR) at the different implantation periods showed that the cement had converted to carbonated hydroxyapatite and remained stable over time. Histological evaluation showed bone apposition on the cement surface without any inflammatory response or fibrous encapsulation.

The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} possibilities and limitations of the CPCs’ mechanical properties, and find out if these ceramic bone cements can carry application-specific loads, alone or as part of a construct. Recently developed experimental brushite and apatite cements were found to have a significantly higher strength in compression, tension and flexion compared to the commercially available CPCs chronOS™ Inject and Norian® SRS®. By using a high-resolution measurement technique the elastic moduli of the CPCs were determined and found to be at least twice as high compared to earlier measurements, and closer to cortical bone than trabecular bone. Using the same method, Poisson's ratio for pure CPCs was determined for the first time. A non-destructive porosity measurement method for wet brushite cements was developed, and subsequently used to study the porosity increase during in vitro degradation. The compressive strength of the experimental brushite cement was still higher than that of trabecular bone after 25 weeks of degradation, showing that the cement can carry high loads over a time span sufficiently long for a fracture to heal. This thesis also presents the first ever fatigue results for acidic CPCs, and confirms the importance of testing the materials under cyclic loading as the cements may fail at stress levels much lower than the material’s quasi-static compressive strength. A decrease in fatigue life was found for brushite cements containing higher amounts of monetite. Increasing porosity and testing in a physiological buffer solution (PBS), rather than air, also decreased the fatigue life. However, the experimental brushite cement had a high probability of surviving loads found in the spine when tested in PBS, which has previously never been accomplished for acidic CPCs. In conclusion, available brushite cements may be able to carry the load alone in scenarios where the cortical shell is intact, the loading is mainly compressive, and the expected maximum stress is below 10 MPa. Under such circumstances this CPC may be the preferred choice over less biocompatible and non-degradable materials...|$|R

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{reported}} the role of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) in treating fractures. In case with bone defect, fracture healing needs not only osteogenic but also osteoconductive component (scaffold). Hydroxyapatite calcium sulphate (HA-CaSO 4) being widely used as <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler,</b> may serve as scaffold for MSC. However, {{the effect of this}} scaffold to the viability of MSC has not been evaluated before. Methods: MSC were isolated from the iliac marrow of a Giant Flamish rabbit, and expanded in DMEM using histogradient density. After one week, they were sub-cultured in a 25 cc TC flask (passage 1) and have the medium replaced every 3 days. During the subculture, we embedded a HA-CaSO 4 pellet into the flask. The cells were evaluated under inverted microscope at a weekly interval. Results: At the first week, MSC are difficult to be identified in microscope due to the large number of HA-CaSO 4 crystals. By the third week however MSC have grown and the HA-CaSO 4 crystals can readily be washed off by medium replacement. By the fourth weeks, MSC can be still seen on microscope. Conclusion: HA-CaSO 4 could serve as a good scaffold due to its pellet shape and easily absorbed, thus providing revascularization which is essential for bone healing. In addition, HA-CaSO 4 does not interfere with MSC survival.

40|$|Calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPC) {{are used}} as <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler</b> in various orthopedic indications; however, there are some major drawbacks regarding mixing, transfer, and injection of traditional CPC. By using glycerol as mixing liquid, a premixed calcium phosphate cement (pCPC), some of these difficulties can be overcome. In the treatment of vertebral fractures the handling characteristics need to be excellent including a high radio-opacity for optimal control during injection. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate a radiopaque pCPC regarding its resorption behavior and biocompatibility in vivo. pCPC and a water-based CPC were injected into a Ø 4 -mm drilled femur defect in rabbits. The rabbits were sacrificed after 2 and 12 weeks. Cross sections of the defects were evaluated using histology, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical analysis. Signs of inflammation were evaluated both locally and systemically. The results showed a higher bone formation in the pCPC compared to the water-based CPC after 2 weeks by expression of RUNX- 2. After 12 weeks most of the cement had been resorbed in both groups. Both materials were considered to have a high biocompatibility since no marked immunological response was induced and extensive bone ingrowth was observed. The conclusion from the study was that pCPC with ZrO 2 radiopacifier is a promising alternative regarding bone replacement material and may be suggested for treatment of, for example, vertebral fractures based on its high biocompatibility, fast bone ingrowth, and good handling properties. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|Bone tissue {{engineering}} is currently undergoing {{a paradigm shift}} regarding the concepts used to develop cell based therapies for skeletal repair. In place of the 'trial and error' approach, researchers aim to develop cellular concepts which mirror developmental and postnatal processes. Herein we describe a model for in vivo endochondral remodeling of an in vitro derived cartilaginous intermediate and its applicability to bone engineering. In vitro differentiation of the continuous cell line, ATDC 5, in pellet culture was enhanced in medium containing ascorbic acid (AA), insulin-transferrin-selenium (ITS), dexamethasone (Dex) and Transforming Growth Factor β 1 (TGFβ 1), {{when compared to other}} tested preparations. This differentiation was characterized by the elevated expression of Collagen type II and X along with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation and the onset of hypertrophy. Upon combination with NuOss™, a clinically used <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> <b>filler,</b> and implantation in nude mice, the differentiated pellets further matured into GAG rich cartilaginous intermediates after 4 weeks. This was subsequently, partially remodeled into osteocalcin positive bone tissue after 8 weeks without further external manipulation, indicating the semi-autonomous nature of this implant. Mineralized tissue along with active osteoclast resorption and neo-angiogenesis was apparent throughout the implant. The bone volume was approximately 8 fold higher (10. 70 ± 0. 99 %) when using a cartilaginous intermediate (based on differentiated cell pellets) than observed with cell seeded scaffolds (1. 19 ± 0. 24 % & 1. 48 ± 0. 35 %), both in an undifferentiated and differentiated state. This study highlights the potential of endochondral strategies for bone {{tissue engineering}} and allows the identification of key cellular parameters for this process. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Autogenous cancellous {{bone graft}} {{provides}} an osteoconductive, osteoinductive, and osteogenic substrate for filling <b>bone</b> <b>voids</b> and augmenting fracture-healing. The iliac crest {{remains the most}} frequently used site for bone-graft harvest, but the proximal part of the tibia, distal end of the radius, distal aspect of the tibia, and greater trochanter are alternative donor sites that are particularly useful for bone-grafting in the ipsilateral extremity. The most common complication associated with the harvest of autogenous bone graft is pain at the donor site, with less frequent complications including nerve injury, hematoma, infection, and fracture at the donor site. Induced membranes is a method that uses a temporary polymethylmethacrylate cement spacer to create a bone-graft-friendly environment to facilitate graft incorporation, even in large segmental defects. Autogenous bone graft remains a reliable treatment option when structural stability is required, <b>bone</b> <b>voids</b> exist, or bone-healing augmentation is desired. Cortical autografts provide a structurally sound osteoconductive medium with minimal osteoinductive and osteogenic properties.

40|$|Second place {{winner of}} poster presentations at the 16 th Annual Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity Forum (URCAF) {{held at the}} Hughes Metropolitan Complex, Wichita State University, April 5, 2016. Bone repair is {{interrupted}} or stalled in nonunion fractures or <b>bone</b> <b>void</b> formation due to removal of bone tumor. The use of bone cements to anchor the free spaces between the bones to restore bone volume and promote bone healing has been a successful treatment modality. However these modalities do not work efficiently as the <b>void</b> <b>fillers.</b> These materials are usually brittle and cannot be reshaped for proper fit. The long-term objective {{of the study is}} to develop appropriate composite materials help resolve the biocompatibility and biomechanical problems mentioned above. The current project focuses on understanding the biocompatibility and biomechanical properties of some composites retrieved from a mice model. / The study involves the use of composite materials developed by a private collaborator (whose chemistry is protected). The biomechanical properties of the above mentioned composite polymer were analyzed through both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The in-vivo studies involved the use of mice femur void model to understand the osteoconductivity of the scaffold by analyzing the variations of bone volume, bone density and total volume in the femur (thigh bone) of mice. / Twenty mice were chosen and divided into four groups of five mice. The first three groups were assigned a biomaterial and the last group was used as a control. The bio-composite scaffold was surgically inserted into the mid-shaft of mouse femur and the mice survived for six weeks before sacrifice. After the set period, the limb with implanted scaffold was harvested and microCT scan was performed to analyze the bone volume fractions and mineral densities within the scaffolds. The preliminary results suggest redevelopment and osteoconductivity in the composite scaffolds. After microCT, 3 -point bending biomechanical test on the implanted limbs was performed using a Bose® electroforce testing apparatus. The final assessments of data will be accomplished in the near future. Yang, Shang-Yo...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} the use of kyphoplasty in 1998 {{was the result of the}} {{expected}} evolution of materials and methods related to the successful introduction of vertebroplasty as a valid treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures. Kyphoplasty introduced a method of creating bilateral <b>bone</b> <b>voids</b> and in many cases elevation (reduction) of depressed end plates with variable degrees of height restoration. This was achieved by using bilateral balloon bone tamps capable of pressures significantly higher than conventional angioplasty balloons. This allows creation of bilateral <b>bone</b> <b>voids,</b> resulting in the ability to apply a much thicker cement mixture. This is felt to be the reason for fewer cement-related complications compared with vertebroplasty including extravasation and embolization. Although the procedural cost presently is higher for kyphoplasty, this is expected to decrease as patents expire and industry competition increases. Kyphoplasty indications include all those of vertebroplasty plus additional ones either contraindicated or not recommended for treatment with vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty achieves the same degree of pain relief as vertebroplasty but may offer additional benefits of fewer complications, more indications, better biopsy specimens, and potential for height restoration of compression fractures of the spine. Further studies regarding potential benefits are warranted to assess any added value of kyphoplasty compared with vertebroplasty...|$|R
