50|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>buckles</b> found <b>in</b> tie down straps. The two most common are {{threaded}} buckles and snap buckles. Threaded buckles work like those found on backpacks and duffel bags {{for the purpose of}} adjusting the length of the tie down strap. Snap buckles are also commonly found on backpacks and duffel bags to allow fastening of the strap. These two components are often used in conjunction with the threading buckle providing tension and the snap buckle providing fastening. While threading <b>buckles</b> come <b>in</b> <b>metal</b> varieties for use with tensioning fasteners like over-center and ratchet fasteners, snap buckles are often plastic and are not designed to withstand a great deal of tension.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Nanoindentation for {{measuring}} thin film mechanical properties {{is probably the}} most popular yet ill-understood method due to its inherent complexities. As opposed to burst pressure or microtensile tests of lithographed structures, where relatively uniform stress fields may be generated, the indentation-induced stress gradients can produce unique challenges. Because of the test’s simplicity and ability to mechanically probe the smallest of scales, it is becoming increasingly applied. Five possible stages of deformation are suggested from Hertzian elastic to film delamination and double <b>buckling.</b> <b>In</b> particular <b>metal</b> films on harder substrates are emphasized where it is shown that dislocation nucleation and arrest are only partially understood. Later stages of film delamination are illustrated with Cu/SiO 2 /Si where it is shown that the true work of adhesion is 0. 6 J/m 2. Current limitations of indentation-induced delamination measures of toughness involve large scatter associated with sensitivity of the fracture radius to the contact radius ratio...|$|R
40|$|Inflation of {{membrane}} {{tubes and}} the associated problem of bifurcation and instability is a classical sub-ject that has been studied in many books and papers. This problem shares the same features as a family of other problems such as propagating <b>buckles</b> <b>in</b> long <b>metal</b> tubes under external pressure, propagating necks in some polymeric materials when pulled in tension, phase transition, and kink band formation and propa-gation in layered structures and fibre-reinforced composites. Whereas {{the determination of the}} propagation pressure through the equal-area rule is now universally accepted, there is still some uncertainty concern-ing the determination of the pressure (the initiation pressure) at which bulging first occurs. Kyriakides and Chang (1990) took this pressure to be the limiting pressure corresponding to the first turning point in the pressure-volume diagram for uniform inflation, but this value was found to be slightly higher than what had been observed in the experiments. Existing instability and bifurcation results were discussed by Kyriakides and Chang (1990, 1991) but were found not to be relevant to the determination of the initiation pressure. This is probably because neither the bifurcation nor the stability analysis that has been conducted so far is able to describe correctly the bifurcation mode having zero wave number and it is in fact this mode that is relevant to the determination of the initiation pressure. This special mode is not sinusoidal — its correct variation can only be found from a near-critical nonlinear analysis...|$|R

40|$|Needle {{buckling}} {{is commonly}} {{observed in the}} surgical procedure of flexible needle insertion. Unexpected buckling can seriously affect the insertion performances, {{and it should be}} avoided because it causes unstable and undesirable motion of the needle, thereby damages surrounding vital tissue structures. Although needle insertion simulation methods using haptic interfaces have been reported, yet no extensive study of needle buckle modeling and its haptic simulation can be found. Therefore, in this paper modeling methods of needle <b>buckling</b> <b>in</b> air, <b>buckling</b> <b>in</b> homogeneous tissue, and <b>buckling</b> <b>in</b> multi-layered tissues are proposed. An energy-based method is used to model the feedback force in the insertion procedure through a haptic interface.

40|$|This paper studies tubular <b>buckling</b> <b>in</b> curved wellbores (such as the build {{section of}} {{horizontal}} wells) {{and its effect}} on tubular "lockup " in horizontal or extended-reach wells. New buckling load equations are derived to properly predict tubular sinusoidal and helical <b>buckling</b> <b>in</b> such wellbores. The results show that the buckling loads to initiate sinusoidal and helical <b>buckling</b> of tubulars <b>in</b> curved wellbores are usually much larger than those in straight wellbores. This is because the curved wellbore tends to hold the axially compressed tubular against the outer-curve side of the wellbore. The tubular becomes less easy to buckle until higher axial compres-sive loads are applied. Less tubular lockup risk is then predicted for tubulars in horizontal or extended-reach wells by using the new buckling load equations. The new <b>buckling</b> loads <b>in</b> curved wellbores agree with those in straight wellbores when wellbore curvature approaches zero. Small-scale laboratory experiments also con-firmed these theoretically derived buckling loads...|$|R
40|$|The {{inflation}} and propagation of a localized instability in elastic tubes shares the same mathematical features {{with a range}} of other localization problems, including <b>buckling</b> propagation <b>in</b> long <b>metal</b> tubes under external pressure. Recent research into origami-inspired tubular geometries has suggested that geometric texturing is able to significantly improve metal pipe resistance to propagation buckling failures, with an increase in critical and propagation pressures. This paper aims to investigate whether texturing generates a similar improvement in hyperelastic tubes under axial loading and internal pressure, with elastomer origami structures of recent interest for use as soft actuators and robots. A new fabrication method with 3 D printed moulds in a dip process was first developed to enable fabrication of textured tube samples. An experimental study was then conducted on inflated smooth and textured latex tubes, with instability formation observed at a 1 ms resolution. Comparative numerical models with a Mooney–Rivlin material were able to provide a good prediction of experimentally-observed behaviours up to and slightly past the critical pressure and bulge formation. A parametric numerical study is then conducted to show that the number of divisions in the axial direction and circumferential direction have no and modest effects on critical pressure, respectively. The experimental and numerical investigations both showed that the critical pressure of the textured tube was increased compared to the smooth tube, however the degree of increase was a modest 8 % and so unlikely to be of significant practical benefit. This work can provide reference and guidelines for future investigations of tubular inflatable origami structures...|$|R
