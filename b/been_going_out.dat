He {{had a meeting with}} Ford's executives, called a [...] "Business Plan Review" [...] (BPR) every Thursday at 7 a.m. in the [...] "Thunderbird Room" [...] at Ford's headquarters. At a [...] "town meeting" [...] of 100 information technology staffers in February 2007, Mulally said, [...] "We have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business for 40 years", and repeated his message to other employee groups.|$|E
2500|$|Disturbed at his son's {{participation}} {{in what he}} considered a [...] "useless" [...] endeavor, Landis's father tried to discourage him from racing his bike by giving him extra chores. This left him no time to train during the day, so he would sneak {{out of the house}} at night to train, sometimes at 1 or 2 a.m. and often in the freezing cold. Landis's father received a tip that his son had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> at night. He did not appreciate his son's passion for cycling and thought he might be getting into drugs or alcohol. He often followed Landis at a distance {{to make sure he was}} not getting into trouble. Landis' father later became a hearty supporter of his son and considered himself one of Floyd's biggest fans.|$|E
2500|$|Yoh's little sister. Although she's {{pretty and}} admired by many boys, she often shows her {{conceited}} side. She {{has a serious}} brother complex. She wants Yoh and Haruna to be together, but she sometimes tries to protect her older brother when she thinks Haruna {{is trying to get}} to Yoh sexually. Often, when Haruna goes to her when she's having a problem, Asami says it's going to be [...] "fun" [...] but quickly replaces it with [...] "trouble". She likes Fumiya but wants to test him to see if he would wait forever in the snow for her. Haruna helped her notice how kind Fumiya was, and they have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out.</b> She gets angry at Fumiya when he didn't take any notice of her, even when she tried her cute poses. She has a mischievous side which can cause others trouble. Yoh once accused her of being [...] "mischievous and evil." [...] Her response was [...] "No, I'm just mischievous." ...|$|E

He seemed to know your name and to know that you had just come from Germany. He hinted at some slight trouble there, sir." ...|$|E

Then you would have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of our lives; now we shall have an {{interest}} in all you do, and you will often be coming back to us; there will be that to look forward to. Well, you won't hear me say another word of grumbling until you have gone. And when are you to go?" ...|$|E

I don't say we should hear any hubbub down at the lines if he were discovered there, but we should certainly hear a shout if he came across any of the sentries round the house." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had about}} that time been reading ancient history, and fired {{with the story of}} old wars when men fought hand to hand, he had dropped guns and pistols for the moment and set himself with furious zeal to {{manufacture}} the ancient weapons--bows and arrows, pikes, shield, battle-axes and javelins. These last were sticks about six feet long, nicely made of pine-wood--he had no doubt bribed the carpenter to make them for him--and pointed with old knife-blades six or seven inches long, ground to a fearful sharpness. Such formidable weapons were not required for our purpose: they would have served well enough if we had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> against Don Anastacio's fierce and powerful swine; but it was his order, and to his wild and warlike imagination the toad- like creatures were the warriors of some hostile tribe opposing us, I forget if in Asia or Africa, which had to be conquered and extirpated.|$|E

I have been a-thinking some months it was time you went; it didn't matter so much as long as you was a kid, but you are growing up now, and it ain't to be {{expected}} as you would keep straight in such a place as this; besides, any day you might get nabbed, and three months in quod would finish you altogether. So you see, Sally, I am glad and I am sorry. Warbles ain't the man I would put you in charge of if I had my way. He has told you hisself what he means to do with you, and I would a lot rather you had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> into service; only of course no one would take you as you are, it ain't likely. Still if you keep your eyes open, and you are a sharp girl, you may make money by it; but mind me, Sally, money is no good by itself, nor fine clothes, nor nothing.|$|E

In the first place, {{when they were in}} Crumville they {{followed}} my sister Laura and Jessie Wadsworth to a concert by a college glee club. They forced their attentions on the two girls, and gave outsiders an impression that they had come as escorts. The girls were so upset over it that Laura wrote me that Jessie was actually sick. Two days after that, when the girls were out walking one evening, Jasniff and Merwell followed them, and right on the main street, near the post-office, they came up and commenced to talk and Merwell said to Laura, loud enough for half a dozen folks to hear: ’You’ve got to keep your word—you can’t go back on us like that.’ And Jasniff added: ‘Yes, you girls were glad enough to let us give you a good time before, down at the Rainbow.’ The Rainbow is a ten-cent moving-picture place, and a low one at that. Of course there wasn’t a word of truth in it, but Merwell and Jasniff gave folks the impression that Laura and Jessie had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> with them, and you know how such reports spread in a small town like Crumville.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I don't so much mind," [...] said I, with {{infinite}} relief; and he added, {{thinking that}} I wanted further reassurance, {{that he should}} never give up trying to get Prometesky's pardon; {{and that this was}} only a journey for supplies, and to see his old friend, and perhaps to try whether anything could be done about that other unhappy Harry. I pressed him to promise me that he would return and settle here, but though he said he would come back, to settling at home he answered, [...] "That depends;" [...] and though I could not see, I knew he was biting his moustache, and guessed, poor dear fellow, that it depended on how far {{he should be able to}} endure the sight of Eustace and Viola married. I saw now that I had been blind not to perceive before that his heart had <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to Viola all this time, while he thought he was courting her for Eustace, and I also had my thoughts about Viola, which made it no very great surprise to me, when, in a few days more, intelligence came that Eustace might be expected at home, and he made his appearance in a petulant though still conceited mood, that made me suspect his wooing had not been prosperous, though I knew nothing till Harold told me that he was not out of heart, though Viola had cut him short and refused to listen to him, for her mother said she was a mere child who was taken by surprise, and that if he were patient and returned to the charge she would know her own mind better.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut," [...] said Miss Prettyman as Grace in vain {{tried to}} conceal her tears {{up in the}} private sanctum. [...] "You ought to know me by this time, and to have learned that I can {{understand}} things." [...] The tears had flown in return {{not only for the}} five gold sovereigns which Miss Prettyman had pressed into her hand, but on account of the prettiest, soft, grey merino frock that ever charmed a girl's eye. [...] "I should like to know how many girls I have given dresses to, when they have <b>been</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> visiting. Law, my dear; they take them, many of them, from us old maids, almost as if we were only paying our debts in giving them." [...] And then Miss Anne gave her a cloth cloak, very warm, with pretty buttons and gimp trimmings,--just such a cloak as any girl might like to wear who thought that she would be seen out walking by her Major Grantly on a Christmas morning. Grace Crawley did not expect to be seen out walking by her Major Grantly, but nevertheless she liked the cloak. By the power of her practical will, and by her true sympathy, the elder Miss Prettyman had for a while conquered the annoyance which, on Grace's part, was attached to the receiving of gifts, by the consciousness of her poverty; and when Miss Anne, with some pride in the tone of her voice, expressed a hope that Grace would think the cloak pretty, Grace put her arms pleasantly round her friend's neck, and declared that it was very pretty,--the prettiest cloak in all the world! ...|$|E
