5|$|Mayor John Curtis began {{a public}} process {{to replace the}} flag in 2013, in {{response}} to the second NAVA survey, consulting with local vexillologists and residents for ideas. In May 2014, the flag replacement process was narrowed to two options by a three-member committee, both consisting of simple renditions of Utah Lake and nearby mountains, with one option having three stars to represent life in Provo. The designs were not well received <b>by</b> <b>residents,</b> leading Mayor Curtis to propose a public design contest to end in early June. A consensus was reached <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> to not use the color red in the new flag, as it is used by the University of Utah, a rival to Provo's Brigham Young University.|$|E

5|$|Wheelwright's {{position}} at the church in Hampton had, as expected, been filled during his absence, but he was quickly called <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> of the neighboring town of Salisbury to be their pastor, and on 9 December 1662, when 70 years old, he was installed there. This became Wheelwright's longest pastorate in his varied life, lasting nearly 17 years.|$|E
5|$|A herd {{lives on}} the Rachel Carson {{component}} of the North Carolina National Estuarine Research Reserve, a series of five small islands and several salt marshes. There were no horses at the Sanctuary until the 1940s.

5|$|Hamersley's first school, Glendale Primary School in Glendale Avenue, {{opened in}} 1971 {{in the western}} portion of the suburb. The school and {{neighbouring}} kindergarten quickly became overcrowded as their catchment area initially extended to Hepburn Avenue, taking in Warwick and Greenwood to its north. As schools were built in those suburbs in 1974–1976, congestion eased considerably. The school and kindergarten were also used as a hall and meeting place <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> and groups until the recreation centre opened in April 1975. In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Tillingbourne {{controversially}} {{reduced the}} number of journeys on contracted route 516, which linked Dorking, Leatherhead and Epsom. Although this was within the terms of the contract, it was criticised <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> of intermediate villages, who claimed the communities relied in particular on a cancelled morning journey. Operations were moved to a new larger site, still located in Cranleigh, in February 2001. The company believed this would reduce operating costs and allow for future expansion.|$|E

5|$|Newark is New Jersey's {{largest and}} second-most racially diverse city (after {{neighboring}} Jersey City). It {{is divided into}} five political wards, which are often used <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> to identify their place of habitation. In recent years, residents have begun to identify with specific neighborhood names instead of the larger ward appellations. Nevertheless, the wards remain relatively distinct. Industrial uses, coupled with the airport and seaport lands, are concentrated in the East and South Wards, while residential neighborhoods exist primarily in the North, Central, and West Wards.|$|E
5|$|The Bombardment of Salé was a naval {{attack against}} the Moroccan city of Salé that took place between 26 and 27 November 1851, in {{response}} to the looting of a French cargo ship <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> of the city.

5|$|A major push {{occurred}} in 2002 when officials from Emery County, joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt, petitioned President George W. Bush {{to use the}} authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument. This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non-binding referendum, which did not pass. Common reasons given <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This monument was established in 1996, by President Bill Clinton. In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret. Boundaries were drawn without the consent or even knowledge of local residents. This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah.|$|E

5|$|A snow groomer is {{a machine}} {{designed}} to smooth and compact the snow, rather than removing it altogether. Early snow groomers were used <b>by</b> <b>residents</b> of rural areas to compress the snow {{close to their}} homes, and consisted of a heavy roller hauled by oxen which compacted the snow to make a smooth surface for sledging. With {{the invention of the}} motor car, snow groomers were replaced by snowplows and snow blowers on public thoroughfares, but remained in use at ski resorts, where they are used to maintain smooth, safe trails for various wintersports, including skiing, snowboarding and snowmobiling. Snow groomers remained unchanged throughout the 20th century, with most consisting of heavy roller which could be attached to a tractor or snowcat and then hauled across the area to be groomed.|$|E

Closer to the epicenter, several instances of damage were aligned with the highest observed intensity. The structural effects to the gas station's walls and roof at Casa de Fruta, the beam damage {{on the second floor of}} the Ford's department store in Gilroy, and the caved-in roof from the fallen parapet at the law office in Hollister were all considered by the United States Geological Survey to be consistent with intensity VII (Very strong) shaking.|$|E
