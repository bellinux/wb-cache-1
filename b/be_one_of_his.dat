5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own pupils.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013, in {{a conference}} to promote the 25th season of the show, {{producer}} Al Jean revealed that a major character would die in this episode. The character would have appeared more than twice in the show, and be voiced by an Emmy Award-winning voice actor who won an Emmy for the role as the character. Later that month, {{following the death of}} Marcia Wallace, it was confirmed {{that it would not be}} her character, Edna Krabappel. Voice actor Hank Azaria, whose roles include Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Moe Szyslak, stated that it would not <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> characters. It was shown at the 2014 Comic-Con that it would not be Homer, although there is a scene that features Lisa worrying about Homer's health as he struggles with a CPAP mask.|$|E
5|$|Ramirez {{was born}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic to Aristides and Onelcida Ramirez and spent {{thirteen}} years living there. As a child, Ramirez was obsessed with baseball. When he was eight years old, his grandmother got him a Dodgers uniform with the number 30 on the back, which he considers to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most prized possessions. In 1985, {{he moved to the}} Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City with his parents. He would often play ball at the nearby Snake Hill, the same place Lou Gehrig played during his childhood. Despite living just a short distance from Yankee Stadium, Ramirez rooted for the Toronto Blue Jays and would watch games when the Blue Jays were in town.|$|E
50|$|The Thomas Durham School <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Regency designs. It <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plainest {{designs for}} the district, and also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{cheapest}} to build. This may have resulted from its location in a predominantly African-American neighborhood.|$|R

5|$|There are two Grade I listed {{churches in}} Trafford: St. Werburgh's Church, in Warburton, is a timber framed church and {{dates back to}} at least the 14th century; All Saints' Church, in Urmston, was {{constructed}} in 1868 by E. W. Pugin, and is considered to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> best works. Of the 11 Grade II* listed buildings in Trafford, seven are churches: Hale Chapel in Hale; the Church of St John the Divine in Sale; Church of St Mary the Virgin in Bowdon; St. Martin's Church in Sale; St. Michael's Church in Flixton; St. Margaret's Church in Altrincham; St. George's Church in Carrington.|$|E
5|$|Everyone in {{the family}} has to create budget cuts in their daily routine, such as Homer having {{to give up on}} buying beer and Marge having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. Bart must get his hair cut at a local barber school, Lisa can no longer get her volumes of Encyclopedia Generica, and Maggie's clothes have to last a little bit longer. They {{eventually}} save up enough money for the operation, which is a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the morale of the family suffers and they take their annoyance out on Santa's Little Helper. Feeling unwanted, he runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the dog pound, and adopted by Mr. Burns, who trains him to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the Ludovico technique, Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.|$|E
5|$|James' playmaking {{ability is}} {{generally}} considered to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> premier skills, with some analysts ranking him among the greatest passers in NBA history. He is the only frontcourt player in league history to register over 7,000 career assists. Using his size, vision, and the attention he garners from opposing defenses to his advantage, James is able to create easy points for his teammates with accurate assists, manufacturing a league leading 2.6 three-pointers per game by way of his passing alone in 2013. He will often execute passes that would normally be considered unconventional, including passes after leaving his feet and passes through defensive traffic. His uncanny tendency to find the open man {{played a significant role}} in the evolution of modern NBA defenses, forcing teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.|$|E

5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase turned out to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, {{one of the best}} two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E
25|$|After this retreat he {{received}} numerous teachings, empowerments, and oral transmissions, from various spiritual masters. One of them, Sechen Rabjam Rinpoche, {{told him that}} Tara meditation would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> major practices.|$|E

25|$|Chadwick's most {{important}} stage work {{from this period}} is The Padrone, based on the realistic plight of Italian immigrants in the North End of Boston. It has a distinctive verismo style (realistic action integrated with a lyrical score). Although Chadwick considered this to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> finer works, it was not performed until 1995, when it was premiered by the Waterbury Symphony at the Thomaston Opera House.|$|E
25|$|In November 1913 the Albanian pro-Ottoman {{forces had}} offered {{the throne of}} Albania to the Ottoman war {{minister}} of Albanian origin, Izzet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire sent agents to encourage a revolt, hoping to restore Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. Izzet Pasha sent major Beqir Grebenali, another ethnic Albanian, to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chief representatives in Albania.

25|$|While in prison, Cunhal {{submitted}} {{his final}} thesis {{on the topic}} of abortion and obtained his law degree (the jury included the future prime minister Marcello Caetano). In the thesis, he also supported the illegality of abortion in USSR, claiming it was no longer practised there. He then taught for some months at the Colégio Moderno, in Lisbon. Among his pupils was the future President of Portugal, Mário Soares, who would <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great political rivals after the coup of 1974.|$|E
25|$|In Kiev he {{attended}} lectures at the University as an auditor student, studied the Polish and Ukrainian languages {{and the art}} of icon-painting, took part in the religious and philosophical circles of the students, and met pilgrims, sectarians and religious dissenters. Dmitry Zhuravsky, an economist and critic of serfdom in Russia, was said to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> major influences. In 1853 Leskov married Olga Smirnova; they had one son, Dmitry (who died after only a year), and a daughter, Vera.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Cleland {{began working}} for the 2004 presidential {{campaign}} of Massachusetts senator John Kerry, also a Vietnam veteran; Kerry {{went on to win}} the Democratic nomination. Cleland often appeared at campaign events with Kerry and was considered by many to <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most important surrogates, partly as a symbol of the sacrifices made by soldiers for wars. He went to Bush's Texas ranch to deliver a swift boat ad complaint, but the event failed to have much impact.
