5|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy.

Cortina, which had {{originally}} been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid {{for the right to}} host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other.

Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.|$|E

5|$|The city of Minneapolis, Minnesota, {{is covered}} by a citywide {{broadband}} wireless internet network, sometimes called Wireless Minneapolis. The network was first proposed in 2003, at which point only a few other cities nationwide had such systems in place. Local firm US Internet <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> EarthLink to build and operate the network, with a guaranteed ten-year, multimillion-dollar contract from the city itself as the network's anchor tenant. Construction began on the project in 2006, but encountered several delays. Most {{of the city was}} covered by the network by 2010, and USI Wireless, the subsidiary of US Internet responsible for the system, set up numerous free internet access points at public locations around Minneapolis.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{failure is}} where the heart can't <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> enough blood {{to meet the needs}} of the body. It is {{generally}} a chronic condition, associated with age, that progresses gradually. Each side of the heart can fail independently of the other, resulting in heart failure of the right heart or the left heart. Left heart failure can also lead to right heart failure (cor pulmonale) by increasing strain on the right heart. If the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood, it may accumulate throughout the body, causing breathlessness in the lungs (pulmonary congestion; pulmonary edema), swelling (edema) of the feet or other gravity-dependent areas, decrease exercise tolerance, or cause other clinical signs such as an enlarged liver, cardiac murmurs, or a raised jugular venous pressure. Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, valve disorders and diseases of cardiac muscle.|$|E

5|$|Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he {{was part}} of a rare {{defensive}} shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved to first base, with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> a bunt single to first base, but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald's grounder to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set an AL record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and was used as a pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.|$|E
5|$|The new Yankee Stadium, {{which cost}} a record $1.5billion, was {{constructed}} near the old facility. As built, {{it had a}} capacity of approximately 52,000, with 52 luxury suites. Monument Park, which holds plaques and monuments honoring former Yankees personnel, was built beyond the center field fence; its collection was transplanted from the old stadium. For the 2009 season, the team committed over $400million in future salaries to three free agents: pitchers CC Sabathia and A. J. Burnett, and first baseman Mark Teixeira. New York won 90 of its last 134 games, and broke the franchise single-season record by hitting 244 home runs. Another club record was broken by Jeter, who passed Gehrig as the Yankees' all-time hits leader on September 11. New York posted 103 wins in 2009 and <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> the Red Sox for the division title by eight games. In the AL playoffs, the Yankees defeated the Twins in the ALDS and the Angels in the ALCS, advancing to the World Series. There, they faced the defending Series champions, the Philadelphia Phillies. Behind a six-RBI effort by Matsui in the sixth and final game, the Yankees defeated the Phillies to win their record 27th Series championship.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, center Dakari Johnson {{was named}} National Freshman of the Year by ESPN HS. In the {{following}} months, Okafor <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> Johnson {{for a spot}} on the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship Team USA. Okafor spent his sophomore season ranked as the number one center and second best player in the national class of 2014 by SLAM Magazine behind Andrew Wiggins, according to SLAM's Franklyn Calle. In January 2012 during his sophomore season, he was ranked third in the class by ESPNU. By April, he was ranked second. By the end of his second year, there was talk that with Jabari Parker Chicago might produce the number one high school player in the country in back to back years, something that they had come close to with Mark Aguirre and Isiah Thomas in the late 1970s. Also in the 1981 NBA draft Aguirre and Thomas were selected first and second, respectively. On October 25, 2012, Andrew Wiggins reclassified into the class of 2013, which cleared the way for Okafor to assume the number one ranking in the Rivals.com ranking for the class of 2014. As of November 2012, he was listed number one in the national class of 2014 by Rivals.com and number two by ESPN. He remained number one according to Rivals with its March 14, 2013 rankings update, following his junior season.|$|E

5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Vengeance was between Batista and Triple H, {{with the two}} battling over the World Heavyweight Championship. After Batista {{defeated}} Triple H at WrestleMania 21, they continued to fight over the World title at the next Raw pay-per-view, Backlash, which saw Batista retain the title. Following Backlash, a series of Gold Rush Tournament matches to determine a number one contender to face Batista for the World title took place with Kane, Shawn Michaels, Edge, and Chris Benoit winning {{in the first round}} of the tournament. In this round, Benoit forced Triple H to submit to the Sharpshooter, Benoit's submission finisher. On the May 23, 2005 episode of Raw, Batista faced Edge, who had <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> Michaels and Kane for an opportunity at the World title. Batista retained the title after he pinned Edge following a Batista Bomb. Following the match, Triple H attacked Batista with a sledgehammer and challenged him to a Hell in a Cell match. After making the challenge, Triple H performed a Pedigree to Batista on the World title. Batista accepted Triple H's challenge, which led to a contract signing for their scheduled match at Vengeance, which would be for the World Heavyweight title in a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The nearly {{decade and}} a half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less {{than it had been in}} the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports <b>beat</b> <b>out</b> local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E
