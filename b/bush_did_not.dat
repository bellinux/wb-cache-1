5|$|Following the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan on March 30, 1981, Vice President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> assume the presidential powers and duties as Acting President. Reagan {{was unable to}} invoke Section 3, {{because he was in}} surgery. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> invoke Section 4, because he was on a plane returning from Texas. Reagan was out of surgery by the time Bush arrived in Washington. In 1995, Birch Bayh, the primary sponsor of the amendment in the Senate, wrote that Section 4 should have been invoked.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{announced}} its decision on June 29, 2006. The Court reversed the ruling of the Court of Appeals, holding that President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have authority {{to set up}} the war crimes tribunals and finding the special military commissions illegal under both military justice law and the Geneva Conventions.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{established}} {{the first national}} monument, Devils Tower in Wyoming, on September 24, 1906. He established 18 national monuments, although only nine still retain that designation. Sixteen Presidents have created national monuments since the program began; only Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> Bill Clinton created nineteen and expanded three others. Jimmy Carter protected vast parts of Alaska, proclaiming fifteen national monuments, some of which later were promoted to national parks. President Barack Obama created or expanded 34 national monuments, {{the most of any}} president, with over half a billion acres of public land and water protected.|$|E

50|$|In the song, Nettles' vocals are {{accompanied}} by Kristian Bush (Sugarland's other member) on acoustic guitar; unlike most other Sugarland songs, <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> sing harmony vocals. The only other instrumentation in the song is an organ, played by Bush's brother Brandon.|$|R
25|$|President <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{make public}} {{appearances}} or private meetings with Harris before the primary. He did, however, appear {{with her at}} a fundraiser on September 21 in Tampa.|$|E
25|$|In September 2004, Lawrence Korb, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan, after {{reviewing}} the payroll records for Bush's {{last two years of}} service, concluded that they indicated that <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> fulfill his obligations and could have been ordered to active duty as a result.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush, President of the United States (by satellite). Because of {{the events}} of Hurricane Gustav, <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> attend the convention, but instead {{delivered}} his remarks to the delegates by satellite. Bush honored McCain's courage and his maverick reputation, while also stating that McCain is ready to lead.|$|E

25|$|President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{attend the}} {{convention}} (although he did appear by satellite), {{in order to}} oversee relief efforts to help citizens recover from Hurricane Gustav. The attending delegates at the convention nominated Senator John McCain from Arizona for President and Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska for Vice President. 1,191 pledged delegates were necessary for candidates to win the respective nominations.|$|E
25|$|Further, income {{inequality}} {{can be measured}} both before-tax and after-tax, so the Bush tax cuts primarily impacted the latter measurements. President <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take deliberate steps to address pre-tax inequality, which involves policies such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining power (unions), limiting executive pay, and protectionism. CBO reported that the top 1% paid an average total federal tax rate of 32.5% in 2000, 30.1% in 2004, and 28.2% in 2008. The top 1% paid an average federal income tax rate of 24.5% in 2000 and 20.4% in 2008.|$|E
25|$|By regulation, National Guard {{pilots were}} {{required}} to take and pass an annual physical {{in order to remain}} in flight status, in the three months prior to a pilot's birthday (in Bush's case, July 6). <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take this mandatory physical examination in mid-1972. As a result of his failure to take his physical, his flight status was suspended by his commander on August 1, 1972, confirmed by Col Bobby Hodges on September 5, 1972, and confirmed again by a National Guard Bureau order on September 29, 1972, which meant he no longer was authorized to fly as a pilot.|$|E
60|$|The smoke, fire, {{and death}} to the leading men, which belched from the <b>bushes,</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> check the rush {{for more than a}} moment.

5000|$|Writing in The Advertiser, in {{a review}} of Saltbush Bill, J.P., and Other Verses, a {{reviewer}} states: [...] "The 'note of melancholy' which Marcus Clarke and other writers have found in the <b>bush</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appeal to him Paterson, and he has set out his attitude in regard to the 'dismal' tribe in 'an answer to various bards,' which appears in this volume." ...|$|R
25|$|Bin al-Shibh {{and four}} other captives {{classified}} as high value detainees (Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Mustafa al-Hawsawi, Ammar al-Baluchi and Walid Bin Attash) were charged in Guantanamo military commissions in Spring 2008. The men triggered controversy when they announced {{that they did not}} want US-appointed attorneys and they planned to boycott their commissions. The military commissions, as authorized by President George W. <b>Bush,</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> permit suspects to forgo legal representation, to act as their own attorneys, or to boycott their commissions. The commissions authorized by the Military Commissions Act of 2006, did authorize suspects to serve as their own attorneys.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, of the 11 {{states in which}} {{amendments}} defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came {{out for the first}} time to cast their ballots for Bush. Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted for a Democrat in many years. The two states that <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.|$|E
25|$|On March 25, 1999, Davis {{issued an}} {{executive}} order calling {{for the removal of}} MTBE (a toxic gasoline additive) from gasoline sold in the state. In 2001, in order for gas prices to remain reasonable in California while removing MTBE, Davis asked President George W. Bush to order the EPA to grant California a waiver on the federal minimum oxygen requirement. Without a waiver, California would have to import a much larger amount of ethanol per year and gas prices were projected to increase drastically. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> grant the waiver and in 2002, Davis issued {{an executive order}} reversing his earlier executive order.|$|E
50|$|The inboard (chassis) end of {{a control}} arm is {{attached}} by a single pivot, usually a rubber bushing. It can thus control {{the position of the}} outboard end in only a single degree of freedom, maintaining the radial distance from the inboard mount. Although not deliberately free to move, the single <b>bushing</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> control the arm from moving back and forth; this motion is constrained by a separate link or radius rod.|$|R

25|$|McGreevey's {{decision}} {{to delay the}} effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace the governor. Doing so allowed the Democratic Party to retain control of the governorship for the rest (until January 2006) of the 4-year term. It avoided {{the prospect of a}} special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted in a Republican victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey's electoral votes. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> win New Jersey's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46% of the statewide vote, compared to 40% in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.|$|E
25|$|As a batter, <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> hit {{for high}} batting average but was {{regularly}} {{among the major}} league leaders in drawing bases on balls, sacrifice hits, stolen bases, and runs scored. At {{the time of his}} retirement in 1923, Bush's 1,158 bases on balls ranked second in major league history. His 337 sacrifice hits still ranks fifth in major league history, and his 1909 total of 52 sacrifice hits is the fourth highest in major league history. He ranked among the American League leaders in stolen bases ten times, and, during the decade from 1910 to 1919, the only players to score more runs than Bush were Ty Cobb, Eddie Collins, and Tris Speaker.|$|E
25|$|George W. Bush {{had become}} {{increasingly}} unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that his approval ratings among American voters had averaged around 30 percent. In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, but <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush {{appeared at the}} 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Gustav. Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed {{in an interview that he}} voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office.|$|E
25|$|<b>Busher</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{play any}} cricket in 1909, but August of the {{following}} year he appeared twice more for Worcestershire, against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham and against Somerset at Taunton. Worcestershire lost the former match by an innings but won the latter by 295 runs. Busher himself also experienced mixed fortunes in these games: against Gloucestershire he could manage only one wicket, but after a wicketless first innings against Somerset he recorded 5-13 in the second; his last first-class wicket was that of wicket-keeper Arthur Newton.|$|R

25|$|While governor, Bush {{presided over}} a state {{government}} that reduced taxes by 19 billion and he vetoed 2 billion in new spending, according to The Wall Street Journal. An analysis conducted by economist Martin Sullivan, which eliminated {{the effects of the}} federal estate tax repeal (which did not require legislative action to go into effect) and inflation, estimated the cumulative reduction in taxes by the state at closer to 13 billion during Bush's tenure, resulting in tax savings by 2006 of 140 per person, per year. A substantial amount of the tax savings in the higher estimate came from the phasing out of the federal estate tax law implemented in 2001 under President George W. Bush, for a total tax savings of 848 million per year; Jeb <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> push for a replacement with a state tax. The biggest reduction in taxes was due to the elimination of the state's Intangible Personal Property Tax, which applied to holdings of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds.|$|E
500|$|The German V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{demonstrated}} a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD {{had some success}} developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field {{that had been left}} to the enemy. <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> seek the advice of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.|$|E
500|$|Federal {{funding for}} medical {{research}} involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the Dickey-Wicker Amendment by Congress and {{the signature of}} President Bill Clinton. Bush {{has said that he}} supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, <b>Bush</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> support embryonic stem cell research. On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing [...] "lines" [...] of stem cells, but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned. Testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines, and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells, which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines. On July 19, 2006, Bush used his veto power {{for the first time in}} his presidency to veto the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. The bill would have repealed the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.|$|E

5000|$|Bush and the zoo promote {{belief in}} a form of creationism {{as well as the}} truth of the Genesis flood myth and explicate these beliefs at length at [...] "earthhistory.org.uk". <b>Bush</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> accept flood geology, a Young Earth Creationist belief that the flood {{described}} in Genesis 6-8 was an actual event that produced most fossil bearing geological strata; rather he believes the earth to be about 100,000 years old, older than the 6,000 to 10,000 years that Young Earth creationists believe it to be but much younger than its actual age of 4.54 billion years.|$|R
