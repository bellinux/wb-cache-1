At no time was either ligand associated with the <b>biosynthetic</b> Golgi <b>apparatus.</b> Rat liver Golgi fractions {{were found to be}} contaminated by endosomes, hence their redesignation as Golgi-endosome fractions (GE). Proton translocation activity of different GE fractions showed a gradient of progressively decreasing activity which correlated with increasing time, of ligand accumulation therein. Based on the distinctive kinetics of proton translocation activity and ligand accumulation the endosomal components of the Golgi intermediate and light fractions, which fractionate coincidently on percoll gradient centrifugation, have been considered to be distinct components of the endocytic apparatus. The activity of the EGF receptor kinase has been assessed in plasmalemmal and GE fractions isolated from untreated animals as well as those injected with EGF in vivo. In untreated animals receptor kinase activity was readily detected in plasmalemmal fractions, but was latent in GE fractions, suggesting an intraluminal orientation of the EGF binding region of the receptor in endosomes. Consequent to the administration of EGF in vivo a majority of the receptor kinase translocated from plasmalemma to endosomes. Receptor kinase activity remaining on the plasmalemma was activated. Endosomally located receptor kinase activity was no longer latent following EGF administration, was maximally stimulated with respect to autophosphorylation activity and at later times following internalization, may become activated. These data are consistent with a role for both plasmalemmal and endosomally located EGF receptor kinase in transmembrane signalling...|$|R

Tb� 1 silencing was lethal in both stages, indicating a critical function(s) for the AP- 1 machinery. Transport of soluble and membrane-bound secretory cargoes was Tb� 1 independent in both stages. In procyclic parasites, trafficking of the lysosomal membrane protein, p 67, was disrupted, leading to cell surface mislocalization. The lysosomal protease trypanopain was also secreted, suggesting a transmembrane-sorting receptor for this soluble hydrolase. In bloodstream trypanosomes, both p 67 and trypanopain trafficking were unaffected by Tb� 1 silencing, suggesting that AP- 1 is not necessary for biosynthetic lysosomal trafficking. Endocytosis in bloodstream cells was also unaffected, indicating that AP- 1 does not function at the flagellar pocket. These results indicate that post-Golgi apparatus sorting to the lysosome is critically dependent on the AP- 1 /clathrin machinery in procyclic trypanosomes but that this machinery is not necessary in bloodstream parasites.

The endothelial cell response to hypoxia involves {{a range of}} adaptive mechanisms that reflect an active response of the cell's <b>biosynthetic</b> and metabolic <b>apparatus.</b> Hypoxia-mediated suppression of endothelial barrier function, resulting in increased vascular leakage, is likely to contribute to pulmonary and cerebral edema associated with high altitude and is closely associated with a fall in intracellular cyclic AMP levels. Buttressing of this second messenger pathway in the endothelium using membrane permeant cyclic AMP analogs prevents increased vascular leakage due to hypoxia. Application of this principle to organ preservation has shown that supplementation with cyclic AMP analogs or inhibition of endogenous cAMP metabolism enables extension of the time a harvested organ can remain extracorporeally, after which transplantation is successful. The underlying mechanism through which cyclic AMP exerts its effects appears to be maintenance of vascular homeostasis in the graft. A distinct adaptive mechanism triggered in the endothelium by hypoxia is expression of the cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) by a novel mechanism involving transcription driven by the nuclear factor IL- 6 (NF-IL- 6) DNA binding site in the promoter. IL- 6 may exert protective effects on vascular function, thereby limiting vascular injury by a different mechanism than those recruited by elevated cAMP levels. These studies provide insights into two independent mechanisms through which endothelium responds to oxygen deprivation, and suggest possible new approaches to attentuate vascular injury associated with ischemia...|$|R

Furthermore, hypertrophic stimulation increases expression of the essential TFIIIB subunit Brf 1, an effect not seen when fibroblasts proliferate.

In all eukaryotes, except members of the protist phylum Euglenozoa, haem attachment is to the cysteine residues of a CxxCH haem-binding motif. In the Euglenozoa, which include medically relevant trypanosomatid parasites, haem attachment is to a single cysteine residue in an AxxCH haem-binding motif. Moreover, genes encoding known c-type cytochrome biogenesis machineries are all absent from trypanosomatid genomes, indicating {{the presence of a}} novel <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus.</b> In the present study, we investigate expression and maturation of cytochrome c with a typical CxxCH haem-binding motif in the trypanosomatids Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma brucei.

At least 13 loci affecting production of EPS I were previously mapped to a cluster on the second of two symbiotic megaplasmids in Rm 1021, pRmeSU 47 b. A putative regulatory region was originally defined by the exoG and exoJ mutations. exoG and exoJ mutants produced less exopolysaccharide than wild-type strains and induced nitrogen-fixing nodules on alfalfa with reduced efficiency compared with the wild type. These mutants appeared to produce only a low-molecular-weight form of EPS I. Mutations called exoX cause an increase in exopolysaccharide production and map in the same region as the exoG and exoJ mutations. The DNA sequence of this region reveals that it contains two open reading frames, called exoX and exoY, which have homologs in other Rhizobium species. Interestingly, the exoG insertion mutations fall in an intergenic region and may affect the expression of exoX or exoY. The exoJ mutation falls in the 3 ' portion of the exoX open reading frame and is probably an allele of exoX that results in altered function. exoG and exoJ mutations limit EPS I production {{in the presence of}} exoR 95 or exoS 96 mutations, which cause overproduction of EPS I. Gene regulation studies suggest that ExoX and ExoY constitute a system that modulates exopolysaccharide synthesis at a posttranslational level.

40|$|Abstract Although the lipids of {{mammalian}} {{stratum corneum}} {{are known to}} be important for the cutaneous permeability barrier, the factors that regulate epidermal lipid biosynthesis are poorly understood. Recent studies suggest that cutaneous sterol synthesis is regulated by cutaneous barrier requirements, while the levels of circulating sterols do not play a role. Whether cutaneous barrier requirements regulate epidermal lipogenesis in general {{and the nature of the}} signal that activates the lipid <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus</b> are unknown. We determined whether alterations of the cutaneous permeability barrier, induced by treatment with a solvent (acetone), a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), or essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), provoked a discrete versus global stimulation of epidermal and dermal lipid biosynthesis. Acetone treatment increased epidermal, but not dermal, sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis approximately threefold over controls at 1 - 4 hr, which returned to normal after 12 hr. SDS treatment likewise stimulated epidermal sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, but the increase was less dramatic than in acetone-treated animals. Since plastic occlusion blocked the expected increase in de novo lipid biosynthesis in acetonetreated animals, it is possible that water flux provides the molecular signal for de novo synthesis. Finally, EFAD mice also demonstrated enhanced epidermal sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis in comparison to normals, an effect that also was abolished when transepidermal water loss was normalized by occlusion, despite the presence of ongoing EFAD. These results demonstrate that disruption of the cutaneous permeability barrier stimulates a parallel, global boost in both sterol and fatty acid biosynthesis that is limited to the epidermis. Since such stimulation is reversed by restoration of barrier function, transcutaneous water gradients may regulate epidermal lipogenesis. ...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the Escherichia coli cell is {{considered}} as a system designed for rapid growth, but limited by the medium. We propose that this very design causes the cell to become subsaturated with precursors and catalytic components {{at all levels of}} macromolecular biosynthesis and leads to a molecular sharing economy at a high level of competition inside the cell. Thus, the promoters compete with each other in the binding of a limited amount of free RNA polymerase and the ribosome binding sites on the mRNA chains compete with each other for the free ribosomes. The macromolecular chain elongation reactions sequester a considerable proportion of the total amount of RNA polymerase and ribosomes in the cells. We propose that the degree of subsaturation of the macromolecular <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus</b> renders a variable fraction of RNA polymerase and ribosomes unavailable for the initiation of new chain synthesis and that this, at least in part, determines the composition of the cell {{as a function of the}} growth rate. Thus, at rapid growth, the high speed of the elongation reactions enables the cell to increase the concentrations of free RNA polymerase and ribosomes for initiation purposes. Furthermore, it is proposed that the speed of RNA polymerase movement is adjusted to the performance speed of the ribosomes. Mechanistically, this adjustment of the coupling between transcription and translation involves transcriptional pause sites along the RNA chains, the adjustment of the saturation level of RNA polymerase with the nucleoside triphosphate substrates, and the concentration of ppGpp, which is known to inhibit RNA chain elongation. This model is able to explain the stringent response and the control of stable RNA and of ribosome synthesis in steady states and in shifts, as well as the rate of overall protein synthesis as a function of the growth rate...|$|E
40|$|The {{bacterium}} Staphylococcus aureus only synthesises peptidoglycan during {{cell division}} at the septum using a complex protein <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus</b> called the divisome. It divides sequentially in three orthogonal planes, using heritable features within the peptidoglycan architecture to maintain this process over generations. The ‘rib’ features that form this ‘memory’ are remnants of a large belt of peptidoglycan called the ‘piecrust’ that is formed at the initiation of septation and before the septal plate. After division, the ribs remain as orthogonal features, which are bisected by further ‘piecrust’ features from ensuing division cycles. This results in a characteristic pattern of different age peptidoglycan sectors, delineated by ribs of a different architecture. As well as maintaining cellular viability and shape the peptidoglycan layer also acts as a scaffold for many other polymers, including wall teichoic acid (WTA). WTA is known to direct and modulate cell wall hydrolase activity. There has been recent debate as to its subcellular localisation. In this study, using the bacterial two-hybrid assay, four putative WTA biosynthesis enzymes were found to interact with numerous members of the divisome. Microscopy techniques localised WTA across the entire cell surface except on the piecrust and rib features. It was hypothesised that WTA blocks {{the rest of the}} peptidoglycan thereby directing the localisation of hydrolases and other proteins. The localisation of peptidoglycan hydrolases was studied. Those found to localise to the rib and piecrust features (Atl(glucosaminidase), Atl(amidase), SagB and ScaH) showed a distinct pattern which was completely disrupted in a strain missing WTA. Conversely those (SceD) not associated with rib/piecrust showed no difference to localisation with loss of WTA. The processed forms of Atl (glucosaminidase and amidase) demonstrated different binding properties during the cell cycle and a model to illustrate the cell cycle dependent binding is proposed. ...|$|E

We studied the kinetics of glucose-regulated proinsulin gene expression and proinsulin biosynthesis in normal rat islets with emphasis on the potential role of insulin as a mediator of the glucose effect. There was a time-dependent increase in steady-state proinsulin mRNA in islets cultured at 16. 7 mmol/l compared with 3. 3 mmol/l glucose; no early (1 – 3 h) increase in proinsulin gene expression was observed. In contrast, there was a threefold increase in proinsulin biosynthesis within 1 hofglucose stimulation that was not affected by inhibition of glucose-stimulated proinsulin gene transcription with actinomycin D. In addition, inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with diazoxide {{had no effect on}} glucose-stimulated proinsulin mRNA or biosynthesis. Furthermore, addition of different concentrations of insulin to islets cultured in low glucose failed to affect proinsulin biosynthesis. Taken together, our data suggest that the early glucosedependent increase in proinsulin biosynthesis is mainly regulated at the translational level, rather than by changes in proinsulin gene expression. Moreover, we could not demonstrate any effect of insulin on islet proinsulin mRNA level or rate of proinsulin biosynthesis. Thus, if insulin has any effect on the proinsulin <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus,</b> it is a minor one. We conclude that the secreted insulin is not an important mediator of insulin production in response to glucose.

While NRP bacteria are believed to retain some metabolic activity, {{it is not known}} how the stability and functionality of the <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus</b> is maintained. Using the Wayne hypoxia model, we focused on mycobacterial ribosomes and found that, in contrast to enteric bacteria, no higher order structures (e. g. ribosomal dimers) are formed upon entry into stasis. We devised a strategy incorporating microfluidic, proteomic and ribosomal profiling techniques to elucidate the fate of mycobacterial ribosomes during NRP. We compared the stability of wild-type ribosomes to those of mutants in the transcriptional regulator DosR, which cannot survive prolonged oxygen starvation. While stability was comparable under conditions of active growth and normoxic stasis, ΔdosR mutants showed a marked decrease in levels of 70 S ribosomes and 30 S ribosomal subunits under hypoxia. Microfluidic analyses were consistent with these observations and pointed to a progressive degradation of rRNA during prolonged hypoxia, with evidence of discrete rRNA cleavage. Proteomic analysis also supported a gradual degradation of ribosomes and led to the identification of S 30 AE proteins as possible ribosome stabilisation factors. There is an S 30 AE domain protein is the DosR regulon and it may contribute to the observed destabilisation of the ribosome during hypoxia in ΔdosR mutants. Macromolecular stability is further compromised during infection by the presence of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. We used mass spectrometry {{to assess the impact of}} oxidative stress on mycobacterial nucleic acids. We found that RNA was more susceptible to damage.

The objective of this thesis work was to expand upon the set of amino acids available for incorporation into proteins in vivo and to explore applications of the novel chemistries and physical properties provided by the new analogs. Chapter 2 describes the incorporation of new unsaturated analogues of isoleucine, the alkene 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 4 -pentenoic acid and the alkyne 2 -amino- 3 -methyl- 4 -pentynoic acid, by the wild type E. coli <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Incorporation was found to be sensitive to side chain stereochemistry {{in the case of the}} alkene analog; the translational activity of the pairs of enantiomers (SS, RR and SR, RS) were markedly different. We concluded that, although the SS-isomer is a good analogue, the SR-isomer is not incorporated into proteins by this expression host. Chapter 3 focuses on the incorporation of a fluorine-containing noncanonical amino acid, 5, 5, 5 -trifluoroisoleucine, into artificial extracellular matrix proteins. The fluorinated proteins displayed altered solubility phase behavior and were more resistant to degradation by the physiologically relevant protease elastase, yet retained the ability to adhere endothelial cells in a sequence specific manner.

To identify these morphologic forms, the authors have used target electron microscopy. It has been established that elongated cells devoid of side processes possess all the ultrastructural features of differentiated smooth muscle cells: a developed contractile apparatus in the form of microfilament bundles with dense bodies occupying most of the cytoplasm, basal membrane surrounding the whole of the cell, and micropinocytotic vesicles along the plasma membrane. The other morphologic forms have an ultra-structure that allows us to identify them as so-called modified smooth muscle cells. They differ from the typical smooth muscle cells in that they have fewer contractile structures and a more developed <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Some of stellate and irregular shaped cells are utterly devoid of contractile structures. To quantitate the number of cells of different morphologic forms, the authors used alcoholic-alkaline dissociation of prefixed intima. It was established that the intimal population is multiplied at the site of an atherosclerotic lesion, the number of stellate cells being increased much more substantially, compared with other morphologic cell forms. It was found that {{an increase in the number}} of stellate cells is related to such sequelae of atherosclerosis in aorta as intimal thickening, deposition of lipids, and an increased amount of collagen. There was a high positive correlation between the alteration in the stellate cell number occurring in the intima and the above-mentioned parameters (correlation coefficients were 0. 732, 0. 800 and 0. 953, respectively). The correlations between these indexes and the total number of intimal cells or the number of cells belonging to each of the other morphologic forms were not so high.

The minor pigment, Bchl a, is associated primarily with the cell membrane and its reaction centers; and the major light-harvesting antenna pigment, Bchl d, is found primarily in the chlorosomes, which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of the cell membrane. Anesthetic gases, such as N 2 O, ethylene, and acetylene, were found to inhibit the synthesis of Bchl d, but not of Bchl a, thus allowing the cells to grow at high light intensities with a greatly diminished content of antenna pigment. Chlorosomes were absent or sparse in inhibited cells. Porphyrins accumulated in the inhibited cells. The major one was identified as the Bchl precursor magnesium-protoporphyrin IX monomethyl ester (Mg-PPME) by comparative absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography of the porphyrin and its derivatives with those of authentic protoporphyrin IX. Small amounts of Mg-PPME were present in control cells, but the addition of inhibitor caused a rapid increase in the Mg-PPME concentration, accompanying the inhibition of Bchl d synthesis. Cells grown in the presence of ethephon (as a source of ethylene) and allowed to stand in dim light for long periods accumulated large amounts of PPME and other porphyrins and excreted or released porphyrins, which accumulated as a brown precipitate in the culture. Inhibition of Bchl d synthesis was relieved upon removal of the inhibitor. These results suggest that the gases act at a step in pigment biosynthesis that affects the utilization of Mg-PPME for isocyclic ring formation. Synthesis of Bchl d and Bchl a may be differentially affected by the gases because of compartmentation of their <b>biosynthetic</b> <b>apparatus</b> or because competition for precursors favors Bchl a synthesis.

The mutant pheS gene (pheS*), which codes for the α-subunit of the enzyme PheRS and confers relaxed substrate specificity, was encoded on a multiple-copy plasmid that also bears the target gene dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Constitutive over-expression of pheS* and subsequent expression of the target gene {{in the presence of}} phenylatanine analog, para-bromophenylalanine (p-Br-phe), allowed over 85 % replacements of phe residues by p-Br-phe in DHFR. The level of bromination can be controlled by varying the relative amounts of phe and p-Br-phe in the culture medium. Introduction of aryl bromide functionality into proteins offers great potential for selective chemical modification of proteins via transition metal-catalyzed reactions, which are orthogonal to existing protein chemistry. Moreover, bromination may be useful in X-ray studies of proteins via the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) technique. ^ The utility of the aryl bromide as a unique functionality was investigated in collaboration with Isaac Carrico. Artificial extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins were synthesized using the principles of recombinant DNA technology. These proteins were designed for eventual application in vascular grafts. The engineered ECM proteins contained alternating blocks of cell-binding domains derived from CS 1 or CS 5 regions of human fibronectin for endothelial cell attachment, and elastin-like repeats for mechanical integrity. One phe residue per elastin block [(VPGVG) 2 VPGFG(VPGVG) 2] was designed, which could be replaced with p-Br-phe and subsequently used for chemical cross-linking of the proteins. Protein expression yields of 75 – 90 mg/L were obtained with 50 – 60 % substitution of phe by p-Br-phe. Preliminary exploration of Pd(0) -catalyzed Heck and Sonagashira couplings with p-Br-phe demonstrate feasibility of these reactions under mild conditions required for protein modification as well as compatibility with side chains of all natural amino acids (except cysteine). ^ Site-specific incorporation of p-Br-phe was tested in an E. coli strain equipped with a yeast PheRS/tRNA Phe amber supressor pair. While p-F-phe can be site-specifically incorporated using this system, attempts at p-Br-phe incorporation were unsuccessful, probably due to unfavorable interaction of p-Br-phe with the bulky and polar tyrosine residue in the binding pocket of yeast PheRS. ...|$|E
