40|$|International audienceSexual {{selection}} {{acting on}} small initial differences in mating signals and mate preferences can enhance signal–preference codiver-gence and reproductive isolation during speciation. However, {{the origin of}} initial differences in sexual traits remains unclear. We asked whether <b>biotic</b> <b>environments,</b> a source of variation in sexual traits, may provide a general solution to this problem. Specifically, we asked whether genetic variation in <b>biotic</b> <b>environments</b> provided by host plants can result in signal–preference phenotypic covariance in a host-specific, plant-feeding insect. We used {{a member of the}} Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess patterns of variation in male mating signals and female mate preferences induced by genetic variation in host plants. We employed a novel implementation of a quantitative genetics method, rearing field-collected treehop-pers on a sample of naturally occurring replicated host plant clone lines. We found remarkably high signal–preference covariance among host plant genotypes. Thus, genetic variation in <b>biotic</b> <b>environments</b> influences the sexual phenotypes of organisms living on those environments in a way that promotes assortative mating among environments. This consequence arises from conditions likely to be common in nature (phenotypic plasticity and variation in <b>biotic</b> <b>environments).</b> It therefore offers a general answer to how divergent sexual selection may begi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Invasive plants {{strongly}} affect {{physical and}} <b>biotic</b> <b>environments</b> of native ecosystems. Insects and other arthropods {{as one of}} the major components of many ecosystems are very sensitive to subtle changes in abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>environments.</b> We examined the effects of exotic Spartina alterniflora invasion on community structure and diets of arthro-pods in a saltmarsh previously dominated by native Phragmites australis in Yangtze River estuary through net sweeping and plant harvesting methods and stable isotope analysis. Our results showed that diversity indices were not significantly different between exotic and native plant communities, but the total abundance of insects estimated through plant harvesting method was found to be lower in Spartina monoculture than that in Phragmites monoculture. Community structure of insects in Spartina mono-culture was dissimilar to that in Phragmites monoculture and Phragmites–Spartina mixture. Moreover, stable carbon isotope patterns of arthro-pods were significantly different between Phragmites and Spartina monocultures. Although some native arthropods (perhaps generalists) shifted their diets, many native taxa did prefer Phragmites to Spartina even in Spartina monoculture. Spartina invasions resulted in reduced abundances of some arthropds, and increased dominance of others feeding preferably on Spartina. This study provides evidence that invasive plants can change the community structure and diets of native arthropods, which will eventually alter the arthropod food web, and affect the integrity and functioning of native ecosystems within a nature reserve that has been set aside for conserving the native biodiversity and maintaining the ecosystem integrity. In this sense, Spartina invasions in the Yangtze River estuary need to be managed appropriately...|$|R

50|$|Endrin {{regularly}} {{enters the}} environment {{when applied to}} crops or when rain washes it off. It {{has been found in}} water, sediments, atmospheric air and <b>biotic</b> <b>environment,</b> even after uses have been stopped. Organochlorine pesticides strongly resist degradation, are poorly soluble in water but highly soluble in lipids, which is called lipophilic. This leads to bioaccumulation in fatty tissues of organisms, mainly those dwelling in water. A high bioconcentration factor of 1335-10,000 has been reported in fish. Endrin binds very strongly to organic matter in soil and aquatic sediments due to their high adsorption coefficient, making it less likely to leach into groundwater, even though contaminated groundwater samples have been found. In 2009, EPA released data indicating that the endrin in soil could last up to 14 years or more. The extent of endrin's persistence depends highly on local conditions. For example, high temperature (230 °C) or intense sunlight leads to more rapid breakdown of endrin into endrin ketone and endrin aldehyde, however, this breakdown is less than 5%.|$|E

S. cerevisiae possesses multiple genes that each produce invertase, an enzyme that is secreted to digest sucrose {{outside of the}} cell. As discussed above, this public good production creates the potential for individual cells to cheat by stealing the sugar digested by their neighbors without contributing the enzyme themselves. Greig & Travisano (2004) measured the fitness of a cheater type (who possessed a reduced number of invertase genes) relative to a cooperator (who contained all possible invertase genes). By manipulating the level of social interaction within the community by varying the population density, {{they found that the}} cheater is less fit than the cooperator at low levels of sociality, but more fit in dense communities. Therefore, they propose that selection for [...] "cheating" [...] causes natural variation in the amount of invertase genes an individual may possess, and that variation in invertase genes reflects constant adaptation to an ever changing <b>biotic</b> <b>environment</b> that is a consequence of the instability of cooperative interactions.|$|E

On the other hand, stable subdioecy potentially has adaptive significance in relation to variation in abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>environments</b> including the availability of resources and mates (Dorken and Barrett, 2004). In willows, hermaphroditic plants and populations have been found in some species but are exceptional in this genus with strict dioecy (Smith, 1940; Rohwer and Kubitzki, 1984; Falinski, 1998; Rottenberg, 2007). Thus, exceptional hermaphrodites in willows are likely to originate from the initial breakdown of the dioecious system or developmental instability in sex expression.|$|R
40|$|Although much {{is known}} about the {{virulence}} of Helicobacter pylori, the transmission pathways for this bacterium are still unresolved. Transmission has been addressed through: (1) prevalence within families; (2) detection in fecal/oral environments; (3) detection in the abiotic/biotic environment; and (4) direct inference from strain similarity. Here, we review the molecular and biochemical methods used and discuss the relative merits of each. Furthermore, as there are differences between developing and developed nations, we discuss the results obtained from transmission studies in light of the study population. We conclude that H. pylori is probably transmitted person-to-person, facilitated by fecal–oral transmission during episodes of diarrhea or gastro-oral contact during periods of vomiting. The persistence of H. pylori in abiotic and <b>biotic</b> <b>environments</b> remains unproven but possible reactivation from viable, non-culturable coccoid forms should be further investigated.

These mixed communities of generalists and specialists are differently influenced by host phylogenetic relationships, geographic and environmental factors. The presence of Flavobacteriaceae is strictly determined by host phylogeny, indicating an obligate symbiotic association and vertical transmission of these bacteria. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of symbiont and host indicate a complex pattern of coevolution that is obscured by factors such as host-switching and incomplete sorting of symbionts within host lineages...|$|R

Here we studied differences in competitive ability between Chromolaena odorata plants of populations from nonnative versus native ranges, considering biogeographical differences in both <b>biotic</b> and abiotic <b>environments.</b> An intraspecific competition experiment was conducted at two nutrient levels in a common garden. In both low and high nutrient treatments, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed consistently lower root to shoot ratios than did plants from native ranges grown in both monoculture and competition. In the low nutrient treatment, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed significantly lower competitive ability (competition-driven decreases in plant height and biomass were more), which was associated with their lower root to shoot ratios and higher total leaf phenolic content (defense trait). In the high nutrient treatment, C. odorata plants from nonnative ranges showed lower leaf toughness and cellulosic contents (defense traits) but similar competitive ability compared with plants from native ranges, which was also associated with their lower root to shoot ratios.
