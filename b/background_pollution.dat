Such research {{was carried out in}} the Bakar bay, on the northern Adriatic coast of Croatia, for simultancous hourly series of SO 2 concentration and wind velocity. It turned out that the minimum value of SO 2 concentration which could not be cleared away any longer by meteorological factors did not depend upon the change in intensity of the local sea and land breeze circulation and its dispersive potentials. Still, when wind directions were taken into account, the different impact of distant and close emission upon the local <b>background</b> <b>pollution</b> could be detected...|$|E

40|$|Voltage flicker is an irritating problem {{especially}} for the low voltage (LV) customers. It is mainly caused by the loads having repetitive cycle of operation. During the past years, the network operators {{around the world have}} registered many complaints from the customers about flicker related problems. Presently, there is no common standard value for the flicker planning level available globally. Moreover, in some countries (for example, in the Netherlands), the existing networks are not even based on a specific planning level value for flicker. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss the flicker planning level values in different voltage levels to overcome flicker related problems. In this paper a typical LV network is simulated to analyze the flicker propagation behavior in the network. The effects of switching LV disturbing loads (such as elevator, welding machine, etc.) on flicker generation at different customer's installations are studied by using synchronized measurement technique. Also, the impacts of the <b>background</b> flicker <b>pollution</b> transferred from the upstream to the downstream networks are analyzed. The simulation results give an overview of the flicker pollution levels at the LV customer's installations in the presence of background flicker.

As China {{economy has been}} growing fast with an annually increasing ratio of about 9. 8 % {{in the past three}} decades, its environmental problems are mostly getting worse. In the future, more environmental restraints would be imposed on the economic development, and bigger pressures of major pollutants reduction will be ensued, so policy innovation of environmental pollution prevention and control should be impeded. Emission trading pilot projects has emerged in China since late 1980 ’s, but advanced very slowly. However, with great efforts in environmental protection of the governments these years, environmental monitoring and supervision and management capacities have been greatly increased, in particular in some sectors or regions, and with these years pilot projects exploration, lots of policy implementation experiences of emission trading also gained. Under such <b>backgrounds,</b> <b>pollution</b> emission trading programs developed rapidly especially since 2007, though the happened emission trading case mostly concentrated on SO 2 emission trade in the fire power generation industry, and COD emission trade in some small and medium-sized basins, development trends of emission trading has become vigorous. This paper reviewed systematically practices and progresses of atmosphere and water pollutants emission trade in China during the past two decades, several key issues influencing the advancement of emission trade pilot projects were identified and discussed, the results showed main factors influencing emission trading programs are the shortage of supporting laws and rules, imperfect initial pricing and allocation methods of the emission permits, lower capacities of pollution monitoring and supervising and management, less market scale of emissions trading, and the vague relationship of emissions trading policy with other related environmental policies. And lastly, the paper proposed the pilot roadmap for implementing emissions trade...|$|R
