5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two launch titles for the Nintendo64, but missed the release window. Gold released in North America on November 25, 1996, {{and in other}} countries the following year, on May 9, 1997. Its soundtrack received a compact disc release, which was rare for Western video games in the 1990s. Rare, under contract, ultimately finished its Super NES port of Killer Instinct2, but Nintendo chose not to release it.|$|E

The division landed near Glasgow, Scotland, then proceeded to a British Army base near London to continue training. Juskalian, who became the assistant plans and operations officer on the regimental staff, went to Inveraray, Scotland, to train for the North African Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{decision}} to sell the two 767s, management also decided to sell the four remaining F-28s. This would allow Braathens to operate a fleet of pure 737-200, giving lower operating costs. One 737 {{was taken out of}} service in 1984, and the four F-28s sold in 1986. The same year, seven more 737-200s were delivered, along with two more in 1987 and 1988. By then, Braathens SAFEs entire fleet consisted of nineteen 737-200s. At the same time, Boeing had launched the 737-300, a slightly larger aircraft with new CFM-56 engines. Braathens SAFE considered the new aircraft, but where concerned that it used a traditional mechanical cockpit. The airline also needed larger aircraft for the charter traffic, and smaller aircraft for the domestic routes. The airline also considered the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and the Airbus A320, but settled on the 737 following the announcement of the stretched 737-400, with 156 seats, and the shortened 737-500, with 124 seats. These had glass cockpits, and Braathens SAFE would <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> airlines to receive both models. To finance the purchase, the airline sold all but two of the 737-200s and leased them back. For some of the aircraft, they received more money than they had paid.|$|E

The major impact of his religious writings, in the long run, was the conversion of Persia from Sunni to Shia Islam.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholism is {{normally}} associated with nutritional deficiencies, which {{may contribute to}} the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Thiamine, vitamin B-12, and folic acid are vitamins that play an essential role in the peripheral and central nervous system and should <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> analyzed in laboratory tests. It has been difficult to assess thiamine status in individuals due to difficulties in developing a method to directly assay thiamine in the blood and urine. A liver function test may also be ordered, as alcoholic consumption may cause an increase in liver enzyme levels.|$|E

However, a rival Italian king in the form of Rudolph II of Burgundy meant that Hugh was {{not in a position to}} help John, and the next few years were a time of anarchy and confusion in Italy.|$|E

25|$|With the {{consideration}} of its high-profile development team, {{as well as the}} fact that it was a front-runner PlayStation 2 release, The Bouncer was highly anticipated. However, the game was perceived as a disappointment by many, and was largely seen as mediocre. Numerous aspects from the E3 trailer, such as destructible scenery, were removed in the final game, possibly in order to get the game out in time to <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> batch of PlayStation 2 titles. Much of the criticism, however, fell on the gameplay. IGN found the controls average and the camera angles to become a major issue in the later portions of the game, where the player is confined to tight spaces. The game was also seen as having an excessive amount of cutscenes and load screens. GameCritics' Brad Galloway, for example, argued actual gameplay constitutes less than one third of the game's length.|$|E
25|$|In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief {{geologist}} for the U.S. Geological Survey, {{investigated the}} crater {{and concluded that}} it {{was the result of a}} volcanic steam explosion. Gilbert had assumed that if it were an impact crater then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should be present on the rim. Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this would generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert's calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris on the rim were roughly equivalent, so that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing, nor were there any magnetic anomalies. Gilbert argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were coincidental. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, however, Gilbert would <b>be</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> to propose that the Moon's craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism.|$|E

The Chinese also mounted over 3,000 bronze and iron cast cannon on the Great Wall of China, to defend themselves from the Mongols. The weapon was later taken up by both the Mongol conquerors. Chinese soldiers fighting under the Mongols appear to have used hand cannon in Manchurian battles during 1288, a date deduced from archaeological findings at battle sites.|$|E
