However, the player can win an additional life for Crash <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by restarting the current episode.|$|E

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them. Crash will lose a life if he is hit by an enemy or obstacle, or falls into a bottomless pit. Crash can protect himself <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or obstacle (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility.

5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E

5|$|Star Fox Command {{supports}} {{six players}} in local wireless multiplayer matches via DS Download Play {{and up to}} three players on the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. In Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection matches, only the Arwing II is available. Players score not by killing opponents, but <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> stars from them when they have been destroyed. It is also possible to collect a star from an opponent not killed by the player. This is {{a modified version of}} the mode from Star Fox 64/Lylat Wars. Nintendo WiFi uses a ranking system based on rankings of the alphabet with Z being the lowest and A being the highest. Players work their way up from Z <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> wins (it could be based on points). For every win a player gains a certain amount of percent and once they reach 100% they move to the next letter. The highest rank a player can get is 100% of the A rank.|$|E

5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} rings scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding rings causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without rings causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> rings. Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of rings to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the player}} can use {{firearms}} to kill monsters, Resident Evil emphasizes evasion over fast-paced combat {{by providing the}} player with limited ammunition. The player has {{a limited amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by monsters. Nevertheless, players can regain their health <b>by</b> <b>collecting</b> and using herbs, which can be mixed with other herbs to increase their healing effect. Some monsters can also infect the player with a poisoning effect, which gradually depletes the player's health over time until the poison is cured with serum or special herbs. Zombies that are defeated but not decapitated or burned eventually revive and mutate into much deadlier opponents.|$|E
