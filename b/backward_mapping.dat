40|$|Abstract: Parametric {{design for}} complex {{engineering}} systems {{at the early}} stage involves identifying feasible candidates for detailed stages that satisfy multiple performance requirements at different levels. Conventional methods, using system analysis through “trial-and-error ” iterations to pursue optimal solutions, are not robust and inflexible for further design and performance changes. In this paper, several methods are studied and a <b>Backward</b> <b>Mapping</b> approach is presented {{to deal with this}} problem. The <b>Backward</b> <b>Mapping</b> Methodology can help design engineers quickly identify robust design alternatives through set-to-set mappings from performance space to design space in complex system designs. In this approach, comprehensible and efficient surrogate models are used to increase design knowledge and expedite the design process. The use of design regions with desirable levels of confidence not only enhances the robustness of design under a high degree of uncertainty but also offers more alternatives for better decision making at the early and later design stage. The main framework of the approach is demonstrated by using an example of vehicle system design at the early stage. The preliminary results show the effectiveness of this approach and its potential applications in different engineering design scenarios.

Specifically, {{the focus is on}} the Federal School to Work Opportunities Act of 1994 and its implementation in 47 school districts in upstate New York as part of a consortium during the 1995 - 96 school year. The purpose of the study was to determine 1) the extent to which an agreement to participate in a consortium arrangement designed to facilitate the implementation of a specific Federal or state policy resulted in the active implementation efforts by individual consortium members, and 2) how a high school setting where School to Work activities were perceived by local stakeholders as having great specific and important effects differed from a high school setting where School to Work activities were perceived by local stakeholders as having some or no effect. A bottom-up <b>backward</b> <b>mapping</b> policy analysis model was used for the purposes of this study. Local level data was used to create performance, environment, technology implementation, and School to Work implementation profiles of local high schools. Regression and correlation analyses were used to determine the relationship between stakeholder perceptions and local high school characteristics. Results of the study were reported and interpreted with the aim of furthering research and knowledge of policy analysis and the use of local level data to determine the success of policy implementation. This study found that variation between federal intent and local adaptation is explained by characteristics of the high school and perceptions of stakeholders. School to Work policy implementation, perceived by the high school administrator as a stakeholder, varied significantly by high school student performance, environment in which the high school operates, and level of technology implementation in the high school.
