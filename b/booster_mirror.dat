40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This paper represents the results on data collected under actual outdoor conditions for artificially roughened and smooth solar air heaters with and without booster mirrors. The {{results show that the}} effect of boosting of solar radiation is appreciable and consequently, the thermal efficiency of the roughened collectors with booster mirrors increases further over the roughened ones without any further increase in the pressure drop over that in the roughened ones. The values of the collector heat removal factor and collector efficiency factor of roughened solar air heaters with booster mirrors have been found to increase by 12. 6 % and 11. 9 % respectively over the roughened ones without booster mirrors and 45. 6 % and 46. 5 % respectively over the smooth ones with booster mirrors and 144. 1 % and 141 % respectively over the smooth ones. For a given value of relative roughness height of 0. 022 and relative roughness pitch of 15,the value of thermal performance of roughened collector with <b>booster</b> <b>mirror</b> and without <b>booster</b> <b>mirror</b> have been found out to be about 54 % and 46 % respectively. A maximum of 1. 865 % of uncertainty in the value of thermal performance have been found. Such solar air heaters are thermally useful quantitatively and qualitatively both...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigher {{value of}} {{intensity}} of radiation on absorber plate of solar air heaters and effective heat removal from the plate by the carrier fluid, air, enhances thermal performance of solar air heaters. The paper deals with the experimental results of enhancing the {{intensity of radiation}} by means of <b>booster</b> <b>mirrors</b> and that of heat transfer by means of providing artificial roughness on the air flow side of the absorber plate. An enhancement in radiation of about 40 % have been found over the normal incident radiation by means of <b>booster</b> <b>mirrors</b> leading to higher rate of heat collection. The thermal performance parameters FR and F’ {{have been found to}} increase in the range of 90 % to 130 % and 92 % to 135 % respectively in comparison to those of smooth solar air heaters without <b>booster</b> <b>mirrors</b> and in the range of 10 % to 15 % in comparison to roughened solar air heater without <b>booster</b> <b>mirrors</b> for the same pressure drop due to artificial roughness within the range of the parameters investigated...|$|R
50|$|Hank Florence plays Jack, a {{treasure}} collector {{who works for}} the Imagine Museum. Each episode he travels to Imagine Island with his robot assistant, Booster, to collect treasures for the museum. The show employs the clever device of having Booster speak the viewer's native language, while Jack only speaks English. <b>Booster</b> <b>mirrors</b> Jack's dialog somewhat, so the viewer is able to understand. Each episode focuses on a letter of the alphabet, and teaches it through vocabulary words, songs, and stories. Instruction is reinforced through repetition. About 2/3 of each episode is content from the computer software, with the remaining 1/3 being scenes with Jack and Booster. Jack is shot on a green screen, so Booster, the island, and all other characters are animated.|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{design work}} on the New Generation Space Telescope (NGST) is {{currently}} under way. This telescope is envisioned as a lightweight, deployable Cassegrain reflector with an aperture of 8 meters, and an effective focal length of 80 meters. It is to be folded into a small-diameter package for launch by an Atlas booster, and unfolded in orbit. The primary is to consist of an octagon with a hole at the center, and with eight segments arranged in a flower petal configuration about the octagon. The comers of the petal-shaped segments are to be trimmed so that the package will fit atop the Atlas <b>booster.</b> This <b>mirror,</b> along with its secondary will focus the light from a point source into an image which is spread from a point by diffraction effects, figure errors, and scattering {{of light from the}} surface. The distribution of light in the image of a point source is called a point spread function (PSF). The obstruction of the incident light by the secondary mirror and its support structure, the trimmed corners of the petals, and the grooves between the segments all cause the diffraction pattern characterizing an ideal point spread function to be changed, with the trimmed comers causing the rings of the Airy pattern to become broken up, and the linear grooves causing diffraction spikes running radially away from the central spot, or Airy disk. Any figure errors the mirror segments may have, or any errors in aligning the petals with the central octagon will also spread the light out from the ideal point spread function. A point spread function for a mirror the size of the NGST and having an incident wavelength of 900 nm is considered. Most of the light is confined in a circle with a diameter of 0. 05 arc seconds. The ring pattern ranges in intensity from 10 (exp - 2) near the center to 10 (exp - 6) {{near the edge of the}} plotted field, and can be clearly discerned in a log plot of the intensity. The total fraction of the light scattered from this point spread function is called the total integrated scattering (TIS), and the fraction remaining is called the Strehl ratio. The angular distribution of the scattered light is called the angle resolved scattering (ARS), and it shows a strong spike centered on a scattering angle of zero, and a broad, less intense distribution at larger angles. It is this scattered light, and its effect on the point spread function which is the focus of this study...|$|R
