This paper assesses solar hybridisation of boiler based steam power plants, whichpreheat boiler combustion air with a novel high temperature CST system based on a solid particle receiver (SPR). This new method of preheating {{has the potential to}} increase the solar share of the overall system, improve fuel saving and therefore produce a higher solar to electric conversion efficiency. These benefits result from theSPR solar systems higher operating temperature and integrated thermal storage. The integrated thermal storage also allows a buffered response time for handling transients in the intermittent solar resource. Analysis indicates that air-solarisation of coal plants can result in significantly higher solar to electric conversion efficiency than existing solar hybridisation options. Solarisation by TBS decreases power cycle efficiency due to <b>bleed</b> <b>steam</b> reduction, while solarisation by air-preheating increases the power system efficiency, primarily due to enhanced boiler efficiency brought about by reduced stack losses. The air solarisation option proposed in this paper has beencompared to current TBS with Fresnel based technology.

Annual simulation tools, which calculate the performance of the solar field, receiver, storage (when applicable) and other system components, were used to model the output of the solar technologies. These tools, coupled with available economic data and cost models for the newly developed solar components, were used to calculate the levelized cost of energy of the compared hybridisation options.

30|$|A {{solution}} {{like this}} has many advantages because a substantial rise in the temperature of steam, especially reheated steam, increases {{the problem of the}} difference between the <b>bleed</b> <b>steam</b> and the saturation temperatures in regenerative heaters fed with bleeds from the intermediate-pressure turbine, which are situated right after the steam reheater. This causes material and thermodynamic problems because, with the rise in the mean difference in temperature of the heat-exchanging agents, the exergy losses rise too which leads to a reduction in the process effectiveness and to an increase in the heating steam consumption. By keeping pressures in the bleeds of the auxiliary turbine at the same level as in the intermediate-pressure turbine, the temperature difference in the exchangers will be much lower (the outlet of this turbine is even in the area of saturated steam). Another advantage of the master cycle is that the construction of an intermediate-pressure turbine without bleeds is much simpler and cheaper. This is essential in view of the need to use expensive construction materials. Lower temperatures of the steam in the bleeds from the driving turbine, compared to the intermediate-pressure turbine, result in an increase in the mass flow from them. This causes a reduction in the steam mass flow to the reheater, i.e., lower costs of the reheated steam pipelines and of the reheater in the boiler. The steam mass flow from the main turbine into the condenser is also smaller which decreases heat losses of the cycle.|$|E

Dicho método consistirá en la utilización de un algoritmo genético, que buscará maximizar el rendimiento de la central y minimizar el coste de la electricidad. El diseño de centrales térmicas con rendimientos elevados es fundamental para el sector energético. Mejoras marginales en el funcionamiento de las instalaciones de producción de energía eléctrica disminuyen significativamente el coste de generación. La obtención de estas mejoras permite a las empresas del sector ser más competitivas en los mercados eléctricos modernos. El conjunto de parámetros que gobierna el rendimiento de la central es numeroso, e incluye el número de calentadores cerrados, la presión de las extracciones o las temperaturas en los calentadores. Incrementar el rendimiento termodinámico de una central térmica supone un aumento del coste de los componentes de la misma. Esto da lugar a que la optimización de una central térmica sea un problema complejo que no tiene solución única, y que debe tener en cuenta las limitaciones técnicas de los propios componentes de la instalación. Para el desarrollo del programa de optimización se utilizó el software Matlab, que permite implementar un algoritmo genético de forma sencilla y construir una interfaz de usuario para el programa. La herramienta informática desarrollada permite la configuración de los parámetros que definen a la central de manera intuitiva, permitiendo escoger entre establecer las variables de diseño como valores fijos o rangos. Cuando una variable se establece como rango, el algoritmo genético busca el valor óptimo dentro del rango proporcionado. El tren de calentadores de una central térmica cumple la función de elevar el rendimiento termodinámico del ciclo. Mediante la extracción de vapor procedente de las turbinas del ciclo, se eleva la temperatura del agua de alimentación de la caldera. El aumento de rendimiento se produce al disminuir el consumo de combustible, puesto que la carga del generador de vapor se reduce. Físicamente, el tren de calentadores está compuesto por intercambiadores de calor cerrados y un intercambiador abierto. Se detalla en este proyecto un método de cálculo para resolver un ciclo termodinámico Rankine y obtener el coste de la electricidad de una central térmica. Adicionalmente se dimensionarán los calentadores cerrados que componen el tren de calentadores. Se han estudiado diversas configuraciones del tren de calentadores en centrales térmicas mediante el programa creado. Tras el análisis de las soluciones óptimas, se concluye que es posible mejorar los diseños industriales modernos mediante la modificación de la presión de las extracciones y la temperatura de los calentadores. Aunque las configuraciones existentes hoy en día se acercan a los valores óptimos, mejorar el tren de calentadores puede suponer incrementos de entre el 0. 5 y el 1 % de rendimiento, y disminuciones de entre el 1 y el 2 % del coste. Debe notarse {{sin embargo}} que estos resultados están sujetos a la incertidumbre de las funciones de costes, y a que se deben analizar aspectos adicionales del funcionamiento de una central térmica (como pueden ser los procesos de arranque y operación a carga parcial) para validar los resultados. The {{purpose of this}} project {{is to develop a}} method for the optimization of the feedwater heater train of a subcritical coal power plant. Using a genetic algorithm, the thermodynamic efficiency will be maximized and the cost of electricity minimized. Thus, the mathematical problem becomes a multi-objective optimization. The design of high-performance power stations is a matter of great importance for the electric power industry. Marginal improvements in power plant operations and efficiency can have a substantial impact in the cost of generation. In order to better compete in the evolving electricity markets, utilities are in a constant pursuit of these advances. The set of parameters which determines the efficiency of a coal power plant has several components, such as the number of closed feedwater preheaters, the turbine steam bleed pressures, or the temperatures in the feedwater preheaters. The design trade-offs between increasing the efficiency and decreasing the cost of electricity are a significant challenge for engineers. Due to this trade-offs, the design problem has multiple solutions. To guarantee the validity of the solutions, the technical limitations of the power plant equipment must be always accounted for. The optimization software has been developed using the Matlab environment, which provides the user with a simple method for the implementation of a genetic algorithm, and also includes the tools needed to develop a graphical user interface. The developed software tool allows the user to set the values of the optimization parameters in a simple way, and to choose which parameters shall be fixed or shall be a range. When a range is chosen, the genetic algorithm will search for an optimal value within the range provided. The feedwater heater train fulfills the purpose of increasing the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle. By means of <b>bleed</b> <b>steam</b> from the turbine, the water heading to the steam generator is heated up. The efficiency rises {{as a consequence of the}} reduced thermal load in the steam generator, which leads to a reduced fuel consumption. The feedwater heater train itself is composed of several closed heat exchangers and one open heat exchanger. In this project, a method to solve a Rankine thermodynamic cycle and calculate the cost of electricity is described. Additionally, the closed feedwater heaters will be dimensioned. Several different feedwater heater train configurations were studied using the developed software. After analysing the results, it is concluded that modern industrial designs can be improved through a combination of modifying the steam bleed pressure and the feedwater heater temperature. Though the configurations used today are close to the optimal values, enhancing the feedwater heater train can lead to increases of between 0. 5 and 1 % in thermodynamic efficiency, and to reductions of between 1 and 2 % in the cost of electricity. However, it should be noticed that these results are subject to uncertainties in the cost functions, and that additional aspects of a power plant operation -such as startup procedures and partial load operation- should be analysed in order to validate the solutions.

The hybrid cooling system described in the paper, consisting of a metal hydride heat pump operating in conjunction with the existing wet cooling tower, is capable of achieving water saving by reducing the temperature of warm water entering the cooling tower. Cooler inlet water temperatures effectively reduce the cooling load on existing towers. This will ultimately reduce the amount of water lost to the air by evaporation whilst still achieving the same cooling output.

Utility companies are required to reduce CO 2 emission from thermal power stations and make various efforts to improve thermal efficiency and to utilize carbon neutral fuels such as biomass fuels. CCS (CO 2 capture and storage) technology is regarded as one method to reduce CO 2 emission, but CCS required great decrease of thermal efficiency. As amount of fossil fuel on the globe is so restricted, {{it is important to}} keep high thermal efficiency as high as possible, in order to utilize valuable fossil fuel effectively. This project plans to develop innovative gasification technology with CO 2 capture, which can keep thermal efficiency as high as state of the art IGCC plant, namely more than 40 %. This is to gasify coal with mixed gas of O 2 and recycled CO 2 flue gas, just like oxy-fuel combustion system. We expect following two merits. First merit is to simplify the system. As the CO 2 concentration in exhaust gas is almost 100 %, this system doesn’t require CO 2 separation unit. So no steam is required to <b>bleed</b> from <b>steam</b> cycle in order to maintain absorber for CO 2, therefore thermal efficiency is kept high even after capturing CO 2.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{mathematical}} model based on set of nonlinear equations has been developed for synthesis of multiple effect evaporator (MEE) systems. As evaporator house {{is one of the}} most energy intensive units of pulp and paper industries, different configurations are considered in the model to reduce the energy consumption. These are condensate, feed and product flashing, vapor <b>bleeding,</b> <b>steam</b> splitting, etc. Along with these the present model also accounts the complexities of real MEE system such as variable physical properties, boiling point rise. Along with complexities discussed above, the present model also accounts the fouling resistance. For this purpose a linear correlation is developed to predict fouling resistance based on velocity as well as temperature difference. The fouling resistance observed by this correlation is within the limit shown in the literature (Muller-Steinhagen and Branch, 1997). It reduces overall heat transfer coefficient by 11. 5 % on average. For the present study two MEE systems of typical Indian pulp and paper industries are considered. First MEE system selected for modeling and simulation is seven effect evaporator system located in north India which is being operated in a nearby Indian Kraft Paper Mill for concentrating weak black liquor using plate falling film evaporators. This system employs steam splitting in first two effects, feed and product flashing along with primary and secondary condensate flashing to generate auxiliary vapor, which are then used in vapor bodies of appropriate effects to improve overall steam economy of the system. The second system used for present study is located in south India. It is ten effect evaporator system used for concentrating black liquor and being operated in mixed flow sequence. In this system feed and steam splitting as well as vapor bleeding is employed. For seven effect evaporator system total fourteen models are developed. Initially, a simplest model without any variation is derived based on mass and energy balance. Further, it is improved by incorporating different configurations such as variation in physical properties, BPR, steam splitting, feed, product and condensate flashing and vapor bleeding. These models are developed with and without fouling resistance. The governing equations of these models are nonlinear in nature. Further, it is observed that for these models the number of equations as well as the number of variables are equal and hence unique solution exist for all cases. The set of nonlinear algebraic equations are solved using software called ‘system of non linear equations’. However, in the present work to incorporate the complex interactions of variables during solution of model an iterative procedure is used. For seven effect evaporator system total 14 models are proposed to visualize that how individual configuration is affecting the steam economy of the MEE system. The comparison shows that maximum steam economy is observed for the model where flashing as well as vapor bleeding are used. In comparison to the simplest system the improvement in steam economy through best model is found as 27. 3 %. The modified seven effect evaporator system, obtained using best model, requires four shell and tube heat exchangers and five pumps. This modification has total capital investment as Rs 29. 3 lakh. However, saving in steam consumption is found as Rs 21. 8 lakh/year thus, total payback period for the modified seven effect evaporator system is 1. 3 years. For ten effect evaporator system improvement in steam economy is observed by 12. 8 % in comparison to existing system. It incorporates three preheaters which use bled vapor from the system. Based on the comparison with published model as well as industrial data it is found that the present model can be effectively applied to simulate the real MEE system and improve the steam economy of MEE system by 15 %...|$|R
