5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your <b>back</b> <b>wheel.</b> That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} gas motor-assisted bicycle designs was the Millet {{motorcycle}} developed by Félix Millet in France in 1892. Millet's designs had both pedals and a fixed-crankshaft radial engine built into the <b>back</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|Moore's winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a {{diamond-shaped}} iron downtube and a {{top tube}} and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, including the wheels. The <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> has a diameter of 31inches, the front 38inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the front hub), so the gear is low. The machine's saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.|$|E

25|$|While {{trying to}} support his family, Knievel {{recalled}} the Joie Chitwood show he saw as a boy and decided {{that he could do}} something similar using a motorcycle. Promoting the show himself, Knievel rented the venue, wrote the press releases, set up the show, sold the tickets and served as his own master of ceremonies. After enticing the small crowd with a few wheelies, he proceeded to jump a twenty-foot-long box of rattlesnakes and two mountain lions. Despite landing short and having his <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> hit the box containing the rattlesnakes, Knievel managed to land safely.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} the Ronde's narrow and badly {{surfaced}} hills came close to tragedy when Danish rider Jesper Skibby was hit from behind by an official's car and fell onto a roadside bank, still strapped into his pedals. The official's car then tried to pass him and ran over Skibby's <b>back</b> <b>wheel,</b> narrowly missing his leg. The race official continued to the finish, where he was met by angry spectators throwing mud, cups and stones at his car. The incident overshadowed the victory of Claude Criquielion, the first French-speaking Belgian winner of the Tour of Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} <b>back</b> <b>wheel,</b> so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a braking force with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E

25|$|Knievel's daredevil show {{broke up}} after the Barstow {{performance}} because injuries prevented him from performing. After recovering, Knievel started traveling from small town to small town as a solo act. To get ahead of other motorcycle stunt people who were jumping animals or pools of water, Knievel started jumping cars. He began adding more and more cars to his jumps when {{he would return to}} the same venue to get people to come out and see him again. Knievel had not had a serious injury since the Barstow performance, but on June 19 in Missoula, Montana, he attempted to jump twelve cars and a cargo van. The distance he had for takeoff did not allow him to get up enough speed. His <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> hit the top of the van while his front wheel hit the top of the landing ramp. Knievel ended up with a severely broken arm and several broken ribs. The crash and subsequent stay in the hospital were a publicity windfall.|$|E
2500|$|Mounting {{requires}} skill. The rider {{must first}} grasp the handlebar and place {{one foot on}} a peg above the <b>back</b> <b>wheel.</b> Then the rider scoots the bicycle forward to gain momentum and quickly jumps up onto the seat while continuing to steer the bicycle and maintain balance.|$|E
2500|$|Peugeot HYmotion3 compressor, {{a hybrid}} scooter is a three-wheeler that uses two {{separate}} power sources {{to power the}} front and back wheels. The <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> is powered by a single cylinder 125 cc, [...] single cylinder motor while the front wheels are each driven by their own electric motor. When the bike is moving up to 10km/h only the electric motors are used on a stop-start basis reducing the amount of carbon emissions.|$|E

In a race at Iwaki-Taira Velodrome on December 14, 2008, separate infractions resulted in the disqualification of the entire field; {{all but one of}} the competitors were handed a one-year suspension by the velodrome after the race. The suspensions were lifted four months later.|$|E
2500|$|The other style, the [...] "ghost rider," [...] when {{performed}} correctly, can {{be faster}} than the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] style, but has the tendency to be more dangerous, {{which is one of}} the reasons why it is no longer taught to rookies during rookie week. In order to perform the exchange the rider goes through all the same steps as in the [...] "dismount to mount" [...] exchange, except, instead of stepping off the bike, the rider sets the handlebars and then grabs hold of the seat. Once set, the rider will push herself off the back of the bike while it is still moving. As long as the handle bars stay in line and the rider clears the <b>back</b> <b>wheel,</b> then the bike will keep going straight on its own until the other rider grabs hold and jumps on. The name [...] "ghost rider" [...] comes from the fact that when the first rider gets off, the bike keeps going as if someone were really still on it, like a ghost. There are several risks to this exchange. The first is if the first rider doesn't set the handle bars properly, then when she lets go, the bike will swerve and the rider will be thrown from the bike, and possibly take out other members of hers or other teams. Any rider performing this exchange must also be careful to clear the <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> of the bike or else face the inevitable injuries associated with this type of accident. Another risk is that the second rider can miss the bike and it will cut into other teams exchanges or even worse, race traffic. In the women's race, the only team to consistently use this technique is Kappa Alpha Theta.|$|E

2500|$|Wallenda then {{crossed the}} high-wire on an {{ordinary}} bicycle with the tires and handlebars removed. Near completion, he paused, causing the bike to slide backward as it lost {{grip on the}} wire. He regained control and finished, then jumped onto the roof of Prudential Center and hugged {{his wife and three}} children. He explained in an interview: [...] "The <b>back</b> <b>wheel</b> started to slip... It was a little nerve-racking at the end." [...] Five years later, he said the slip was closest he ever came to disaster. [...] "It really shook me up", he recalled. [...] By completing the ride, Wallenda set the world record for both highest and longest bike ride on a high-wire. A representative from Guinness World Records was on hand to present him with a certificate documenting the achievement.|$|E

He just sat there, so we picked up the pace again. It was still no problem for him. I looked over my shoulder {{and he gave me}} a half-mocking, half-friendly grin. In the end, we went as hard as we could to try {{to get rid of him}} and teach the little brat a lesson, because by now he was getting a bit too cocky for our tastes. But whatever we did, he still hung on. After about an hour, we came into a village called Ploegsteert, at which point he came alongside with real arrogance and said 'OK, I'm back home now, so 'bye. By the way, I'm Frank Vandenbroucke.' Neither of us had ever met a kid like him." ...|$|E
