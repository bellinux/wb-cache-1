500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the <b>bottom</b> <b>board</b> (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E
2500|$|Common {{mechanical}} controls generally rely on disruption of {{some aspect of}} the mites' lifecycle. [...] These controls are generally intended not to eliminate all mites, but merely to maintain the infestation at a level which the colony can tolerate. [...] Examples of {{mechanical controls}} include drone brood sacrifice (varroa mites are preferentially attracted to the drone brood), powdered sugar dusting (which encourages cleaning behavior and dislodges some mites), screened bottom boards (so any dislodged mites fall through the bottom and away from the colony), brood interruption and, perhaps, downsizing of the brood cell size. A device called the varroa mite control entrance (VMCE) is under development as of 2008. The VMCE works in conjunction with a screened <b>bottom</b> <b>board,</b> by dislodging varroa mites from bees as they enter and exit a hive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Australia {{does not}} have varroa mite. However, we {{investigated}} whether modified hive <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> used for varroa mite management in honey bee colonies had other benefits, for honey production. We compared a number of colony parameters between hives fitted with tube, mesh and conventional (solid) <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> in two locations in eastern Australian, Richmond NSW and Castlemaine Victoria. Colonies housed in hives with mesh and tube <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> were not significantly superior to those in hives with conventional <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> with regard to bee flight activity, nor did they produce more honey, brood or stored pollen, in either experimental site. Although the trial was conducted over only one season, {{it is suggested that}} there may be no benefit in Australian bee keepers changing from using conventional <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> in the absence of varroamite.

While automated handling equipment {{can be designed}} for this, often it can operate faster and more effectively if the bottom edges of a pallet have <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> oriented in both directions.

2500|$|According to tradition, the qin {{originally}} had five strings, representing the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth. Later, in the Zhou dynasty, Zhou Wen Wang added a sixth string to mourn his son, Bo Yihou. His successor, Zhou Wu Wang, added a seventh string to motivate his troops into {{battle with the}} Shang. The thirteen hui on the surface represent the 13 {{months of the year}} (the extra 13th is the 'leap month' in the lunar calendar). The surface board is round to represent Heaven and the <b>bottom</b> <b>board</b> flat to represent earth. The entire length of the qin (in Chinese measurements) is 3 chi, 6 cun and 5 fen; representing the 365 days of the year (though this is just a standard since qins can be shorter or longer depending on the period's measurement standard or the maker's preference). Each part of the qin has meaning, some more obvious, like [...] "dragon pool" [...] and [...] "phoenix pond".|$|E

60|$|I {{was looking}} through the glasses, and I saw the oar-blade shatter as he shot. Henderson {{duplicated}} it, selecting Harrison’s right oar. The boat slewed around. The two remaining oars were quickly broken. The men tried to row with the splinters, and had them shot out of their hands. Kelly ripped up a <b>bottom</b> <b>board</b> and began paddling, but dropped it with a cry of pain as its splinters drove into his hands. Then they gave up, letting the boat drift till a second boat, sent from the shore by Wolf Larsen, took them in tow and brought them aboard.|$|E
50|$|In an open boat it {{is often}} {{fastened}} to the keel and hog {{in such a way}} that it can be removed for maintenance. Again, it lies above the boat's frames or timbers as they cross the hog but in this instance, its main function is frequently to provide a means of holding down the <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> {{in such a way that}} they can easily be removed for maintenance. The keelson of an open boat is normally arranged to be flush with the <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> so as to reduce the chance of the crew's tripping over it.|$|R

This is a cheap and cheerful technique maybe called [...] in some parts but usually, in England at least, [...] "turnin'-em-over". It is the sort of thing which used to be found in Scandinavian-built boats but even with iron nails, on the lands, they were usually properly clenched over roves. Nails fastening timbers were sometimes turned over, particularly where removable <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> were to rest on the timbers. However, it was possible to tread the <b>bottom</b> <b>boards</b> onto the clenched nails and where marks were left, gouge out recesses to accommodate the clenched nails.|$|R

The bobbin threads {{are carried}} on brass bobbins that are held in {{carriages}} that are swung {{back and forth on}} combs in a pushing and catching routine. Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; in net formation the pillars must be connected and this can be done by the spool threads (top or <b>bottom</b> <b>board).</b> These are secured each time by the bobbin threads. Patterning or gimping is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads.|$|E

50|$|Curse of the Mummy's Tomb was a {{boardgame}} for 1-4 players, {{published by}} Games Workshop and designed by Stephen Hand. It featured a three-dimensional board, representing an Egyptian pyramid, with two consecutively smaller playing areas above the <b>bottom</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
50|$|Perforated <b>bottom</b> <b>board</b> {{method is}} used by many beekeepers on their hives. When mites {{occasionally}} fall off a bee, they must climb back up to parasitize another bee. If the beehive has a screened floor with mesh the right size, the mite will fall through and cannot return to the beehive. The screened <b>bottom</b> <b>board</b> is also being credited with increased circulation of air, which reduces condensation in a hive during the winter. Studies at Cornell University done over two years found that screened bottoms have no measurable effect at all. Screened bottom boards with sticky boards (glue traps) separate mites that fall through the screen and the sticky board prevents them from crawling back up. Insecticide may also {{be applied to the}} sticky boards to help kill the mites.|$|E
