5|$|The {{position}} of regent (officially known as General-in-Chief 大將軍) was created during Emperor Wu's reign (r. 14187 BCE) when he appointed three officials {{to form a}} triumvirate regency over the central government while the child Emperor Zhao (r. 8774 BCE) sat on the throne. Regents were often relatives-in-law to the emperor through his empress's family, but they could also <b>be</b> <b>men</b> of lowly means who depended on the emperor's favor to advance their position at court. Eunuchs who maintained the harem of the palace could also gain a similar level of power. They often came from {{the middle class and}} had links to trade. In the Western Han, there are only a handful of examples where eunuchs rose to power since the official bureaucracy was strong enough to suppress them. After the eunuch Shi Xian (石顯) became the Prefect of the Palace Masters of Writing (中尚書), Emperor Yuan (r. 4833 BCE) relinquished much of his authority to him, so that he was allowed to make vital policy decisions and was respected by officials. However, Shi Xian was expelled from office once Emperor Cheng (337 BCE) took the throne. No palace eunuch would obtain comparable authority again until after 92 CE, when the eunuchs led by Zheng Zhong (d. 107 CE) sided with Emperor He (r. 88105 CE) in a coup to overthrow the Dou 竇 clan of the empress dowager. Officials complained when eunuchs like Sun Cheng (d. 132 CE) were awarded by Emperor Shun (r. 125144 CE) with marquessates, yet after the year 135 CE the eunuchs were given legal authority to pass on fiefs to adopted sons. Although Emperor Ling (r. 168189 CE) relinquished a great deal of authority to eunuchs Zhao Zhong (d. 189 CE) and Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE), the eunuchs were slaughtered in 189 CE when Yuan Shao (d. 202 CE) besieged and stormed the palaces of Luoyang.|$|E

25|$|Horizontal {{segregation}} {{refers to}} differences {{in the number of}} people of each gender present across occupations. Horizontal segregation is likely to be increased by post-industrial restructuring of the economy (post-industrial society), in which the expansion of service industries has called for many women to enter the workforce. The millions of housewives who entered the economy during post-industrial restructuring primarily entered into service sector jobs where they could work part-time and having flexible hours. While these options are often appealing to mothers, who are often responsible for the care work of their children and their homes, they are also unfortunately most available in lower-paying and lower status occupations. The idea that nurses and teachers are often pictured as women whereas doctors and lawyers are often assumed to <b>be</b> <b>men</b> are examples of how highly engrained horizontal segregation is in our society.|$|E

25|$|Cargas {{generally}} {{last for}} one year and start small, such as being in charge of cleaning the neighborhood church, collecting alms and acting as a go-between for the priest and parishioners. However, most involve the sponsorship of the many religious festivals {{that take place in}} the city. This system {{is one of the more}} complex of its type in the world. Receiving a carga gives the person, called a mayordomo, prestige from the community since he is considered to be working for the common good. Mayordomos can <b>be</b> <b>men,</b> women and even children. The most prestigious carga is to be the mayordomo of the neighborhood's patron saint. This mayordomo receives a certain amount of authority and even a silver scepter along with physical possession of the image. The wives of these mayordomos, carry silver baskets. Even more prestigious than this is to be a mayordomo of a citywide festival which is organized among the neighborhoods. These include the festival of the Virgin of the Remedies, the Fiesta del Pueblo, and events related to Holy Week.|$|E
25|$|Though TF1 {{initially}} {{had plans}} to hold its own debate {{between the first and}} second round, it will instead jointly host one with France 2. BFM TV also originally intended to host a debate between the two rounds, and it sought to join France 2 and TF1 in co-hosting a single debate but was rebuffed; while all channels were welcome to broadcast the debate, CEO of France Télévisions Delphine Ernotte said, it would not accept such an arrangement with BFM TV, which would mean three journalists moderating the debate. Unlike Jacques Chirac, who refused to debate Jean-Marie Le Pen after the latter's surprise advancement to the second round in the 2002 presidential election, Macron agreed to debate Marine Le Pen on 3 May. The debate, planned to start at 21:00 CEST and last 2 hours and 20 minutes, was originally to be moderated by Gilles Bouleau and David Pujadas; however, after the Conseil supérieur de l'audiovisuel (CSA) raised concerns that the moderators would both <b>be</b> <b>men</b> for the first time since 1995, the final pair of Christophe Jakubyszyn of TF1 and Nathalie Saint-Cricq of France 2 was chosen.

2500|$|It {{is clear}} that nothing would prevent a {{singular}} term occurring in a syllogism—so {{long as it was}} always in the subject position—however, such a syllogism, even if valid, is not a categorical syllogism. An example is Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man,</b> all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> mortal, therefore Socrates is mortal. Intuitively this is as valid as All Greeks <b>are</b> <b>men,</b> all <b>men</b> <b>are</b> mortal therefore all Greeks are mortals. To argue that its validity {{can be explained by the}} theory of syllogism would require that we show that Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> the equivalent of a categorical proposition. [...] It can be argued Socrates <b>is</b> a <b>man</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to All that are identical to Socrates <b>are</b> <b>men,</b> so our non-categorical syllogism can be justified by use of the equivalence above and then citing BARBARA.|$|R

500|$|In 1809, Dennis Pennington, one of {{the most}} outspoken anti-slavery men and a friend of Henry Clay, was elected to the {{legislature}} as the representative from Harrison County, and became speaker of the assembly. His prominence allowed him to dominate the legislature. Before the constitutional convention in 1816, Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let us be on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they <b>be</b> <b>men</b> opposed to slavery." [...] At the constitutional convention, the anti-slavery party was able to take control, electing Jennings {{as the president of the}} convention.

Gavin Long described Rowell as [...] "clear and incisive in thought, sensitive in feeling, frank and outspoken in approach to men and to problems. Five recent years of service either at English staff colleges or on exchange duty made it probable that wherever he went his opposite numbers in British formations would <b>be</b> <b>men</b> {{with whom he had}} previously worked and played." [...] Comparing him to the AA, Colonel George Alan Vasey, Long noted that both [...] "were not only efficient soldiers but men of commanding temperament and talent".|$|E
500|$|Jennings and his {{supporters}} had control of the convention and Jennings was elected its president. Other notable delegates at the convention included Dennis Pennington, Davis Floyd, and William Hendricks. Pennington and Jennings were {{at the forefront of}} the effort to prevent slavery from entering Indiana and sought to create a constitutional ban on it. Pennington was quoted as saying [...] "Let us be on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they <b>be</b> <b>men</b> opposed to slavery". They succeeded in their goal and a ban was placed in the new constitution. But, persons already held in bondage stayed in that status for some time. That same year Indiana statehood was approved by Congress. While settlers did not want slavery, they also wanted to exclude free blacks, and established barriers to their immigration to the state.|$|E

500|$|Árbenz instead told Díaz {{to select}} {{officers}} {{to lead a}} counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all regarded to <b>be</b> <b>men</b> of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz. On the night of 19 June, most of the Guatemalan troops in the capital region left for Zacapa, joined by smaller detachments from other garrisons. Árbenz stated that [...] "the invasion was a farce", but worried {{that if it was}} defeated on the Honduran border, Honduras would use it as an excuse to declare war on Guatemala, which would lead to a U.S. invasion. Due to the rumours spread by the Voice of Liberation, there were worries throughout the countryside that a fifth column attack was imminent; large numbers of peasants went to the government and asked for weapons to defend their country. They were repeatedly told that the army was [...] "successfully defending our country". Nonetheless, peasant volunteers assisted the government war effort, manning roadblocks and donating supplies to the army. Weapons shipments dropped by rebel planes were intercepted and turned over to the government.|$|E
500|$|Árbenz had {{intended}} the shipment of weapons from the Alfhem {{to be used}} to bolster peasant militia, in the event of army disloyalty, but the US informed the Guatemalan army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and the chiefs of his army. Castillo Armas' forces invaded Guatemala on June 18, 1954. The invasion was accompanied by an intense campaign of psychological warfare presenting Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli, with the intent of forcing Árbenz to resign. The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station known as the [...] "Voice of Liberation", whose transmissions broadcast news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributed to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population. Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily, but he worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a US invasion. Árbenz ordered Carlos Enrique Díaz, the chief of the army, to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all known to <b>be</b> <b>men</b> of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz.|$|E

Entertainments were laid on almost every day for two weeks after the wedding, in what art historian Roy Strong has called [...] "the climax of Valois festival art". The chief artist employed to design the magnificences was Antoine Caron, who was aided by the sculptor Germain Pilon. Among the writers were Dorat, Ronsard, and Philippe Desportes; and the music was written by Claude Le Jeune and the Sieur de Beaulieu, among others. A programme for an entertainment with a sun–moon theme announced that [...] "twelve torch bearers will <b>be</b> <b>men</b> and women disguised as trees...the golden fruits of which will carry lamps and torches". The visual decorations included two arcades, one shining as a sun, to represent the king, the other as a moon, to represent the newlyweds. The arcades were linked to an amphitheatre overhung with artificial heavens of planets and constellations, and allusions to Catherine’s personal emblem, the rainbow.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a {{regional}} sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary {{for the purposes of the}} law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): [...] "northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would <b>be</b> <b>Men</b> of Kent.|$|E

He also donated his books to the university's Bodleian Library [...] "for the use chiefly of mathematical readers". He required the professors to <b>be</b> <b>men</b> of good character, at least 26 years old, and to have [...] "imbibed the purer philosophy from the springs of Aristotle and Plato" [...] before acquiring a thorough knowledge of science. The professors could come from any Christian country, but he specified that a professor from England should have a Master of Arts degree as a minimum. He wanted students to be educated {{in the works of}} the leading scientists of the ancient world, saying that the professor of geometry should teach Euclid's Elements, Apollonius's Conics, and the works of Archimedes; tuition in trigonometry was to be shared by the two professors. [...] As many students would have had little mathematical knowledge, the professors were also permitted to provide instruction in basic mathematics in English (as opposed to Latin, the language used in education at Oxford at the time).|$|E

Conkling opposed the confirmation of Merritt and Burt when the Senate reconvened in February 1879, but Merritt was approved {{by a vote of}} 31–25, as was Burt by 31–19, giving Hayes his most significant civil service reform victory.

[...] They were successful, but narrowly, as Cornell was nominated for governor by a vote of 234–216. [...] Arthur and Conkling campaigned vigorously for the Stalwart ticket and, owing partly to a splintering of the Democratic vote, were victorious. [...] Arthur and the machine had rebuked Hayes and their intra-party rivals, but Arthur had only a few days to enjoy his triumph when, on January12, 1880, his wife died suddenly while he was in Albany organizing the political agenda for the coming year.
