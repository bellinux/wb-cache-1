50|$|The LDF has {{committed}} funding {{until the end}} of the decade towards running costs of the functional Magnetic Resonance Images (fMRI) <b>scanning</b> <b>facility</b> at Aston University. The fMRI scanner is twice as powerful as those found in hospitals, so allows detailed study of the human brain. Whilst animal researchers study neurological disorders in primates, this facility shows that it is better to use non-invasive methods to study people; results are more reliable and avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of species differences.|$|R
50|$|JTAG programmers {{are also}} used to write {{software}} and data into flash memory. This is usually done using data bus access like the CPU would use, and is sometimes actually handled by a CPU, but in other cases memory chips have JTAG interfaces themselves. Some modern debug architectures provide internal and external bus master access without needing to halt and take over a CPU. In the worst case, it is usually possible to drive external bus signals using the boundary <b>scan</b> <b>facility.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{timing of}} {{detection}} surveys and location scans {{is critical to}} success, and varies {{with the type of}} location being <b>scanned.</b> For permanent <b>facilities,</b> <b>scans</b> and surveys must take place during working hours to detect remotely switchable devices that are turned off during non-working hours to defeat detection.|$|R
30|$|Piglets were {{instrumented}} and ventilated with TV of {{corresponding to}} a strain (TV/FRC) > 2.5. The whole study {{was performed in}} an animal CT <b>scan</b> <b>facilities</b> equipped as an ICU. Every three hours a CT scan was performed and data on respiratory mechanics were collected. CT scans were analysed and lesions were defined as clearly defined regions of poorly/not inflated tissue (- 500 /+ 100 HU) with a minimal diameter of 6 mm non present in the previous CT scan image. Lung weight was computed from the CT scan data.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} an MRI <b>scanning</b> <b>facility</b> {{run by a}} Radiology department. Several hospital departments compete for capacity and have private information regarding their demand for scans. The fairness of the capacity allocation by the Radiology department depends {{on the quality of}} the information provided by the hospital departments. We employ a generic Bayesian game approach that stimulates the disclosure of true demand (truth-telling), so that capacity can be allocated fairly. We derive conditions under which truth-telling is a Bayesian Nash equilibrium. The usefulness of the approach is illustrated with a numerical example...|$|R

25|$|The labeled 18F-FDG {{compound}} has {{a relatively}} short shelf life which {{is dominated by the}} physical decay of 18F with a half-life of 109.8 minutes, or slightly less than 2 hours. Still, this half life is sufficiently long to allow shipping the compound to remote PET <b>scanning</b> <b>facilities,</b> in contrast to other medical radioisotopes like 11C. Due to transport regulations for radioactive compounds, delivery is normally done by specially licensed road transport, but means of transport may also include dedicated small commercial jet services. Transport by air allows to expand the distribution area around a 18F-FDG production site to deliver the compound to PET scanning centres even hundreds of miles away.|$|R
50|$|Most {{stores have}} self {{checkout}} {{and some have}} self <b>scanning</b> <b>facilities.</b> Self-checkout facilities are small checkout for express (15 items or less) purchases, where customers scan and bag their own groceries, with several self-checkouts monitored over by a single staff member for assistance and to clear any restricted transactions (e.g. alcohol). Self-scanning facilities (Shop n' Go) are where a pre-registered customer scans each item with a hand-held scanner as they put them in their trolley. This reduces waiting time at the checkout, with most customers only requiring {{to pay for the}} groceries, although random rescans do take place. All stores have conventional checkout operator scanning available.|$|R

40|$|Neutron stress {{measurements}} require {{specimens of}} complex geometry to be speedily and accurately positioned and oriented {{with respect to}} the neutron beam. Recognition {{that a majority of the}} specimen positioning systems in use at strain <b>scanning</b> <b>facilities</b> are effectively serial robot manipulators suggests that the methods of serial robot kinematic modelling may be applied to advantage. The adoption of robotics methods provides a simple and reliable framework for controlling positioning systems of arbitrary geometry and complexity. In addition the numerical solution of the inverse kinematic problem is facilitated, allowing specimens to be automatically positioned and orientated so that pre-determined strain components are measured. It is also shown that, given sufficient degrees of freedom, a secondary characteristic of the measurement position such as the measurement count time may be simultaneously optimised...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} 2012 the proton {{irradiation}} {{facility at}} the CERN PS [1] will shut down for two years. With this in mind, we have been developing a new ATLAS <b>scanning</b> <b>facility</b> at the University of Birmingham Medical Physics cyclotron. With proton beams of energy approximately 30 MeV, ﬂuences corresponding {{to those of the}} upgraded large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) can be reached conveniently. The facility can be used to irradiate silicon sensors, optical components and mechanical structures (e. g. carbon ﬁbre sandwiches) for the LHC upgrade programme. Irradiations of silicon sensors can be carried out in a temperature controlled cold box that can be scanned through the beam. The facility is described in detail along with the ﬁrst tests carried out with mini (1 1 cm 2) silicon sensors...|$|R

30|$|It is {{a classic}} topic that {{creating}} a texture {{on the surface of}} objective model, and the key is to minimize the visible seams caused by multi-view misregistration and inaccuracy of data. Catmull (1974, 1980), begin to use the texture mapping skill to improve the visual quality of images generated by raster <b>scanning</b> <b>facility.</b> Rocchini et al. (1999) confirm the best texture for each triangular mesh by projecting the color images onto the surface of 3 D model, and apply the region expansion algorithm to complete the ambient texture projection. It guarantees the validity of inner texture for local areas, but results in discontinuities in the boundary of images. Liu et al. (2006) resolve the discontinuities in the boundary effectively by global optimization of the multiple texture images using bundle adjustment. Zhou et al. (2005) implement coarse-to-fine strategy of several levels, considering both geometric and images in overlapping textures, and complete the textures montage.|$|R
