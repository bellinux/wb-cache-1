5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a single station, by which time all the companies had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by {{one or both of}} just two companies.|$|E

No.1 AD was disbanded in December 1994, its functions having <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by other units and private contractors. At {{the time of its}} disbandment, it was the oldest RAAF unit in continuous operation.|$|E

5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury services would have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E

The four Links learn that not only have the knights of Hyrule mysteriously disappeared, but evil versions of them have been creating havoc.

Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have been absorbed into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|By September 1945, {{control of}} major {{infrastructure}} installations, including railway stations and trams in Java's largest cities, had <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by Republican pemuda who encountered little Japanese resistance. To spread the revolutionary message, pemuda {{set up their}} own radio stations and newspapers, and graffiti proclaimed the nationalist sentiment. On most islands, struggle committees and militia were set up. Republican newspapers and journals were common in Jakarta, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, which fostered a generation of writers known as angkatan 45 ('generation of 45') many of whom believed their work could be part of the revolution.|$|E

One of these three, the Sheriffdom of Skye, was granted to William I, Earl of Ross (died 1323). This sheriffdom included the seaboard north of Ardnamurchan (Wester Ross and Kintail), and the islands of Skye, Lewis, Uist, Barra, Eigg, and Rum. It is possible that parts of the sheriffdom may have <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> earlier, sometime after the dismantling of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles.|$|E

Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively <b>been</b> <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.|$|E
