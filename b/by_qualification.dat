What! {{do you think the}} death of Lorenzo is the scourge God has {{prepared}} for Florence? Go! you are sparrows chattering praise over the dead hawk.

But this is what you love: you grumble and raise a riot over your quattrini bianchi" [...] (white farthings); [...] "but you take no notice when the public treasury has got a hole in the bottom for the gold to run into Lorenzo's drains. You like to pay for footmen to walk before and behind one of your citizens, that he may be affable and condescending to you. `See, what a tall Pisan we keep,' say you, `to march before him with the drawn sword flashing in our eyes!--and yet Lorenzo smiles at us. What goodness!' And you think the death of a man, who would soon have saddled and bridled you as the Sforza has saddled and bridled Milan--you think his death is the scourge God is warning you of by portents. I tell you there is another sort of scourge in the air." ...|$|E
