25|$|There {{are many}} {{recorded}} fake or counterfeit gold sovereigns in circulation, {{although they are}} still relatively scarce {{in comparison to the}} numbers of genuine coins, due to the difficulty of accurately replicating such a small coin economically. With numismatic fakes, the counterfeiter might use the correct proportions of gold, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> to replicate an older coin with special rarity value. Such fakes present a potential problem only to the numismatic collector, as they still have standard bullion content.|$|E

500|$|Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Aagadu a [...] "simple, oft-repeated cop vs. don story", and added, [...] "The {{difference}} {{here is the}} don is reduced to a cardboard. For a mind game to be interesting, both players need to be smart and second guess the opponent’s next move, which doesn’t happen here. If one is looking for gags, Aagadu offers them in plenty. <b>But</b> <b>try</b> an overdose of this formula {{and it could be}} tiring." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Though this film has many similarities of Srinu Vaitla’s earlier films, but it’s Mahesh Babu who has the audience’s attention throughout. Watch it for him and more rely on him".|$|E
500|$|Refn's {{inspiration}} for Drive came partly from reading Grimms' Fairy Tales, and {{his goal was}} to make [...] "a fairy tale that takes Los Angeles as the background," [...] with The Driver as the hero. To play with the common theme of fairy tales, The Driver protects what is good {{while at the same time}} killing degenerate people in violent ways. Refn was also inspired by films such as Point Blank (1967), Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), The Driver (1978) and Thief (1981). Jean-Pierre Melville's crime productions influenced the cinematography. Amini's script propensity imposes [...] "a kind of sideways moral code," [...] where even those who comply with it are almost never rewarded for their efforts, as seen when The Driver helps Standard with Irene and her son's best interests in mind. In their vehicles, the characters not only make escapes or commit murder, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> to find peace and search for romance.|$|E
500|$|On March 26, 2012 a 6-minute {{film was}} {{uploaded}} to the Tenacious D VEVO channel on YouTube. The mockumentary, titled 'Tenacious D - To Be the Best', documents the uncertain future Tenacious D faced after the box-office failure of The Pick of Destiny, KG's subsequent breakdown and incarceration in [...] "an institution", and Jack's embracing of an indulgent Hollywood lifestyle. The film shows a deranged Kyle escaping the facility {{and attempting to}} kill Jack and then himself, before they each realize their importance {{to each other and}} revive the band. They produce a new album in 75 minutes in the studio, described as [...] "awful", <b>but</b> <b>try</b> again and emerge with another new album, described {{at the end of the}} film as [...] "the greatest album recorded by anyone, ever". The film features numerous cameo appearances, including Maria Menounos, Val Kilmer, Dave Grohl, Yoshiki Hayashi, Josh Groban, Richard Ghagan, Mike White, Tim Robbins and Jimmy Kimmel.|$|E

On her website [...] Scott responds to a reader of her book stating that she felt there was never evidence to link Knight to Tupac's murder. Scott also told CNN, [...] "That theory doesn’t even add up. 'Open fire on my car, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> not to hit me?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{talking about}} {{the close of the}} title, Cornell stated [...] "Our {{audience}} really left at issue four... People protest about events, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> and write a comic now without them. The audience is actually more concerned with what’s going on, with the big news, than they are with story. I’d be part of an event every issue if I could, if it meant I could keep the title going. ... after [...] Birmingham I realised that the only way the book would survive would be huge event stories of our own." [...] He also said he might've had the characters visit America early on if he'd known how long he had, or put more action into Hell Comes To Birmingham.|$|E

The Heineken Cup pool stages started with wins against Llanelli and Calvisano. Back to back wins against USA Perpignan in October and November saw Leicester through as group winners but a loss to Llanelli in the final round allowed the Welsh side through to the knock out stages as a best runner up.

2500|$|Liberati's {{system of}} {{acquiring}} his style {{is founded on}} the bedrock of virtuosoship: persevering, persistent, faithful work of the severest nature. With a determination and energy truly admirable he devoted all his spare moments to practice. His {{first step was to}} perfect the 'attack of the tone.' Then, with a metronome as his guide in tempo, he practiced scales in all keys—always in a light staccato—until he could play them with absolute precision, in both time and tune. He stated, [...] "You may think you play a scale perfectly <b>but</b> <b>try</b> it with a metronome and you will find out that you don't. I thought I did until I began practicing with a metronome." [...] Although then regarded as an artist, Liberati learned that he could not play a simple scale with evenness, but by diligence he gained the point he sought. He was forced to begin at a slow tempo but gradually increasing it, he rapidly acquired the desired precision at any tempo he found necessary.|$|E
2500|$|Recognizing the {{popularity}} of A Walk to Remember as both a novel and film, Sparks [...] "put all [...] thoughts into that, {{trying to make the}} story as different from A Walk to Remember as , <b>but</b> <b>try</b> to capture the same feelings." [...] Sparks' experiences as a father and as a high school track and field coach also helped shape the plot, and characters Jonah Miller and Will Blakelee are respectively based on Sparks' sons Landon and Miles. Sparks felt Ronnie was the hardest character to write for because he had [...] "never been a 17-year-old, angry teenage girl". Ronnie became a composite character inspired by several young women Sparks has known, such as his nieces. Cyrus herself influenced Ronnie fairly little, although her singing career did inspire the musical elements of the story. Ronnie plays only the piano and Cyrus only sings a small amount in the film, though she does contribute to its soundtrack.|$|E
2500|$|The Sun {{described}} the album as [...] "a mixture of ballads and the relentlessly upbeat, catchy hits {{we have come}} to expect." [...] Kimberley Walsh has said that the album is [...] "a lot older sounding, which wasn't intentional, it was just kind of how it went." [...] The girl group were very involved in the album's direction. [...] "The '60s thing is quite prominent," [...] Walsh told the BBC. [...] "But it's out of the ordinary. Not really what you'd expect." [...] Nicola Roberts said that the album also features a lot of 1980s-inspired electropop. Sarah Harding said that Girls Aloud [...] "wanted to stay upbeat <b>but</b> <b>try</b> something a bit different and advanced. I don't think anything we've ever done has ever sounded the same. But we have that same vibe whatever we do because of our vocals." [...] Nadine Coyle said the [...] "aim from the beginning was to come up with songs that didn't sound like anything else out there." [...] Walsh continued, [...] "We want to impress the fans with what we do, so we've tried to up our game with this album and step outside the comfort zone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cornell {{stated in}} a 1996 interview: [...] "I {{know what it}} feels like to be suicidal, and I {{know what it feels}} like to be hopeless. There is some point where I learnt enough about myself to know that I don't have the {{tolerance}} to create other hurdles as well." [...] In 1999, Cornell said about depression, [...] "No one really knows what run-of-the-mill depression is. You'll think somebody has run-of-the-mill depression, and then the next thing you know, they're hanging from a rope. It's hard to tell the difference. But I do feel that depression can be useful. Sometimes it's just chemical. It doesn't seem to come from anywhere. And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine what it feels like to not be there, <b>but</b> <b>try</b> to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{on-screen}} storyline {{begun in}} May 2014 when Stan decided to loan Cora Cross, played by Ann Mitchell, money {{in order for}} her {{to move into a}} flat. Cora and Stan's friendship progressed, to the amusement of his family and sometimes annoyance of their friend, Patrick Trueman (Rudolph Walker). At the 2014 British Soap Awards, Mitchell teased that there is [...] "some interesting stuff" [...] with Cora, including her relationship with Stan. Cora and Stan's relationship enters a rough patch when Cora discovers that Mick was arrested for kerb crawling and realises her daughter, Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) was the prostitute involved. This puts strain on the relationship when Stan is unable to choose between Cora and Mick and when Stan tries to get Cora to clear Mick's name, it causes tension between them. Mick later reveals that he was covering for Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Stan and Cora resume their relationship. Stan's prostate cancer storyline affected his relationship with Cora as she struggled to cope due to her own past with cancer. It was announced on 6 December 2014 that Stan's final Christmas would see him transform the pub's barrel store into a [...] "winter wonderland" [...] for him and Cora to spend time together. It was revealed that the elderly couple would spend a poignant moment dancing together. It was later announced that Stan's ex-wife, Sylvie (Marlowe), would return to Albert Square on Christmas Day when Mick invites her to dinner. Cora becomes uncomfortable with Sylvie and decides to leave, annoying Stan who was hoping to enjoy his final Christmas. On 27 December 2014, it was announced that Cora would decide to leave Walford with her grandson, Dexter Hartman (Khali Best), to live with her daughter, Ava Hartman (Clare Perkins) in Newcastle and that Stan would [...] "beg" [...] Cora not to leave Walford.
