2500|$|At {{the age of}} 18, {{she left}} the family home for New York City and learned the trade of a vestmaker. She devoted her evenings to study and to writing. She contributed tales and {{sketches}} to various newspapers and magazines, but was not paid for them. She began to do reporting and book-reviewing for educational and literary journals, still without any pay in money, but happy at being occasionally paid in books. She said: [...] "It is my college, and I must learn my business <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> demand pay." [...] In 1856, she compiled a marbleworker's manual, such as had been issued in France, but although it was published, she again was given only books for compensation. As time went on, she received more and more literary work to do, and though still obliged at times to walk four miles for lack of horse-car fare, she made steady progress. She widened her circle of those friends who were beginning to appreciate her abilities. In 1859, she agreed to write a history of New York within a year, and succeeded in doing so; but even then, {{she was unable to}} support herself wholly, although she had given up vestmaking and was writing 12 hours a day. When she was 30 years old, she accepted the position of amanuensis to Dr. J. Marion Sims, and this was the first work of the kind for which she received steady payment. She was now able to do without her father's assistance, and live on her own resources in New York, though very plainly.|$|E

2500|$|The lukewarm {{response}} to Monuments to an Elegy caused Corgan {{to change his}} plans for Day for Night. The critic's reviews of Monuments to an Elegy, which holds a rating of 70/100 at Metacritic based on 31 reviews, were criticized by Corgan for being [...] "middling, muddling" [...] reviews and not offering a [...] "fair" [...] evaluation of the album, while also admitting he didn't even read any of the reviews. Corgan said: [...] "I thought for sure I would get really strong reviews for our new album , based on all the feedback I was getting.

Nobody believes it's a three-star record. Nobody! OK, these people obviously did, so maybe I shouldn't be so absolute.

[...] The original plan was for Monuments to an Elegy to be a pop/rock album and then be followed by an experimental [...] "weird, arty" [...] album, Day for Night. However, the {{response to}} Monuments to an Elegy caused him to re-evaluate the Day for Night demos and decided that, [...] "The Smashing Pumpkins shouldn't be an arty band anymore," [...] and elaborated, [...] "Monuments is me solving a problem of how to get The Smashing Pumpkins back into the mainstream. I had to solve that problem <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> solve problem two, which is where Day for Night comes in.
