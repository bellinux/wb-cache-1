25|$|Diacetyl can be {{produced}} by the LAB through metabolism of sugar or of citric acid. While citric acid is naturally present in grapes, {{it is in a}} very small amount with most of it coming from deliberate addition by the winemaker to acidify the wine. In the presence of both malic and citric acids, the LAB use both, but use the malic much more quickly, with the rate of citric use/diacetyl formation influenced by the particular bacterial strain (with most strains of O. oeni producing less diacetyl than Lactobacillus and Pediococcis species), as well as the redox potential of the wine. In wine conditions that have a low redox potential (meaning it is more oxidative such as in a barrel that is not fully topped up), more citric acid will be consumed and diacetyl formed. In more reductive conditions, such as in alcoholic fermentations where yeast populations are at their peak and the wine is heavily saturated with carbon dioxide, the formation of diacetyl is much slower. The yeasts also help keep levels low by consuming diacetyl and reducing it to acetoin and <b>butylene</b> <b>glycol.</b>|$|E

40|$|Of a {{representative}} series of aliphatic acydic acetals previously studied (1), none equals paraldehyde in efficiency as a hypnotic. As a greater structural resemblance to paraldehyde {{is found in}} the cyclic acetals, formed from an aldehyde and a glycol, it might be expected that such compounds would approach it more closely in pharmacological properties. Accordingly, a number of these were prepared, using formalde-hyde and acetaldehyde, and ethylene, propylene, trimethylene, and 2, 3 <b>butylene</b> <b>glycols.</b> The procedure used was that of Clarke (2). Ethylene formal was kindly supplied by Dr. Frederic Walker of the Roessler-Hasslacher Chemical Co. The dioxane was a product of the Carbon Carbide Chemical Co., redistilled before use. The specific gravity of the compounds was found by the Westphal balance, and their aqueous solubility roughly determined by the amount of water required to dissolve a fixed amount; each procedure was at 24 #{ 176 }C. The properties of the compounds are shown in table 1. The pharmacological activity of the compounds was deter-mined as in the previous study, administering them to rats intraperitoneally and to rabbits by stomach tube, and the results recorded as seen in table 2. From the data it appears that the compounds in which the ring is unsubstituted, that is, ethylene formal, trimethylene formal, and dioxane, are of lowest activity, the five-membered ring compound being slightly inferior to the other two.

Structure-property {{relationships in the}} thermoplastic-AIPNs were investigated by means of wide-angle and small-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS, SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) techniques, dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) and several physico-mechanical characterization techniques. The results obtained by the various techniques were critically compared to each other. They suggest that the two components show weak affinity {{to each other and}} that the thermoplastic-AIPNs can be classified into two groups with high and low contents of CPU, showing essentially the behavior of CPU and S/AA, respectively. However, deviations from additivity and significant changes for several properties on addition of small amounts of either of the components suggest partial miscibility. Most of the results are explained by physical interactions of COOH- groups of AA in S/AA with the ester groups of the flexible CPU blocks, which promote microphase separation in both the CPU and the S/AA components...|$|R
40|$|Indomethacin (IND) is {{a potent}} non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug used {{in the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, acute gout and other disorders. IND is available worldwide mostly in the form of capsules and suppositories, however, these formulations usually create side effects. Consequently, an alternate route of administration to avoid or minimize side effects may be found in the form of semisolid dermatological formulations, now available in few countries. The specific goals of this study were: (I) to determine the solubility of IND using different co-solvents: hexylene glycol (HG), propylene glycol (PG), polyethylene <b>glycol</b> 300 (PEG), <b>butylene</b> <b>glycols</b> (1, 2 BG; 1, 3 BG and 1, 4 BG) and ethanol (ETOH). 1 % (w/w) Tween® 80 or polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP- 25) were used as enhancers; (II) to develop suitable topical gel preparations using 20 % (w/w) Pluronic® (PF- 127) or 1 % (w/w) Carbopol ETD® 2001 (C 2001) as gelling agents and HG or PEG 300 as solvents (1 % (w/w) Tween® 80 and PVP- 25 were added as excipients); (III) To evaluate the effect of composition of prepared gel formulations on the following parameters: appearance, crystallization, pH and rheological behaviour and (IV) to investigate the influence of storage time and storage conditions on the characteristics of the gels. These results indicate that all the solvents tested increased the solubility of IND to varying degrees. Tween® 80 and PVP- 25 only slightly enhanced the solubility of IND. 1 % (w/w) IND was able to form a structural gel with both PF- 127 and C 2001. Storing the INDPF- 127 gels at 6 °C resulted in the precipitation of IND. All gels stored at room temperature exhibited good stability. The gels stored at 45 °C developed a dark yellow colour. Gels with C 2001 and PF- 127 /PEG had slightly decreased viscosities with increasing storage time, while the gels with PF- 127 /HG showed increase in viscosities with time. In conclusion, the water solubility of IND was increased by the addition of co-solvents. 1 % (w/w) IND gel can be suitable for using as a gel formulation and it is stable at room temperature. The search for suitable gels for IND topical formulation needs to be continued with more stability studies. Moreover, in-vitro and in-vivo experiments will be necessary for providing data on bioavailability...|$|R

Limited miscibility of SFT and STF chain components resulted in incomplete separation into a regular three-dimensional macrolattice of STF-rich microdomains and SFT-rich microphases. The composition of STF-rich microdomains was estimated by fitting the softening temperatures to the Couchman's equation, whereas the relative contents of SFT-rich and STF-rich microphases were assessed by comparing the specific heat capacity change at the glass transition temperatures to corresponding additive values.

Porous polymer sheets were implanted subcutaneously for 32 weeks in rats. The degradation was monitored visually (histology), by molecular weight (GPC), and by copolymer composition (NMR). Substitution of the aromatic terephthalate units by aliphatic succinate units was shown to accelerate the degradation rate of the copolymers. Direct correlation of the in vivo and in vitro degradation of the porous implants showed a slightly faster initial molecular weight decrease in vivo. Besides hydrolysis, oxidation occurs in vivo due to the presence of radicals produced by inflammatory cells. In addition, the higher molecular weight plateau of the residue found in vivo indicated a higher solubility of the oligomers in the extracellular fluid compared to a phosphate buffer. Minor changes in the poly(ether-ester) compositions were noted due to degradation. Microscopically, fragmentation of the porous implants was observed in time.

Apart from 3 D Printing by Z-corporation, all the other jetting based processes require a support material to successfully build a part.

These support materials present challenges in terms of their removability and reusability. This research is therefore, aimed towards finding a support material composition that can be used with jetting based AM processes. The support material should be easily removable either by melting or by dissolution and also, if possible, it should be reusable. AM processes often process materials with poor mechanical properties and therefore, the parts produced by these processes have limited functionality. In an attempt to obtain complex shaped, functional parts made of nylon (i. e. Polyamide 6), a new jetting based AM process is under research at Loughborough University. The process uses two different mixtures of caprolactam (i. e. the monomer used to produce polyamide). These mixtures are to be jetted using inkjet heads and subsequently polymerised into polyamide 6. Therefore, another aim of this research was to consider the support material s suitability for jetting of caprolactam. Two different polymers were researched which included Pluronic F- 127 and methylcellulose (MC). Both these polymers are known for gel formation upon heating in aqueous solutions. Due to the inhibition of polymerisation of polyamide 6 by the presence of water, non-aqueous solvents such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and <b>butylene</b> <b>glycol</b> were studied. Since both F- 127 and MC in the glycols mentioned above had not been studied before, all the compositions prepared and investigated in this report were novel. F- 127 did not show gel formation in propylene and <b>butylene</b> <b>glycol</b> but formed a gel in ethylene glycol at a concentration of 25 % (w/w) F- 127. MC, on the other hand, showed gel formation upon cooling in all the three glycols at concentrations as low as 5 % for ethylene glycol and 1 % for both propylene and <b>butylene</b> <b>glycol.</b> These compositions were characterized using experimental techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, hot stage microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

Three types of lipids, S 75 - 3, S 100 - 3, and SL 80 - 3 were used for formulating ALA. The pH of all the liposomal ALA is 4. 5 ~ 5. 5 and the size is 50 ~ 200 nm. All the liposomal formulations gave better ex vivo ALA skin penetration using nude mice skin in Franz cell than free ALA did. Among them, SL 80 - 3 including 22 % of lyso-phosphocholine achieved excellent ALA penetration when {{compared with those of}} S 75 - 3 and S 100 - 3 which have only 1 ~ 2 % of lyso-phospholipids. S 100 - 3 showed a little better results than S 75 - 3 did. Addition of humectants (glycerine, propylene glycol, <b>butylene</b> <b>glycol,</b> betaine) in liposomal ALA for-mulated with SL 80 - 3 produced little enhancing effect in ALA penetration. On the other hand, addition of surfactants (Tween 20, 60, Brij 72, 76, 78) in same liposomal system produced significant increase in ALA penetration. Among them, trans-ferosomal system of lyso-phospholipid, SL 80 - 3 and the surfactant, Brij 76 showed the highest ALA penetration. Fur-thermore, this system also established the highest in vivo PpIX biosynthesis in hairy mice skin of C 57 BL/ 6. These results concluded that the transferosome of SL 80 - 3 and Brij 76 produced the best results in both ALA penetration and PpIX bio-synthesis, and proved good correlation between them.
