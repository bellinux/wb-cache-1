5|$|Free updates to {{the game}} were {{released}} to provide fixes and updates {{to the game}}, some based on community feedback. These included: a <b>Big</b> <b>Head</b> mode, which makes all characters in the game have disproportionate heads; a photo mode, which allows players to edit photos taken during gameplay; {{the ability to use}} the original voice cast, with localized subtitles; and updates to the game's AR challenges. These included the ability to select all playable characters from the game and its downloadable content (DLC) to be used in all combat and predator challenge maps. Previously, each map had predefined character selection; the addition of a harder difficulty setting on combat challenges; more round-based challenges as well as interior map locations; and the removal of the blue wall around the challenges, which players found distracting.|$|E
5|$|The embryos {{probably}} represented near-hatchlings. While {{the skeletal}} features {{were similar to}} those of the adults, the body proportions were very dissimilar. The head was big with a short snout and very large orbits, whose diameter amounts 39% of the entire skull length. The neck was short, contrasting to the very long neck in the adults. Girdle bones and caudals were relatively tiny. The forelimbs were of equal length to the hindlimbs, indicating that newly hatched Massospondylus were quadrupedal, unlike the bipedal adults. The discovery of hatching footprints with manus impressions confirmed their quadrupedality. These impressions show that the hand was not pronated, with palm faces facing each other and the thumb facing forwards. The unpronated manus and the <b>big</b> <b>head</b> indicate that an effective locomotion was not possible for newly hatched Massospondylus. Notably, the near-hatchings had no teeth, suggesting they had no way of feeding themselves. Based on the lack of teeth and the ineffective locomotion, scientists speculate that postnatal care might have been necessary. This is further supported by evidence that the hatchings remained at the nest sites until they had doubled in size.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 2013, Target Field {{has hosted}} every summer the Skyline Music Festival, named so because its seating, {{with only the}} seats around third base in an Amphitheatre-like manner, allows for {{extensive}} views of the Minneapolis skyline. The inaugural edition was held on July 26, 2013, featuring three of four bands in a package tour – Soul Asylum, Matthew Sweet and <b>Big</b> <b>Head</b> Todd and the Monsters, each of whom played one of their past albums in their entirety – along with Minnesota band Gear Daddies. The 6,752 tickets allowed by the section were sold out. The following edition was extended to two nights. August 8 featured an indie rock night sponsored by KCMP, featuring Andrew Bird, The New Pornographers, Thao and the Get Down Stay Down, S. Carey and Dosh. The following night was headlined by Melissa Etheridge, accompanied by the returning Gear Daddies, along with The Honeydogs, O.A.R. and The Rembrandts. Attendance was 2,500 for the first night and 5,500 for the second.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{well known}} local story and one version given by Robert Cunningham in 1740 in his manuscript, {{entitled}} the Right Honorable the Earl of Glencairn's family, is that MacBeth murders his cousin, King Duncan I. The king's son, Malcolm Canmore (<b>big</b> <b>head</b> in Gaelic) tries to reach temporary safe refuge in his castle of Corsehill (also Crosshill). MacBeth's men were almost upon Malcolm when he sees a peasant, Friskin (or Friskine), turning hay in a barn (or pasture) nearby. Friskin hides Malcolm who then escapes to England with Friskin as a retainer. King Harthacanute of England and Norway gave them protection. When Harthacanute died his successor King Edward the Confessor gave Malcolm an army which permitted him to conquer Scotland and kill King MacBeth. The grateful King Malcolm III (1031 to 1093) gave Friskine the thanedom or Baillery of Cunninghame and the family took this name, together with the motto of 'Over Fork Over' which they retain to this day. It is {{also said that the}} Cunninghams were 'Masters of the king's horses' and that they took their motto from this position in the 'punning way' which is typical of the armorial bearings and mottos of many an aristocratic family.|$|E

500|$|Richard Fox {{and others}} note that while Wooden Leg's version is corroborated by the oral {{tradition}} of other Cheyenne witnesses, notably that of Kate <b>Big</b> <b>Head,</b> {{a young woman who}} witnessed the battle, there is no corroboration in {{the oral tradition}} of the Sioux. Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, {{but it is hard to}} know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide". Fox in his turn has been criticized for selectively using Indian oral tradition when it suits him, but discarding it as nonsense when he finds it disagreeable.|$|E
500|$|Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth of Crims, the Red Queen. She is an {{amalgamation}} of two Carroll characters: the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts. Her {{first name}} is a play on the word [...] because she is easily irritated, obstreperous, impatient, and quick to anger. Bonham Carter's head was digitally increased to three times its original size on screen. The character hates animals, and chooses to use them as servants and furniture. It is implied that the Red Queen beheaded her former husband, the King. The actress took inspiration from her young daughter Nell, a toddler, stating that, [...] "The Red Queen is just like a toddler, because she's got a <b>big</b> <b>head</b> and she's a tyrant." ...|$|E

He had met the father of Kate <b>Big</b> <b>Head,</b> a witness to the Custer battle about whom he would later write. Another new contact was Jules Chaudel, who had been with the Cheyenne scouts at Fort Keogh. In October, Marquis completed Memoirs of a White Crow Indian and submitted it to The Century Company.

500|$|The Rodrigues parrot was {{described}} as being the largest parrot species on the island, with a <b>big</b> <b>head</b> and a long tail.

The skull was [...] long without the beak, [...] wide, and [...] deep. The coracoid (part of the shoulder) was [...] long, the humerus (upper-arm bone) , the ulna (lower-arm bone) , the femur (thigh-bone) , the tibia (lower-leg bone) , and the metatarsus (foot bone) [...] Its exact body length is unknown, but {{it may have been}} around , comparable {{to the size of a}} large cockatoo. Its tibia was 32% smaller than that of a female broad-billed parrot, yet the pectoral bones were of similar size, and proportionally its head was the largest of any Mascarene species of parrot.|$|E

2500|$|Sully arrived about 6 p.m. on {{the ridge}} {{overlooking}} the large, much dispersed Indian encampment. He estimated that only 600 to 700 of his men were present.

[...] Sully’s objective was to “corral” the Indians and he deployed his force to cut off their escape routes and to advance on the village. [...] He sent Colonel Wilson and the 6th Iowa to his right flank and Colonel Furnas and the 2nd Nebraska to his left to occupy several ravines which offered the Sioux an opportunity to conceal themselves from the soldiers and escape. [...] Covered on both flanks, Sully with three companies and artillery advanced into the encampment without serious opposition. [...] Two chiefs, Little Head and <b>Big</b> <b>Head,</b> and about 150 of their followers surrendered.

2500|$|Disney's {{most recent}} work on animating fur {{was for the}} titular {{character}} of the 2008 film Bolt, but the software they had used {{at the time was}} not ready for creating the realistic fur of the animals of Zootopia. Therefore, the studio's IT engineers developed the fur-controlling software iGroom, which gave character designers precise control over the brushing, shaping and shading of fur and made it possible to create a variety of eccentric character styles for each animal. The software was also able to control an unseen [...] "imaginary" [...] underlayer that gave fur a degree of plushness not seen before. This feature was used to create characters like Officer Clawhauser, who has a <b>big</b> <b>head</b> that is entirely made of spotted fur. Characters with noteworthy numbers of strands of hair or fur included both of the two lead characters, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, who each had around 2.5 million hairs; a giraffe with nine million strands of fur; a gerbil with 480,000 strands; and a rodent with more strands of hair than the 400,000 that were on Elsa's head in Frozen.|$|E
