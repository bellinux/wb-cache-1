A field investigation phase has been undertaken {{in conjunction with}} analytical studies to model the cracking process. It is shown that the front cracks in the pier cap developed because the bending tensile stress far exceeds the tensile strength, while the side crack caused by none bursting reinforcement. Based on the analysis results, an internally prestressing approach is provided, and the retrofitting effect is verified by finite element analysis. Strengthening with internally prestressed tendons of <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> is {{proven to be a}} reliable and relatively easy-to-install technique...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} direct Strut-and-Tie Model (STM) is {{proposed}} here {{to predict the}} ultimate shear strength of the reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> for shear span to depth ratio of 0. 4 to 2. 4. The model {{is based on the}} Kupfer-Gerstle Biaxial Compression-Tension failure criterion which includes the concrete softening effect produced by the presence of transverse tensile stress. The earlier models consider the stress distribution factor for the varied stress distribution across the section by assuming it as linear function which is derived by satisfying equilibrium conditions. In this study the principal stresses have been evaluated by satisfying the compatibility condition at the time of impending failure which has been accounted for the effective area of concrete resisting tension. Also the softening effect has been included by using the formula for tensile strength of cracked concrete proposed by Belarbi and Hsu. The proposed model has been validated with 43 experimental results by author and from literature which confirm the coherency and conservativeness of the predicted results. The parametric study on ultimate shear strength is done so as to infer the relation between various abstract quantities such as compressive strain, shear capacity, span depth ratio and other material properties and get a deeper insight into the behavior of the Pier cap. Thus this paper tries to extend the practical application of Strut-and-Tie Model for reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> in understanding the actual behavior of the structure on various dimensional and material parameters...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is aimed at}} examining experimentally and analytically the behavior of reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> strengthened with externally bonded reinforcement. In the experimental study, nine full-scale reinforced concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> were built, externally strengthened with stainless steel reinforcement, and ten tested to failure. Load, deflection, and strain measurements were collected and two potential failure mechanisms were identified. In the analytical part of this work, mechanics-based equations were developed for calculating the shear strength {{of these types of}} structural elements when a diagonal shear crack is formed under loading. In addition, a combined strut-and-tie/truss model is proposed for determining the strength of reinforced concrete bridge caps with externally bonded reinforcement.

40|$|Condition {{assessment}} of existing concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> using the general shear {{provisions of the}} AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification has caused the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) to post {{a large number of}} bridges in the State of Georgia. Posting of bridges disrupts the free flow of goods within the region served by the bridge and has a negative economic impact. To prevent structural deterioration, diagonal cracking or failure of concrete <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> in shear, the GDOT employs an in-situ strengthening technique that utilizes an external vertical post-tensioning system. However, the fundamental mechanics of this system and its effectiveness under service load have not been examined previously. This research examines the behavior of reinforced concrete <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> that utilize the above strengthening system in a combined analytical and experimental program. In the experimental part of the study, two groups of full-scale reinforced concrete deep beam specimens were tested. The first group consisted of six deep beams with shear span/depth ratios of approximately 1. 0, which is typical of <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> caps; of these six, two included the external post-tensioning system. In the second group, nine deep beam specimens that included a segment of the column representing the pier were tested; four of those tests included the external post-tensioning system. The tests revealed that the shear capacity computed using the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications provided a conservative estimate of the specimen capacity in all but one case when compared to the experimental results. However, the AASHTO strut and tie provisions were found to provide a much closer {{assessment of}} the load carrying mechanism in the <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> than the general shear provisions, in {{that they were able to}} predict the load at which yielding of the tension reinforcement occurred as well as the angle of the compression strut. The presence of the column segment in the second group had a significant impact on the failure mechanism developed in the specimen near ultimate load. The stress concentration at the reentrant corner between the <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> and column interface served as an attractor for the formation of diagonal shear cracks, a mechanism not observed in previous deep beam tests in shear. The research has led to recommendations for improving the design of <b>pier</b> <b>caps</b> and the external post-tensioning system, where required, based on mechanics which are consistent with the results of the experimental program.

40|$|Corrosion {{of steel}} tendons {{is a major}} problem for {{post-tensioned}} concrete, especially because corrosion of the steel strands is often hard to detect inside grouted ducts. Non-metallic tendons can serve as an alternative material to steel for post-tensioning applications. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), given its higher strength and elastic modulus, as well as excellent durability and fatigue strength, is the most practical option for post-tensioning applications. ^ The primary objective of this research project was to assess the feasibility of the use of innovative carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tendons and to develop guidelines for CFRP in post-tensioned bridge applications, including segmental <b>bridges</b> and <b>pier</b> <b>caps.</b> ^ An experimental investigation and a numerical simulation were conducted to compare the performance of a scaled segmental bridge model, post-tensioned with two types of carbon fiber strands and steel strands. The model was tested at different prestress levels and at different loading configurations. While the study confirms feasibility of both types of carbon fiber strands for segmental bridge applications, and their similar serviceability behavior, strands with higher elastic modulus could improve structural performance and minimize displacements beyond service loads. ^ As the second component of the project, a side-by-side comparison of two types of carbon fiber strands against steel strands was conducted in a scaled <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> model. Two different strand arrangements were used for post-tensioning, with eight and six strands, respectively representing an over-design and a slight under-design relative to the factored demand. The model was tested under service and factored loads. The investigation confirmed the feasibility of using carbon fiber strands in unbonded post-tensioning of <b>pier</b> <b>caps.</b> Considering both serviceability and overload conditions, the general performance of the <b>pier</b> <b>cap</b> model was deemed acceptable using either type of carbon fiber strands and quite comparable to that of steel strands. ^ In another component of this research, creep stress tests were conducted with carbon fiber composite cable (CFCC). The anchorages for all the specimens were prepared using a commercially available expansive grout. Specimens withstood 95 % of the guaranteed capacity provided by the manufacturer for a period of five months, without any sign of rupture. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{a bridge}} is built across an {{alluvial}} channel, the obstruction {{of the flow}} by the <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> induces higher velocities and vortices that cause scour of the channel bed around the piers. If this scour reaches the foundation level of the <b>bridge</b> <b>piers,</b> the <b>bridge</b> might collapse. <b>Bridge</b> <b>pier</b> scour {{is the leading cause}} of bridge failure. In Egypt, concerns about <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> scour is one of the important reasons for limiting the increase of the current flow releases from High Aswan Dam above the current maximum.

A 3 -dimensional moment–curvature and moment–rotation analysis program is created to generate the monotonic section {{response of}} a conventional and post-tensioned <b>bridge</b> <b>pier.</b> After comparing {{the accuracy of the}} section analysis program to the experimental testing of the monolithic pier, the program is validated against the experimental testing of the post-tensioned <b>bridge</b> <b>pier.</b> This section analysis program is then used in the calibration of a macro-model to capture the entire cyclic response of the post-tensioned <b>bridge</b> <b>pier.</b> The macro-model adopts multiple linear-elastic compression-only springs at the rocking interface, combined with non-linear inelastic springs for each of the mild-steel dissipaters and returns encouraging results at both local and global levels.

Using a two-dimensional tidal current numerical model, three different models were established: the non-bridge <b>pier</b> model, original <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> model, and simplified <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> model. The difference in hydrodynamic parameters, including water level, velocity, and diversion ratio, as well as time efficiency between these three models is discussed in detail. The results show that simplifying the pier group using the E-R method influences the water level and velocity near the piers, but has no influence on the diversion ratio of each cross-section of the Xuliujing reach located in the lower Yangtze River. Furthermore, the simplified <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> model takes half the calculation time that the original <b>bridge</b> <b>pier</b> model needs. Thus, it is concluded that the E-R method can be use to simplify <b>bridge</b> <b>piers</b> in tidal river section modeling reasonably and efficiently...|$|R
