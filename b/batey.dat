25|$|The Taíno {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} ball game called <b>batey.</b> Opposing teams had 10 to 30 players per team {{and used a}} solid rubber ball. Normally, the teams were composed of men, but occasionally women played the game as well. The Classic Taíno played in the village's center plaza or on especially designed rectangular ball courts called <b>batey.</b> Games on the <b>batey</b> {{are believed to have}} been used for conflict resolution between communities. The most elaborate ball courts are found at chiefdoms' boundaries. Often, chiefs made wagers on the possible outcome of a game.|$|E

50|$|The Dominican {{government}} has historically provided fewer public services to <b>bateys</b> than to similarly sized {{communities in the}} rest of the country. The <b>bateys</b> were regarded as exceptions to the country's governance system. It was often left to the State Sugar Council (CEA: Consejo Estatal de Azúcar) or private companies to provide basic services, a responsibility that all too often they did not fulfill. <b>Bateys</b> were often still regarded as places where only Haitians (non-citizens) live.|$|R
50|$|Since the Haitians who {{originally}} filled the <b>bateys</b> were not legal immigrants, their children {{have often been}} denied citizenship papers {{because they are in}} transit. Without citizenship papers from Haiti, these children of Haitian immigrants cannot go to school nor can they receive the benefits of other public services; however, a number of non-governmental organizations have attempted to address this problem by operating primary schools on <b>bateys</b> trying to get them Dominican citizenship.|$|R

25|$|<b>Batey,</b> a {{ball game}} played on many Caribbean islands {{including}} Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the West Indies, has been proposed as a descendent of the Mesoamerican ballgame, perhaps through the Maya.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, after McDonald resigned, former player Scott Young was put {{in charge}} of the Glens {{until the end of the}} 2010–11 season along with Pete <b>Batey</b> as {{assistant}} manager and Tim McCann as head coach. Young led Glentoran into the 2009–10 Irish League Cup final against Coleraine. The bannsiders were the favourites for the match but the Glens were the team who came out victorious, winning 4–1 on penalties after the match ended in a 2–2 draw. At the end of the season, Young along with <b>Batey</b> and McCann signed a deal with the Glens to stay on as manager. Former Glentoran manager Roy Coyle, who brought a huge amount of success, became director of football.|$|E

50|$|In the past, sugar was a {{profitable}} industry. However, the Dominican sugar industry {{is no longer}} competitive, and when combined with the historical lack of educational and health services to these communities, the low wages have tended to make <b>bateys</b> some of the poorest communities in the country.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, some {{of these}} {{migrants}} have stayed through the six months that follow the cane harvest (zafra), called [...] "dead time" [...] (tiempo muerto), and have started families with Haitian women that have migrated as well. <b>Bateys</b> are unique in culture and language in their mix of which is Haitian and which is Dominican.|$|R
25|$|In March 1963, she toured Victoria in the Union Theatre Repertory Company's double bill of George Bernard Shaw's Balkan satire Arms and the Man and Peter <b>Batey's</b> bush-life farce The No-Hopers (6 March 1963 – 10 April 1963). At the renamed St Martin's Theatre (formerly the Little Theatre), she {{appeared}} in her last play for a few years; Fay and Michael Kanin's adaptation of Ryūnosuke Akutagawa's Rashomon (5 February 1964 – 29 February 1964).|$|R

25|$|Knox's {{work was}} cut short when he fell ill with lymphoma. When he became unable to travel to Bletchley Park, he {{continued}} his cryptographic work {{from his home in}} Hughenden, Buckinghamshire, where he received the CMG. He died on 27 February 1943. A biography of Knox, written by Mavis <b>Batey,</b> one of 'Dilly's girls', the female codebreakers who worked with him, was published in September 2009.|$|E
50|$|With 44 {{years old}} {{he had more}} than 70 songs written as an autodidact, because he neither had any {{professional}} training nor musical knowledge, any others than listening the countryside sounds. He composed {{with a mix of}} genres, taking reference from rhythms he heard and knew, so he was making a proper style with themes about outside or personal events, impregnated with rural elements: the ox yoke, the smell of coal, the smell of <b>bateys.</b>|$|R
40|$|RNA {{backbone}} is biologically important {{with many}} roles in reactions and interactions, but {{has historically been}} a challenge in structural determination. It has many atoms and torsions to place, and often there is less data on it than one might wish. This problem leads to both random and systematic error, producing noise in an already high-dimensional and complex distribution to further complicate data-driven analysis. With {{the advent of the}} ribosomal subunit structures published in 2000, large RNA structures at good resolution, it became possible to apply the Richardson laboratory's quality-filtering, visualization, and analysis techniques to RNA and develop new tools for RNA as well. A first set of 42 RNA backbone rotamers was identified, developed, and published in 2003; it has since been thoroughly overhauled in conjunction with the backbone group of the RNA Ontology Consortium to combine the strengths of different approaches, incorporate new data, and produce a consensus set of 46 conformers. Meanwhile, extensive work has taken place on developing validation and remodeling tools to correct and improve existing structures as well as to assist in initial fitting. The use of base-phosphate perpendicular distances to identify sugar pucker has proven very useful in both hand-refitting and the semi-automated process of using RNABC (RNA Backbone Correction), a program developed in conjunction with Dr. Jack Snoeyink's laboratory. The guanine riboswitch structure ur 0039 / 1 U 8 D, by Dr. Rob <b>Batey's</b> laboratory, has been collaboratively refit and rerefined as a successful test case of the utility of these tools and techniques. Their testing and development will continue, and they are expected to help to improve RNA structure determination in both ease and quality. Dissertatio...|$|R
25|$|In April 2016 and June 2016, {{two former}} Vanderbilt {{football}} players {{were found guilty}} of charges related to the videotaped rape of an unconscious woman in a dorm room. Cory <b>Batey</b> was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, facilitation of aggravated rape, and attempted aggravated rape, while Brandon Vandenburg was convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated sexual battery, and unlawful photography. The two are among four former football players charged with crimes related to the case.|$|E
25|$|In December 2003, André told UK {{journalist}} Angus <b>Batey</b> that, {{following a}} Detroit concert {{in the midst}} of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case was less to do with Parks than with the lawyers. In April 2005, the judge in the case appointed an impartial representative for Parks after her family expressed concerns that her caretakers and her lawyers were pursuing the case based on their own financial interest. Later that same year, the members of OutKast were dropped as co-defendants, and Parks' lawyers continued to seek action against LaFace and parent company BMG.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, Fritz Ullmann {{found out}} that copper powder could {{significantly}} improve the reaction of aryl halides with phenols to give biaryl ethers. This reaction is known as Ullmann condensation. In 1906, I. Goldberg extended this reaction to synthesize an arylamine by reacting aryl halides with an amide {{in the presence of}} Potassium Carbonate and CuI. This reaction is known as Goldberg modified Ullmann condensation. In 2003, R. A. <b>Batey</b> and T. D. Quach have modified this kind of reactions by using potassium organotrifluoroborates salts to react with aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic amines or anilines to synthesize aryl ethers or aryl amines.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{psychologist}} J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity {{to be greater}} in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent thinking was associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals {{were found to have}} much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark <b>Batey</b> and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.|$|E
25|$|Joseph {{was born}} on August 31, 1931, in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic and lived in a <b>batey</b> (a sugar worker's town), whose family was {{originally}} from Les Cayes. He spent his early years surrounded by Christian missionaries. At birth, Joseph was refused Dominican citizenship in several attempts. Following the genocide of over 10,000 Haitians at the border due to the Parsley Massacre imposed by dictator Rafael Trujillo, his father moved him and his brother back to Haiti, where Haitian citizenship was acquired. By age 10, in addition to Spanish, he was fluent in his native Haitian Creole, French, and English. In 1954, he volunteered as an interpreter for a Baptist preacher, who assisted Joseph in coming to the United States. Joseph enrolled in the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois in 1954. Joseph remained in Chicago and later earned a BA in Anthropology from Wheaton College.|$|E
25|$|For {{decades after}} the end of the Second World War, the {{involvement}} of the GC, as well as the code breaking methods used, were kept secret. A number of controversial theories were published before more complete accounts emerged after records were declassified in 1978. Only later, after Dilly's rodding method was demonstrated by Mavis <b>Batey</b> to the Admiral in charge of naval history, were Italian official records corrected. In 1966, H. Montgomery Hyde published a story alleging that a spy (codename Cynthia) seduced Admiral Alberto Lais (the Italian naval attaché in Washington, D.C.) and that she obtained a codebook used by the British to defeat the Italians at Matapan. Hyde was found guilty of libelling the dead, but evidence of GC involvement was not made public at that time. In 1980, the BBC series Spy! included similar allegations about a spy called 'Cynthia' who obtained a codebook. In 1974, Frederick Winterbotham in The Ultra Secret falsely credited the decryption of Luftwaffe Enigma traffic.|$|E
25|$|Zarzuela {{reached its}} peak {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. A string of front-rank composers such as Gonzalo Roig, Eliseo Grenet, Ernesto Lecuona and Rodrigo Prats {{produced}} a series of hits for the Regina and Martí theatres in Havana. Great stars like the vedette Rita Montaner, who could sing, play the piano, dance and act, were the Cuban equivalents of Mistinguett and Josephine Baker in Paris. Some of the best known zarzuelas are La virgen morena (Grenet), La Niña Rita (Grenet and Lecuona), María la O, El <b>batey,</b> Rosa la China (all Lecuona); Gonzalo Roig with La Habana de noche; Rodrigo Prats with Amalia Batista and La perla del caribe; and above all, Cecilia Valdés (the musical of the most famous Cuban novel of the 19th century, with music by Roig and script by Prats and Agustín Rodríguez). Artists who were introduced to the public in the lyric theatre include Caridad Suarez, María de los Angeles Santana, Esther Borja and Ignacio Villa, who had such a round, black face that Rita Montaner called him Bola de Nieve ('Snowball').|$|E

MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic described the song as a [...] "soulful disposition". Meghan Bard of The Daily Campus described the single featuring [...] "a great up-tempo number with gritty guitar riffs and powerful vocals" [...] from Levine. Bard noted that the theme in the song was about [...] "recovering from heartbreak". Angus <b>Batey</b> of The Times compared [...] "Harder to Breathe" [...] sounding as [...] "Zeppelin-esque".|$|E
500|$|According to Yahoo! Music {{journalist}} Angus <b>Batey,</b> American Gangster used [...] "a {{selection of}} beats built from '70s soul and funk" [...] to reflects [...] "the period setting; lyrically, its primary theme is {{an investigation of}} the evolution of the gangsta archetype, looking at how the drug dealer became a semi-sympathetic outlaw figure, examining the contradictions inherent in those who chase the American Dream {{on the far side of}} legality, and ruminating on what this period of US history might yet come to mean". Although Jay-Z says American Gangster was inspired by the movie of the same name, songs such as [...] "Say Hello" [...] touch on the topics of censorship and the Jena 6 controversy.|$|E
500|$|The concerts were {{received}} well. Simon O'Hagan, reviewing the London concert in The Independent, {{described it as}} [...] "a moving, memorable evening" [...] {{and went on to}} describe McCulloch's voice as [...] "torn silk" [...] and [...] "magnificent". Giving the London concert five out of five stars, Angus <b>Batey,</b> writing in The Guardian, described [...] "The Killing Moon" [...] as a [...] "dizzying high" [...] which was [...] "topped by 'Ocean Rain' itself, where the strings are held back {{until the end of the}} second verse so that they hit with a euphoric punch of almost physical intensity, sunny melodic optimism piercing the lyrics' chiaroscuro of storm clouds and 'blackest thoughts'." [...] However, Adam Sweeting, for The Daily Telegraph, said the orchestra [...] "often didn't add much beyond a vague sonic sludge".|$|E
500|$|Angus <b>Batey</b> from Yahoo! Music {{described}} [...] "R Junkie" [...] {{as one of}} {{the high}} points from Damita Jo, describing it as a delicious throwback. BBC Music's Ian Warde asserted that the song [...] "is a nice Evelyn Champagne King infused number that parties like it's 1982". Similarly, Michael Paoletta from Billboard called the song a [...] "winner" [...] from Damita Jo and noted that it [...] "fabulously" [...] referenced the sampled song. Mikael Wood from Baltimore City Paper commented that [...] "R Junkie" [...] had an enough positive vibe to shame American musician Michael J. Powell into early retirement. Ernest Hardy from LA Weekly described the song as the second best song from Damita Jo, after [...] "Like You Don't Love Me". Spence D. from IGN called it as ultimately non-descript, despite considering it infectious.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, The Oval was {{the site}} of a protest by the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster against a {{decision}} by the Irish Football Association to allow football matches to be played on Sundays, a first in Northern Ireland due to traditional sabbatarianism. The protesters were concerned that regular Sunday matches would attract churchgoers away from attending church. The protest was led by Reverend David McIlveen, who said [...] "Fundamentally, it is a desecration of God's day." [...] In October 2010 the British National Party (BNP), who were trying to gain electoral support, held a rally outside The Oval. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Member of the Legislative Assembly, Robin Newton described the BNP's presence outside The Oval as [...] "nauseous". In July 2011, an incendiary bomb was discovered outside The Oval requiring evacuation of surrounding streets. In October 2011 during an Irish Cup match between Glentoran and Portadown, a Portadown fan threw fireworks onto the pitch, injuring Glentoran's assistant manager Pete <b>Batey</b> and goalkeeping coach Davy McClelland.|$|E
500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{has been}} labeled as an R, hip hop, and pop, {{culminating}} in a [...] "Southern rap ballad". It {{has been described as}} [...] "slow" [...] and [...] "lulling", as well as, [...] "charming and unabashedly sweet", having an [...] "up lifting melody". Its chorus and bridge is [...] "silky-smooth". Pitchfork's Jayson Greene said the whole album sound as a [...] "sticky-sweet" [...] for [...] "modern-rock radio", including [...] "Nothin' on You". Angus <b>Batey</b> from The Guardian called the recording [...] "glorious, euphoric, essentially old-fashioned kind of love song". The track is backed by a [...] "jazzy" [...] piano, a [...] "Jim Jonsin-helmed beat", funky elements and contains an interpolation of Joe Tex's [...] "I Gotcha". According to the digital sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing, it was composed in time signature of common time and in the key of B-flat major, and follows a chord progression of Eb 9-Cm 9-Dm-F, with a tempo of 104 beats per minute. B.o.B's and Mars' vocal range span from F4 to Bb5.|$|E
500|$|Rating Charmbracelet {{two out of}} five stars, Barry Walters from Rolling Stone {{wrote that}} none of the songs were bold, that the lack of hooks made the album weak, and said, [...] "Carey needs bold songs that help her use the power and range for which she is famous. Charmbracelet is like a stream of watercolors that bleed into a puddle of brown." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine complimented Carey's mixture of pop and hip hop melodies, and wrote, [...] "Though there's nothing as {{immediate}} as 'Fantasy' or 'My All' here, Charmbracelet is significantly less contrived than 1999's Rainbow and almost as creatively liberating as Butterfly. British columnist Angus <b>Batey,</b> writing for Yahoo! Music UK called the songs on Charmbracelet forgettable, and wrote, [...] "She used to take risks, but Charmbracelet is conservative, unadventurous and uninspiring; and, while it's understandable that simply to make another record marks a triumph of sorts, it's impossible to admire Mariah to the degree that her talent ought to merit." [...] John Mulvey from NME criticized its content, writing, [...] "Nominally, Charmbracelet is R, much like Tony Blair is nominally a socialist...Tragedies, all told, have been worse" ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{it finds}} B.o.B {{throwing}} away his old habits {{and telling the}} girl he loves {{not to worry about}} other women as he wants to [...] "settle down", while flattering her. In the hook and bridge, Mars is able to allure the girl, who is the object of all this affection, by serenading her. B.o.B, during his verses, makes references appealing not only to younger supporters, [...] "Just like that, girl, you got me froze/ Like a Nintendo 64", but also to older admirers, [...] "Baby you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes". Tiny Mix Tapes pointed out that the song's lyrics use [...] "clumsy analogies". <b>Batey</b> found B.o.B's attitude and rapping verses care free, in which you can almost hear him smiling. David Jeffries had a different opinion, stating that the rapper [...] "courts the ladies" [...] on the song along with Mars. He also added that B.o.B transmitted his [...] "positive vibes" [...] on [...] "Nothin' on You". B.o.B compared the song's [...] "spirit" [...] to [...] "Bonita Applebum" [...] by A Tribe Called Quest. Mars confessed that the lyrics are about someone, saying they come from [...] "real-life experience, whether it's at the time or me back-tracking to how I felt at another moment." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Billboards Evan J. Nabavian gave the song a 4 out of 5 starts, denoting that the song explores the swell appeal [...] "between Mars' delicately delivered melodies and B.o.B.'s Southern twang." [...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd be a fool to give a hoot." [...] Lee Tyler from Blues & Souls awarded the single 8 out of 10 stars, calling it a [...] "delight" [...] from its beginning until the end. He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper {{plenty of room to}} flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B. [...] "drops lovestruck bars as agile as they are flattering," [...] and the [...] "silky-smooth bridge and chorus" [...] Mars uses to seduce [...] "the woman in question". Angus <b>Batey</b> thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches that have come to pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E
