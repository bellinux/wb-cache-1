40|$|Since World War II, {{international}} trade has expanded exponentially and the United States has had substantial incentives to negotiate trade agreements {{with a view}} toward lowering tariffs reciprocally. The United States has also benefited from entry into the North American Free Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 NAFTA 2 ̆ 2) in 1992, the Canada-United States Free-Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 CFTA 2 ̆ 2) in 1988, and the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement in 1985. The Canadian goal had been to eliminate existing antidumping and countervailing duty rules [in the United States] and to negotiate {{a new set of}} laws modeled on competition law principles with a binational tribunal to enforce them. Chapter 19 of the CFTA provides for <b>binational</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> in antidumping and countervailing duty cases. However, Chapter 19 also retains the substantive domestic antidumping and countervailing duty laws of the United States and Canada. Article 1904 expressly recites the parties 2 ̆ 7 intention to replace judicial review of antidumping and countervailing duty determinations with binational panel review. The two governments had to agree on the selection of the fifth panelist.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and controversial legal issues arising in connection with <b>binational</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> panels under the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and its predecessor, the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (“CFTA”), has been the standard of judicial review that panels must apply to U. S. antidumping (“AD”) and countervailing duty (“CVD”) cases. This standard generated particular controversy in three cases involving substantial amounts of trade from Canada into the United States [...] lumber, swine, and frozen pork. The United States contended that panels reviewing U. S. agencies 2 ̆ 7 decisions in those cases incorrectly applied the standard of review by failing to grant the requisite deference to the agency. When the United States challenged the panels 2 ̆ 7 decisions before Extraordinary Challenge Committees (“ECCs”), the ECCs let them stand. As a result, when negotiating the NAFTA, the United States succeeded in strengthening the attention paid to the standard of review that ECCs must grant when reviewing panel decisions. The United States 2 ̆ 7 experience with binational panels has thus enhanced awareness of the concept of standard of review. While an explanation of the standard could fill volumes and cover hundreds of cases, the Authors of this Essay will attempt to present a practical, common sense analysis that may aid practitioners, panelists, law students, business people, and scholars to appreciate better the application of this principle...|$|E

The mechanism under GATT 1947 had many weaknesses which resulted to the need of reform. The procedure under GATT 1947 was not contradictory and {{all members of the}} <b>Dispute</b> <b>Settlement</b> Body (DSB) were entitled to use the veto right when adopting the reports. The contracting parties were conscious of such weaknesses and they have agreed on a new <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system during the Uruguay round. The <b>Dispute</b> <b>Settlement</b> Understanding (DSU) is part of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The new system remains inter-state mechanism and as a consequence, available only to the Member States, excluding individuals and business operators. The <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> under WTO has become compulsory while leaving each member the choice between this standard procedure and other dispute modes, such as Good Offices, Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. The <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system has been unified and has become more judicial. It excludes national jurisdictions and means strengthening the multilateralism.

40|$|Many claim {{a process}} of judicialization of {{international}} <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures is taking place. In order to capture this ongoing process we introduce an analytical framework to assess the degree of judicialization of international <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures. We then proceed to present preliminary results of applying this framework to the procedure and practice of <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> in the United Nations Security Council. In our concept, judicialization means that international <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures increasingly incorporate the normative principle of impartiality, i. e. the principle of a comparable treatment of comparable breaches of law. We use a graded scale ranging from purely diplomatic to predominantly judicial procedures to assess the degree of judicialization of any given <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedure. From our institutionalist point of view, it is entirely an empirical question whether – and if so when – judicialized <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures lead to a corresponding practice of judicialized <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement.</b> For this reason we analyze in a second step the corresponding practice of <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement.</b> The degree of judicialization of the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedure {{within the framework of}} the United Nations Security Council remains low. Nonetheless, our comparison of the periods 1974 - 1983 and 1990 - 1999 suggests so far an increasing judicialization of the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> practice within the Security Council. ...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of unfair trade laws {{has become}} an {{important}} topic in negotiations on preferential trading areas. Recent preferential trading areas involving the United States, {{one of the most}} significant users of these laws, have established special <b>binational</b> <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> panels to arbitrate disagreements. Using a panel database of U. S. antidumping and countervailing duty activity from 1980 through 2000, the article examines whether the use of dispute settlement panels has reduced such activity between the United States and its North American Free Trade Agreement partners. The analysis finds little evidence for any effect, calling into question the effectiveness of dispute settlement panels in reducing unfair trade law activity. With the success of multilateral trade negotiation rounds under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) in reducing traditional forms of trade protection, such as tariffs and quotas, attention has turned to the use of antidumping and countervailing duty laws by WTO member countries. In some countries, these laws have been on the books since well before the GATT/WTO existed. However, as GATT/WTO membership has grown over the past two decades, such activity has exploded. 1 This trend is worrisome for its implications for the ultimate effectiveness of recent and future GATT/WTO rounds. It may be that countries with antidumping and countervailing duty laws are willing to negotiate greater reductions in other forms of trade protection, since such laws allow the most import-sensitive sectors a channel of relief when negotiated reductions in trade barriers take place. But it is also the case that increased antidumping and countervailing duty activity may seriously undermine free trade agreements that do not fully addres...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the compliance problem that exists in the World Trade Organization (WTO) <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> {{provisions}} of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC or Convention), and the potential and actual role that they play in oceans governance. The study focuses {{not only on the}} traditional role of <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms in peacefully settling disputes, but also on their potential for contribution to good oceans governance in many ways. The jurisprudence generated so far under the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> provisions of the LOSC can be called neither a complete success nor a total failure. Part XV of the Convention, dealing with <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures, has made a promising start with the inaugural jurisprudence under the prompt release and provisional measures proceedings. However, besides the general beneficial influence of the jurisprudence on oceans governance, a few detrimental developments have also been identified from the perspective of oceans governance. The present thesis demonstrates that a lot of hope had been pinned on the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> provisions at the time when the LOSC was drafted. However, most of these hopes have not yet found expression, and if the limited use of <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures continues, it is unlikely that Part XV will fulfil those hopes in the future. Nevertheless, this thesis argues along more optimistic lines, and expresses a realistic hope that the actual role of <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> in oceans governance will improve in the future. The thesis concludes that {{the success or failure of}} the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms mostly depends upon their actual use made by states. Further, the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms once invoked must be able to settle disputes objectively on the basis of law, equity and justice and uphold the principles and provisions of the LOSC. It is hoped that states will have recourse to Part XV more often for the purpose of settling their disputes peacefully, and that the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> provisions will in turn fulfil their mandate. Only then will the world witness the <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms playing a real and beneficial role in oceans governance, concurrently with other oceans governance institutions and arrangements...|$|R

40|$|Analysing {{disputes}} between the US and the EU under GATT and the WTO respectively, the paper {{demonstrates that the}} judicialization (or legalization) of international <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> procedures can contribute to states’ compliance with these <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> mechanisms. The paper compares four sets of pairwise similar disputes with US had with the EU: the socalled Domestic International Sales Corporations (DISC) case (which arose under GATT) and the Foreign Sales Corporations case (which was settled through WTO procedures), the Steel case (GATT) and the Patents case (WTO), the two Hormones cases under GATT and the WTO respectively, and the Citrus case (GATT) and the Bananas case (WTO).

From the legal point of view, they have fuelled a lively doctrinal debate on fragmentation of international law and the role of non-WTO norms in the WTO dispute resolution mechanism. The thesis conceives legitimacy as a notion consisting of various interlinked components, including social, substantive, formal and procedural ones, and analyses the operation of the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system in light of these criteria. It shows that the compulsory but materially restricted jurisdiction of the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> limits its ability to solve disputes involving non-trade interests and legal norms. The dissertation argues, however, that some of the ensuing problems could be remedied if the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system approached international environmental law in a more constructive, consistent and transparent manner. Turning to the formal and procedural elements of legitimacy, the thesis conceives the situation of the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system as a dilemma between the pressure to improve substantive legitimacy by considering environmental norms and interests, and the need to observe the limits of its judicial function. It explores tensions at the boundary between the WTO and its Member States, arguing that only limited potential exists to enhance the authority of the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> through 'importing' substantive legitimacy. Finally, the dissertation highlights institutional and systemic problems arising from fragmentation of international law. Using the relationship between the WTO and the international climate change regime as an example, it concludes that the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system's legitimacy challenge involves two dimensions. Certain unexploited potential exists to improve the situation through the judicial techniques at the disposal of the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system. However, the more profound and systemic problems are incapable of solution by the WTO <b>dispute</b> <b>settlement</b> system or even by WTO negotiators alone. Instead, they would require broader international efforts...|$|R
