5000|$|Many of the {{biography}} pages within Lawton's books have a decidedly tongue-in-cheek bent with hobbies {{listed as the}} 'cultivation of the onion and obscure varieties of potato', or 'growing leeks'. Those close to him would stress that such descriptions are meant quite seriously. His author <b>bio</b> <b>notes</b> that [...] "since 2000 he {{has lived in the}} high, wet hills of Derbyshire England, with frequent excursions into the high, dry hills of Arizona and Italy." ...|$|E

50|$|Runamuck's Dreamwave <b>bio</b> <b>noted</b> {{that while}} Runabout's {{destructive}} impulses {{came from his}} sadism, Runamuck simply does it because he likes to have fun. Unfortunately for others this fun usually involves random and flagrant destruction. Oddly, he admires wrecked cars {{as if they were}} works of art. This is part of why the psychotic Runabout keeps him about - because only Runamuck can appreciate the damage that his fellow Battlecharger causes. He is slightly stronger and smarter than the average Decepticon. Oddly, he is terrified of heights.|$|R
5000|$|As with The New Order, {{players can}} {{complete}} [...] "Perks"; each Perk has a task the player can complete. Perks encourage the player {{to change their}} play style on the fly; collecting [...] "helmets", getting silent kills, killing specific enemies a select number of times, getting a set number of kills with a specific weapon, and getting kills via explosives {{are some of the}} objectives. Once a Perk's task is complete, the player unlocks a bonus, such as more overall health or armor, more ammunition for a certain weapon, or the ability to gain health after a silent takedown. Various collectibles are also scattered throughout the levels; concept art, character models and <b>bios,</b> <b>notes,</b> which tell small side stories of the game, and gold bars are some of the collectables.|$|R
5000|$|Bain even {{fought a}} few {{competitive}} heavyweights in his career, though {{perhaps it was}} ill-advised. He fought future World Heavyweight contender Tony Galento, in Dreamland Park on September 30, 1931, losing in a fourth-round TKO. Bain's New Jersey Hall of Fame <b>bio</b> <b>noted</b> that in 1935, Bain fought Galento again, outweighed {{by as much as}} fifty pounds and the fight resulted in hospitalization and injuries that sped Bain's retirement from boxing. Galento would become a Heavyweight World contender fighting Joe Lewis on June 28, 1939, in Philadelphia, actually knocking Lewis to the mat in the bout, but losing in a fourth-round TKO. It is possible Bain's loss to Galento, which cost him seven weeks of hospitalization, made him a more likely model for Anthony Quinn's character [...] "Mountain" [...] Rivera in Quinn's classic boxing movie Requiem for a Heavyweight. The movie's plot centered on a Heavyweight's tragic loss to a stronger opponent on the poor advice of an ambitious manager.|$|R
5000|$|After {{years of}} {{releases}} using degraded 16mm (for TV) and old theatrical 35mm prints, the film finally received a deluxe DVD release in 2006 from Dark Sky Films. The DVD provides extensive special features including an audio commentary by director Roy Ward Baker and cameraman Neil Binney, plus [...] "Inside the Fear Factory" [...] (a featurette about Hammer rival Amicus Films), {{cast and crew}} <b>bios,</b> liner <b>notes,</b> trailers and a still photo gallery. The film was remastered from a pristine 35mm print.|$|R
5000|$|The archduke had an {{interest}} in Romani language and occasionally wrote on this topic to Albert Thomas Sinclair, an American lawyer who shared this interest. A <b>bio</b> of Sinclair <b>notes</b> that the archduke sent a copy of his work, “a large octavo volume handsomely bound It is a most important and valuable philological work comparing the gypsy words with Sanskrit, Hindustani Persian, etc.” ...|$|R
50|$|In 2003, SIHR started {{developing}} its statistical database, available to members on its web site. Starting {{with the paper}} records of SIHR members Ernie Fitzsimmons, John Patton and Pat Conway, combined with the input of a 10,000 player database developed by Dave Weigum, SIHR's database has grown to include over 250,000 players, coaches and officials. The database includes statistics {{dating back to the}} 1886-87 season for various professional, semi-professional and amateur male and female leagues. The player profiles include <b>notes,</b> <b>bios</b> and in some cases photos.|$|R
500|$|The two-disc DVD release which {{followed}} in October 22, 2002 contained the original theatrical and 20th Anniversary extended {{versions of the}} film. Spielberg personally demanded the release feature both versions. The features on disc one included an introduction with Steven Spielberg, a 20th Anniversary premiere featurette, John Williams' performance at the 2002 premiere and a Space Exploration game. Disc two included a 24-minute documentary about the 20th Anniversary edition changes, a [...] "Reunion" [...] featurette, a trailer, cast and filmmaker <b>bios,</b> production <b>notes,</b> and the still galleries ported from the 1996 LaserDisc set. The two-disc edition, {{as well as a}} three-disc collector's edition containing a [...] "making of" [...] book, a certificate of authenticity, a film cell, and special features that were unavailable on the two-disc edition, were placed in moratorium on December 31, 2002. Later, it was re-released on DVD as a single-disc re-issue in 2005, featuring only the 20th Anniversary version.|$|R
40|$|Background Information {{reported}} by scientific literature still remains {{locked up in}} discrete documents that are not always interconnected or machine-readable. The Semantic Web together with approaches such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative offer a connectivity tissue {{that can be used}} to support the generation of self-describing, machine-readable documents. Results Biotea is an approach to generate RDF from scholarly documents. Our RDF model makes extensive use of existing ontologies and semantic enrichment services. Our dataset comprises 270, 834 articles from PubMed Open Central in RDF/XML distributed in 404 zipped files. The RDFization process takes care of metadata, e. g., title, authors and journal, as well as semantic annotations on biological entities along the full text. Biological entities are extracted by using the NCBO Annotator and Whatizit. We use the Bibliographic Ontology (BIBO), Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Terms (DCMI-terms), and the Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) to model the bibliographic metadata. Links to related pages such as PubMed HTML articles are provided via rdfs:seeAlso while links to other semantic representation such as Bio 2 RDF PubMed articles are provided via owl:sameAs. The NCBO Annotator is used to extract entities covering ChEBI for chemicals; Pathway, and Functional Genomics Data Society (MGED) for genes and proteins; Master Drug Data Base (MDDB), NDDF, and NDFRT for drugs; SNOMED, SYMP, MedDRA, MeSH, MedlinePlus Health Topics (MedlinePlus), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), FMA, ICD 10, and Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI) for diseases and medical terms; PO for plants; and MeSH, SNOMED, and NCIt for general terms. Whatizit is used for GO, UniProt proteins, UniProt Taxonomy, and diseases mapped to the UMLS; UniProt taxa are also mapped to NCBI Taxon vocabulary. Conclusions Biotea delivers models and tools for metadata enrichment and semantic processing of biomedical documents. Our dataset makes it easier to access to the first bunch of RDFized articles following the Biotea model. Our future plans include updating our dataset on regular basis in order to incorporate the latest articles added to the PubMed Open Central collection, next delivery is planned for the first half of 2017. Following datasets will support a mapping to the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) in order to accomplish to the guidelines set by <b>Bio</b> 2 RDF. <b>Notes</b> Biotea approach in full is available at [URL] (Garcia Castro, L. J., C. McLaughlin, and A. Garcia, Biotea: RDFizing PubMed Central in Support for the Paper as an Interface to the Web of Data. Biomedical semantics, 2013. 4 Suppl 1 : p. S 5).
