5|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of {{the water}} pipit is the {{mountains}} of southern Europe and Asia from Spain to central China, along with the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Corsica.|$|E
5|$|The {{continental}} <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of the blackcap {{lies between}} the 14–30° July isotherms, and {{is occupied by}} the nominate subspecies, the other forms being restricted to islands or fringe areas in the Caucasus and eastern Iberia. Birds on the Mediterranean and Atlantic islands and in the milder west {{and south of the}} main Eurasian distribution often winter within the nesting range, but populations elsewhere are migratory. The blackcap is a leap-frog migrant; birds from the north of the <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> travel furthest south, whereas Mediterranean breeders move much shorter distances. The wintering areas overlap with the <b>breeding</b> <b>range,</b> but also include extensive areas in West Africa, East Africa south to Lake Malawi, and further north in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Eritrea. The large majority of birds wintering in eastern Africa are of the southwest Asian race, S. a. dammholzi.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, at {{the extreme}} edge of the fieldfare's <b>breeding</b> <b>range,</b> {{only a handful of}} pairs breed. It is {{therefore}} classified by the RSPB as a Red List species as of January 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} population {{moves to}} its <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> during March and April; near the northernmost {{limit of the}} green heron's <b>range,</b> <b>breeding</b> is well underway {{by the end of}} May. The migration to the winter quarters starts in September; by late October, the birds are absent from regions where they do not stay all year. At least the northward migration {{does not seem to be}} affected by global warming; birds appear in their <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> at the same time they did 100 years ago.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} parula winters south of its <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> in Central America and the West Indies, where the tropical parula is a usually a permanent resident.|$|R
50|$|They will {{mate with}} the same partner from year to year, as long as both birds survive. They {{sometimes}} hybridize with red-naped sapsuckers or red-breasted sapsuckers where their <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> overlap.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is non-migratory in the milder {{west and}} south of its <b>breeding</b> <b>range,</b> but some northern birds move south in winter, and individuals breeding on mountains may descend to a lower altitude in winter. Winter movements and post-breeding dispersal may lead to vagrancy outside the normal range. Wintering migrants of the Asian subspecies have been recorded in South Korea and China, and the nominate form has been recorded west of its <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> as far as Orkney, Scotland. The Eurasian treecreeper has also occurred as a vagrant to the Channel Islands (where the short-toed is the resident species), Majorca and the Faroe Islands.|$|E
5|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of the European {{nightjar}} comprises Europe {{north to}} around latitude 64°N and Asia north to about 60°N and east to Lake Baikal and eastern Mongolia. The southern limits are northwestern Africa, Iraq, Iran and the northwestern Himalayas. This nightjar formerly bred in Syria and Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{nature of}} this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory by finding a vacant area or replacing a dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of an adult pair.|$|E
50|$|Wilsonia {{is a small}} genus of New World warblers which {{breed in}} North America. They are migratory, {{wintering}} south of their <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> in Central America, the West Indies or South America.|$|R
50|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> of the {{two species}} do not overlap; while their {{appearance}} and songs are very similar, the calls are completely different (see below). They also show marked difference in mtDNA sequence.|$|R
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the white-rumped swallow, but lacks the white {{forehead}} of that species and has bluer upperparts and grey underwing-coverts. In addition to this, the <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> of the two have almost no overlap.|$|R
5|$|Estimates of the European {{population}} of the European nightjar range from 470,000 to more than 1million birds, suggesting a total global {{population of}} 2–6million individuals. Although {{there appears to be}} a fall in numbers, it is not rapid enough to trigger the vulnerability criteria. The huge <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> and population mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Its <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> {{extends from}} central and western Alaska across {{northern}} Canada to Nova Scotia, and south throughout North America, into central Mexico and the Caribbean. It {{is a local}} breeder in Central America and is widely distributed throughout South America. Most birds breeding in Canada and the northern United States migrate south in the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to western Europe.|$|E
5|$|Migration southwards {{from the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> starts in October but {{the bulk of}} birds arrive in the United Kingdom in November. Some of these are still on passage and carry on into {{continental}} Europe but others remain. The passage-migrants return in April and they and the resident migrants depart from the United Kingdom mostly by early May.|$|E
50|$|Subsequent to {{the recent}} {{split-up}} of the genus Sturnus, this species and the common starling are the only species retained in the genus. Hybrids with common starling are found occasionally where the <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> overlap in northeast Spain.|$|R
50|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> and {{seasons of}} the two species do not overlap. The standard-winged {{nightjar}} disperses southwards for breeding in the late northern hemisphere winter, while the pennant-winged nightjar crosses the equator southwards to breed in the early southern hemisphere summer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> of the rufous-thighed and {{sharp-shinned hawk}} is entirely allopatric. This allopatry {{combined}} with differences in plumage (see appearance) and, apparently, certain measurements, {{has been the}} background for the split, but hard scientific data are presently lacking (AOU).|$|R
5|$|P. c. canadensis, the {{nominate}} subspecies, breeds {{from northern}} British Columbia east to Prince Edward Island, and {{south to the}} northern reaches of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Vermont, and New Hampshire, as well as northeastern New York and Maine. It winters at lower altitudes within the <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> and south to southern Ontario and Massachusetts, and is an occasional visitor to central Minnesota, southeastern Wisconsin, northwestern Pennsylvania, and central New York. P. c. canadensis is a vagrant to northeastern Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).|$|E
5|$|P. c. collybita, the {{nominate}} form, breeds in Europe east to Poland and Bulgaria, and {{is described}} below. It mainly winters {{in the south}} of its <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> around the Mediterranean and in North Africa. It has been expanding its range northwards into Scandinavia since 1970 and close to the southern edge of the range of P. c. abietinus.|$|E
5|$|Siberian {{accentors}} {{leave the}} north of their <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> from mid-September onwards, but may stay for a further month {{or two in the}} south. In spring, returning birds pass through Mongolia from the end of March and south easternmost Russia in April and May, reaching their breeding grounds in May, perhaps as late as June in the far north.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the success of crows, {{compared}} to ravens, is their ability to overlap breeding territory. During breeding season, crows were shown to overlap breeding territory six times as much as ravens. This invasion of <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> allowed a related increase in local population density.|$|R
25|$|Autumn {{migration}} occurs from August to December, with {{males and}} non-breeders moving south before the females and juveniles. Spring migration to <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> occurs from late February to mid-May, with males and older birds moving North first. There has been evidence of birds travelling {{as far north}} as Greenland and Iceland.|$|R
50|$|At {{least several}} {{dozen or more}} {{reported}} sightings have been confirmed by biologists, many of whom believe they are accounted for by escaped captives or individual members of the western subspecies who have wandered {{hundreds of miles from}} their established <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> in the Dakotas or elsewhere in the west.|$|R
5|$|T. m. achrusterus breeds from {{southern}} Oklahoma east to Maryland and western Virginia and south to northern Florida and the Gulf states. It winters {{through much of}} {{the southern part of the}} <b>breeding</b> <b>range.</b> It is smaller than the nominate subspecies. The black feathers of the forehead and crown have pale gray tips. The underparts are paler than those of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) is {{a common}} species of wren that is a {{resident}} in {{the eastern half of}} the United States of America, the extreme south of Ontario, Canada, and the extreme northeast of Mexico. Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their <b>breeding</b> <b>range.</b> Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the state bird of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} masked shrike to be between 105,000–300,000 individuals, suggesting a global total of 142,000–600,000 birds. Although the population appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and extensive <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of about , mean that this shrike is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
50|$|Autumn {{migration}} occurs from August to December, with {{males and}} non-breeders moving south before the females and juveniles. Spring migration to <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> occurs from late February to mid-May, with males and older birds moving North first. There has been evidence of birds travelling {{as far north}} as Greenland and Iceland.|$|R
50|$|Two {{subspecies}} exist, with discrete <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges.</b> The nominate subspecies, O. r. ruficapilla, breeds {{in northeastern}} North America. The other subspecies, O. r. ridgwayi, {{known as the}} Calaveras warbler, nests in western North America. The latter differs from the former in its relatively duller plumage and more persistent tail movements.|$|R
40|$|Monarch {{butterfly}} (Danaus plexippus) {{populations have}} undergone extensive declines since the mid- 1990 s due to habitat loss and fragmentation in wintering and <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges.</b> Urbanization and intensiveagricultural practices in <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> have reduced populations of monarch obligate host milkweeds (Asclepias sp.). Little information exists on western monarch demography and no information exists regarding habitat suitability. In light of increasing conservation concerns and prospective Endangered Species Act listing, we determined the distribution, abundance, and demography of monarchs in Treasure Valley, ID. We employed citizen science efforts and the ArcGIS Collector app to collect milkweed and monarch occurrences and habitat characteristics. We used generalized linear mixed models and model selection procedures {{to evaluate the}} importance of breeding site characteristics on breeding patch selection and success. Here, we present results of our model and discuss their implications for monarch butterfly conservation...|$|R
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{estimates}} the European {{population of the}} yellowhammer to be from 54–93million individuals, suggesting a Eurasian total of 73–186million birds. Although the population {{appears to be in}} a decline, the decrease is not rapid enough to trigger the IUCN vulnerability criteria. The large numbers and huge <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> of about 12.9million km2 (5million sq mi), mean that this bunting is classified by the IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The pintail or {{northern}} pintail (Anas acuta) is a duck with wide geographic distribution that breeds {{in the northern}} areas of Europe, Asia and North America. It is migratory and winters south of its <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> to the equator. Unusually for a bird with such a large range, it has no geographical subspecies if the possibly conspecific duck Eaton's pintail {{is considered to be}} a separate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} breeds {{in most of}} Europe (although not in {{the greater part of}} Iberia, lowland Italy or {{southern}} Greece), and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. It reaches to 75°N in Norway, but only to about 60°N in Siberia. Birds from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, but only some of the birds in the milder west of the <b>breeding</b> <b>range</b> leave their breeding areas.|$|E
50|$|Successful {{breeding}} usually {{results from}} appropriate courtship displays which include {{features such as}} aerial chases, duets and crest raising. The incubation period is similar across all the <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> and lasts anywhere from 21-25 days. Normal young possess a green down which can be observed about 2 weeks after hatching when they leave the nest for the first time.|$|R
25|$|Some migratory {{population}}s of sandhill cranes face population threats due to interspecies competition with snow geese. Since the 1990s, snow geese have eaten waste corn {{on which the}} cranes also rely prior to migration. Despite this competition and other pressures, since the early 2000s the sandhill crane has expanded both its winter (non-breeding) and <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> northward, including into upstate New York.|$|R
50|$|These birds {{breed in}} southeastern North America, and their <b>breeding</b> <b>ranges</b> extend from {{southern}} Pennsylvania and northern Missouri, to the Gulf of Mexico. One subspecies, from northwest Florida, is resident all year round. The other populations {{of this species}} are migratory, wintering at the Gulf Coast, eastern Central America, and the Caribbean. Vagrant wintering birds are sometimes seen in northernmost South America.|$|R
