In the present study, the stratified bed was started up for a period of four weeks by either direct feeding of sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> at four different feeding rates, or by introducing a straw bed primer which was batch digested without feeding. During weeks five to six both systems were fed with sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> at such a rate that the total amount of <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> added at the end of week six was the same {{in each of the four}} corresponding pairs of straw and 'no-straw' reactors.

40|$|Global {{energy demand}} is rapidly increasing. In contrast, fossil fuel {{reserves}} are decreasing. Today, {{one of the}} major challenge is energy supply for the future. Furthermore, effects of global warming cannot be neglected anymore. Alternative energy sources such as biogas should be developed. The biomass has huge biogas potential. However, arable area in the world is limited. Therefore, substrate which will be used for biogas production should be chosen carefully. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the biogas yields of different substrates. For this reason; red algae, green algae, mixture of brown and red algae, mixture of sugar beets and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves,</b> mixture of straw and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves,</b> mixture of maize and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves,</b> straw, maize and ensiled ley were chosen to conduct a lab-based anaerobic digestion experiment. Biogas production and composition in mesophilic (37 OC) conditions during 25 days were measured and compared. The measurements were performed in a system consisting of 32, 1000 ml glass bottles with rubberstoppers. Potential energy production and energy requirements of each substrate were calculated. Methane yields ranged between 65. 8 – 578. 9 m 3. t- 1 VS (Volatile Solids). Whilst the highest methane yield was obtained from sugar beets, the lowest methane yields were obtained from the co-digestion of sugar beets and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves.</b> The highest total energy potential for Sweden was obtained from ensiled ley and the lowest energy potential was obtained from maize. Sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> were not good co-substrates, when they were digested with sugar beets, since they resulted in a decline in the methane yields. The highest total energy requirements for cropping and digestion were calculated for sugar beets. The lowest total energy requirements for cropping and digestion were calculated for ensiled ley. In the present study, digestion of sugar beets is suggested as good substrates for biogas production in Sweden, since it is more economical and helpful to solve the food&energy challenge. Although algae did not yield as much biogas as crops, they are interesting for biogas production since algae are considered a problem on the beaches and their high growth rates and abundance make them attractive for use in energy production. Due to lack of information, further studies are needed about economical aspects of algae for using in biogas plants...|$|R

The aim of the biorefinery is to optimize the total use of the whole feedstock – with focus being on various products simultaneously – rather than to maximize the extraction yield of one single product. The challenge is therefore two-fold; first to identify the main compounds of interest, i. e. the products of the biorefinery, and second to design a process scheme that will allow for an optimal quantity and quality of the identified compounds.

40|$|The {{production}} of methane via anaerobic digestion of agricultural residues and industrial wastewater would benefit society {{by providing a}} clean fuel from renewable feedstocks. This would reduce the use of fossil-fuel-derived energy and reduce environmental impact, including global warming and pollution. Limitation {{of carbon dioxide and}} other emissions through emission regulations, carbon taxes, and subsidies on biomass energy is making anaerobic digestion a more attractive and competitive technology for waste(water) management. This thesis is concerned with some important aspects of anaerobic digestion of solid potato waste, sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> and opaque beer brewery wastewater. Studies were performed using batch, one-stage and two-stage processes using laboratory-, pilot- and full-scale anaerobic reactors. For improved understanding of the anaerobic digestion of solid potato waste, some of the aspects investigated in this work were the profiles of hydrolytic enzymes, the distribution of the major volatile fatty acids produced in the acidification stage, the organic matter degradation, methane yield and the effect of co-digestion. During the hydrolysis of solid potato waste, both free and cell-bound hydrolytic enzyme activity was observed; amylase activity was found to be the highest followed by carboxylmethyl cellulase and filter paper cellulase. The fermentation products during batch anaerobic digestion of solid potato waste were chiefly acetic, butyric, propionic and lactic acid. The concentration and proportions of individual volatile fatty acids in the acidogenic stage are important in the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion system since acetic and butyric acids are the preferred precursors in methane formation. The performance of two-stage anaerobic digestion systems under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions showed that the digestion period for solid potato waste was shorter under thermophilic conditions than under mesophilic conditions; the concentrations of volatile fatty acids in the effluent of the second-stage thermophilic upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor were no different from those in the effluent from the mesophilic UASB reactor. High rate reactors (packed-bed reactors with plastic and straw as biofilm carriers and a UASB reactor) were found to perform well during methanogenesis in two-stage anaerobic digestion of solid potato waste. The UASB performed better than the packed-bed reactor with plastic carriers. Straw, a common agricultural by-product, was confirmed to work well as a biofilm carrier. Employing efficient but low-cost technology is important for increased utilisation of anaerobic digestion, and the possibility of doing this has been demonstrated by a simple pilot-scale, two-stage anaerobic digestion system for the treatment of solid potato waste and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves,</b> alone and combined, with the recovery of biogas. Co-digestion of solid potato waste and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> improved the methane yield by 60 % compared with that from digestion of the separate substrates in both batch and pilot-scale studies. Results from this work suggest that potato waste and sugar <b>beet</b> <b>leaves</b> are suitable substrates for anaerobic digestion giving high biogas yields, and could provide additional benefits to farmers. The performance of a full-scale UASB reactor treating opaque beer brewery wastewater investigated over a period of two years enabled the brewery to meet the requirements for wastewater discharged into the municipal sewage system of Harare, Zimbabwe. The installation of a high-rate reactor by the brewery is an attractive economic and environmental alternative considering that an era of critical energy shortage, substantially higher energy prices and high demand on environmental protection lies ahead...|$|R

Spinach Spinach is a cool season crop and belongs to the goosefoot family (Chenopodiaceae), along with Swiss chard and beets. Spinach is low in calories. It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and minerals, especially iron. After washing the leaves, cook them in a covered pan using only the water clinging to the leaves. After cooking, add salt and butter, vinegar, or mustard for added flavor. Spinach may be prepared in a souffle, creamed soup, or used raw in salads.

All measurements were performed under controlled environmental conditions. In order to measure a consistent time series, data were scored with time intervals of 20 s during 6 h. Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions, KS entropy and relative LZ complexity were calculated. Stomatal conductance in both irrigated and non-irrigated plants was chaotic-like. Plants under water deficit showed a trend to a more complex behaviour, mainly in sunflower that showed better homeostasis than in sugar beet. Some biological implications are discussed...|$|R
