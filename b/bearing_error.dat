40|$|The {{intrinsic}} {{high accuracy}} of modern HF direction finders cannot be realized in practice {{due to the}} perturbations and tilts which exist in the ionosphere. Particular attention is given in this dissertation {{to the effect of}} Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDs) since their occurrence is difficult to predict and the magnitude of the induced <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> extremely variable. TID activity is quantified by monitoring simultaneously the bearings of a number of transmitters whose locations and frequencies are well known. This information is then employed to determine the expected <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> on a target transmission reflected in the same area of the ionosphere. The major limitations of this correction scheme are investigated. The large-scale temporal and spatial variations of the quiet ionosphere (Systematic Ionospheric Tilts, SITs) produce bearing errors of similar magnitude to those due to TIDs. Rapid calculation of these errors for various path geometries and ionospheric conditions is possible by raytracing through 3 -D ionospheric models. The limitations of a correction scheme which employs a 3 -D model based on ionospheric predictions are examined. Variance is a particularly useful statistic in assessing the 'reliability' of bearings made on a particular HF circuit. A scheme is proposed in which the bearings of a network of reference transmitters are monitored continuously allowing a variance to be assigned to any target transmission, even if it is only present for a very short time. These variance values are of considerable value in practical DF applications. Whenever possible the experimental observations are related to the underlying physical processes in the ionosphere which generate these DF errors...|$|E

Eight of the moorings carried vector-measuring current meters (VMCMs), the ninth had an upward-looking ADCP. Coverage areas of the HF radars and moorings included diverse flow and sea-state regimes. Measurement depths were; 1 m for the HF radars, 5 m for the VMCMs, and 3. 2 m for the ADCP bin nearest to the surface. Comparison of radial current components from 18 HF radar–mooring pairs yielded rms speed differences of 7 – 19 cm s 21 and correlation coefficients squared (r 2) in the range of 0. 39 – 0. 77. Spectral analysis showed significant coherence for frequencies below 0. 1 cph (periods longer than 10 h). At higher frequencies no significant coherence was found, and noise levels corresponding to 6 cm s 21 rms were evident in the radar data.

50|$|In practice, <b>bearing</b> <b>errors</b> {{can often}} exceed those defined in Annex 10, in some directions. This is usually due to terrain effects, {{buildings}} near the VOR, or, {{in the case}} of a DVOR, some counterpoise effects. Note that Doppler VOR beacons utilise an elevated groundplane that is used to elevate the effective antenna pattern. It creates a strong lobe at an elevation angle of 30° which complements the 0° lobe of the antennas themselves. This groundplane is called a counterpoise. A counterpoise though, rarely works exactly as one would hope. For example, the edge of the counterpoise can absorb and re-radiate signals from the antennas, and it may tend to do this differently in some directions than others.|$|R

However, few studies have evaluated the influence of vegetative obstruction on accuracy in differing habitats with varying transmitter types and heights. Using adult and fawn collars at varying heights above the ground (0, 33, 66 and 100 cm) to simulate activities (bedded, feeding and standing) and ages (neonate, juvenile and adult) of deer Odocoileus spp., we collected 5, 767 bearings and estimated 1, 424 locations (28 - 30 for each of 48 subsamples) in three habitat types (pasture, grassland and forest), during two stages of vegetative growth (spring and late summer). <b>Bearing</b> <b>error</b> was approximately twice as large {{at a distance of}} 900 m for fawn (9. 9 °) than for adult deer collars (4. 9 °). Of 12 models developed to explain the variation in location error, the analysis of covariance model (HT*D + C*D + HT*TBA + C*TBA) containing interactions of height of collar above ground (HT), collar type (C), vertical height of understory vegetation (D) and tree basal area (TBA) was the best model (wi = 0. 92) and explained ∼ 71 % of the variation in location error. Location error was greater for both collar types at 0 and 33 cm above the ground compared to 66 and 100 cm above the ground; however, location error was less for adult than fawn collars. Vegetation metrics influenced location error, which increased with greater vertical height of understory vegetation and tree basal area. Further, interaction of vegetation metrics and categorical variables indicated significant effects on location error. Our results indicate that researchers need to consider study objectives, life history of the study animal, signal strength of collar (collar type), distance from transmitter to receiver, topographical changes in elevation, habitat composition and season when designing telemetry protocols. Bearing distances in forested habitat should be decreased (approximately 23 % in our study) compared to bearing distances in open habitat to maintain a consistent <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> across habitats.

40|$|Studying {{the habitat}} use of highly mobile, fast moving animal species by radio-tracking is {{particularly}} difficult. Often {{only a part}} of the locations reach the high spatial accuracy aimed for, especially where parts of the study area are not accessible to the observers, or if the accuracy of location is activity-dependent. As a result, excluding data of lower precision may result in biased information on home-range size and use. We present a method to analyse sets of location data of different accuracy by kernel estimation. Each location is included into the estimation according to its class of accuracy. For this purpose, the accuracy of locations has to be estimated in the field using an estimation of signal quality and topographic circumstances. In the given example three categories are defined on the base of test bearings with known position of the transmitter. Test-bearings are taken under conditions simulating those encountered during the field survey. The average deviation of the radiolocation from the real position is estimated for the three categories of data. In the kernel procedure, the smoothing parameter of each location is denoted by the standard deviation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> within each accuracy category. In this way the resulting density matrix accounts for differences in location accuracy. Calculations are made with a module of the software GRID. The option to join together data of different accuracy improves the results of home-range analyses. To include locations of low accuracy allows areas of high utilisation density to be detected if large samples are available.

40|$|The {{performance}} of two TCAS systems is {{studied in the}} presence of electromagnetic scatterers. TCAS is an aircraft mounted angle of arrival (AOA) system, which estimates the bearing of a signal transmitted from a mode-S transponder on another nearby aircraft (intruder). Two systems are studied: (1) Comparison of Relative Amplitude system (CRA), and (2) Spiral Phase Antenna (SPA). The CRA antenna receives the reply via four switched beams. The bearing is estimated by comparing the amplitudes of the received signal. The SPA is based on the phase interferometer, which utilizes the received phase via sum and difference beams. The AOA is computed by comparing the reply with similar values on a calibration table, which is generated by modeling the TCAS antenna on the bare fuselage of a Boeing 727 - 200. The antenna patterns for the TCAS are found via high frequency methods based on the Uniform Geometric theory of Diffraction (UTD). By minimizing the standard deviation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> in a specified angular sector, optimal locations for top and bottom mounted TCAS antennas are found on the Boeing 727 - 200, 737 - 300 and 747 - 200 airframes. It will be shown that the overall bearing errors of the amplitude system are consistently smaller than the spiral phase TCAS. The effect of two types of nearby scatterers [...] antennas, and engine inlets [...] is studied. The AT 741 L-band blade, DMC 60 - 1 VHF Communication antenna were chosen as being representative antenna interference examples. Models are derived for the blades via a moment method analysis followed by a least squares procedure to synthesize the scattering patterns. Studies were conducted to estimate the minimum separation between the two antennas for acceptable operation. It will be shown that the spiral phase TCAS is adversely affected by the presence of a blade antenna. The amplitude system does not suffer from this limitation, especially for the forward look angles which are of most interest here. A model to represent the inlet scattering is based on the multiple scattering method and UTD. The engine on top of the B 727 - 200 fuselage is modeled by a terminated circular waveguide. Then, the effect of moving the antenna forward on the fuselage is studied. It is again shown that the {{performance of}} the amplitude system is superior...|$|E
40|$|Long-term {{continuous}} monitoring of ice break-up on ice shelves and icebergs in Antarctica {{is essential for}} a global observation system of climate change and its consequences. While calving of massive pieces of ice from the Antarctic ice shelf is well observed from satellites, numerous ice breaks of smaller volume cannot be systematically monitored and statistically analysed by the existing means of remote sensing and local in-situ observations. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of an alternative monitoring approach based on remote acoustic observations of ice rifting and breaking events on Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs using distant underwater acoustic listening stations in the ocean. This investigation was carried out using long-term continuous sea noise recordings made from 2002 to 2007 at two hydroacoustic stations deployed in the Indian Ocean {{as part of the}} International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty: off Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia (HA 01) and off Chagos Archipelago (HA 08). Investigations of a number of scientific and technical issues relevant to the main objective were carried out in this study. They include: 1) processing of the CTBT hydroacoustic data from the two IMS stations with the aim of detecting and identifying signals received from Antarctic ice breaking events; 2) investigating the time-frequency arrival structure of the signals expected from ice events using experimental data and numerical modelling of acoustic propagation from Antarctica to the IMS stations in the Indian Ocean; 3) analysing the bearing accuracy of the IMS stations; 4) examining three different schemes for localization of ice events using either one or two IMS stations; 5) analysing the spatial distribution of Antarctic ice events observed over 6 years of data collection and its correlation with the major glacial features of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone which are most likely sources of newly calved icebergs and underwater noise produced by ice breakup; 6) analysing long-term variations in the occurrence of ice events and their links with changes in climate related metocean characteristics of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone. A number of important findings and conclusions were made {{based on the results of}} this study. It was revealed that Antarctica is one of the major sources of low-frequency underwater noise at the two IMS stations in the Indian Ocean. The transient signals received at the IMS stations from Antarctic ice events consist mainly of a mode one arrival pulse with strong frequency dispersion, which is due to the acoustic propagation characteristics in the near-surface acoustic channel of the polar ocean environment south of the Antarctic Convergence Zone (ACZ). Both HA 01 and H 08 S stations have bearing estimate accuracy for transient acoustic noise in Antarctica of about 0. 2 ° RMS. The <b>bearing</b> <b>error</b> of HA 01 also has a systematic component of around 0. 8 ° clockwise. The bearing deviation induced by horizontal refraction of acoustic propagation across the ACZ polar frontal zone and over the continental slopes can be considerable, up to 1 ° for sources located in the easternmost and westernmost parts of the Eastern Antarctic coastal zone observed from the IMS stations. The localization of Antarctic ice events can be achieved either by triangulation using bearing estimates, if the same event can be detected at both stations, or by estimating the range to the noise source through inversion of mode 1 dispersion characteristic when the signal is detected only at one station. The location of ice events in the Antarctic coastal zone can also be coarsely estimated from the low cut-off frequency of mode 1 measured at the receive station. The majority of ice events observed at HA 01 were located within a number of back-azimuth sectors which correspond to the directions to the ice shelves and iceberg tongues which are known as active zones of ice break-up in Eastern Antarctica. The temporal changes in the occurrence frequency of ice events detected at HA 01 reveal strong seasonal variations but no significant interannual trend. Based on the main results and findings, this study achieved its primary aim to demonstrate the feasibility of remote monitoring of ice rifting and breaking events on Antarctic ice shelves and icebergs using the IMS hydroacoustic listening stations deployed in the Indian Ocean...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{modification}} to the debiased convertedmeasurement Kalman filter (CMKF-D) {{is proposed}} and implemented. The resulting CMKF-D evaluates the average true measurement-error bias and covariance with polar target-position estimates obtained by nonlinearly transforming Cartesian estimates formed by traditional weighted-leastsquares fusion of the debiased converted measurements and the predicted Cartesian {{estimates of the}} CMKF-D. A tracking-performance comparison is made between the resulting CMKF-D and the previously presented CMKF-D which demonstrates the improvements obtained from the new technique when <b>bearing</b> measurement <b>errors</b> are large. 1...|$|R
40|$|To {{attenuate}} synchronous {{disturbances in}} magnetic bearing systems, {{a number of}} approaches have been used, including both adaptive feed-forward and feedback approaches. In practice it is generally preferred to use feed-forward techniques as they have less effect on system stability. One method of feed-forward disturbance attenuation that has been proposed is the application of adaptive filtering techniques to minimize {{the magnitude of the}} magnetic <b>bearing</b> system <b>error</b> signal. This will be referred to as "indirect" method for synchronous disturbance attenuation...|$|R
