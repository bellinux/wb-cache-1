40|$|An {{experimental}} research program {{was conducted in}} the Lewis Research Center's 9 x 15 -foot (2. 74 x 4. 57 m) low speed wind tunnel to evaluate the aerodynamic performance of an inlet and fan system with {{variable inlet guide vanes}} (VIGVs) for use on a subsonic V/STOL aircraft. At high VIGV blade angles (lower weight flow and thrust levels), the fan stage was stalled over a major portion of its radius. In spite of the stall, fan blade stresses only exceeded the limits at the most extreme flow conditions. It was found that inlet flow separation does not necessarily lead to poor inlet performance or adverse fan operating conditions. Generally speaking, separated inlet flow did not adversely affect the fan <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> levels. There were some cases, however, at high VIGV angles and high inlet angles-of-attack where excessive <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> levels were encountered.

40|$|Objectives] The {{reliability}} of propeller stress {{has a great}} influence on the safe navigation of a ship. To predict propeller stress quickly and accurately, [Methods] a new numerical prediction model is developed by coupling the Boundary Element Method(BEM) with the Finite Element Method (FEM). The low order BEM {{is used to calculate}} the hydrodynamic load on the blades, and the Prandtl-Schlichting plate friction resistance formula is used to calculate the viscous load. Next, the calculated hydrodynamic load and viscous correction load are transmitted to the calculation of the Finite Element as surface loads. Considering the particularity of propeller geometry, a continuous contact detection algorithm is developed; an automatic method for generating the finite element mesh is developed for the propeller blade; a code based on the FEM is compiled for predicting <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> and deformation; the DTRC 4119 propeller model is applied to validate the {{reliability of}} the method; and mesh independence is confirmed by comparing the calculated results with different sizes and types of mesh. [Results] The results show that the calculated <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> and displacement distribution are reliable. This method avoids the process of artificial modeling and finite element mesh generation, and has the advantages of simple program implementation and high calculation efficiency. [Conclusions] The code can be embedded into the code of theoretical and optimized propeller designs, thereby helping to ensure the strength of designed propellers and improve the efficiency of propeller design...|$|E

This paper details a hydrodynamic model based on Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) developed to assess ’conventional’ 3 -bladed tidal stream turbines (TSTs), adapted here to analyse an ’unconventional’ case of a ducted and open centre device. Validations against a more detailed coupled Reynolds averaged computational fluid dynamics (RANS-BEM) model shows excellent agreement, of within 2 % up to the peak power condition, with associated computational times {{in the order of}} a few minutes on a single core. The paper demonstrates the application of hydrodynamic forces into a structural analysis tool, in order to assess <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> distributions of a generic hubless turbine. Incorporation of parameters such as non-uniform inflows and blade weight forces are investigated, with their effects on stress profiles presented. Key findings include: i) the adapted BEMT model replicates the majority of turbine performance characteristics estimated through previous CFD assessments; ii) the proposed model reduces the computational effort by several orders of magnitude compared to the reference coupled CFD, making it suitable for engineering assessments iii) <b>blade</b> <b>stress</b> distribution profiles are quantified, detailing concentration zones and cyclic values for use in fatigue analyses.
