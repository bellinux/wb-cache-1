A solid state Nd:YAG (λ = 532 nm) laser is used as the recording beam, with a total incident intensity of 5 mW/cm 2, and a He–Ne laser as the reconstruction <b>beam.</b> The <b>dye</b> concentration in the photopolymer is optimized {{so that it does}} not limit the dynamic range. Nine holograms are recorded using constant exposure time scheduling and variable exposure time scheduling. From the results obtained it may be deduced that optimization of the dye allows us to work in the linear response region of the photopolymer {{and at the same time}} obtain high values of diffraction efficiency for each hologram. An exponential increase in exposure time as the number of holograms increases enables the values of diffraction efficiency to be homogenized with regard to the case of constant exposure scheduling. In this way, better use is made of the dynamic range of acrylamide hydrophilic photopolymer.

40|$|Abstract—In {{view of a}} {{possible}} application in optical data storage devices, diffraction grating efficiency of an organic dye, Acid Fuchsin doped in PMMA matrix was studied under excitation with CW diode pumped Nd: YAG laser at 532 nm. The open aperture Z-scan of dye doped polymer displayed saturable absorption and the closed aperture Z-scan of the samples exhibited negative nonlinearity. The diffraction efficiency of the grating is {{the ratio of the}} intensity of the first order diffracted power to the incident read <b>beam</b> power. The <b>dye</b> doped polymer films were found to be good media for recording. It is observed that the formation of gratings strongly depend on the concentration of dye in the polymer film, the intensity ratios of the writing beams and the angle between the writing beams. It has been found that efficient writing can be made at an angle of 20 and when the intensity ratio of the writing beams is unity.

40|$|One {{potential}} drawback of the excitation geometry {{presented here}} is that the metal-coated gratings used in dye lasers have relatively low damage thresholds and hence are susceptible to damage by the pump laser. However, this is not a serious limitation especially in dye laser systems of the oscillator amplifier type, in which the oscillator is pumped {{with a small amount of}} pump energy to obtain a narrow spectral linewidth. In addition, the large magnification of the pump beam on the grating surface that is due to the grazing incidence results in a considerable reduction in power density. In our laser system we have not encountered grating damage over several weeks of operation. For oscillator amplifier systems, it is desirable to obtain emission with good spatial quality from the oscillator and in this respect the present pumping arrangement may be more attractive than off-axis pumping because of a better match of the pump laser and the dye laser modes. To summarize, a new pumping geometry for a grazingincidence grating dye laser has been presented in which true longitudinal pumping is achieved by coupling the pump <b>beam</b> to the <b>dye</b> laser resonator by way of zero-order diffraction from the grating. Laser emission with good spatial quality was obtained from a dye laser based on this configuration. The authors thank M. Laghate for technical assistance, S. M. Oak and H. S.

40|$|Evaluation of {{criticality}} safety {{has become}} an important task in preparing for the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation (AVLIS) uranium enrichment runs that will take place during the Integrated Process Demonstration (IPD) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This integrated operation of AVLIS systems under plant-like conditions {{will be used to}} verify the performance of process equipment and to demonstrate the sustained integrated enrichment performance of these systems using operating parameters that are similar to production plant specifications. Because of the potential criticality concerns associated with enriched uranium, substantial effort has been aimed towards understanding the potential system failures of interest from a criticality standpoint, and evaluating them in detail. The AVLIS process is based on selective photoionization of uranium atoms of atomic weight 235 (U- 235) in a vapor stream, followed by electrostatic extraction. The process is illustrated in Figure 1. Two major subsystems are involved: the uranium separator and the laser system. In the separator, metallic uranium is fed into a crucible where it is heated and vaporized by an electron beam. The atomic U- 235 /U- 238 vapor stream moves away from the molten uranium and is illuminated by precisely tuned <b>beams</b> of <b>dye</b> laser light. Upon absorption of the tuned dye laser light, the U- 235 atoms become excited and eject electrons (become photoionized), giving them a net positive charge. The ions of U- 235 are moved preferentially by an electrostatic field to condense on the product collector, forming the enriched uranium product. The remaining vapor, which is depleted in U- 235 (tails), passes unaffected through the photoionization/extractor zone and accumulates on collectors {{in the top of the}} separator. Tails and product collector surfaces operate at elevated temperatures so that deposited materials flow as segregated liquid streams. The separated uranium condensates (uranium enriched in U- 235 and uranium depleted in U- 235) are cooled and accumulated in solid metallic form in canisters. The collected product and tails material is weighed and transferred into certified, critically safe, shipping containers (DOT specification 6 M with 2 R containment vessel). These will be temporarily stored, and then shipped offsite either for use by a fuel fabricator, or for disposal. Tails material will be packaged for disposal. A criticality risk assessment was performed for AVLIS IPD runs. In this analysis, the likelihood of occurrence of a criticality was examined. For the AVLIS process, there are a number of areas that have been specifically examined to assess whether or not the frequency of occurrence of a criticality is credible (frequency of occurrence > 10 - 6 /yr). In this paper, we discuss only two of the areas: the separator and canister operations...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{calculate}} {{the density of}} photon states (DOS) of the normal modes in dye-doped chiral nematic liquid crystal (LC) cells {{in the presence of}} various loss mechanisms. Losses and gain are incorporated into the transmission characteristics through the introduction of a small imaginary part in the dielectric constant perpendicular and along the director, for which we assume no frequency dispersion. Theoretical results are presented on the DOS in the region of the photonic band gap for a range of values of the loss coefficient and different values of the optical anisotropy. The obtained values of the DOS at the photonic band gap edges predict a reversal of the dominant modes in the structure. Our results are found to be in good agreement with the experimentally obtained excitation thresholds in chiral nematic LC lasers. The behaviour of the DOS is also discussed for amplifying LC cells providing an additional insight to the lasing mechanism of these structures. We subsequently investigate the spontaneous emission properties, under the assumption that the electronic transition frequency is close to the photonic edge mode of the structure (resonance). We take into account the transition broadening and the decay of electromagnetic field modes supported by the so-called 'mirror-less' cavity. We employ the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian to describe the electron interaction with the electromagnetic field, focusing on the mode with the diffracting polarization in the chiral nematic layer. As known in these structures, the density of photon states, calculated via the Wigner method, has distinct peaks {{on either side of the}} photonic band gap, which manifests itself as a considerable modification of the emission spectrum. We demonstrate that, near resonance, there are notable differences between the behaviour of the density of states and the spontaneous emission profile of these structures. In addition, we examine in some detail the case of the logarithmic peak exhibited in the density of states in 2 D photonic structures and obtain analytic relations for the Lamb shift and the broadening of the atomic transition in the emission spectrum. The dynamical behaviour of the atom-field system is described by a system of two first order differential equations, solved using the Green's function method and the Fourier transform. The emission spectra are then calculated and compared with experimental data. Finally, we detail a new technique for the pumping of dye lasers which requires no moving parts or flushing mechanisms and is applicable to both solid state and liquid based devices. A reconfigurable hologram is used to control the position of incidence of a pump <b>beam</b> onto a <b>dye</b> laser and significant increases in device lifetimes are achieved. The technique is also applied to wavelength tune a dye laser. This offers access to higher repetition rates and larger average output powers. With higher repetition rate pump lasers it is feasible that the approach could allow such organic lasers to reach operating frequencies on the order of MHz. The unique nature of the adaptive pumping method also allows precise control of the spatial wave-front and configuration of the pumping wave which allows greater versatility and functionality to be realised. It is possible to envisage that novel pump beam profiles that optimise propagation through the medium could also be demonstrated...|$|R
