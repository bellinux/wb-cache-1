25|$|The {{range was}} {{completed}} in 1966 {{with the arrival of}} the 'fourgonette' van version which in most respects followed the design of the estate, but with only one door on each side and a steel panel in place of the side windows behind the <b>b</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the two- and four-door saloons, there was a ‘pillarless’ coupé which shared {{the profile of the}} saloons apart from the absence of any fixed <b>B</b> <b>pillar.</b> A three-door estate version was also offered, branded as the ‘Universal’, between 1959 and 1962. For the new decade, the saloon was renamed Auto Union 1000S and received, in August 1959, an eye catching wrap around windscreen. Neither the windscreen nor the name changes entirely concealed the fact that at a time when competitor designs employed the modern ponton, three box form, this Auto Union’s body along with most of its technical features descended directly from that of the Zwickau developed DKW F9 prototype of 1938. Fortunately in 1938 the front-wheel-drive DKW design had been an innovative one.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 the Fabia {{received}} a facelift, with changed {{front fog lights}} and grille, slightly different rear lights, new steering wheel and revised specification levels. The RS also had its final gearbox ratio changed. Most importantly, the Sport model was added, with the [...] 1.4 petrol being offered with a manual transmission. This engine was quickly dropped for the 1.2 HTP, which while not as powerful, was a much more free revving engine giving a more sporty feel and flexible drive. The Sport also had its specification changed to include red seat belts and sunset privacy glass from the <b>B</b> <b>pillar</b> to the rear.|$|E

2500|$|A single {{prototype}} was built, the LP500 (where the 'LP' {{stands for}} 'longitudinale posteriore', which means 'longitudinally in the rear' in Italian and refers to engine orientation and placement, whereas the 500 {{stands for the}} [...] engine displacement they intended to use). Painted bright sunflower yellow, the concept car {{proved to be a}} stunner at the Geneva Motor Show in 1971. Sporting Gandini's original design concepts, the car's design required extensive modification to qualify for mass-production. The two most notable changes were necessary because air-intake proved insufficient to cool the engine. The prototype had slatted, 'gill-like' intake ducts on the rear shoulders, and these were replaced with massive [...] "air box" [...] scoops that extended out from the vehicle's streamlined body. In addition, NACA style air ducts were cut into the body of the car beneath the <b>B</b> <b>pillar,</b> which required eliminating the prototype's traditional door handles and replacing them with handles of a unique configuration set into the portion of the ducts carved into the scissor doors. Aluminium-honeycomb sheeting, a concept utilized in the prototype design, was also dropped in preparation for production.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 American Rally {{alongside}} its {{new name}} obtained its first redesign of identity emblems {{in the form}} of an all new [...] "RALLY" [...] nameplate in printing letters connected by a background line. Like the former one, it was located on the rear panel between the right taillight and rear license plate. A new set of grille, headlight bezels and parking lights shared with the American and Gremlin lines became present in blackout form. New side decals were applied, being discreet lines running the full length of the car without changing proportions and incorporating Rally emblems on the front fenders. The interior of the first time was different from that of the American model other than the front seats. Rally emblems appeared etched on the front high corners of the side panels. All previously exposed metal parts like the top of the doors, rear sides and <b>B</b> <b>pillar</b> were now upholstered in vinyl. The [...] "RAMBLER" [...] emblem on the glove box was replaced by a [...] "RALLY" [...] one of the same design. Unlike all of its predecessors, a considerable amount of 1975 American Rally units were equipped with the heater as standard. The aspect that made the American Rally the most different from the last generation was the mechanicals. The 258 six cylinder obtained an all new electronic ignition system sourced by Prestolite. Manual front disk brakes took the place of the drums. A new TREMEC 170-F four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage came from the factory, although in the end VAM wasn't able to fully standardize it so there were still several Hurst-linked three-speed 1975 American Rally units present.|$|E

5000|$|The name is {{reportedly}} a conscious {{combination of the}} words 'Room' and 'Roadster', and the split personality theme is {{played out in the}} design with a carefully honed 'Driving Room' ahead of the <b>B</b> <b>pillars,</b> and a generous 'Living Room' to the rear. The front ‘Driving Room‘ is tailor made to comply with the driver's requirements for a sporty cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|Montecarlos were {{available}} as fixed head [...] "Coupés" [...] {{and also as}} [...] "Spiders" [...] with solid A and <b>B</b> <b>pillars,</b> but a large flat folding canvas roof between them. The very first examples had steel panels to the rear wings above the engine bay, but this limited version made reversing difficult and it was replaced by glass panels. This gave a 'flying buttress' appearance to the rear, similar to the Maserati Merak.|$|R

50|$|The concept {{versions}} of the Dodge Challenger and Chevrolet Camaro shown in 2006 were both pillarless two-door hardtops. However, the production {{versions of}} both include a blacked-out <b>B</b> <b>Pillar</b> and fixed rear side glass. Another pillarless design was featured in the 2007 model concept for the Chrysler 300C. Cadillac exhibited a concept pillarless hardtop coupe, the Elmiraj.|$|E
50|$|Leonardo Fioravanti led {{the design}} team, {{who had been}} {{responsible}} for most Pininfarina Ferrari designs since the 1960s, while detailed work was completed Diego Ottina. Fioravanti proposed a sporting sedan design, powered by a forward-located Flat-12 engine. New headlights from Lucas Industries allowed the front to be lowered, creating a thin egg-crate style grill. The design also included body-coloured rear lights by Carello, a concept which is now common on production vehicles. From the side, the A and <b>B</b> <b>pillars</b> were disguised by using smoked glass, and exaggerating the C pillar, creating a coupe-style side view.|$|R
50|$|Body {{configurations}} {{were the}} same as those offered on the previous (Taunus) 17M range. Top sellers from the range were the two- and four-door saloons/sedans, and the three- and five-door “Turnier” station wagons were also heavily promoted. A version of the three-door “Turnier” with the side windows behind the <b>B</b> <b>pillars</b> replaced by steel panels was made available for people whose work and tax status called for a small van, but who nevertheless preferred to drive a car. A two-door coupé was offered. The Ford P7 was also the last of a long line of German Fords to be offered, at considerable extra cost, as a two-door coach-built Karl Deutsch cabriolet.|$|R
5000|$|The hardtop {{began to}} {{disappear}} along with convertibles in the mid-1970s, {{partly out of}} a concern that U.S. federal safety regulations {{would be difficult for}} pillarless models to pass. The ascendancy of monocoque construction also made the pillarless design less practical. Some models adopted modified roof styling, placing the <b>B</b> <b>pillars</b> behind tinted side window glass and painting or molding the outer side of each pillar in black to make them less visible, creating a hardtop look without actually omitting the pillar. Some mid- to late-1970s models continued their previous two-door hardtop bodies, but with fixed rear windows or a variety of vinyl roof and opera window treatments.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{proposal}} for the E24 was a based on a BMW E9 3.0 CS with an increased height, {{in order to make}} it easier for customers to get into the car. However, Bob Lutz rejected the proposal, eventually leading to the shape of the E24 in its production form. Unlike its E9 predecessor, the body of the E24 has a <b>B</b> <b>pillar.</b>|$|E
50|$|The restyled second {{generation}} was introduced 1989 and luxury equipment content increased. Four wheel steering {{appeared on the}} top level offering and styling was updated more closely resemble the twin introduction of the Toyota Corona EXiV, and shared it appearance with the Toyota Corona and Toyota Carina. Electronic fuel injection was made standard on all engines offered. The car was the last true hardtop as the next generation had a complete <b>B</b> <b>pillar</b> extending {{all the way to}} the roof.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, a coupé {{is often}} {{distinguished}} from a two-door saloon (US sedan) {{by the lack}} of a <b>B</b> <b>pillar</b> to support the roof. Saloon cars have an A pillar forward at the windscreen, a <b>B</b> <b>pillar</b> aft of the door, and a C pillar defining the aftermost roof support at the rear window. Thus with all side-windows down, a coupé would appear windowless from the A to the C pillars. These fixed-roof models are described as a hardtop or pillarless coupé. Though, to confuse things even further, there are many hardtop/pillarless two- and four-door saloons. Targa top, or just 'T'-top models are a variation on the convertible design, where the roof center section can be removed, in one or two sections, leaving the rest of the roof in place. Yet another variation on the convertible or drop-head coupé is the fully retractable hardtop. In this form the car has all the advantages of fixed-head vehicle but, {{at the touch of a}} button, the entire roof lifts off, folds and stows away in the trunk (boot). Though retractables were tried many years ago by Peugeot, in Europe and Ford, in the US, with the Fairlaine Skyliner, it is only in the 21st century that there has been an explosion in the popularity of this bodystyle.|$|E

5000|$|The 1973 Chevelle Laguna [...] "Colonnade" [...] hardtop {{featured}} a semi-fastback roofline with styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, frameless door glass and distinctive rear quarter glass on two-door coupes. New side windows with styled center pillars were featured on four-door sedan models. The new-design <b>B</b> <b>pillars</b> were structurally {{strong enough to}} contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. GM had anticipated federal roll-over safety standards for January 1974 that did not materialize. The unusually thin windshield pillars contributed to the much improved visibility over the previous generation Chevelles. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. The wagons, available in six or nine passenger seating, {{featured a}} counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easy entry and loading up to [...]|$|R
