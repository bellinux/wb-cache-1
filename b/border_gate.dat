In addition, the Preventive Health and Environment Bureau requested all health facilities to carefully monitor any suspected H1N1 case and Bureau head Nguyen Huy Nga also {{warned that the}} pandemic could enter Vietnam through imported swine or <b>border</b> <b>gates.</b> Thermal imaging devices were dispatched to airports and <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> to screen passengers. In response to WHO's warnings, Vietnam on 30 April 2009 raised its swine flu alert level to 4 which indicated a [...] "threat of community level outbreaks" [...] while local authorities have been executing precautionary measures.|$|R
50|$|The {{obligation}} {{imposed by}} European law on national border authorities to stamp travel documents of certain travellers should not prevent {{the development of}} automated border control systems which are then made available {{to those who are}} required to have their travel documents stamped when crossing the external border of the Schengen Area. One solution is to dedicate separate lanes to third-country nationals and to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> used by these lanes who can stamp travel documents where required: this has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Canadian, Japanese, South Korean and United States biometric passports, and in the Port of Helsinki, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include Russian citizens, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports). A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch Royal Marechaussee at the Privium iris recognition automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are Global Entry members, and all nationals who are holders of diplomatic passports, as well as by the German Federal Police at the ABG Plus iris recognition automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> at Frankfurt Airport where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are Global Entry members: when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate/door/turnstile opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national user is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border guard stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the user's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his/her travel document stamped.|$|R
25|$|The {{additional}} obligations imposed by European law on national border authorities {{when it comes}} to processing travellers who are third-country nationals (e.g. the obligation to stamp their travel documents) should not prevent the development of automated border control systems which are made available to such travellers. As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the Finnish Border Guard at the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> in Helsinki Airport, where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Australian, Canadian, Japanese, New Zealand, South Korean and United States biometric passports, {{as well as by the}} Portuguese Serviço de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras at the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> in Lisbon Airport where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of Angolan and Brazilian passports and holders of diplomatic/service passports.

At the Port of Helsinki, the Finnish Border Guard has adapted the design of the automated <b>border</b> <b>gates</b> there to widen eligibility to include Russian citizens (who, as Annex I nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.|$|R

A branch of it - National Route 1D - connects the provincial capital Quy Nhơn to 1A and Sông Cầu town in Phú Yên Province. 20km of 1D's 33km are in Bình Định. National Road 19 runs from Quy Nhơn Port through northern Quy Nhơn, the towns of Tuy Phước, Phú Phong to An Khê, Pleiku and Lệ Thanh <b>border</b> <b>gate</b> in Gia Lai Province. This direct link from Quy Nhon to the Central Highlands and the border to Cambodia has been important for Bình Định's role as a gateway to the highlands and its industrial development, since especially the wood processing and furniture industry has relied on raw materials from the highlands, Cambodia and Laos. 70km of National Route 19 are located in Bình Định.|$|E
25|$|The fishery {{sector has}} {{continuously}} developed {{and become a}} key economic sector of the province. At present the province has around 3,200 fishing boats with power of over 67,000CV.

50|$|A closed {{border is}} a border that {{prevents}} {{movement of people}} between different jurisdictions with limited or no exceptions associated with this movement.

Perhaps the most famous example of an extant closed border is the Demilitarized Zone between North Korea and South Korea. The Berlin Wall could also have been called a closed border.|$|R
