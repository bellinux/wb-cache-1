5|$|Maritime trade {{began with}} safer coastal trade and evolved with the {{manipulation}} of the monsoon winds, soon resulting in trade crossing boundaries such as the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. South Asia had multiple maritime trade routes which connected it to Southeast Asia, thereby making the control of one route resulting in maritime monopoly difficult. Indian connections to various Southeast Asian states <b>buffered</b> it from blockages on other routes. By making use of the maritime trade routes, bulk commodity trade became possible for the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. A Roman trading vessel could span the Mediterranean in a month at one-sixtieth the cost of over-land routes.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1978, {{the economy}} of Côte d'Ivoire {{experienced}} a serious decline due to the sharp downturn in international market prices of coffee and cocoa. The decline was perceived as fleeting, since its impact on planters was <b>buffered</b> by the Caistab, the agricultural marketing board, which ensured them a livable income. The next year, in order to contain a sudden drop in the prices of exported goods, Houphouët-Boigny raised prices to resist international tariffs on raw materials. However, by applying only this solution, Côte d'Ivoire lost more than 700billion CFA francs between 1980 and 1982. From 1983 to 1984, Côte d'Ivoire fell victim to a drought that ravaged nearly 400,000 hectares of forest and 250,000 hectares of coffee and cocoa plants. To address this problem, Houphouët-Boigny travelled to London to negotiate an agreement on coffee and cocoa prices with traders and industrialists; by 1984, the agreement had fallen apart and Côte d'Ivoire was engulfed in a major financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Between the two buffer regions {{there is}} an end-point, or {{equivalence}} point, at about pH 3. This end-point is not sharp and is typical of a diprotic acid whose buffer regions overlap by a small amount: pKa2 − pKa1 is about three in this example. (If the difference in pK values were about two or less, the end-point would not be noticeable.) The second end-point begins at about pH  6.3 and is sharp. This indicates that all the protons have been removed. When this is so, the solution is not <b>buffered</b> and the pH rises steeply on addition of {{a small amount of}} strong base. However, the pH does not continue to rise indefinitely. A new buffer region begins at about pH 11 (pKw − 3), which is where self-ionization of water becomes important.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY In {{this paper}} {{a fair and}} fast <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme based on the round robin cell {{distribution}} mechanism for an input <b>buffer</b> ATM switch is proposed. This <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme improves {{the performance of the}} input <b>buffer</b> ATM switch in terms of the cell loss ratio and the CDV by equalizing the occupancy of input <b>buffers.</b> In order to make the equalizing and <b>buffer</b> sharing operation fast and simple, the proposed <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme uses a dynamic threshold by which input <b>buffers</b> are separated into two groups according to their occupancy. The <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme equalizes the <b>buffer</b> occupancy of input <b>buffers</b> by distributing incoming cells to the input <b>buffers</b> of lower occupancy first. The performance of the proposed <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme is evaluated by computer simulation. The result shows that the input <b>buffer</b> ATM switch adopting the <b>buffer</b> sharing scheme outperforms those with conventional input <b>buffer</b> schemes based on virtual output queue (VOQ) and the simple round robin in terms of the cell loss ratio, the maximum throughput and the CDV. 1...|$|R

30|$|A <b>buffer</b> {{family is}} a {{collection}} of circular <b>buffers</b> which store time series data for a single variable. The variable can either be {{in the form of a}} floating point value or a string. The former is used for performance data, resource usage and statistics while the latter is use for representing service check results, logs, events and other non numeric data. In both cases the <b>buffer</b> family consists of a series of <b>buffers</b> appropriate to that data type. The first <b>buffer</b> within the family is the receiving <b>buffer,</b> which stores metrics as they are received from monitored hosts. Subsequent <b>buffers</b> in the family are aggregate <b>buffers,</b> these <b>buffers</b> store aggregated metrics representing the value over a given time period. Each aggregate <b>buffer</b> stores data for a given interval with each additional <b>buffer</b> storing aggregate for a greater time period than the previous. The user can provide intervals, via the configuration service, for aggregate <b>buffers</b> on a per metric basis or provide a single default set of intervals. A typical scheme might be as follows, the receiving <b>buffer</b> followed by aggregate <b>buffers</b> with a 60 s, 5 min, 10 min, 30 min and hour long periods. Values are aggregated from one <b>buffer</b> to another when either a <b>buffer</b> is full or when by a scheduled task running which runs at the frequency of the subsequent <b>buffer.</b> In the eventuality that a <b>buffer</b> has reached its capacity but the time range of data within that <b>buffer</b> does not extend to the interval of the subsequent <b>buffer</b> an interim <b>buffer</b> is created with an intermediate interval. This interim <b>buffer</b> persists until data can be directly aggregated from one <b>buffer</b> to the next.|$|R
5|$|Both 256Lr and 260Lr have half-lives {{too short}} to allow a {{complete}} chemical purification process. Early experiments with 256Lr therefore used rapid solvent extraction, with the chelating agent thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) dissolved in methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) as the organic phase, and with the aqueous phase being <b>buffered</b> acetate solutions. Ions of different charge (+2, +3, or +4) will then extract into the organic phase under different pH ranges, but this method will not separate the trivalent actinides and thus 256Lr must be identified by its emitted 8.24MeV alpha particles. More recent methods have allowed rapid selective elution with α-HIB {{to take place in}} enough time to separate out the longer-lived isotope 260Lr, which can be removed from the catcher foil with 0.05Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{representative}} burst <b>buffer</b> architectures in the {{high-performance computing}} environments: node-local burst <b>buffer</b> and remote shared burst <b>buffer.</b> In the node-local burst <b>buffer</b> architecture, burst <b>buffer</b> storage {{is located on}} the individual compute node, so the aggregate burst <b>buffer</b> bandwidth grows linearly with the compute node count. This scalability benefit has been well-documented in recent literature.It also comes with the demand for a scalable metadata management strategy to maintain a global namespace for data distributed across all the burst <b>buffers.</b> In the remote shared burst <b>buffer</b> architecture, burst <b>buffer</b> storage resides on a fewer number of I/O nodes positioned between the compute nodes and the back-end storage systems. Data movement between the compute nodes and burst <b>buffer</b> needs to go through the network. Placing burst <b>buffer</b> on the I/O nodes facilitates the independent development, deployment and maintenance of the burst <b>buffer</b> service. Hence, several well-known commercialized software products have been developed to manage this type of burst <b>buffer,</b> such as DataWarp and Infinite Memory Engine.|$|R
