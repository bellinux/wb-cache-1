5|$|In New Jersey, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.1inches (205mm) in Tuckerton. The rains also caused river flooding, including the north {{branch of the}} Metedeconk River in Lakewood which crested at 8feet (2.5m).

Gusty winds of up to 44mph (71km/h) in Atlantic City downed weak trees and power lines, leaving over 13,000 without power.

Gusty winds generated rough sea conditions along coastal regions, resulting in some beach erosion and the collapse of a sidewalk section. Rains and associated floods topped a number of culverts and bridges, washed out the sides of some roadways, and damage to some utility lines, followed by significant disruptions to electricity services. The exact amount of damage to the territory remains unknown, however.|$|E
