40|$|This paper studies {{an episode}} of {{dissemination}} of wrong stock index values in real time due to a software bug in the Indian Nifty index futures market {{on the morning of}} January 18, 2006. The episode provides an opportunity to test various models of cognitive biases and bounded rationality highlighted in behavioural finance. The paper provides strong evidence against cognitive biases like “anchoring and adjustment” (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974) that one might expect under such situations even though the cognitive task involved is quite simple. The futures market tracked the true Nifty index which it could not see while completely ignoring the wrong Nifty index that it could see. However, the paper demonstrates that market efficiency failed in more subtle ways. There is evidence of a partial <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> discovery in the futures markets and a weakening of the bonds linking futures and cash markets. [W. P.

Curs acadèmic: 2016 / 2017 The {{objective}} of the paper is remembering the existing aggregate macro-models, explain price inflation, present the problems that may arise in aggregate models and carry out a study to understand the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> inflation in Spain in the last 15 years. In {{order to do that}} first we’re going to describe the article that will be our starting point to carry out the paper and also the meaning of the different named concepts. The macro-economic problems generated by aggregation in economy will be presented. Moreover, an economic study about price evolution will be carried out, in order to better understand the breakdown of annual headline inflation. After the study will be carried out one can better observe the differences and similarities of the American case. In the Spanish case the good that increased its price the most were cigarettes, that is, they have increased or decreased necessary goods as well as leisure ones. However, in the American case, only the necessary ones increased...|$|E
40|$|Socially {{oriented}} {{businesses are}} on the rise in the United States yet their social goals cause them to have higher costs and be less competitive. This paper investigates the viability of such a business model within a competitive market by determining the price premiums that consumers {{are willing to pay for}} goods manufactured or sold by social businesses. It begins with a review of past literature focusing on social certifications such as fair trade and forest stewardship. In contrast to such studies, this paper utilizes four categories based upon the B Corporation certification to shape a survey testing consumer price preferences. By determining that consumers are willing to pay premiums on social goods, as well as finding that these social premiums are similar in magnitude to the premiums placed on goods of higher quality, I find that a social certification, such as the B Corporation certification, can potentially add substantial value to a company. Also, through the incorporation of demographic information and a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> premium results into separate social categories, I find evidence of both significant differences in preferences between genders and that a higher perceived ability to consume may decrease consumers’ willingness to pay social premiums...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{response}} <b>of</b> collusive <b>prices</b> to changing demand conditions when firms operate under capacity constraints {{in the presence}} of demand uncertainty. We find support for the conventional view that periods of low demand lead, through the emergence of excess capacity, to a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> collusive <b>pricing.</b> We also find that the nature <b>of</b> <b>price</b> wars depends on the degree of excess capacity in the industry; while small amounts of excess capacity can lead firms to engage in "mild" price wars, characterized by uniform price reductions and market share stability, more "severe" price wars, characterized by price undercutting and market share instability, can emerge if excess capacity is sufficiently great. Finally, our results lend support to the view that market share instability is a symptom of ineffective collusion. ...|$|R

Farmers, cooperatives, wholesale milk processors, and retailers all work to move milk from the dairy farm to the consumer. Each of these entities performs a distinct function in the production, processing, distribution, and sale of milk, and each receives a portion <b>of</b> the retail <b>price</b> <b>of</b> a gallon of milk. Fluid milk prices at the farm-level have fallen sharply, prompting Congress to authorize almost {{a billion dollars in}} emergency assistance to dairy farmers in the last three years.

40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} dynamic {{extension}} of the classic static model <b>of</b> Bertrand <b>price</b> competition that allows competing duopolists to undertake cost-reducing investments {{in an attempt to}} “leapfrog ” their rival to attain low-cost leadership — at least temporarily. We show that leapfrogging occurs in equilibrium, resolving the Bertrand investment paradox., i. e. leapfrogging explains why firms have an ex ante incentive to undertake cost-reducing investments even though they realize that simultaneous investments to acquire {{the state of the art}} production technology would result in Bertrand price competition in the product market that drives their ex post profits to zero. Our analysis provides a new interpretation of “price wars”. Instead of constituting a punishment for a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> tacit collusion, <b>price</b> wars are fully competitive outcomes that occur when one firm leapfrogs its rival to become the new low cost leader. We show that the equilibrium involves investment preemption only when the firms invest in a deterministically alternating fashion and technological progress is deterministic. We prove that when technological progress is deterministic and firms move in an alternating fashion, the game has a unique Markov perfect equilibrium. When technological progress is stochastic or if firms move simultaneously, equilibria are generally not unique. Unlike the static Bertrand model, the equilibria of the dynamic Bertrand model are generally inefficient. Instead of having too little investment in equilibrium, we show that duopoly investments generally exceed the socially optimum level. Yet, we show that when investment decisions are simultaneous there is a “monopoly ” equilibrium when one firm makes all the investments...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, and that <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R
