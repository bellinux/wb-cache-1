40|$|Background: Endometrial {{cancer is}} the most common {{gynecologic}} malignancy in the developed countries. Clinical studies have shown that early stage uterine serous carcinoma (USC) has outcomes similar to early stage high grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC-G 3) than to early stage low grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC-G 1). However, {{little is known about the}} origin of these different clinical outcomes. This study applied the whole genome expression profiling to explore the expression difference of stage I USC (n = 11) relative to stage I EAC-G 3 (n = 11) and stage I EAC-G 1 (n = 11), respectively. Methodology/Principal Finding: We found that the expression difference <b>between</b> <b>USC</b> <b>and</b> EAC-G 3, as measured by the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), is consistently less than that found <b>between</b> <b>USC</b> <b>and</b> EAC-G 1. Pathway enrichment analyses suggested that DEGs specific to USC vs. EAC-G 3 are enriched for genes involved in signaling transduction, while DEGs specific to USC vs. EAC-G 1 are enriched for genes involved in cell cycle. Gene expression differences for selected DEGs are confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR with a high validation rate. Conclusion: This data, although preliminary, indicates that stage I USC is genetically similar to stage I EAC-G 3 compared to stage I EAC-G 1. DEGs identified from this study might provide an insight in to the potential mechanisms that influence the clinical outcome differences between endometrial cancer subtypes. They might also have potential prognostic an...|$|R

The game was close early with the Trojans leading at times in the first half, but Texas went on a 10-2 run to take a seven-point lead. Miller would have one of her worst games in her career. Although she scored 16 points, twelve of those were from the free throw line. She was only 2 for 11 from the field, without a single point in the second half. In contrast, Texas' Clarissa Davis came off the bench to score 25 and earn Most Outstanding Player honors. USC's Cynthia Cooper scored 27 points, and Texas won the national championship 97-81 to complete the first undefeated season in NCAA history.|$|R
