40|$|Scattered {{radiation}} is an undesired signal largely present in most digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) projection images as no physically rejection methods, i. e. anti-scatter grids, are regularly employed, {{in contrast to}} full- field digital mammography. This scatter signal might reduce the visibility of small objects in the image, and potentially affect the detection of small breast lesions. Thus accurate scatter models are needed to minimise the scattered radiation signal via post-processing algorithms. All prior work on scattered radiation estimation has assumed a rigid <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> (RP) and reported large contribution of scatter signal from RP in the detector. However, in this work, flexible paddles (FPs) tilting from 0 ° to 10 ° will be studied using Monte Carlo simulations to analyse if the scatter distribution differs from RP geometries. After reproducing the Hologic Selenia Dimensions geometry (narrow angle) with two (homogeneous and heterogeneous) compressed breast phantoms, results illustrate that the scatter distribution recorded at the detector varies up to 22 % between RP and FP geometries (depending on the location), mainly due to the decrease in thickness of the breast observed for FP. However, the relative contribution from the paddle itself (3 - 12 % of the total scatter) remains approximately unchanged for both setups and their magnitude depends on {{the distance to the}} breast edgeThis work is part of the SCARtool project (H 2020 -MSCA-IF- 2014, reference 657875), a research funded by the European Union within the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks.

40|$|Background: In mammography, <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> {{is applied}} to reduce the {{thickness}} of the breast. While it is widely accepted that firm <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> is needed to ensure acceptable image quality, guidelines remain vague about how much compression should be applied during mammogram acquisition. A quantitative parameter indicating the desirable amount of compression is not available. Consequently, {{little is known about the}} relationship between the amount of <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> and <b>breast</b> cancer detectability. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> pressure in mammography on breast cancer screening outcomes. Methods: We used digital image analysis methods to determine breast volume, percent dense volume, and pressure from 132, 776 examinations of 57, 179 women participating in the Dutch population-based biennial breast cancer screening program. Pressure was estimated by dividing the compression force by the area of the contact surface between <b>breast</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>paddle.</b> The data was subdivided into quintiles of pressure and the number of screen-detected cancers, interval cancers, false positives, and true negatives were determined for each group. Generalized estimating equations were used to account for correlation between examinations of the same woman and for the effect of breast density and volume when estimating sensitivity, specificity, and other performance measures. Sensitivity was computed using interval cancers occurring between two screening rounds and using interval cancers within 12 months after screening. Pair-wise testing for significant differences was performed. Results: Percent dense volume increased with increasing pressure, while breast volume decreased. Sensitivity in quintiles with increasing pressure was 82. 0 %, 77. 1 %, 79. 8 %, 71. 1 %, and 70. 8 %. Sensitivity based on interval cancers within 12 months was significantly lower in the highest pressure quintile compared to the third (84. 3 % vs 93. 9 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 034). Specificity was lower in the lowest pressure quintile (98. 0 %) compared to the second, third, and fourth group (98. 5 %, p[*]<[*] 0. 005). Specificity of the fifth quintile was 98. 4 %.

40|$|During breast {{screening}} it {{is necessary}} and essential to compress the <b>breast</b> with a <b>compression</b> <b>paddle,</b> {{in order to obtain}} a clear mammographic image. The quality of the image has a direct correlation with the accuracy of mammogram reading, which in turn could affect radiologist’s interpretation. Clinical observation has indicated that <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> may have a side effect on image quality during the image acquisition and can result in unexpected variations in texture and intensity appearances, between breast tissue near the skinline {{and the rest of the}} breast. Within computer aided mammography, such variations increase the difficulty in breast tissue modelling and can be detrimental to image analysis, leading to incorrect prompts which can have an impact on sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography. We present an automatic image enhancement approach, in which both Cranio Caudal and Medio-Lateral Oblique views are utilised. We estimate the relative breast thickness ratio at a given projection location in order to alter/correct an inconsistent intensity distribution as a means of improving mammographic image quality. Our dataset consists of 360 full field digital mammographic images was used in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Visual assessment indicated good and consistent intensity variation over the processed images, whilst texture information (breast parenchymal patterns) was preserved and/or enhanced. By improving the consistency of the intensity distribution on the mammographic images, the developed method has demonstrated a potential benefit in density based mammographic segmentation and risk assessment. This in turn can be found useful in computer aided mammography, and is beneficial in a clinical setting by aiding screening radiologists in the process of decision making...|$|R
40|$|In x-ray mammography, {{flattening}} of {{the breast}} improves image quality and reduces absorbed dose. Current mammographic compression guidelines are based on applying a standardized force to each breast. Because breast size is not taken into consideration, this approach leads to large variations in applied pressure (force applied per unit contact area). It is the authors' hypothesis that a pressure-controlled compression protocol, which takes contact area into account, (1) improves standardization across the population in terms of physiological conditions in the compressed breast (blood pressure), and (2) reduces discomfort and pain, particularly the number of severe pain complaints, (3) with limited effects on image quality and absorbed glandular dose (AGD). A prospective observational study including 291 craniocaudal (CC) and 299 mediolateral oblique (MLO) <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> in 196 women following the authors' hospital's standard compression protocol with 18 decanewton (daN) target force was performed. Breast thickness, applied force, area of contact between <b>breast</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>paddle,</b> and mean pressure were recorded during the entire compression. Pain scores before and after <b>breast</b> <b>compressions</b> were obtained using an 11 -point numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores of 7 and higher were considered to indicate severe pain. The authors analyzed differences between the CC and MLO compressions, correlation coefficients (ρ) between compression parameters, and odds-ratios (OR) for all parameters as possible predictors for experiencing severe pain using multivariate logistic regression. The observed data were used in two models to estimate what breast thickness, required force, and pain score would be for pressure-controlled compression protocols with target pressures ranging from 4 to 28 kilopascal (kPa). For a selection of 79 mammograms having a 10 % or more thickness difference {{with respect to the}} prior mammogram, the authors performed a retrospective observer study to assess whether such thickness differences have significant effects on image quality or AGD. In a standard 18 daN force-controlled compression protocol, the authors observed an average pressure of 21. 3 kPa± 54 % standard deviation for CC compressions and 14. 2 kPa± 32 % for MLO compressions. Women with smaller breasts endured higher pressures and experienced more pain, as indicated by a significant negative correlation (ρ=- 0. 19, p < 0. 01) between contact area and pain score. Multivariate regression showed that contact area is a strong and significant predictor for severe pain (ORNRS≥ 7 (CC) = 0. 10 /dm 2, p < 0. 05), {{as is the case with}} any pain already present before compression (ORNRS≥ 7 (CC) = 1. 61 per NRS-point, p < 0. 05). Model estimations showed that mammographic <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> with a standardized pressure of 10 kPa, corresponding with normal arterial blood pressure, may significantly reduce the number of severe pain complaints with an average increase in breast thickness of 9 % for small breasts and 2 % for large breasts.

40|$|Fibroglandular tissue {{volume and}} percent density can be {{estimated}} in unprocessed mammograms using a physics-based method, which relies on an internal reference value representing the projection of fat only. However, pixels representing fat only may not be present in dense breasts, causing an underestimation of density measurements. In this work, we investigate alternative approaches for obtaining a tissue reference value to improve density estimations, particularly in dense breasts. Two of three investigated reference values (F 1, F 2) are percentiles of the pixel value distribution in the breast interior (the contact area of <b>breast</b> and <b>compression</b> <b>paddle).</b> F 1 is determined in a small breast interior, which minimizes the risk that peripheral pixels {{are included in the}} measurement at the cost of increasing the chance that no proper reference can be found. F 2 is obtained using a larger breast interior. The new approach which is developed for very dense breasts does not require the presence of a fatty tissue region. As reference region we select the densest region in the mammogram and assume that this represents a projection of entirely dense tissue embedded between the subcutaneous fatty tissue layers. By measuring the thickness of the fat layers a reference (F 3) can be computed. To obtain accurate breast density estimates irrespective of breast composition we investigated a combination {{of the results of the}} three reference values. We collected 202 pairs of MRI's and digital mammograms from 119 women. We compared the percent dense volume estimates based on both modalities and calculated Pearson's correlation coefficients. With the references F 1 -F 3 we found respectively a correlation of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Best results were obtained with the combination of the density estimations ([Formula: see text]).

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of two methods of determining the contact area between the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> and the <b>breast</b> in mammography. An accurate method to determine the contact area is essential to accurately calculate the average compression pressure applied by the paddle. Methods: For a set of 300 <b>breast</b> <b>compressions,</b> we measured the contact areas between breast and paddle, both capacitively using a transparent foil with indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coating attached to the paddle, and retrospectively from the obtained mammograms using image processing software (Volpara Enterprise, algorithm version 1. 5. 2). A gold standard was obtained from video images of the compressed <b>breast.</b> During each <b>compression,</b> the <b>breast</b> was illuminated from the sides {{in order to create}} a dark shadow on the video image where the breast was in contact with the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle.</b> We manually segmented the shadows captured at the time of x-ray exposure and measured their areas. Results: We found a strong correlation between the manual segmentations and the capacitive measurements [r = 0. 989, 95 % CI (0. 987, 0. 992) ] and between the manual segmentations and the image processing software [r = 0. 978, 95 % CI (0. 972, 0. 982) ]. Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of - 0. 0038 dm(2) for the capacitive measurement (SD 0. 0658, 95 % limits of agreement [- 0. 1329, 0. 1252]) and - 0. 0035 dm(2) for the image processing software [SD 0. 0962, 95 % limits of agreement (- 0. 1921, 0. 1850) ]. Conclusions: The size of the contact area between the paddle and the breast can be determined accurately and precisely, both in real-time using the capacitive method, and retrospectively using image processing software.

40|$|The {{standard}} procedure at mammography is to compress the breast {{in order to}} improve image quality, better separate tissue components and reduce absorbed dose to the <b>breast.</b> Traditionally, <b>compression</b> guidelines have been based on applied force, rather than actual thickness reduction. Structures such as the pectoral muscle are stiffer than breast tissue and if compressed along with it, as in the MLO-projection, might absorb much of the applied force. This study investigated the difference in <b>compression</b> of <b>breasts</b> before and after they were repositioned to exclude 1 cm of the juxtathoracic part. Twenty-one women were included in the study. The distribution of compression pressure was measured using thin FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) pressure sensors attached to the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle.</b> <b>Breast</b> thickness and <b>compression</b> force were measured by the mammographic device. Compared to standard positioning the repositioned breasts were thinner by 4. 4 +/- 2. 3 mm (P < 0. 001) (from 50. 3 mm to 45. 9 mm) and had a 12. 3 +/- 24. 5 cm(2) (P = 0. 032) larger area over which pressure was distributed (from 97. 6 cm(2) to 109. 9 cm(2)), despite less of the breast being included in the projection. This indicates that the inclusion of the pectoral muscle and other juxtathoracic structures in the MLO-projection substantially affects pressure distribution and prevents proper <b>compression</b> of the <b>breast.</b> The results suggest that the exact positioning of the MLO-projection should be carefully evaluated in order to find a balance between <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> and tissue inclusion...|$|R

40|$|From major {{protocols}} on dosimetry in mammography, {{there is}} no doubt that the incident air kerma should be evaluated without backscattered radiation to the dosemeter. However, forward-scattered radiation from the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> is neglected. The aim of this work was to analyse the contribution of forward-scattered radiation for typical air kerma measurements. Measurements of forward-scatter were performed with a plane-parallel ionisation chamber on four mammography units. The forward-scatter contribution to the air kerma was 2 - 10 % and increased with the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> thickness, but also with the half-value layer value. For incident air kerma in mammography, it can be as important to consider forward-scattered as backscattered radiation. If an ionisation chamber is used, the <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> should be in contact with the chamber; otherwise the air kerma and absorbed dose will be underestimated. If a dosemeter based on semiconductors with much less sensitivity to scattered radiation is used, it is suggested that a forward-scatter factor (FSF) is applied.

Results: The results obtained are based on simulation alone and indicate that closed-loop control of breast side paddle position dramatically reduced the settling time from over 90 seconds to less than 4 seconds. The effect of different machine drive time constants on the open-loop response is insignificant.

During this IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant study, 50 women were recruited to undergo 3 D breast surface imaging with structured light (SL) during <b>breast</b> <b>compression,</b> along with simultaneous acquisition of a tomosynthesis image. A pair of SL systems were used to acquire 3 D surface images by projecting 24 different patterns onto the compressed breast and capturing their reflection off the breast surface in approximately 12 - 16 s. The 3 D surface was characterized and modeled via principal component analysis. The resulting surface model was combined with a previously developed 2 D model of projected compressed breast shapes to generate a full 3 D model. Data from ten patients were discarded due to technical problems during image acquisition.

It was also applied an interview using focus group to debate the score that were attributed during pain evaluation and to identify the criteria that were considered to do the classification. Results: The women aged between 19 - 29 y (with higher breast density) classified the pain during no gradual compression as 4 and the gradual compression as 2 for both projections. The MLO projection was considered the most uncomfortable. During the focus group interview applied to this group was highlighted that compression did not promoted pain but discomfort.

There are no quantifiable recommendations for optimal compression force levels for practitioners to follow. Clients report variations in pain and discomfort when compression force is applied. Until now practitioner compression force variability has not been investigated; even though this might lead to variations in client pain and discomfort. The primary purpose of this thesis was to investigate whether practitioner compression force variability exists. Method: Three research papers investigated practitioner compression force variability: one used a cross sectional design; two used longitudinal designs, one was single centre {{and the other was}} multicentre. Three further research papers investigated important issues which might confound practitioner variability results: the first investigated <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> bend and distortion; the second investigated how <b>breast</b> thickness and <b>compression</b> force vary; the third evaluated practitioner ability to grade breast density, visually.

40|$|Abstract Background Calibrating mammograms {{to produce}} a {{standardized}} breast density measurement for breast cancer risk analysis requires an accurate spatial measure of the compressed breast thickness. Thickness inaccuracies due to the nominal system readout value and <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> orientation induce unacceptable errors in the calibration. Method A thickness correction was developed and evaluated using a fully specified two-component surrogate breast model. A previously developed calibration approach based on effective radiation attenuation coefficient measurements {{was used in the}} analysis. Water and oil were used to construct phantoms to replicate the deformable properties of the breast. Phantoms consisting of measured proportions of water and oil were used to estimate calibration errors without correction, evaluate the thickness correction, and investigate the reproducibility of the various calibration representations under compression thickness variations. Results The average thickness uncertainty due to <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> warp was characterized to within 0. 5 mm. The relative calibration error was reduced to 7 % from 48 - 68 % with the correction. The normalized effective radiation attenuation coefficient (planar) representation was reproducible under intra-sample compression thickness variations compared with calibrated volume measures. Conclusion Incorporating this thickness correction into the rigid breast tissue equivalent calibration method should improve the calibration accuracy of mammograms for risk assessments using the reproducible planar calibration measure. </p...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method of}} skin {{segmentation}} is presented aimed to obtain as many pixels {{belonging to the}} real skin as possible. This method is validated by experts in radiology. In addition, a biomechanical model of the breast, which considers the skin segmented in this way, is constructed to study the influence of considering real skin in the simulation of the <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> during an X-ray mammography. The reaction forces of the plates are obtained and compared with the reaction forces obtained using classical methods that model the skin as a 2 D membranes that cover all the breast. The results of this work show that, {{in most of the}} cases, the method of skin segmentation is accurate and that real skin should be considered in the simulation of the <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> during the X-ray mammographies...|$|R
30|$|During the interview, all radiographers also {{classified}} {{the level}} of the task demand (effort) according to the Borg CR 10 scale at each posture. This scale is used for estimating effort and exertion, breathlessness and fatigue during physical work. The Borg CR 10 scale is a category ratio (CR) scale based on the number 10, which represents extreme intensities [10]. Also, it was asked about the equipment characteristics, namely: control station height, accessibility of the monitor, accessibility of compression devices, accessibility of the <b>compression</b> <b>paddles</b> and intensity of the positioning light.|$|R
30|$|According to Whelehan et al. [44], clients avoid re-attending for {{screening}} mammography due to breast pain {{experienced in the}} previous exams. During a mammography exam, pain can arise from the application of compression force, being also a challenge in the radiographer practice, as the radiographer rather than the client influences the application of compression force in mammography. The application of compression force and the resultant pain can affect client experience, radiation dose and image quality (noise, sharpness, movement artefacts), {{and needs to be}} addressed in radiographer education and training. Mercer et al. [28] also highlighted in their study the considerable variability in <b>breast</b> <b>compression</b> force applied during mammography examination, showing room for improvements in practice and consequently in radiographers’ education. It is crucial to identify strategies allowing the optimisation of <b>breast</b> <b>compression,</b> resulting in pain reduction and improving the image quality.|$|R
40|$|Diffuse optical {{tomography}} (DOT) is {{an emerging}} noninvasive functional imaging method {{for breast cancer}} diagnosis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy monitoring. In particular, the multimodal approach of combining DOT with x-ray digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is especially synergistic as DBT prior information {{can be used to}} enhance the DOT reconstruction. DOT, in turn, provides a functional information overlay onto the mammographic images, increasing sensitivity and specificity to cancer pathology. We describe a dynamic DOT apparatus designed for tight integration with commercial DBT scanners and providing a fast (1 Hz+) image acquisition rate to enable tracking of hemodynamic changes induced by the mammographic <b>breast</b> <b>compression.</b> The most significant advance enabling fast acquisition was the design and construction of a direct analog-to-digital conversion frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (FD-NIRS) component. It achieves simultaneous dual wavelength operation at 685 nm and 830 nm by concurrent 67. 5 MHz and 75 MHz frequency modulation of each laser source, respectively, followed by digitization using a high-speed analog to digital converter and real-time hybrid FPGA-assisted demodulation by discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The overall DOT system integrates 96 CW-NIRS and 24 FD-NIRS source locations, as well as 32 CW-NIRS and 20 FD-NIRS detection locations into low-profile plates that mate to the DBT <b>compression</b> <b>paddle</b> and x-ray detector cover, respectively. The plates and the embedded optical fibers are made of plastic to minimize x-ray absorption and thus allow true simultaneous acquisition of the DBT image. We first characterize each major system component individually, and then demonstrate overall performance using static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms, as well as in vivo images acquired from the pool of patients recalled for breast biopsies at the Massachusetts General Hospital Breast Imaging Division. by Bernhard B.

The <b>breast</b> thickness, <b>compression</b> force, contact area, contact pressure and pain experience were recorded continuously. Breast volume was calculated retrospectively from the mammograms. We visualized the progression of pain in relation to breast mechanics for five groups of breast volumes and we performed multivariable regressions to identify factors that significantly predict pain experience. <b>Breast</b> <b>compressions</b> consisted of a deformation phase for flattening, and a clamping phase for immobilization. The clamping phase lasted 12. 8 [*]±[*] 3. 6 seconds (average[*]±[*]standard deviation), 1. 7 times longer than the 7. 5 [*]±[*] 2. 6 seconds deformation phase. During the clamping phase, the average pain score increased from 4. 75 to 5. 88 (+ 24 %) on a 0 - 10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), {{and the proportion of}} women who reached severe pain (NRS[*]≥[*] 7) increased from 23 % to 50 % (more than doubled).

40|$|A lack of {{consistent}} guidelines regarding mammographic compression {{has led to}} wide variation in its technical execution. <b>Breast</b> <b>compression</b> is accomplished {{by means of a}} <b>compression</b> <b>paddle,</b> resulting in a certain contact area between the paddle and the breast.

To compare the current compression practice in mammography between different imaging sites in the Netherlands and the United States from a mechanical point of view, and to investigate whether the compression protocols in these countries can be improved by standardization of pressure (kPa) as an objective mechanical parameter. We retrospectively studied the available parameters of a set of 37, 518 mammographic compressions (9188 women) from the Dutch national breast cancer screening programme (NL data set) and of another set of 7171 compressions (1851 women) from a breast imaging centre in Pittsburgh, PA (US data set). Both sets were processed using VolparaAnalytics and VolparaDensity to obtain the applied average force, pressure, breast thickness, breast volume, breast density and average glandular dose (AGD) {{as a function of the}} size of the contact area between the breast and the paddle. On average, the forces and pressures applied in the NL data set were significantly higher than in the US data set. The relative standard deviation was larger in the US data set than in the NL data set. Breasts were compressed with a force in the high range of > 15 daN for 31. 1 % and > 20 kPa for 12. 3 % of the NL data set versus, respectively, 1. 5 % and 1. 7 % of the US data set.
