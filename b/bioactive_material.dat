Protein surface modification of various types biomaterials (ceramics, polymers, metals, composites) is performed to ultimately increase biocompatibility of the material and interact as a <b>bioactive</b> <b>material</b> for specific applications. In various biomedical applications of developing implantable medical devices (such as pacemakers and stents), surface properties/interactions of proteins with a specific material must be evaluated with regards to biocompatibility as it {{plays a major role in}} determining a biological response.

The composition and biodegradability of PHAs can be regulated by blending it with other natural polymers. In the 1980s the company ICI Zenecca commercialized PHAs under the name Biopol.

5000|$|Many {{medical devices}} and {{products}} {{come into contact}} with the internal surfaces of the body, such as surgical tools and implants. When a non-native material enters the body, the first step of the immune response takes place and host extracellular matrix and plasma proteins aggregate to the material in attempts to contain, neutralize, or wall-off the injurious agent. These proteins can facilitate the attachment of various cell types such as osteoblasts and fibroblasts that can encourage tissue repair. [...] Taking this a step further, implantable devices can be coated with a <b>bioactive</b> <b>material</b> to encourage adsorption of specific proteins, fibrous capsule formation, and wound healing.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} improve osseointegration of dental {{implants}} with bone we studied an implant with holes inside its body to deliver bioactive materials based on a proposed patent.

In {{order to improve}} the concept and study the effect of <b>bioactive</b> <b>material</b> injection on implant integration, design optimization and integration research were undertaken utilizing the finite element method. A 2 -dimensional simulation study showed that when bone grew into the holes after the <b>bioactive</b> <b>material</b> was injected, stress vertically distributed in {{the upper part of}} the implant was relieved and mild stress appeared at the opening of the injection holes. This confirmed the effect of the <b>bioactive</b> <b>material</b> and the contribution of the injection holes, but the maximum stress increased ten-fold at the opening.

40|$|<b>Bioactive</b> <b>materials</b> are {{critical}} in many {{applications in the}} fields ranging from antibiofouling coatings to tissue engineering to biosensing devices. The construction of <b>bioactive</b> <b>materials</b> generally involves dispersion of bioactive components such as biocides, peptides or proteins in organic or inorganic matrices. However, when these bioactive components are incorporated to such matrices, their functionalities may be significantly hindered. As a result, it has spurred great attention seeking guidelines for future rational design and development of <b>bioactive</b> <b>materials</b> with optimal functionalities. This thesis proposes optimization strategies by investigating interfacial molecular interactions of various <b>bioactive</b> <b>materials</b> in situ using surface specific spectroscopies and correlating the structural and orientational information to their activity. Firstly, two biocide-incorporated antifouling polymeric materials are characterized using sum frequency generations vibrational spectroscopy at solid/liquid interfaces. The interaction mechanism is unraveled by varying both biocidal and the polymer components of the system. The structure of the alkyl chains from the biocidal components is determined and by comparing to their antifouling performance, it is concluded that the protruding-out state offers the best antifouling activity. Factors that affect {{the structure of the}} biocidal components are examined. Secondly, antimicrobial peptides are immobilized to various surface platforms. The immobilization processes are thoroughly monitored and the final immobilized peptide structures and orientations are determined using spectroscopic technique. The immobilization environment, the location of the attachment point and the peptide sequence all play important roles in determining the immobilization process and the final state of the immobilized peptides. Finally, a model enzyme is immobilized to solid surfaces and characterized by using combined spectroscopic measurements. These results are further correlated to the enzymatic activities and confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations performed by our collaborators. It is concluded that the surface properties, the location of the attachment point, the secondary structure of the attachment point are factors influencing the immobilized enzyme structure and further determining the activity and stability of the immobilized enzyme.
