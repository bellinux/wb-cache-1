GNU Troff is a typesetting package which reads plain text mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output. It supports a number of devices and now supports the production of HTML. The paper discusses {{the design of the}} HTML device driver grohtml and modifications made to GNU Troff. The front end program troff was modi-fied to maintain a reduced state machine which is examined each time a glyph is passed to the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> <b>device</b> driver (post-grohtml). Any change in system state between the production of two glyphs results in a sequence of events being passed to the device driver. There is a direct correspondence between this technique and creating a script for a next event simulation queue. Furthermore the device driver reconstructs the system state and for-mats the HTML according to state changes caused when processing the event queue. This technique works well, as it minimises the state information passed from front end to <b>back</b> <b>end</b> <b>device</b> driver whilst still preserving the high level layout of the text. Using this technique GNU Troff effectively translates input source into another mark-up language and thus this technique could be extended to translate GNU Troff documents into any of the OpenOffice supported formats. Troff has been in use for three decades now and is still actively used by authors. Troff’s biggest use, however, is to format manual pages for GNU/Linux and other UNIX like operating systems. Introducing this facility into GNU Troff provides users with the ability to translate legacy documents into HTML and in the future to a format supported by OpenOffice.

The robot is fully autonomous and can avoid obstacles. Forward locomotion is achieved by rotating the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of the <b>device</b> {{up and over the}} front end. The robot consists of a long bar that connects two boxes that each house electrical and mechanical components. Wireless RF communication is used between the two boxes to coordinate their movements. As a box is lifted, position sensing is provided by an accelerometer and obstacle avoidance is provided by an infrared sensor.

30|$|PacketCable 2.0 replaces NCS with SIP. NCS is a {{centralized}} signaling protocol to control nonintelligent legacy telephony <b>end</b> <b>devices.</b> With NCS, CMS monitors the <b>end</b> <b>device</b> status and issues the corresponding signaling to establish or terminate a session. The <b>end</b> <b>device</b> has no intelligence {{to provide the}} required call control signaling. In contrast, SIP proposes distributed signaling architecture with intelligent <b>end</b> <b>devices.</b> The <b>end</b> <b>devices</b> are able to provide call control signaling and react to the incoming requests. Consequently, the involvement of IMS components (including CMS) in session signaling is limited to AAA functions, session routing, and service triggering.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the idea}} of the {{fabrication}} platform in the automobile industry to save cost and time of fabrication, the fabrication of other micro fluidic actuators will be reorganised to a full wafer fabrication technology line too. The equipment therefore will be the same for different fluidic devices like micro pumps, active micro valves and micro mixers. To fabricate different fluidic devices just particular design is to be done by appropriate masks and etching protocols. All different fluidic devices will be fabricated with the same front <b>end</b> and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> process on the same equipment, no special steps or equipment are necessary. The front <b>end</b> <b>device</b> fabrication for the different fluidic products is based on a 4 " wafer process integrated in a 100 class cleanroom and yet organised in a platform conception. The main process modules are oxide, nitride, doubled sided lithography, dry etching, wafer bond technologies, KOH deep etching and sputtering. Also the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> fabrication will be modular: changing the fabrication from one device to another, downtime of the different equipment is reduced to few minutes because only device specific adapters, clamps or conversion kits must be changed to fabricate different fluidic devices with the same equipment. Intermediate tests will be done on wafer level, thus time for single product endtest will be reduced. Reliability tests like temperature and vibration tests will be developed. This <b>back</b> <b>end</b> fabrication will be integrated in a laboratory (10 000 class cleanroom). High yield and reproducibility, low cost, good performance and repeatability will be the result of realizing the full wafer fabrication platform of microfluidic devices...|$|R

5000|$|In compilers, {{the front}} end {{translates}} a computer programming source code into an intermediate representation, and the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> works with the intermediate representation to produce code in a computer output language.

The front-end/back-end distinction can separate the parser section that deals with source code and the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> that generates code and optimizes. Some designs, such as GCC, offer choices between multiple front ends (parsing different source languages) or <b>back</b> <b>ends</b> (generating code for different target processors).|$|R

The <b>back</b> <b>end</b> performs instruction scheduling, which re-orders instructions to keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots. Although most algorithms for optimization are NP-hard, heuristic techniques are well-developed and currently implemented in production-quality compilers. Typically the output of a <b>back</b> <b>end</b> is machine code specialized for a particular processor and operating system.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} value {{relevance}} of nuclear decommissioning costs and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs (nuclear recycle costs), which are accruals related to {{nuclear power plants}} in electric utilities. We analyze the association between those accruals and stock price levels {{at the end of}} fiscal year, based on earnings capitalization model. The findings of this paper are as follows. (1) Recognizing of decommissioning costs and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs contribute to increase the quality of earnings of electric companies. Off-balancing regulation, which compels not to recognize some portion of <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs, distorts the quality of earnings. (2) Decommissioning costs and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs, which are measured by estimating of future payments, are value relevant. However, the contents of information differ each other. The result of OLS regression shows that decommissioning costs (<b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs) are positively (negatively) associated with stock price levels. (3) Though both discretionary decommissioning costs and discretionary <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs are value relevant, two accruals have different information contents. Moreover, the value relevance of income-increasing (negative signed) discretionary accruals is different form that of income-decreasing (positive signed) discretionary accruals. (4) We cannot observe the signaling effect of discretionary accruals reported in some prior studies. (5) As to the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs, although in limited case, we find the conservative behavior of estimating the future payments. In Appendix, we detect the income smoothing strategy of electric companies by discretionary estimation of decommissioning costs and <b>back</b> <b>end</b> costs. ...|$|R

40|$|Although I {{have proven}} {{that the general}} problem is undecidable, I show how, for {{machines}} of practical interest, to generate the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> of a compiler. Unlike previous work on generating <b>back</b> <b>ends,</b> I generate the machinedependent components of the <b>back</b> <b>end</b> using only information that is independent of the compiler’s internal data structures and intermediate form. My techniques substantially reduce the burden of retargeting the compiler: although it is still necessary to master the target machine’s instruction set, {{it is not necessary}} to master the data structures and algorithms in the compiler’s <b>back</b> <b>end.</b> Instead, the machine-dependent knowledge is isolated in the declarative machine descriptions.
