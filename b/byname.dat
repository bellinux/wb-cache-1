These names are cognomina because of the significant appellative meaning in Old and Middle High German times. They are divided in 10 groups: (1.) ethnic <b>bynames</b> (type: Hesso, Latinus), (2.) <b>bynames</b> given at birth (type: Willicomo, Gotedanc) (3.) <b>bynames</b> designating relationship (type: Fater, Muatir), (4.) <b>bynames</b> from animals (type: Fisc, Swein), (5.) <b>bynames</b> from plants (type: Palma, Pluoma), (6.) <b>bynames</b> from professions (type: Choufman, Chnehto), (7.) religious <b>bynames</b> (type: Kotechind, Seraphim), (8.) <b>bynames</b> based on physical attributes (type: Barbatus, Panzleip), (9.) <b>bynames</b> indicating intellectual qualities (type: Chusc, Heitar), (10.) negative <b>bynames</b> (type: Unarg, Untol).

50|$|<b>Bynames,</b> to-names, {{or other}} names, were once {{very common in}} Scotland. These names were used in areas where there were few names in circulation, and the <b>bynames</b> were added onto the name of person, in order to {{distinguish}} them from others who bore the same name. <b>Bynames</b> were particularly prevalent in fishing communities in the northeastern part of Scotland, but were also used in the Borders and the West Highlands. In some cases within fishing communities, the names of fishing boats were tacked onto the names people in order to differentiate them from others.|$|R

25|$|Human {{personal}} {{names are}} presented, used and categorised {{in many ways}} depending on the language and culture. In most cultures (Indonesia is one exception) it is customary for individuals to be given at least two names. In Western culture, the first name is given at birth or shortly thereafter and {{is referred to as}} the given name, the forename, the baptismal name (if given then), or simply the first name. In England prior to the Norman invasion of 1066, small communities of Celts, Anglo-Saxons and Scandinavians generally used single names: each person was identified by a single name as either a personal name or nickname. As the population increased, it gradually became necessary to identify people further – giving rise to names like John the butcher, Henry from Sutton, and Roger son of Richard … which naturally evolved into John Butcher, Henry Sutton, and Roger Richardson. We now know this additional name variously as the second name, last name, family name, surname or occasionally the <b>byname,</b> and this natural tendency was accelerated by the Norman tradition of using surnames that were fixed and hereditary within individual families. In combination these two names are now known as the personal name or, simply, the name. There are many exceptions to this general rule: Westerners often insert a third or more names between the given and surnames; Chinese and Hungarian names have the family name preceding the given name; females now often retain their maiden names (their family surname) or combine, using a hyphen, their maiden name and the surname of their husband; some East Slavic nations insert the patronym (a name derived from the given name of the father) between the given and the family name; in Iceland the given name is used with the patronym, or matronym (a name derived from the given name of the mother), and surnames are rarely used. Nicknames (sometimes called hypocoristic names) are informal names used mostly between friends.|$|E

50|$|So, the two <b>bynames</b> (Oginskis and Puzyna) {{actually}} formed only {{in later}} {{generations of the}} two brothers, and not yet to the two brothers themselves. But it has been easy although mistaken {{to try to make}} already two brothers to carry the nicknames. Since <b>bynames</b> of the real historically attested brothers Dimitrijus and Ivan were actually not such, this has presumably led to confusions about what were the first names of the two brothers who started the branches, some thus picking up the unhistorical names Grigor and Valadimir, as well as the 'mythical' forefather name Tit (who was real person in the ancrstry but farther back) as their father.|$|R

500|$|Ölvir Rósta, is a {{character}} in the mediaeval Orkneyinga saga. His name in Old Norse is Ölvir rósta. The 17th-century Icelandic historian Þormóður Torfason, who wrote Latin histories which covered events the Northern Isles and north-east of Scotland, rendered Ölvir's name as Aulver Rosta. Ölvir's <b>byname,</b> rósta, means [...] "brawl", [...] "riot". Both his name and <b>byname</b> are represented various ways in English secondary sources.

The Ingoldsby Legends includes a re-invention of the story in which two brothers, Robert and Richard de Birchington, are substituted for the two sisters.

500|$|Magnus grew {{up among}} the hird (royal retinue) {{of his father}} in Nidaros (modern Trondheim), de facto capital of Norway at the time. His father's cousin, the {{chieftain}} Tore Ingeridsson, was foster-father to Magnus. In his youth, he was apparently more similar to his warlike grandfather, King Harald Hardrada, than to his father (who bore the <b>byname</b> Kyrre: [...] "the Peaceful"). According to Snorri Sturluson, Magnus was considered handsome and gifted in learning; although he was shorter in stature than his grandfather Harald, he was reportedly known as [...] "Magnus the Tall". Magnus' more-common <b>byname,</b> [...] "Barefoot" [...] or [...] "Barelegs", was—according to Snorri—due to his adopting the Gaelic dress of the Irish and Scots: a short tunic, which left the lower legs bare. Another version (by Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus) maintains that he acquired the nickname because {{he was forced to}} flee from a Swedish attack in his bare feet, while a third explains that he rode barefoot (like the Irish). Due to Magnus' aggressive nature and his campaigns abroad, he also had the nickname styrjaldar-Magnús ("Warrior Magnus" [...] or [...] "Magnus the Strife-lover").|$|E
500|$|Later, {{historian}} W.D.H. Sellar noted Matheson's proposed {{link between}} the MacLeods and Ölvir, but commented that the evidence Matheson used was entirely circumstantial. Sellar was {{of the opinion that}} Ölvir was not such a rare name as Matheson had previously thought. Sellar also noted that the genealogy and family of Ölvir, recorded in the Orkneyinga saga, has no similarity with the line recorded in the Gaelic genealogies concerning the ancestry of Leod. Matheson's association of Ölvir to the Macleods was also attacked by clan historian Alick Morrison. Morrison commented that the name Ljotr was also not as rare as Matheson had proposed. Morrison noted that, in the previous century, Thomas had considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr (mentioned earlier in the article), who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. In fact, Morrison did not consider Ölvir's name—and the singled-out Gaelic names—to be anything but other forms of Óláfr. However, Óláfr and Ölvir are considered by others to be quite different names, with separate origins. Morrison, and Sellar, also noted that the bynames of Ölvir, and Leod's great-grandfather, do not appear to match up—in three of the relevant Gaelic pedigrees, the <b>byname</b> of Leod's great-grandfather appears as snoice, snaige, and snáithe. Thomas considered these bynames to mean [...] "hewer"; although, both Matheson and Sellar disagreed with this translation. Morrison considered these to equate to snaith, [...] "white";' however, Sellar noted that Morrison gave no further explanation for this assertion. Sellar, himself, proposed that the <b>byname</b> may be not be Gaelic, but Norse in origin. He suggested that it may refer to some sort of deformity to the man's nose; another suggestion forwarded to him was that it may refer to a cleft palate. Later, A.P. MacLeod noted that the Gaelic snatha—which has a secondary meaning of [...] "grief", and [...] "trouble"—may be a nominative form of the genitive snaithe, and thus may equate to Ölvir's <b>byname.</b>|$|E
500|$|Einarr Rognvaldarson often {{referred}} to by his <b>byname</b> Torf-Einarr (sometimes anglicised as Turf-Einarr), (fl. early 890s–c. 910) {{was one of the}} Norse Earls of Orkney. The son of the Norse jarl, Rognvald Eysteinsson and a concubine, his rise to power is related in sagas which apparently draw on verses of Einarr's own composition for inspiration. After battling for control of the Northern Isles of Scotland and a struggle with Norwegian royalty, Einarr founded a dynasty which retained control of the islands for centuries after his death.|$|E

500|$|Barry der Menschenretter (1800–1814), {{also known}} as Barry, was a dog of a breed which was later called the St. Bernard that worked as a {{mountain}} rescue dog in Switzerland for the Great St Bernard Hospice.

500|$|Relations between Harald and Magnus Sigurdsson soured, {{and several}} years later Harald had Magnus {{mutilated}} and deposed (hence his <b>byname</b> [...] "the Blind"). Soon afterwards, Harald was murdered by another pretender: Sigurd Slembe, who also {{claimed to be a}} son of Magnus Barefoot and had been outlawed by Harald. After Harald's death Slembe allied himself with Magnus the Blind, but they were defeated by chieftains loyal to Harald Gille's family in the Battle of Holmengrå. Magnus was killed during the battle; Sigurd was captured, tortured and executed. This began what would become the century-long Norwegian civil-war era.|$|E
500|$|Danish king Eric Evergood, {{concerned}} that the conflict would escalate, began peace talks between the two kings.

After a constructive meeting, they agreed to preserve ancestral borders; by marrying Inge's daughter Margaret (who acquired the <b>byname</b> Fredkulla: [...] "Colleen-of-Peace"), Magnus acquired the lands he claimed {{on behalf of his}} ancestors. Since the marriage was childless, Dalsland never became established as a Norwegian province and was returned to Sweden after his death.|$|E
