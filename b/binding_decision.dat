Only when the conciliation was unsuccessful and a conciliation certificate issued could the claim proceed to the next step. For {{unfair dismissal}} claims, the claim proceeded to arbitration by the AIRC, where a Member of the Commission could issue a <b>binding</b> <b>decision.</b> For unlawful termination claims, the claim proceeded to a court with appropriate jurisdiction such as the Federal Court or the Industrial Division of the Federal Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|After the {{destruction}} of the Second Temple and the failure of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, the Great Sanhedrin moved to Galilee, which became part of the Roman Syria Palaestina province and was sometimes referred as the Galilean Patriarchate or Patriarchate of Palaestina, being the governing legalistic body of Galilean Jewry until about 425 CE. In the late 3rd century, to avoid persecution, its authoritative decisions were issued under the name of Beit HaMidrash. Historically, the last <b>binding</b> <b>decision</b> of the Great Sanhedrin appeared in 358 CE, when the Hebrew Calendar was adopted. The Great Sanhedrin was dissolved after continued persecution by the Eastern Roman Empire and aspiring Christendom. Over the centuries, there have been attempts to revive the institution, such as the Grand Sanhedrin convened by Napoleon Bonaparte and modern attempts in Israel.|$|E

2500|$|In Germany, Liberal {{communities}} stagnated since mid-century. Full {{and complete}} Jewish emancipation granted to {{all in the}} German Empire in 1871 largely diffused interest in harmonizing religion with Zeitgeist. Immigration from Eastern Europe also strengthened traditional elements. In 1898, seeking to counter these trends, Rabbi Heinemann Vogelstein established the Union of Liberal Rabbis (Vereinigung der liberalen Rabbiner). It numbered 37 members at first and grew to include 72 by 1914, about half of Germany's Jewish clergy, a proportion maintained until 1933. In 1908, Vogelstein and Rabbi Cäsar Seligmann also founded a congregational arm, the Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany (Vereinigung für das Liberale Judentum in Deutschland), finally institutionalizing the current that until then was active as a loose tendency. The Union had some 10,000 registered members in the 1920s. In 1912, Seligmann drafted a declaration of principles, [...] "Guiding Lines towards a Program for Liberal Judaism" [...] (Richtlinien zu einem Programm für das liberale Judentum). It {{stressed the importance of}} individual consciousness and the supremacy of ethical values to ritual practice, declared a belief in a messianic age and was adopted as [...] "a recommendation", rather than a <b>binding</b> <b>decision.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Binding commitment. Early {{decision}} is a <b>binding</b> <b>decision,</b> meaning that students must withdraw applications to other schools if accepted. It is not legally binding, {{but there is}} a commitment involved with penalties for withdrawing for spurious reasons. Advisers suggest that this method is only for students who are absolutely certain about wanting to attend a specific school. If financial aid is a concern or if a family is [...] "shopping for the best deal", then it is usually advised to apply early action or regular decision instead. The one stipulated situation under which a student may back out of the agreement is if the financial aid offer is insufficient. A student who backs out for other reasons may be [...] "blacklisted" [...] by the early decision college, which may contact the student's high school guidance office, and prevent it from sending transcripts to other colleges, and high schools generally comply with such requests. In addition, the jilted college may contact other colleges about the withdrawal, and the other colleges would likely break off their offers of acceptance as well. And by the time that an early decision aid package is offered it may be March or April of twelfth grade, and then if a student backs out at that point for financial reasons, valuable time may be lost.|$|E
