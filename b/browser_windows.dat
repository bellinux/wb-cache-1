Google's mobile Android operating system uses both their own Google Goggles application or third party barcode scanners like Scan. Nokia's Symbian operating system features a barcode scanner, while mbarcode is a QR code reader for the Maemo operating system. In Apple iOS 11, the native camera app can decode QR Codes and can link to URLs, join wireless networks, or perform other operations depending on the QR Code contents. Other paid and free apps are available with scanning capabilities for other symbologies or for earlier iOS versions. With BlackBerry devices, the App World application can natively scan barcodes and load any recognized Web URLs on the device's Web <b>browser.</b> <b>Windows</b> Phone 7.5 is able to scan barcodes through the Bing search app. However, these devices are not designed specifically for the capturing of barcodes. As a result, they do not decode nearly as quickly or accurately as a dedicated barcode scanner or portable data terminal.|$|E
2500|$|Google Chrome {{includes}} a private browsing feature called [...] "incognito browsing mode" [...] that prevents the browser from permanently storing any browsing or download history information or cookies. Using incognito mode prevents tracking by the browser. However, the individual websites visited can still track and store information about visits. In particular any searches performed while signed into a Google account {{will be saved}} {{as part of the}} account's web history. In addition, other programs such as those used to stream media files, which are invoked from within Chrome, may still record history information, even when incognito mode is being used. Furthermore, a limitation of Apple's iOS 7 platform allows some information from incognito <b>browser</b> <b>windows</b> to leak to regular Chrome <b>browser</b> <b>windows.</b> There are concerns that these limitations may lead Chrome users to believe that incognito mode provides more privacy protection than it actually does.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{malicious}} add-ons can {{compromise the}} security of a system, Internet Explorer implements several safeguards. Internet Explorer 6 with Service Pack 2 and later feature an Add-on Manager for enabling or disabling individual add-ons, complemented by a [...] "No Add-Ons" [...] mode. Starting with Windows Vista, Internet Explorer and its BHOs run with restricted privileges and are isolated {{from the rest of the}} system. Internet Explorer 9 introduced a new component– Add-on Performance Advisor. Add-on Performance Advisor shows a notification when one or more of installed add-ons exceed a pre-set performance threshold. The notification appears in the Notification Bar when the user launches the <b>browser.</b> <b>Windows</b> 8 and Windows RT introduce a Metro-style version of Internet Explorer that is entirely sandboxed and does not run add-ons at all. In addition, Windows RT cannot download or install ActiveX controls at all; although existing ones bundled with Windows RT still run in the traditional version of Internet Explorer.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pop-up ad}} is {{displayed}} in a new web <b>browser</b> <b>window</b> that opens above a website visitor's initial <b>browser</b> <b>window.</b> A pop-under ad opens a new <b>browser</b> <b>window</b> under a website visitor's initial <b>browser</b> <b>window.</b> Pop-under ads and similar technologies are now advised against by online authorities such as Google, who state that they [...] "do not condone this practice".|$|R

The Correlator continues {{to monitor the}} ad space for each individual ad on the web page {{and its relation to}} the <b>browser</b> <b>window</b> dimensions, scrolling position and web page focus, considering if the viewer has scrolled the ad space in or out of the visible area of the <b>browser</b> <b>window,</b> minimized, tabbed away, or opened another <b>browser</b> or application <b>window</b> bringing the web page monitored out of focus or portion of the <b>browser</b> <b>window</b> with the ad space outside of the monitor screen. When 60%, (or other pre-defined area) of the ad content on a web page is within the visible area of the viewer's <b>browser</b> <b>window</b> for one second, a message is sent via Correlator and a [...] "Viewable Impression" [...] is reported. The Correlator code continues to monitor the web page focus and scrolling position, location of ad unit(s) and the visible area of the <b>browser</b> <b>window,</b> and communicates to the reporting server logging the “Time in View” for the ads being delivered on the webpage.|$|R

2500|$|On April 10, 2012, a new build of Chrome OS {{offered a}} choice between the {{original}} full-screen window interface and overlapping, re-sizable windows, such as found on Microsoft Windows and Apple's macOS. [...] The feature was implemented through the Ash window manager, which runs atop the Aura hardware-accelerated graphics engine. The April 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller, overlapping <b>browser</b> <b>windows,</b> {{each with its own}} translucent tabs, browser tabs that can be [...] "torn" [...] and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip, and a mouse-enabled shortcut list across the bottom of the screen. [...] One icon on the task bar shows a list of installed applications and bookmarks. [...] Writing in CNET, Stephen Shankland argued that with overlapping windows, [...] "Google is anchoring itself into the past" [...] as both [...] iOS and Microsoft's Metro interface are largely or entirely full-screen. Even so, [...] "Chrome OS already is different enough that it's best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved".|$|E
2500|$|On 18 July 2008, [...] "Girlfriend" [...] {{became the}} most viewed video at that time on YouTube and in August of that year, surpassed 100 million views, {{becoming}} the only YouTube video available {{at that time to}} reach that milestone (although CSS's [...] "Music Is My Hot Hot Sex" [...] had reached that milestone a couple months before, it has been removed from the website under accusations that the views had been frauded). The YouTube video of the song was accused of having an exaggerated number of views due to the use of a web link posted by AvrilBandAids, a fansite devoted to Lavigne. Clicking on the link would automatically reload the YouTube video of Girlfriend every fifteen seconds. Fans of Lavigne were encouraged to: [...] "Keep this page open while you browse the internet, study for exams, or even sleep. For extra viewing power, open up two or more <b>browser</b> <b>windows</b> at this page!" [...] However, the fansite later revealed that no [...] "cheating" [...] had taken place, and that the link had merely been a ruse to draw more attention to the video, thereby attracting additional views. It is expected that Lavigne's YouTube video views have earned in excess of US$2,000,000. In November 2009, RCA Records removed the video of the song from YouTube, by which time it had received around 130 million views. The video is now officially hosted on Vevo and Lavigne's Vevo channel on YouTube, surpassed 400 million views in September 2017.|$|E
