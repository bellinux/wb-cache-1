500|$|On the August 4 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, {{after a lengthy}} feud {{involving}} the [...] "Deletion" [...] of Jeff Hardy, <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> sent Jeff, [...] (at the time referred to as Brother Nero), on a quest to procure the Impact Wrestling World Tag Team Championship for him.|$|R
50|$|Nine {{professional}} wrestling matches were {{featured on}} the card. The main event consisted of Lashley defeating Drew Galloway by tapout to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship while the other saw Ethan Carter III defeat Mike Bennett. And, Jeff Hardy defeating <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> in a Full Metal Mayhem match.|$|R
5|$|On December 2, 2016, Hardy {{returned}} to ROH {{for the second}} time while still under contract with TNA, appearing at the promotions Final Battle pay-per-view show as <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt,</b> where a video message showed him addressing The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) and The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe).|$|R
50|$|Eight matches, one {{of which}} was a match taped for TNA Xplosion, took place at the event. In the main event, Lashley {{defeated}} Ethan Carter III to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, and The Hardys (<b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero) defeated Decay (Abyss and Crazzy Steve) in The Great War to become the TNA World Tag Team Champions.|$|R
5000|$|On July 8, 2016, TNA is {{announced}} that Impact Wrestling will begin airing at 8pm EST on Thursday nights on July 21, {{the night that}} would feature {{the start of the}} [...] "Bound For Glory Playoff" [...] to determine a new #1 contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. In the first round, <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt,</b> Ethan Carter III, Drew Galloway and Mike Bennett advanced to the semifinals with victories over James Storm, Eli Drake, Bram and Jeff Hardy respectively. Second round action lead to Carter pinning <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> Hardy, and Bennett pinning Galloway. In the final, Carter pinned Bennett to become the number one contender. On the August 4 episode of Impact Wrestling, James Storm defeated Eli Drake to win the TNA King of the Mountain Championship. Lashley would then come out and challenge Storm to a match for his King of the Mountain Championship, whilst putting his TNA World Heavyweight Championship and TNA X Division Championship on the line as well, which Lashley won.|$|R
500|$|On the August 18 {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero {{defeated}} The BroMans, The Tribunal, and The Helms Dynasty in an [...] "Ascension to Hell" [...] fatal four-way number one contender's ladder match {{for an opportunity}} to challenge Decay for the TNA World Tag Team Championships at Bound for Glory. Matt climbed the ladder and grabbed the contract, following Nero sacrificing himself by jumping off the ladder and onto Trevor Lee.|$|R
50|$|On December 3, it was {{reported}} that The Young Bucks had signed a new two-year contract, which covers both ROH and New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). On March 4, 2017, The Young Bucks lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to The Hardys (<b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero). On April 1 at Supercard of Honor XI, The Young Bucks regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from The Hardys in a ladder match.|$|R

5|$|Although {{some debate}} remains {{whether it was}} six or seven championships held at one time, the {{contracts}} of <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> (Hardy) and Brother Nero (Jeff Hardy) expired with TNA Wrestling on February 27, 2017 at midnight after negotiations were stalled by the company. Having previously filmed television weeks in advance, in storylines Matt and Jeff remained the TNA Tag Team Champions as their contracts expired. They offered to drop the titles the following week on {{the next set of}} television tapings but TNA's new parent company, Anthem, declined.|$|R

5000|$|On the 27 October {{episode of}} Impact Wrestling, Spud {{took part in}} the Team X Gold match teaming with Decay against DJ Z, Braxton Sutter and Mandrews ("Go for Broke"), in a losing effort. On the 3 November episode of Impact Wrestling, Spud and Decay lost a {{three-way}} match against Go for Broke and The Helms Dynasty. They were defeated once again in a three-way tag team match against Go for Broke and The Helms Dynasty, this time in an elimination match. At [...] "Total Nonstop Deletion", Spud was defeated by <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> Hardy's son King Maxel. The same night, he participated at the Tag Team Apocalypto, teaming with Swoggle, but was attacked by him during the match, losing the match.|$|R
5000|$|Ruutu {{played his}} first full season with the Canucks in 2001-02 and earned himself a {{reputation}} as one of the league's most effective [...] "pests" [...] or [...] "agitators". During the 2004-05 NHL lockout, Ruutu played once more for HIFK and set a SM-liiga record for penalty minutes in a single season with 215 (since <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Nickerson).|$|R
50|$|The {{main event}} saw Edge defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Jeff Hardy. The match kept a quick pace between the two, {{trying to gain}} the upper hand {{with a number of}} strikes and takedowns, as well as Hardy {{executing}} a Twist of Fate. The action would spill onto the floor, leading to both men positioned at the barricade surrounding the ring area. Hardy tried to run across it, and Edge stopped him with a spear through the barricade. Hardy set up the steel steps, ran up the steps and performed a heel kick on Edge, leading to both competitors crashing into the crowd over the barricade. Once Edge managed to return to the ring, Matt Hardy, came through the crowd and attacked Hardy with his cast (Jeff had <b>broken</b> <b>Matt's</b> hand in their previous encounter). At the end of the match, Edge delivered an Edgecution off the top rope, pinning Hardy to retain the title.|$|R
50|$|Her unpredictably willful but passionate rant {{instantly}} lands her on <b>Matt's</b> bad <b>side,</b> {{although he}} eventually has a redemptive change of heart, then seeks to charm Sue into becoming his girlfriend. Other complications arise shortly thereafter, putting their loving relationship in jeopardy, which {{all too often}} tends to involve Matt's inability to control his own quick and fiery temper.|$|R
40|$|The surface {{topography}} of a bulk material {{is not only}} responsible for its optical appearance; {{it also has a}} strong influence on its physical properties like tensile strength or corrosion resistance. The topography develops during deformation due to extrinsic effects like tool-contact or due to intrinsic effects like microstructure related inhomogeneous deformation. The object of this investigation is {{to examine the relationship between}} microstructure and surface roughness during compressive and tensile deformation. The formation of the matt surface during foil rolling was taken as an example for the compressive deformation and the one-dimensional tensile test was taken as an example for the tensile deformation. The potential applicability of the crystal-plasticity finite element method was tested with regard to microstructure dependent roughness evolution. The microstructure was characterized with EBSD (electron backscattering diffraction) in a high resolution SEM with a field emission gun. The topography was measured using a white light confocal microscope. A small tensile test frame was constructed for use with the confocal microscope thus allowing in-situ surface measurements during tensile testing. The local strain distribution was calculated from the topographic dataset with a photogravimetric method. The foil rolling experiments showed an exponential relation between the roughness of the <b>matt</b> <b>side</b> and the strain. Neither the rolling velocity nor the viscosity of the rolling lubricant had a direct effect on the evolution of the <b>matt</b> <b>side.</b> An increase of the rolling force and a decrease of the viscosity of the separating lubricant reduced the roughness of the <b>matt</b> <b>side</b> because of the shift to from hydrodynamic lubrication to mixed lubrication. The homogenisation procedure after continuous casting and the modification of the chemical composition of the alloy has a strong influence on the roughness. A fine globular grain or subgrain structure has a positive effect. Such a microstructure evolves if a high volume fraction of fine particles is present. The type and fraction of precipitates was simulated with the Calphad-method. The influence of the iron, silicon, manganese and magnesium content on the roughening behaviour was investigated. Two different mechanisms were found for the roughness evolution during tensile testing. As a result of the grain structure a valley and hill structure was formed parallel to the tensile direction. In agreement with earlier publications a linear relation between roughness and strain was found. The second mechanism is based on the formation of shear bands. This leads to a surface texture, which is transverse to the tensile direction and shows an exponential relation to the strain. A method based on the classification of the localized necking of a tensile specimen was developed for the estimation of the roughening tendency of a material. With this method it is possible to make a first approximation of the roughening behaviour of an alloy during rolling without cost intensive rolling experiments. This could be advantageously used during alloy development. With a simple model the possibilities of the implementation of a crystal plasticity material law into the finite element simulation were demonstrated. The model can be used for the simulation of the orange peel effect...|$|R

5000|$|In September 2006, Patent Pending, {{the debut}} album by <b>Matt</b> Skiba's <b>side</b> project Heavens was released. The band {{consisted}} of Skiba on guitar and vocals, and Josiah Steinbrick (of hardcore punk outfit F-Minus) on bass. On the album, the duo {{were joined by}} The Mars Volta's Isaiah [...] "Ikey" [...] Owens on organ and Matthew Compton on drums and percussion. Skiba was playing with Heavens during a short tour {{in the fall of}} 2006.|$|R
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{following}} this, the bad blood {{between the two}} sides intensified, {{so much so that the}} new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay–per–view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to his recording career, Dulli has also appeared {{in a number of}} films, including the independent short Salt Shaker, Ted Demme's Monument Ave. and Beautiful Girls (together with The Afghan Whigs), as well as <b>Matt</b> Bissonnette's Passenger <b>Side.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Three {{tracks were}} {{featured}} on the compilation album My Other Band, Vol. 1 on Mono vs Stereo records in 2006, from <b>Matt</b> Thiessen's <b>side</b> project Matthew Thiessen and the Earthquakes, Dave Douglas' side project Agnes, and Ethan Luck's My Red Hot Nightmare project. Relient K {{was part of a}} fundraiser called [...] "Habitat for Humanity" [...] with other Christian bands. Matt Thiessen and Jon Foreman (Switchfoot's lead singer and guitarist) wrote a song called [...] "Rebuild" [...] to help raise even more money.|$|R
500|$|Afterwards, Omega took a hiatus from NJPW to [...] "reassess [...] future". Upon {{his return}} on February 26, a new storyline {{involving}} tension between Omega and Cole was started, with The Young Bucks {{caught in the}} middle. On February 11, Frankie Kazarian joined Bullet Club, turning on longtime tag team partner Christopher Daniels at a taping of Ring of Honor Wrestling. On March 4, The Young Bucks lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to The Hardys (<b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero). On March 10 at ROH's 15th Anniversary Show, Kazarian turned on Adam Cole and Bullet Club, revealing his tenure was only a ruse to help Christopher Daniels become the new ROH World Champion. The following day, Cole, disappointed with The Young Bucks for not having his back, tried to fire them from Bullet Club, but the two responded by stating {{that he could not}} fire them as Omega, not Cole, was the leader of the stable. Despite the dissension among members of the Superkliq, Cole remained a member of Bullet Club. On April 1 at Supercard of Honor XI, The Young Bucks regained the ROH World Tag Team Championship from The Hardys in a ladder match. On May 12, during the third night of the NJPW and ROH co-produced War of the Worlds tour, Omega fired Cole from Bullet Club and gave his spot in the stable to ROH World Television Champion Marty Scurll. Two days later, on the final night of the tour, Scurll lost the ROH World Television Championship to Kushida, following a distraction from Cole.|$|R
25|$|In {{the top of}} the 12th {{inning of}} Game 4 of the 2012 American League Division Series, Chamberlain was struck on the elbow by a <b>broken</b> bat by <b>Matt</b> Wieters of the Orioles and left the game. Despite his injury, the Yankees won the series over Baltimore in five games, but were swept in the 2012 American League Championship Series by the Detroit Tigers.|$|R
50|$|Following a 1-5-1 start, coach Tom Fears {{was fired}} by owner John W. Mecom Jr. Fears was {{replaced}} by J.D. Roberts, whose first game was a 19-17 victory over the Detroit Lions in which Tom Dempsey set an NFL record with a 63-yard field goal on the final play, breaking the old record held by Bert Rechichar of the Baltimore Colts by seven yards. Dempsey's record stood alone until it was tied by Jason Elam of the Denver Broncos in 1998 and equaled by Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland Raiders in 2011 and David Akers of the San Francisco 49ers in 2012. The record was <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Prater of the Denver Broncos in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|Dickey {{retired from}} {{professional}} football {{prior to the}} 1986 season, after he was waived late in training camp. He holds Packers records for highest completion percentage in a game {{with a minimum of}} 20 attempts (19-21, 90.48%, versus New Orleans on December 13, 1981). [...] His record for most passing yards in a 1980 game (418 versus Tampa Bay on October 12) was <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Flynn on Jan. 1, 2012 with 480 yards. (Aaron Rodgers had 422 in a playoff game against the Arizona Cardinals); and highest average gain in a season (9.21 yards per attempt in 1983). The latter is an NFL single-season record for quarterbacks with 400 or more attempts.|$|R
50|$|On September 12, 2011, as a rainy {{first half}} against the Denver Broncos {{came to a}} close, Janikowski made a 63-yard field goal and tied the NFL record set by Tom Dempsey in 1970 and {{previously}} tied by Jason Elam (1998) and afterwards by David Akers (2012), but which has subsequently been <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Prater of the Denver Broncos. On November 27, 2011, {{in a game against}} the Chicago Bears, Janikowski made field goals of 40, 47, 42, 19, 37, and 44 yards to break the team record of most field goals in a single game he shared with Jeff Jaeger. Janikowski attempted a record breaking 65-yard field goal on December 18, 2011, against the Detroit Lions, but Ndamukong Suh blocked it to end the game.|$|R
500|$|On March 4, 2017, in {{the same}} week that both Matt and Jeff were {{released}} from TNA, The Hardys defeated The Young Bucks in an impromptu match at ROH's 2017 installment of the company's Manhattan Mayhem show series to become the new ROH World Tag Team Champions {{for the first time}} (which makes Matt the first professional wrestler in history to have held WWE's World Tag Team Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship, WCW Tag Team Championship, TNA World Tag Team Championship and ROH World Tag Team Championship, followed by Jeff when they won WWE's Raw Tag Team Championship). Moments after winning the titles, Hardy announced in a post-match promo that both he and Brother Nero (Jeff) had signed [...] "the biggest ROH contracts in (the company's) history". It was later confirmed that the contracts were short-term, only for the [...] "immediate future". On March 10, The Hardys successfully defended the ROH World Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} ROH's 15th Anniversary pay-per-view show against The Young Bucks and Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) in a three-way Las Vegas tag team street fight match. Prior to the event, the Hardys had been sent a legal threat by Impact Wrestling regarding the use of the <b>Broken</b> <b>Matt</b> and Brother Nero gimmicks. The following night on March 11, The Hardys (not billed but using the Broken gimmicks anyway) once again retained the titles, this time against The Briscoes at a set of Ring of Honor Wrestling television tapings. The Hardys lost the titles back to The Young Bucks in a ladder match on April 1 at ROH's Supercard of Honor XI pay-per-view show, which would be the final ROH appearances for both Hardys in this tenure with the promotion.|$|R
50|$|He {{departed}} for Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1999, {{brought about by}} financial problems at the County Ground. He signed for Wolves {{at a cost of}} £1 million. Unfortunately his Wolves career suffered an early blow when his leg was <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Carbon during only his third game, against local rivals West Bromwich Albion. He recovered from his broken leg and knee and groin injuries to resume his Molineux career in the autumn of 2000 and soon made himself a popular figure with the Molineux faithful - especially after his two-goal return in the home victory over West Bromwich Albion. Injuries again scotched hopes for a better 2001/02. Ndah made just one start that term, although he did score the winner in a 2-1 home win over Rotherham United in February 2002.|$|R
50|$|In the 2002 season, he {{converted}} 26 of 36 field-goal attempts (.722) and 42 of 43 (.977) extra-point {{attempts to}} account for a team-leading 120 points, marking his 10th consecutive season with 100 or more points. Also in 2002, he tied his career-high with five field goals (on five attempts) vs. the Miami Dolphins, including a 55-yard kick. He also tied a career-high by scoring 16 points in the contest, he made all three field-goal attempts at Kansas City, including the game-winner from 25 yards in overtime. It was his 11th career game-winning or game-saving field goal and his third in an overtime situation, Elam, {{who at the time}} owned the NFL record for consecutive extra points (371, later <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Stover), saw the streak end against Indianapolis Colts.|$|R
5000|$|After {{spending}} a {{year out of}} football, he {{signed as a free}} agent with the Seattle Seahawks in 1976. Zorn is closely associated with his favorite passing target, Hall of Fame wide receiver Steve Largent. Largent was the first Seahawk inducted into the team's [...] "Ring of Honor" [...] (1989), and Zorn was second (1991). [...] Zorn was named AFC Offensive Rookie of the Year by the National Football League Players Association following the team's inaugural 1976 season. [...] He was also the Seahawks' team MVP, throwing for 12 touchdowns and rushing for four touchdowns. His three consecutive 3,000-yard seasons were tops in team history, since <b>broken</b> by <b>Matt</b> Hasselbeck in 2005, and he was the first Seattle quarterback to record back-to-back 300-plus yard games—a feat he accomplished twice. [...] He was succeeded by Dave Krieg midway through the 1983 season, the year the Seahawks first made the NFL playoffs. Zorn stayed with the team as a second-string quarterback until the end of the 1984 season.|$|R
