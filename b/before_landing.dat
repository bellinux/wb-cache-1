They may lock talons and tumble downwards in a ritualised version of grappling, but release just <b>before</b> <b>landing.</b> All courtship displays are accompanied by constant calling.|$|E

5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis <b>before</b> <b>landing.</b> Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also jump out of the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

5|$|Cowes Castle {{was used}} to house {{important}} visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison; {{the captain of the}} castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels. When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was initially held for the King by its captain, Humphrey Turney.

5|$|Fall Out Boy is an American {{rock band}} formed in Wilmette, Illinois, {{a suburb of}} Chicago, in 2001. The band {{consists}} of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers <b>before</b> <b>landing</b> Hurley and recording the group's debut album, Take This to Your Grave (2003).
