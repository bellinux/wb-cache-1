[...] For the characterization and design for Jim Hawkins, John Ripa cited James Dean as an important reference because [...] "there was a whole attitude, a posture" [...] wherein [...] "you felt the pain and the youthful innocence", and he also cited the film Braveheart because [...] "there are a lot of close-ups on characters...who are going through thought processes, just using their eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|Formby was {{the first}} comic to use a delayed {{entrance}} as a joke to make the audience laugh before he arrived: his orchestra played his entrance music, and then he failed to appear on stage. His act included songs, described by Smart and Bothway Howard as [...] "characteristically simple, some with tunes derived from Methodist hymns, and with catchy choruses", and he would chat to the orchestra conductor and front rows, punctuating his stage patter—delivered in a deadpan style—with his cough. He used his health—particularly the coughing—as part of his act, and would {{say that he was}} [...] "Coughin' well tonight!" [...] He also created the phrase [...] "It's not the cough that carries you off – it's the coffin they carries you off in!" [...] One of Formby's nicknames, [...] "The Wigan Nightingale" [...] was coined <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> used his bronchial cough in his act.|$|E
500|$|During the American Civil War, Gray was a steadfast {{supporter}} of the North and the Republican Party. About February 1861two months before the war started, Gray lost part of his left thumb, just above {{the base of the}} nail, in an accident in the garden. Despite now being 50 years old, he regretted that this accident ended his [...] "fighting days". After hostilities began, he joined a company that guarded the Massachusetts State Arsenal in Cambridge. He also bought war bonds, was surprised more people did not do likewise, and supported a 5%tax to support the war. Gray regretted not having children because he had [...] "no son to send to the war". Gray considered Abraham Lincoln as a second George Washington <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> managed to preserve the Union during the war. He also predicted that the fate of slavery depended upon the length and bitterness of the war, and the longer it lasted the more disastrous it would be for the South. As a corollary, he felt that if the South had given up early in the war, they would have had a chance of preserving slavery longer. Regarding his botanical endeavors, the war sundered his supply of information and specimens from the South. Even the Southern botanists who supported the North, such as Alvan Wentworth Chapman and Thomas Minott Peters, were soon forced to cease communications with Gray. It was during the war that Gray first began to think of retiring from his professorial duties so he could concentrate on completing Flora of North America.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and he still is, obviously, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did.

He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating.

2500|$|Some novelists become intimately {{linked with}} a {{particular}} place or geographic region and therefore receive a place-based identity. In {{his discussion of the}} history of the association of particular novelists with place in British literature, critic D. C. D. Pocock, described the sense of place not developing in that canon until a century after the novel form first solidified at the beginning of the 19th century. Often such British regional literature captures the social and local [...] character of a particular region in Britain, focussing on specific features, such as dialect, customs, history, and landscape (also called local colour): [...] "Such a locale is likely to be rural and/or provincial." [...] Thomas Hardy's (1840-1928) novels can be described as regional <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> makes use of these elements in relation to a part of the West of England, that he names Wessex. Other British writers that have been characterized as regional novelists, are the Brontë sisters, and writers like Mary Webb (1881-1927), Margiad Evans (1909–58) and Geraint Goodwin (1903–42), who are associate with the Welsh border region. George Eliot (1801–86) on the other hand is particularly associated with the rural English Midlands, whereas Arnold Bennett (1867–1931) is the novelist of the Potteries in Staffordshire, or the [...] "Five Towns", (actually six) that now make-up Stoke-on-Trent. Similarly, novelist and poet Walter Scott's (1771-1832) contribution in creating a unified identity for Scotland and were some of the most popular in all of Europe during the subsequent century. Scott's novels were influential in recreating a Scottish identity that the upper-class British society could embrace.|$|E
