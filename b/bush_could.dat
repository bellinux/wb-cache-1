25|$|Justice William Brennan {{stepped down}} from the Supreme Court in 1990. Thomas was one of five {{candidates}} on Bush's shortlist and was the one that Bush was most interested in nominating. Bush's staff made three arguments against nominating Thomas at the time: Thomas had only served eight months as a judge at the time; <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> expect to replace Thurgood Marshall with Thomas in due time; and multiple senior advisors told Bush that they did not feel that Thomas was ready. Bush eventually decided to nominate Judge David Souter of the First Circuit instead, who was easily confirmed.|$|E
500|$|The German V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{demonstrated}} a serious omission in OSRD's portfolio: guided missiles. While the OSRD {{had some success}} developing unguided rockets, it had nothing comparable to the V-1, the V-2 or the Henschel Hs 293 air-to-ship gliding guided bomb. Although the United States trailed the Germans and Japanese in several areas, this represented an entire field {{that had been left}} to the enemy. Bush did not seek the advice of Dr. Robert H. Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.|$|E
2500|$|On May 18, 2009, {{when asked}} by Sean Hannity of Fox News, how George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> have avoided the attacks of September 11, 2001, Ventura answered, [...] "And there it is again, you pay {{attention}} to memos on August 6th that {{tell you exactly what}} bin Laden's gonna do." ...|$|E
50|$|A linear bushing is {{not usually}} pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such {{examples}} include two retaining rings, or a ring that is molded onto the OD of the bushing that matches with a groove in the housing. This is usually a more durable way to retain the bushing, because the forces acting on the <b>bushing</b> <b>could</b> press it out.|$|R

2500|$|Flight logs {{released}} in September 2004 {{in response to}} a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. [...] Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the flight logs in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> have just been practicing landing skills. [...] "It doesn't mean anything to have multiple approaches," [...] Weaver said.|$|E
2500|$|During Clarke's earlier testimony, {{he stated}} that Bill Clinton {{did not have a}} {{comprehensive}} plan on dealing with terrorism. During later testimony, {{he stated that}} President Clinton did have a comprehensive plan on dealing with terrorism. As summarized by the Toledo Blade, [...] "In his August 2002 briefing, Mr. Clarke told reporters (1) that the Clinton administration had no overall plan on al-Qaeda to pass on to the Bush Administration; (2) that just days after his inauguration, Mr. Bush said he wanted a new, more comprehensive anti-terror strategy; (3) that Mr. Bush ordered implementation of anti-terror measures that had been kicking around since 1998, and (4) that before Sept. 11, Mr. Bush had increased fivefold the funding for CIA covert action programs against al-Qaeda. ... It's reasonable enough to argue that Mr. <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> have done more to guard against terror, though it isn't clear what. What is incredible is to argue—as Mr. Clarke did before the 9/11 Commission—that President Clinton was more concerned about al-Qaeda than Mr. Bush was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Federalist No. 70 justifies {{the role that}} the President has played {{in the war on terror}} up to this point. Some scholars contend that President Bush's foreign policy decisions exceeded his presidential powers granted by the Constitution. Further, critics of the Bush Administration argue that any executive, as envisioned by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 70, must act within the limits imposed by other provisions of the United States Constitution [...] and that the concept of the unitary executive does not allow the president to work outside laws passed by Congress, even when they conflict with national security interests. These critics argue that President <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> have asked Congress to amend existing law or retroactively obtain warrants for surveillance and that he violated the constitution when he did not. President Obama has been similarly criticized for operating outside the law, despite statements at the beginning of his presidency which showed a desire to limit the use of signing statements to expand executive power.|$|E
60|$|There was, however, he said, {{a spot on}} {{the outer}} side of the island where a landing could be effected, at a little ravine that ran down to the shore. This was thickly wooded, and some large trees growing at its mouth almost hid it from passing vessels. At other points the shore was steep, but there was so much {{vegetation}} on every ledge where trees or <b>bushes</b> <b>could</b> obtain a foothold, that from the sea {{it would seem that the}} cliffs were not too steep to scale.|$|R
6000|$|... "The Kaffir policemen ahead {{ought to}} have done that work," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "Why, bless you, if there was {{as much as a}} fox lurking among the <b>bushes</b> they <b>could</b> find him." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1971, Republican President Nixon {{appointed}} the then Democrat Connally as Treasury Secretary. Before agreeing {{to take the}} appointment, however, Connally told Nixon that the president must find {{a position in the}} administration for George H. W. Bush, the Republican who had been defeated in November 1970 in a hard-fought U.S. Senate race against Democrat Lloyd M. Bentsen. Connally told Nixon that his taking the Treasury post would embarrass Bush, who had [...] "labored in the vineyards" [...] for Nixon's election as president, while Connally had supported Humphrey. Ben Barnes, then the lieutenant governor and originally a Connally ally, claims in his autobiography that Connally's insistence saved Bush's political career because the then former U.S. representative and twice-defeated Senate candidate relied on appointed offices to build a resume by which to seek the presidency in 1980 and again in 1988. Nixon hence named Bush as ambassador to the United Nations in order to secure Connally's services at Treasury. Barnes also said that he doubted George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> have become president in 2001 had Bush's father not first been given the string of federal appointments during the 1970s to strengthen the family's political viability.|$|E

60|$|Tired as {{the horses}} were, {{there was no}} {{likelihood}} of their straying very far; and Dick simply removed the harness, allowing the animals to roam at will. The wagon served as a camp; and the most arduous task was that of gathering materials with which to make a fire, when nothing larger than a <b>bush</b> <b>could</b> be seen on either hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Hetty. [...] "Still, it can {{be bought}} at the settlement, and no doubt you could find the pack-horses in the <b>bush.</b> You <b>could</b> go down and get it while Tom holds the claim." ...|$|R

60|$|I heard Trip barking, so I ran {{towards the}} pond. The punt {{was at the}} island, where from behind the <b>bushes</b> I <b>could</b> hear George whistling. I called to him, {{and he came to}} the water's edge half dressed.|$|R
6000|$|High over {{hills and}} over dales he fled, [...] As {{if the wind}} him on his wings had borne; [...] Nor bank nor <b>bush</b> <b>could</b> stay him, when he sped [...] His nimble feet, as {{treading}} still on thorn; [...] Grief, and Despite, and Jealousy, and Scorn, [...] Did all the way him follow hard behind; [...] And he himself himself loath'd so forlorn, [...] So shamefully forlorn of womankind, [...] That, as a snake, still lurkèd in his wounded mind.|$|E
60|$|Marston stopped abruptly. He {{wanted to}} go down and turn out the fellow, but doubted if he would be justified, {{although}} he was Wyndham's partner. Somehow it was unthinkable the brute and his comrade should engage in quiet talk. For all that, he did not go, and turning back a few yards stopped again. He must not be a fool, and no doubt the fellow had come to talk about some goods his friends in the <b>bush</b> <b>could</b> supply. Marston did not want the goods, but forced himself to wait.|$|E
60|$|So soundly did the kanakas {{sleep through}} that long hot {{day that they}} did not see the cutter run out through the passage and head south, {{close-hauled}} on the southeast trade. Nor was the cutter ever sighted on that long tack to the shores of Ysabel, and during the tedious head-beat from there to Malaita. He landed at Port Adams with a wealth of rifles and tobacco such as no one man had ever possessed before. But he did not stop there. He had taken a white man's head, and only the <b>bush</b> <b>could</b> shelter him. So back he went to the bush villages, where he shot old Fanfoa and half a dozen of the chief men, and made himself the chief over all the villages. When his father died, Mauki's brother ruled in Port Adams, and joined together, salt-water men and bushmen, the resulting combination was the strongest of the ten score fighting tribes of Malaita.|$|E

Nonetheless, Ginsberg resigned as legal counsel from the Bush Campaign after his position was made public.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly Woot, {{who was in}} the lead, {{looked around}} and found that all his comrades had mysteriously disappeared. But where could they have gone to? The broad plain was all about him and there were neither trees nor <b>bushes</b> that <b>could</b> hide even a rabbit, nor any hole for one to fall into. Yet there he stood, alone.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the dear Old Briar-patch they found that Peter was not outside.

5000|$|Finally on {{the subject}} of abortion, Workman stated that <b>Bush</b> <b>could</b> harm the electoral future of the GOP if he were to select a running mate who {{supports}} abortion rights. It would be [...] "insulting to the base" [...] of the Republican Party, Workman said.|$|E
