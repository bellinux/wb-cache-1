She had watched her brother Stephen die as she was swallowed by mounds of earth. The raid had made her weak and incapable of dealing with trauma later in her life.|$|E

After she recovered she went to work at Point McLeay Mission.|$|E

60|$|These are surprizing scenes; but I beg {{leave to}} affirm, that the solemn {{operations}} of nature are subjects of contemplation, not of ridicule. Therefore I make it my earnest {{request to the}} merry fellows, and giggling girls about town, {{that they would not}} put themselves in a high twitter, when they go to visit a general lying-in of his first child; his officers serving as midwives, nurses and rockers dispensing caudle; or if they behold the reverend prelates dressing the heads and airing the linnen at court, I beg they will remember that these offices must be fill'd with people of the greatest regularity, and best characters. For the same reason, I am sorry that a certain prelate, who notwithstanding his confinement (in December 1723), still preserves his healthy, chearful countenance, cannot come in time to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> at court.|$|E
6000|$|While these {{sights and}} sounds were going on without, curious scenes were passing within, and I was {{learning}} {{that one of the}} best methods of fitting oneself to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>nurse</b> in a hospital, is to be a patient there; for then only can one wholly realize what the men suffer and sigh for; how acts of kindness touch and win; how much or little we are to those about us; {{and for the first time}} really see that in coming there we have taken our lives in our hands, and may have to pay dearly for a brief experience. Every one was very kind; the attendants of my ward often came up to report progress, to fill my wood box, or bring messages and presents from my boys. The nurses took many steps with those tired feet of theirs, and several came each evening, to chat over my fire and make things cozy for the night. The doctors paid daily visits, tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was within, left doses without names, and went away, leaving me as ignorant, and much more uncomfortable than when they came. Hours began to get confused; people looked odd; queer faces haunted the room, and the nights were one long fight with weariness and pain. Letters from home grew anxious; the doctors lifted their eyebrows, and nodded ominously; friends said [...] "Don't stay," [...] and an internal rebellion seconded the advice; but the three months were not out, and the idea of giving up so soon was proclaiming a defeat before I was fairly routed; so to all [...] "Don't stays" [...] I opposed [...] "I wills," [...] till, one fine morning, a gray-headed gentleman rose like a welcome ghost on my hearth; and, at the sight of him, my resolution melted away, my heart turned traitor to my boys, and, when he said, [...] "Come home," [...] I answered, [...] "Yes, father;" [...] and so ended my career as an army nurse.|$|E
