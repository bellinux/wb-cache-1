5|$|Due to Gourcuff's {{impressive}} season, his parent club {{announced that}} it would <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> player returning to Milan for the 2009–10 season. However, the club's plans were put on halt after learning of Bordeaux's intent to meet Gourcuff's buy-out clause of €15million included in the loan deal. Despite general manager Adriano Galliani and new manager Leonardo's efforts to persuade Gourcuff to return, on 28 May, it was announced that Bordeaux had signed Gourcuff permanently from Milan with Gourcuff agreeing to a four-year deal. The transfer fee was €13.6 million.|$|E
5|$|Tyntesfield was {{purchased}} by the National Trust in June 2002, after a fundraising campaign to prevent it being sold to private interests and ensure it would <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The house was opened to visitors {{for the first time}} just 10 weeks after the acquisition, and as more rooms are restored they are added to the tour.|$|E

50|$|Chudleigh Cavern - <b>The</b> first passage <b>is</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The cave {{continues}} beyond, and <b>is</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> experienced caver. The entrance <b>is</b> in an <b>open</b> garden, {{which contains}} several other caves, parts {{of some of}} which <b>are</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public.

5|$|In the church's teaching, sexual {{activity}} is reserved to married couples, whether in a sacramental marriage among Christians, or {{in a natural}} marriage where one or both spouses are unbaptised. Even in romantic relationships, particularly engagement to marriage, partners are called to practise continence, {{in order to test}} mutual respect and fidelity. Chastity in marriage requires in particular conjugal fidelity and protecting the fecundity of marriage. The couple must foster trust and honesty as well as spiritual and physical intimacy. Sexual activity must always <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> possibility of life; the church calls this the procreative significance. It must likewise always bring a couple together in love; the church calls this the unitive significance.|$|E
5|$|The complex {{was partly}} {{demolished}} {{just after the}} war on Churchill's direct orders (and to the great annoyance of the French, who were not consulted), as it was still seen {{as a threat to}} the United Kingdom. It was later reopened by private owners, first in 1969 to serve as a mushroom farm and subsequently as a museum in 1984. A nature conservation organisation acquired the Fortress of Mimoyecques in 2010 and La Coupole, a former V-2 rocket base turned museum near Saint-Omer, took over its management. It continues to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public as a vast underground museum complex.|$|E
5|$|After Sulphur Dell was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur Dell was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{public for}} tours since 1959. It <b>is</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public daily except Tuesdays from late April through October. An {{entrance}} fee is charged.|$|R

25|$|Youngen {{earned her}} {{doctorate}} {{degree from the}} Ohio State University in 1971 while maintaining a leadership role on campus.

25|$|As they {{developed}} their philosophy, {{they believed that}} Surrealism would advocate the idea that ordinary and depictive expressions are vital and important, but that the sense of their arrangement must <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full range of imagination according to the Hegelian Dialectic. They also looked to the Marxist dialectic {{and the work of}} such theorists as Walter Benjamin and Herbert Marcuse.|$|E

25|$|In 1839 Hosking {{was chosen}} by the newly formed Abney Park Cemetery Company to design the {{buildings}} {{and contribute to the}} layout of a landscaped park cemetery to serve the metropolis of London in which all parts would <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> burial of anyone regardless of belief or denomination. The aim of the promoters of Abney Park Cemetery was to open the first wholly non-denominational garden cemetery in Europe.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, CDI {{demolished}} approximately 1,400 stalls {{in an area}} {{marked for}} non-racing commercial re-development. In July 2015, Gulfstream Park was informed that the Calder grandstand - owned by CDI - will not <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public for the 2015 Gulfstream Park West meet except for racing officials, and that the seven-story structure will be demolished once the meet has concluded.

25|$|The Exhibition Building was {{designed}} by Page\Park Architects and constructed in 1998-2001 on newly purchased land. It is designed to reflect its links {{with the world of}} agricultural and nature, with large sliding entrance doors giving access to a wood-clad barn-like building. The other outer walls appear to be 'white-washed' and the lower portion of almost the whole of one side appears to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground outside, echoing the design of typical barns, cart sheds, etc.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of local {{government}} reorganisation in the 1960s Twickenham {{became part of the}} London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, but the town hall remains at York House and the gardens continue to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. The statues have gone through at least one major restoration to remove graffiti and the wartime grey cement, and reverse the effects of vandalism by replacing lost fingers, pearls and even a hoof. In 1983 the statues were protected with a Grade II listing by English Heritage.|$|E
25|$|La communauté de communes a misé on the {{creation}} of orienteering courses, this being facilitated by that the wood is not a hunting ground: it can therefore <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public all year round. The comité de l’Yonne de course d’orientation (comity in the Yonne departement for the French Orienteering Federation) gave its expert advice on tracing the tracks and installing 25 control points and an information panel. The tracks can extend on nearby private land for one-off events, after obtaining permission from the owners.|$|E
25|$|To {{create this}} I–Thou {{relationship}} with God, {{a person has}} to <b>be</b> <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of such a relationship, but not actively pursue it. The pursuit of such a relation creates qualities associated with It‑ness, and so would prevent an I‑You relation, limiting it to I‑It. Buber claims {{that if we are}} open to the I–Thou, God eventually comes to us in response to our welcome. Also, because the God Buber describes is completely devoid of qualities, this I–Thou relationship lasts as long as the individual wills it. When the individual finally returns to the I‑It way of relating, this acts as a barrier to deeper relationship and community.|$|E
