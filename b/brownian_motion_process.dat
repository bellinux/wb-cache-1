5|$|After World War II {{the study}} of {{probability}} theory and stochastic processes gained more attention from mathematicians, with signification contributions made {{in many areas of}} probability and mathematics as well as the creation of new areas. Starting in the 1940s, Kiyosi Itô published papers developing the field of stochastic calculus, which involves stochastic integrals and stochastic differential equations based on the Wiener or <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are two popular generalizations of a {{martingale}} {{that also}} include cases {{when the current}} observation Xn is not necessarily equal to the future conditional expectation E but instead an upper or lower bound on the conditional expectation. These definitions reflect a relationship between martingale theory and potential theory, which {{is the study of}} harmonic functions. Just as a continuous-time martingale satisfies E−Xs=0∀s≤t, a harmonic function f satisfies the partial differential equation Δf=0 where Δ is the Laplacian operator. Given a <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process</b> Wt and a harmonic function f, the resulting process f(Wt) is also a martingale.|$|E

500|$|Although Khinchin gave {{mathematical}} {{definitions of}} stochastic {{processes in the}} 1930s, [...] specific stochastic processes had already been discovered in different settings, such as the <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process</b> and the Poisson process.

500|$|The [...] Wiener {{process is}} a {{stochastic}} process with stationary and independent increments that are normally distributed based {{on the size of}} the increments. The Wiener process is named after Norbert Wiener, who proved its mathematical existence, but the {{process is a}}lso called the <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process</b> or just Brownian motion due to its historical connection as a model for Brownian movement in liquids.|$|E
500|$|Applications and {{the study}} of {{phenomena}} have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes. Examples of such stochastic processes include the Wiener process or <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process,</b> used by Louis Bachelier to study price changes on the Paris Bourse, and the Poisson process, used by A. K. Erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time.

500|$|The Wiener {{process or}} <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process</b> has {{its origins in}} {{different}} fields including statistics, finance and physics. In 1880, [...] Thorvald Thiele {{wrote a paper on}} the method of least squares, where he used the process to study the errors of a model in time-series analysis. The work is now considered as an early discovery of the statistical method known as Kalman filtering, but the work was largely overlooked. It is thought that the ideas in Thiele's paper were too advanced to have been understood by the broader mathematical and statistical community at the time.|$|E
500|$|Playing {{a central}} role in the theory of probability, the Wiener process is often {{considered}} the most important and studied stochastic process, [...] with connections to other stochastic processes. Its index set and state space are the non-negative numbers and real numbers, respectively, so it has both continuous index set and states space. [...] But the process can be defined more generally so its state space can be -dimensional Euclidean space. If the mean of any increment is zero, then the resulting [...] Wiener or <b>Brownian</b> <b>motion</b> <b>process</b> is said to have zero drift. If the mean of the increment for any two points in time is equal to the time difference [...] multiplied by some constant , which is a real number, then the resulting stochastic process is said to have drift [...]|$|E
