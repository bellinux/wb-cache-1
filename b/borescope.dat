25|$|Optical fiber is {{also used}} in imaging optics. A {{coherent}} bundle of fibers is used, sometimes along with lenses, for a long, thin imaging device called an endoscope, {{which is used to}} view objects through a small hole. Medical endoscopes are used for minimally invasive exploratory or surgical procedures. Industrial endoscopes (see fiberscope or <b>borescope)</b> are used for inspecting anything hard to reach, such as jet engine interiors. Many microscopes use fiber-optic light sources to provide intense illumination of samples being studied.|$|E
25|$|On September 24, 2005, the {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at the}} Kennedy Space Center on board a C-17 Globemaster III for launch preparations. The launch of New Horizons was originally scheduled for January 11, 2006, but was initially delayed until January 17, 2006 to allow for <b>borescope</b> inspections of the Atlas V's kerosene tank. Further delays related to low cloud ceiling conditions downrange, and high winds and technical difficulties—unrelated to the rocket itself—prevented launch for a further two days. Although there were backup launch opportunities in February 2006 and February 2007, only the first twenty-three days of the 2006 window permitted the Jupiter flyby. Any launch outside that period would have forced {{the spacecraft}} to fly a slower trajectory directly to Pluto, delaying its encounter by 2–4 years. The probe finally lifted off from Pad 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, directly south of Space Shuttle Launch Complex 39, at 19:00UTC on January 19, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|The {{water hammer}} not only caused extreme {{physical}} damage and {{distortion of the}} reactor vessel, it also caused the shield plugs of the vessel to be ejected, one of which impaled Legg. The most surprising and unforeseen evidences of the steam explosion and water hammer were the impressions made on the ceiling above the reactor vessel when it jumped [...] in the air before settling back into its prior location. The post-incident analysis also concluded that the reactor vessel was dry, {{since most of the}} water and steam had been either ejected immediately or evaporated due to the heat inside the reactor.

50|$|From the start, rigid {{endoscopes}} {{were used}} for direct viewing, photography, video and film in environmental simulation and for interior and exterior shots of models. Endoscopes used for industrial applications, called <b>borescopes,</b> were basically {{the same as those}} used in architecture. Specially developed <b>borescopes</b> were used temporarily in model visualization. Video and film needed strong light and lamps and spotlights with high wattages were required. In professional photo studios, powerful flash units were used. Light emitted from optical fiber systems, which was used in the medicine, was seldom used for architectural models.|$|R

50|$|Criteria for {{selecting}} a <b>borescope</b> are usually image clarity and access. For similar-quality instruments, the largest rigid <b>borescope</b> that will fit the hole gives the best image. Optical systems in rigid borescopes {{can be of}} 3 basic types: Harold Hopkins rod lenses, achromatic doublets and gradient index rod lenses. For large diameter borescopes (over 12mm), the achromatic doublet relays work quite well, but as {{the diameter of the}} <b>borescope</b> tube gets smaller the Hopkins rod lens and gradient index rod lens designs provide superior images. For very small rigid borescopes (under 3mm), the gradient index lens relays are better.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible}} Videoscope or Video <b>Borescope</b> is {{an advanced}} type of <b>borescope</b> that houses {{a very small}} CCD chip embedded into {{the tip of the}} scope. The video image is relayed from the distal tip and focusable lens assembly back to the display via internal wiring. This is unlike a traditional <b>borescope</b> and fiberscope. Borescopes use hard optical relay components to transfer the image from the tip to an eyepiece and Fiberscopes use coherent image fiberoptics to relay the image to one's eye through an eyepiece. The image quality of a videoscope is superior to a fiberscope and could be compared to that of a high-end Video Camcorder.|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is a Department of Energy Facility {{designed}} to vitrify highly radioactive waste. An extensive materials evaluation {{program has been}} completed on key components in the DWPF after twelve months of operation using nonradioactive simulated wastes. Results of the visual inspections of the feed preparation system indicate that the system components, which were fabricated from Hastelloy C- 276, should achieve their design lives. Significant erosion was observed on agitator blades that process glass frit slurries; however, design modifications should mitigate the erosion. Visual inspections of the DWPF melter top head and off gas components, which were fabricated from Inconel 690, indicated that varying degrees of degradation occurred.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{designed}} to have better performance than the latest Atar engines but simpler and less costly than the SNECMA TF 306 turbofan.

The engine has a modular construction, first introduced on the Napier Eland turboprop and then later {{in a big way}} with the Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine. Modular construction allows sub-assemblies or modules to be changed without the need for full power testing of the engine after replacement.Modules are changed “on condition” by monitoring deteriorating trends in performance and mechanical measurements, such as exhaust gas temperature and oil samples, and by visually assessing blade clearances and high temperature distress on internal parts using <b>borescopes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Cavitation erosion on {{propellers}} and rudders {{remains a}} problem in the marine industry. The consequences of failing to detect the risk of erosion damage during the design phase, and early in the service life of a vessel, include reducing the speed of the vessel, unscheduled dry-dockings and repairs or replacement of the propellers or rudders. The associated costs are borne by the builder and owner and may harm their reputations within the industry. Lloyd's Register has developed and tested a unique measurement system, based on acoustic emission techniques, which is capable of detecting the onset of erosion damage on propellers and rudders. The system uses high frequency transducers to quantify the impulsive energy transmitted from imploding cavitation events through the material paths of rudder, propeller and shafting configurations. The acoustic emission signals from such events have been synchronised with visual observations using high speed video equipment and <b>borescopes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Visual {{inspection}} is {{an important}} component of aircraft maintenance. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has cited the failure to identify visually detectable corrosion, cracks, or inclusions as the probable cause of several aviation accidents 1, 2, 3. Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) procedures require careful visual inspection of aircraft and aircraft components. NDI/NDT personnel must use their vision, with or without various aids, to make judgments grossly, as well as when inspecting aircraft using highly sophisticated imaging and scanning devices (<b>borescopes,</b> ultrasonic scans, eddy current imaging, X-ray, etc.). Presently, there is no existing national policy to ensure that persons performing aircraft maintenance and inspection tasks meet a specific vision requirement. The FAA’s Production and Airworthiness Division (AIR- 200) recognized a general lack of national policy concerning qualification and certification of NDI/NDT programs and prepared a memorandum 4, dated September 26, 2001, to address the issue.

40|$|Abstract: Assuring the {{integrity}} of high-energy rotating parts in aircraft engines is of utmost importance to manufacturers and end users. Because of their complex shapes and unique material properties, some titanium components are quite difficult to inspect using conventional NDE methods(1). Features such as small diameter, high length-to-diameter (L/D) bores, for example, are particularly difficult to inspect for machining-induced flaws such as microstructural anomalies, inclusions, smearing and cracks. However, flaws of this type can cause a severe reduction of fatigue life, particularly when occurring on highly stressed aircraft engine parts. Visual inspection methods rely on the operator’s ability to clearly see sometimes very subtle changes in surface color or reflectivity. Mirrors, <b>borescopes</b> and other optical devices are often used to inspect difficult-to-access surfaces, but they can produce distorted or otherwise inadequate images. In addition, a human observer may miss positive indications {{for a number of}} reasons, such as awkward viewing angles, poor contrast, inattentiveness or fatigue. A study was conducted for MANHIRP to investigate the feasibility of employing automated laser-based NDE methods to improve the process by which safety-critical aircraft engine components are inspected. The study demonstrated that by employing state-of-the-art laser-based ND...|$|R
40|$|The Olympus Optical Company of Japan {{was formed}} in 1919, with the {{introduction}} of the first generation single lens reflects camera, and soon after with the first microscope. Since that time, the organisation has developed and is now split into three main divisions: manufacturing and supplying cameras, microscopes and endoscopes. Other smaller specialist divisions exist suppling such products as dictaphones. Perhaps, rather surprisingly, the endoscope division is the largest part of the organisation. Through a world-wide organisation of four main business centers, Olympus Industrial, the name given to the industrial endoscope division, provides service and support to its customers. Each of the main business centers operates through agents and distributors. There are many different industries which gain the benefits of saved time and money provided by using endoscopes. To meet the needs of so many varied industries, {{there is a need to}} have a wide range of equipment. This includes light sources, to provide illumination, rigid <b>borescopes,</b> flexible fiberscopes, if views around corners are needed, and the new technology videoscopes.

40|$|USA-SRB Element is {{responsible}} for the assembly and refurbishment of the non-motor components of the SRB as part of Space Shuttle. Thrust Vector Control (TVC) frames structurally support components of the TVC system located in the aft skirt of the SRB (Solid Rocket Booster). TVC frames are exposed to the seacoast environment after refurbishment and, also, to seawater immersion after splashdown, and during tow-back to CCAFS-Hangar AF refurbishment facilities. During refurbishment operations it was found that numerous TVC frames were experiencing internal corrosion and coating failures, both from salt air and seawater intrusions. Inspectors using <b>borescopes</b> would visually examine the internal cavities of the complicated aluminum alloy welded tubular structure. It was very difficult for inspectors to examine cavity corners and tubing intersections and particularly. {{to determine the extent of}} the corrosion and coating anomalies. Physical access to TVC frame internal cavities for corrosion removal and coating repair was virtually impossible, and an improved method using a Liquid (water based) Vapor-phase Corrosion Inhibitor (LVCI) for preventing initiation of new corrosion, and mitigating and/or stopping existing corrosion growth was recommended in lieu of hazardous paint solvents and high VOC/solvent based corrosion inhibitors. In addition, the borescopic inspection method used to detect corrosion, and/or coating anomalies had severe limitations because of part geometry, and an improved non-destructive inspection (NDI) method using Neutron Radiography (N-Ray) was also recommended...|$|R
