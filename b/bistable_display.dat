Because of good bistability and very fast switching time, FLC display has potential in field sequential color (FSC) and <b>bistable</b> <b>display</b> applications. However, there are two problems to stop FLC technology popular in display market for these years. First is how to receive good alignment on large size substrate. Second is how to achieve analog gray scales. The purpose of this thesis is trying to solve these two problems for FLC technology in <b>bistable</b> <b>display</b> application. In order to avoid “surface destroy” and static charge accumulation problems, two non-contacting methods are proposed, which are photo-alignment technology and SiO 2 thin films by ion beam deposition method. At the same time, SiOx surface using oblique evaporation method is investigated, in order to compare with characteristics of SiO 2 thin films.

40|$|In this Thesis, {{systems of}} {{confined}} and flexoelectric liquid crystal {{systems have been}} studied using molecular computer simulations. The aim of this work {{was to provide a}} molecular model of a <b>bistable</b> <b>display</b> cell in which switching is induced through the application of directional electric field pulses. In {{the first part of this}} Thesis, the study of confined systems of liquid crystalline particles has been addressed. Computation of the anchoring phase diagrams for three different surface interaction models showed that the hard needle wall and rod-surface potentials induce both planar and homeotropic alignment separated by a bistability region, this being stronger and wider for the rod-surface varant. The results obtained using the rod-sphere surface model, in contrast, showed that tilled surface arrangements can be induced by surface absorption mechanisms. Equivalent studies of hybrid anchored systems showed that a bend director structure can be obtained in a slab with monostable homeotropic anchoring at the top surface and bistable anchoring at the bottom, provided that the slab height is sufficiently large and the top homeotropic anchoring is not too strong. In the second part of the Thesis, the development of models for tapered (pear-shaped) mesogens has been addressed. The first model considered, the truncated Stone expansion model, proved to be unsuccessful in that it did not display liquid crystalline phases. This drawback was then overcome using the alternative parametric hard Gaussian overlap model which was found to display a much richer phase behaviour. With a molecular elongation k = 5, both nematic and interdigitated smectic A sub 2 phases were obtained. In the final part of this Thesis, the knowledge acquired from the two previous studies was united in an attempt to model a <b>bistable</b> <b>display</b> cell. Switching between the hybrid aligned nematic and vertical states of the cell was successfully performed using pear shaped particles with both dielectric gs to an applied field. Also, a parameter window was identified, for values of the electric field, dielectric susceptibility and dipole moment, for which directional switching is achievable between the bistable states...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION We are {{interested}} in displays for electronic paper. These need to have good contrast and to have high resolution, at least 300 dpi. Current displays are unable to achieve this {{and so we are}} looking at new ways of reaching this goal. One of the main difficulties when trying to obtain high resolution is the need to refresh the screen regularly. This can be avoided by using a <b>bistable</b> <b>display,</b> pixels are set and remain in that state until they are changed again. We are focussing on bistable nematic liquid crystal displays. The liquid crystal (LC) is sandwiched between two micro-structured surfaces and the bistability arises from the boundary conditions that these surfaces, and their surface treatments, put on the LC material[1, 2]. We are using modelling to help us to understand what is happening inside the LC cell and also to explore the effect of changing the surface shapes and/or their surface treatments. To do this we need a model, which will find the different possible st...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Active {{matrices}} often {{related with}} high grade display devices, due to {{application of the}} storage elements, typically thin film transistor (TFT). Because of the complex procedures in the manufacturing TFT, investment of the high value manufacturing equipments and clarification plants is necessary, hence increasing the manufacturing cost of the flat panel, and more importantly, causing the pollution of water and air. As the contribution of TFT array merely exists in supplying storage function for the pixels of the display panel, large efforts {{have been made to}} find suitable cells that have bistable effect, so as to substitute the effect of TFT. As the bistable cell is just the storage pixel, one could construct a bistable cell to skip the needs of TFT active matrices. The paper is to introduce currently available <b>bistable</b> <b>display</b> devices in the following field: liquid crystal bistable displays with cholesteric liquid crystals, which is an example to introduce the bistable technology; iMod display devices based on mechanic induced bistable and light interference, which shows the possibility to construct bistable display; and the display based on solid powder movement in air or in vacuum, so called liquid powder displays, which shows how to improve the existed display...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 The {{advances}} in electronics reduced the energy requirements for computation and sensing {{to an extent}} needed to enable RF-powered systems. We demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to build key components of a ubiquitous computing system in a RF-powered way: sensing (input) and output. Those systems were built using software defined passive radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. As an input application, we demonstrate the EEGWISP: battery-free electroencephalogram (EEG), which uses RFID for power and communications. The wearable EEG monitoring systems are the cornerstone of noninvasive brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and many medical applications, but state-of-the-art wearable systems are limited by weight, battery life and size. Since EEGWISP does not need batteries it can be lightweight, miniature and maintenance free for users.

40|$|Abstract. One {{discusses}} phenomenologically the statics {{and dynamics}} of surface anchoring of nematic liquid crystals. In statics, for symmetrical situations, one can induce, under {{the action of}} an external field, a surface breaking with a bifurcation between two opposite orientations of the director. In dynamics, one shows that the surface director relaxation is intrinsically fast, and accompanied by a transient surface shear flow. In thin cells with planar anchorings, filled by cyanobiphenyl materials which orient normal to the plates under a strong electric field, there are now two effects which couple the relaxation of the surface director: a static one, which favors parallel orientation and a uniform cell texture, and a transient dynamical coupling from the surface flow, which forces -twisted texture. With suitable electric signals, one can control the surface bifurcations to give at will {{one of these two}} bistable textures. Results are presented which show that these mechanisms could lead to a new class of surface controlled, fast nematic <b>bistable</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{ultrasound}} imaging is gradually {{moving away from}} conventional videotape stor-age (an analog medium) toward computers with digital acquisition and storage capabil ities. Ad-vantages include reproducibility of studies, ease and speed of retrieval, the ability to digitally manipulate images, {{and the ability to}} transmit images through phone lines. This new technol-ogy will require familiarity with computers and computer terminology. This article provides an introduction to the basic concepts underlying Key words: analog, digital, bit, <b>bistable</b> <b>display,</b> byte, gray scale, pixels. Until recently, ultrasound imaging has relied on the use of television-style monitors to display images and on videotape to store those images. There is now increasing interest in using digital technology to dis-play, store, and transmit images. This article will provide a basic introduction to digital imaging. Analog versus Digital To begin, one must understand the difference be-tween analog and digital. Television and videotape store data in an analog format. Computers store in-formation as digital data. Digital systems use {{what is known as the}} binary system, where all information is stored as a series of either Os or 1 s. The difference between analog and digital is like the difference be-tween an on/off switch and a dimmer switch. The on/off switch (digital) is either on or off, with no in-between value possible. Although limited in its choices, it is highly reproducible. A dimmer switch (analog), on the other hand, has an infinite range of settings, from off to maximum brightness. Although very flexible, it is less reproducible (imagine two people trying to set a dimmer at exactly the same place). The issue of reproducibility is important when comparing analog to digital systems. When one at-tempts to copy a videotape, it is impossible to repro-duce the image exactly. There is always a certain amount of electronic noise introduced into the origi...|$|E

On the other hand, macroscopic properties, such as dynamic and dielectric data of achiral host systems, have been considered to find out practically useful guidelines for tailoring chiral LC guesthost systems. The studies include recording of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra to study the dependence of helicity induction on the configuration of stereogenic center.
