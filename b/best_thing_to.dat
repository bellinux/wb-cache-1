5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do was to leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, {{so in a way}} it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E

25|$|Suede {{appeared}} on Melody Maker's cover {{before they had}} a record out... The exposure got them a record deal, brought a bunch of like-minded acts to the public's attention, and helped create Britpop.

25|$|Chapter Three – The Caucus Race and a Long Tale: The sea {{of tears}} becomes crowded with other animals and birds {{that have been}} swept away by the rising waters. Alice and the other animals convene on the bank and the {{question}} among them is how to get dry again. The Mouse gives them a very dry lecture on William the Conqueror. A Dodo decides that the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> dry them off would be a Caucus-Race, which consists of everyone running in a circle with no clear winner. Alice eventually frightens all the animals away, unwittingly, by talking about her (moderately ferocious) cat.|$|E
25|$|Among {{other things}} in the recent update, the band said they were {{extremely}} surprised on how well their last album, Awake?, did in the market considering it had no tour support by them {{and that it was}} thrown onto Ferret's label in the 11th hour. Zao said the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> come out of it is that they learned a lot of the last release and it showed them that fans still enjoy their music and this inspired and motivated them to continue making music. According to social media reports, on July 11, 2014, Zao went into the studio, after a five-year unofficial hiatus and working on side projects like Lonely Ghost Parade and Young Fox, is currently, tracking and recording their 11th album. Guitar tracking began in January 2015. Xenophobe, the band's first EP since 1998, was released on July 10, 2015.|$|E

500|$|Lane {{said the}} story is [...] "compelling", while Sell stated that it is well laid out and rarely stalls.

At the 2001 Soul Train Music Awards, Country Grammar earned Nelly the award for Best R/Soul or Rap New Artist. Nelly was nominated for four awards at the Online Hip-Hop Awards, for Favorite Music Video, Song of the Year (both for [...] "E.I."), Album of the Year (for Country Grammar) and Outstanding Graphic Design for his official website.

500|$|In December 1986 {{the band}} finally got {{permission}} to {{tour in the}} US.

500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do is to try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|For {{the moment}} it was safer ashore. The cavalrymen overran the airstrip. Sporadic {{opposition}} allowed them {{to set up the}} antiaircraft machine guns on the beach, unload supplies, and patrol inland. Two soldiers were killed and three wounded. At 16:00, General MacArthur and Admiral Kinkaid came ashore. The general inspected the position. A lieutenant warned him a Japanese sniper had been killed in the vicinity just a few minutes before. [...] "That's the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do with them," [...] the General replied. He decided to stay, ordering Chase to hold his position until the follow-up force arrived, then returned to Phoenix. Fechteler's force departed at 17:29, the transports having unloaded and most of the bombardment force having exhausted its ammunition. Bush and Stockton remained to provide on-call naval fire support.|$|E

This {{collection}} of hoary old standards is the next <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> testing that proposition directly." [...] Orange Coast praised Nelson's performance of the standards: [...] "Willie Nelson is perhaps the finest male singer in country music [...] his phrasing and sense of understated drama have caused him to {{be compared with the}} best jazz singers. Now he's released an album of old pop standards, Stardust (Columbia), and you can almost hear the stirrings of an outlaw uprising between the grooves [...] although is definitively no step forward in Nelson's career, it's still a pleasurable showcase of his considerable artistry as a vocalist. Plus even though he's dealing with the sophisticated likes of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Kurt Weill, he remains essentially country".|$|E

500|$|Just as the Save Our Children {{campaign}} was a motivational force for conservative Christians, {{it was also}} one for gay and lesbian politics. Fejes writes, [...] "While the Stonewall riots of 1969 may have {{marked the beginning of}} the modern lesbian and gay movement, the campaigns of 1977 and 1978 marked the emergence of a national politically self-conscious lesbian and gay community". The birth of a political life for gays and lesbians gave opportunities for national networking as Anita Bryant and those who followed her acted as a virtual lightning rod, attracting a collective anger. Thirty years after the campaign, the Stonewall Library & Archives sponsored an exhibition of the events surrounding the Save Our Children campaign and displayed it at the Broward County Public Library. According to the curator of the exhibit, Bryant is considered [...] "the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> happen to the gay rights movement. She and her cohorts were so over the top that it just completely galvanized the gay rights movement".|$|E
500|$|Dave McKean drew {{most of the}} {{principal}} art, {{as well as the}} cover art of the graphic novel. In illustrating the story, McKean blends paintings, drawings, photography, and mixed-media collage to come up with striking page designs, and dense symbols. He has said that he was [...] "trying to make the book despite the subject, rather than because of it. At the end of the day, if you really love to do Batman comics, then that's probably the <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> do. Not liking them, and then trying to make something out of them is just a waste of time." [...] He also came to think that [...] "overpainted, lavish illustrations in every panel just didn't work. It hampers the storytelling." [...] McKean liberally uses symbolism, imagery, and surrealism, and many scenes involve the use of symbols to denote a particular psychological device. For example, a Greek inscription can be seen scratched on the doorway of Maxie Zeus's electroshock chamber, which translates into [...] "Discover thyself." [...] Much of this symbolism was later explained and expanded upon by the release of the 15th Anniversary Edition containing Morrison's annotated script.|$|E
500|$|Scouting {{reports on}} Filatov were mixed {{in advance of}} the 2008 NHL Entry Draft. Sergei Nemchinov, head coach of Russia's {{national}} junior team, said of Filatov, [...] "He definitely has an NHL upside because he can score, is a well-rounded player and is responsible in the defensive zone." [...] Independent scouting service Red Line Report at one point declared Filatov [...] "the next <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> Steven Stamkos" [...] (who was eventually selected first overall in the 2008 Draft). McKeen's Hockey scouts described him as a cross between Ilya Kovalchuk and Maxim Afinogenov. His strengths included his skating and vision, as well as the inclination to play at high intensity. The NHL's Director of European Scouting, Goran Stubb, assessed Filatov's NHL readiness as, [...] "Nikita is a leader, has a great attitude, an excellent work ethic and tons of talent." [...] Other scouts were not as impressed with his defensive game, however, preferring to focus on his offensive abilities. Off the ice, Filatov does not train in a traditional gym or weight room, preferring to run outside in sand and lift objects such as trees and boulders.|$|E
