40|$|Present cancer {{treatments}} cause {{the cessation of}} the body 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> own <b>natural</b> <b>defenses,</b> resulting in the susceptibility of patients to other illnesses, namely infection, during therapy. Contemporary research must focus on developing treatments to preserve or even augment the body 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>natural</b> <b>defenses</b> by pursuing naturally-derived elements devoid of such adverse effects. Seeking more natural treatments, Sambucus Nigra (elderberry) proves {{to be an important}} source of known immune stimulators including anthocyanins, catechins, and tannins, as wells as several known antioxidants and tumor suppressive agents in the form of flavonoids and proanthocyanidins. ^ Our primary goal was to separate the distinctive components of an elderberry extract using gravity column chromatography and examine their proliferative effects on T lymphocytes as well as their inhibitory effects on the growth of human skin melanoma cells. ^ Due to the successful effects of crude elderberry extracts on both immune enhancement and tumor suppression, we concluded that there must be specific components within the berry that enables its therapeutic value. ^ The effects on immune cell stimulation were assessed through the quantitative analysis of spleen cell proliferation, which yielded significantly positive spleen cell stimulation following the addition of and concanavalin A, a known mitogen, as compared to the spleen cells incubated solely with concanavalin A. ^ The inhibitory effect of the extract fractions was examined on a melanoma cell line. The successful suppression of tumor cell growth by several of the elderberry extract fractions, without mass suppression, was observed. In vivo studies using specific elderberry fractions may validate the use of the resolved components as viable therapeutic agents both in immunotherapy as well as chemotherapy. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{looked a little}} closer into opioid medication- types, effects, side effects and their use in current medical practice. In 1975 {{scientists}} finally discovered the biophysiological mechanisms behind morphine s effects. They found that brain has its own substances that, when bound to their respective receptors, give effects that earlier were {{very similar to those}} induced by morphine. These natural ligands were therefore named endogen opioids and are understood as our <b>body</b> <b>s</b> <b>natural</b> pain- and stress-defeating system. Twenty years later we know a little more about these incredible systems, but our knowledge is still poor. It is speculated about possibility that endogen opioids also could have an important role in certain psychological and endocrinological functions. Exogenous opioids are today a large group of medication, with morphine still being the most important and most researched one. The main indications for using this medicament group are: acute conditions of strong pain (short term), per- and postoperatively, and strong pain in terminal, especially cancer patients (long term). There have been reports about under-usage of opioids in these patient groups. This because of too little knowledge that leads to a non justified fear for the side effects. At the same time, opioids used on the wrong indications and their over-usage have caused a lot of harm to the patients, even leading to deaths. The main reason for this paper was therefore to try to learn more about opioids and their right medical use...|$|R
40|$|A {{spacecraft}} is {{the ultimate}} tight building. We don t want any leaks, and {{there is very little}} fresh air coming in, says Jay Perry, an aerospace engineer at Marshall Space Flight Center. As a result, there is a huge potential for a buildup of contaminants from a host of sources. Inside a spacecraft, contaminants can be introduced from the materials that make spacecraft components, electronics boxes, or activities by the crew such as food preparation or cleaning. Humans also generate contaminants by breathing and through the <b>body</b> <b>s</b> <b>natural</b> metabolic processes. As part of the sophisticated Environmental Control and Life Support System on the International Space Station (ISS), a trace contaminant control system removes carbon dioxide and other impurities from the cabin atmosphere. To maintain healthy levels, the system uses adsorbent media to filter chemical contaminant molecules and a high-temperature catalytic oxidizer to change the chemical structure of the contaminants to something more benign, usually carbon dioxide and water. In the 1990 s, while researching air quality control technology for extended spaceflight travel, Perry and others at Marshall were looking for a regenerable process for the continuous removal of carbon dioxide and trace chemical contaminants on long-duration manned space flights. At the time, the existing technology used on U. S. spacecraft could only be used once, which meant that a spacecraft had to carry additional spare parts for use in case the first one was depleted, or the spacecraft would have to return to Earth to exchange the components...|$|R

The data used in this study was a secondary data export raw natural rubber Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia during the period 1996 - 2010. The data was taken from the value and volume of exports of natural rubber in the International market. The analytical method used was the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and Constant Market Share (CMS). The results of this study indicate that the development of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>natural</b> rubber exports tend to increase every year. The level of the comparative advantage of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>natural</b> rubber exports relatively higher than Malaysia.
