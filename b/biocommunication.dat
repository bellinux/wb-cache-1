Such natural genome editing agents can (re)combine and (re)regulate host genome content according to context-dependent (i.e. adaptational) purposes. Such active agent-driven processes contradict passive error replication (mutation) narratives to explain emergence of genetic diversity.|$|E

Whereas Biosemiotics studies the production and interpretation of signs and codes, <b>biocommunication</b> theory investigates concrete interactions mediated by signs. Accordingly, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic aspects of <b>biocommunication</b> processes are distinguished. <b>Biocommunication</b> specific to animals (animal communication) is considered a branch of zoosemiotics. The semiotic study of molecular genetics, can {{be considered}} a study of <b>biocommunication</b> at its most basic level. Current research demonstrated that genetic content arrangements in most cases are the result of competent natural genetic engineering and natural genome editing. [...] According <b>biocommunication</b> theory this requires consortia of agents that edit genomes coherently with insertion/deletion capabilities. Additionally such agents must be capable of de novo generation of new nucleotide sequences and insertion in pre-existing (host)sequences without disturbing/destroying previous genetic content arrangements. This fundamentally contradicts former narratives in which genetic content arrangements resulted out of error replication events by chance and their selection.|$|E

50|$|In {{the study}} of the {{biological}} sciences, <b>biocommunication</b> is any specific type of communication within (intraspecific) or between (interspecific) species of plants, animals, fungi, protozoa and microorganisms. Communication includes sign-mediated interactions following three levels of (syntactic, pragmatic and semantic) rules. Signs in most cases are chemical molecules (semiochemicals, but also tactile, or as in animals also visual and auditive. <b>Biocommunication</b> of animals may include vocalizations (as between competing bird species), or pheromone production (as between various species of insects), chemical signals between plants and animals (as in tannin production used by vascular plants to warn away insects), and chemically mediated communication between plants and within plants. <b>Biocommunication</b> of fungi demonstrates that mycelia communication integrates interspecific sign-mediated interactions between fungal organisms soil bacteria and plant root cells without which plant nutrition could not be organized.|$|E

50|$|By 1870, Maury and Duhring had {{established}} a journal based on using medical photography, The Photographic Review of Medicine and Surgery, published by Lippincott in Philadelphia, USA provided case studies and before and after photographs. Most major centres of medical education had adopted photography {{as a method of}} documentation and study by the 1900s. Many photographers were working in multi-faceted disciplines from radiology, pathology and ophthalmology. Medical photography became a special field of photography and in 1931 a group of photographers working in medicine came together at Yale University in the United States of America to form the Biological Photographic Association, which later became the BioCommunications Association Inc. The group published a journal; the Journal of Biological Photography which was later incorporated into the Journal of <b>BioCommunication.</b> Other organizations formed in England, Scandinavia and Australia.

The possibility of producing physical states where all the components of the ensemble move in unison has been recognized. In such cases, electromagnetic fields trapped within the ensemble appear. In the present paper we present a scheme based on Quantum Field Theory where molecules are able to move in phase-correlated unison among them and with a self-produced electromagnetic field. Experimental corroboration of this scheme is presented. Some consequences for future biological developments are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{coherent}} description of all levels of communication of ciliates. Ciliates are highly sensitive organisms that actively compete for environmental resources. They assess their surroundings, estimate how much energy they need for particular goals, and then realise the optimum variant. They take measures to control certain environmental resources. They perceive themselves and can distinguish between â€˜selfâ€™ and â€˜non-selfâ€™. They process and evaluate information and then modify their behaviour accordingly. These highly diverse competences show us that this is possible owing to sign(aling) -mediated communication processes within ciliates (intra-organismic), between the same, related and different ciliate species (inter-organismic), and between ciliates and non-ciliate organisms (trans-organismic). This is crucial in coordinating growth and development, shape and dynamics. This book further serves as a learning tool for research aspects in <b>biocommunication</b> in ciliates. It will guide scientists in further investigations on ciliate behavior, how they mediate signaling processes between themselves and the environment...|$|E

The oestrus specific synthetic compounds were rubbed onto the genital region of nonoestrus animals (dummy cows), and the bulls were allowed to sniff the genital region and observed sexual behaviours. The statistical significance was higher (P < 0. 001) in bulls exhibiting repeated flehmen and mounting behaviours towards the mixture of acetic acid, propionic acid, and trimethylamine as compared to test these compounds separately. It was concluded that the volatile substances present in the bovine vaginal fluid during oestrus may act as chemical communicators...|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} a coherent <b>biocommunication</b> categorization for the kingdoms of bacteria, fungi and plants. The investigation further shows that, besides biotic sign use in trans-, inter- and intraorganismic communication processes, a common trait is interpretation of abiotic influences as indicators to generate an appropriate adaptive behaviour. Far from being mechanistic interactions, communication processes within organisms and between organisms are sign-mediated interactions. Sign-mediated interactions are the precondition for every {{cooperation and coordination}} between at least two biological agents such as cells, tissues, organs and organisms. Signs of biocommunicative processes are chemical molecules in most cases. The signs {{that are used in}} a great variety of signaling processes follow syntactic (combinatorial), pragmatic (context-dependent) and semantic (content-specific) rules. These three levels of semiotic rules are helpful tools to investigate communication processes throughout all organismic kingdoms. It is not the aim to present the latest empirical data concerning communication in these three kingdoms but to present a unifying perspective that is able to interconnect transdisciplinary research on bacteria, fungi and plants...|$|E
40|$|Glycans {{participate}} in bio-communication, such as cell to cell recognition, sperm-egg recognition and embryonic development {{because they have}} the property of storing biological signals in forms that can be identified by other biological systems, such as anti-glycan antibodies and glycan binding proteins or lectins. Aberrant arise at the cell surface in many diseases, including cancer, and altered carbohydrate moieties are indicated as mediators of tumorigenicity and invasiveness. Alpha-L-fucopyranosyl residues are immunodeterminant, playing {{an important role in the}} glyco-language; this is especially true of residues alpha(1, 2) -linked to a galactose, that frequently exist as terminal modifications of N-glycans, O-glycans or glycolipids. The H antigen is the product of the enzyme that adds fucose to galactose residues by an alpha(1, 2) -linkage. We report work in which we demonstrated the presence and role of alpha(1, 2) fucose-containing glycoepitopes in <b>biocommunication</b> between egg and sperm in two invertebrate species, the tunicate Ciona intestinalis and the mollusk Unio elongatulus. In the mollusk the structure of the fucosylated epitopes involved in sperm recognition in the context of the blood group H-antigen was confirmed by MS/MS data. Using an antibody raised against the bio-communicating glycoprotein of the Unio oocyte, the epitope of which was demonstrated to contain the alpha(1, 2) fucosylated O-glycans, we detected the same or a very similar epitope in nucleolin, a protein expressed in highly proliferating and cancer cells in humans, known to act as a shuttle between the cell surface and nucleus. We suggest that the glycosylation machinery used to build up the alpha(1, 2) fucosyl-containing glycoepitope of the Unio egg, is re-stored in cancer cells...|$|E
