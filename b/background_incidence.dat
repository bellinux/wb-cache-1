40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} over-diagnosis due to population-based mammography screening using a {{lead time}} adjustment approach, with lead time measures based on symptomatic cancers only. Subjects Women aged 40 – 84 in 1989 – 2009 in South Australia eligible for mammography screening. Methods: Numbers of observed and expected breast cancer cases were compared, after adjustment for lead time. Lead time effects were modelled using age-specific estimates of lead time (derived from interval cancer rates and predicted <b>background</b> <b>incidence,</b> using maximum likelihood methods) and screening sensitivity, projected background breast cancer incidence rates (in {{the absence of}} screening), and proportions screened, by age and calendar year. Results: Lead time estimates were 12, 26, 43 and 53 months, for women aged 40 – 49, 50 – 59, 60 – 69 and 70 – 79 respectively. Background: incidence rates were estimated to have increased by 0. 9 % and 1. 2 % per year for invasive and all breast cancer. Over-diagnosis among women aged 40 – 84 was estimated at 7. 9 % (0. 1 – 12. 0 %) for invasive cases and 12. 0 % (5. 7 – 15. 4 %) when including ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS). Conclusions: We estimated 8 % over-diagnosis for invasive breast cancer and 12 % inclusive of DCIS cancers due to mammography screening among women aged 40 – 84.

40|$|OBJECTIVES To seek {{objective}} evidence for geographical clustering of places of residence {{of patients with}} motor neuron disease (MND). METHODS A complete residential history from birth to onset of disease was obtained from a cohort of 130 patients with MND from Lancashire and south Cumbria presenting to the Department of Neurology in Preston between 1 January 1989 and 31 December 1993. These data were compared with population based reference data from the 1991 UK Census. RESULTS Some areal units showed a greater, others a lesser, number of MND patient residences than expected. The {{results suggest that the}} background population incidence of MND is relatively low and that the overall incidence figures previously quoted have been skewed upwards by areas in which the incidence of MND is relatively increased. These findings were further tested by Poisson modelling. The Poisson model provided a poor fit for the data at postcode district and sector levels confirming that patients with MND {{were significantly more likely to}} have lived in some areas than others after allowing for variation in population of the different areal units and for variation in duration of residence. CONCLUSIONS These findings reinforce the results of previous work, much of which has been qualitative rather than quantitative. The results presented here suggest a low <b>background</b> <b>incidence</b> of MND in the context of generally quoted overall incidence figures. This low <b>background</b> <b>incidence</b> is, however, skewed upwards by some areal units with a relatively high incidence, thus achieving overall incidence rates comparable with generally quoted figures. We conclude that there is prima facie evidence of spatial patterns in the distribution of places of residence of patients with MND. Further examination of occupational and environmental factors in the lives of the patients with MND is required to obtain a better understanding of the importance of these findings...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Viral {{childhood}} infections may {{be involved}} in the multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Following national Swedish vaccination programs, measles sharply declined in the 1970 s, and measles, mumps, and rubella were virtually eliminated in cohorts born from 1981. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether the vaccination induced reduction in these infections influences the MS incidence. In addition, the public health aspect justified an early evaluation of beneficial as well as harmful effects of mass vaccinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From an incidence material of 534 MS patients, born 1959 - 1990, we selected one unvaccinated cohort and four cohorts, each corresponding to a vaccination program (MS patients = 251). RESULTS: With the ability to detect a decrease by 30 - 35 %, and an increase by 37 - 48 % in the MS incidence in the first three cohorts, we found no vaccination related MS <b>incidence</b> changes. The <b>background</b> MS <b>incidence</b> showed a significant gradual age dependent increase. CONCLUSIONS: While the present follow-up provided limited power in the last cohort, there is no evidence as yet that the radical decline in three viral infections influenced the MS incidence. However, the increasing <b>background</b> MS <b>incidence</b> of unknown cause may have concealed a reduction in MS risk associated with mass vaccinations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antecedent surgery {{has been}} {{described}} to trigger Guillain/x 96 Barre syndrome (GBS), but its evidence is poor and based on case reports only. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 patients with GBS admitted to the University Hospital Basel and University Children's Hospital Basel from January 2005 to December 2010. We calculated and compared the incidences of post-surgical and non-exposed patients with GBS in the study population and those reported previously in literature. RESULTS: Six of 63 (9. 5 %) GBS cases had had a surgery within 6 weeks prior to GBS. The relative risk of developing GBS during the 6 -week period after surgery is 13. 1 {{times higher than the}} normal incidence in the study population (95 % confidence interval: 5. 68, 30. 3; P >/= 0. 0001), suggesting an attributable risk of 4. 1 cases per 100 000 surgeries.

The Dutch FRAX 1 algorithm, which predicts 10 -year probabilities of hip fracture and MOF (first of hip, humerus, forearm, clinical vertebral), therefore incorporates imputed MOF rates. Swedish incidence rate ratios for hip fracture to MOF (Malmo 1987 – 1996) {{were used to}} perform this imputation. However, equality of these ratios between countries is uncertain and recent evidence is scarce. Aims were to estimate incidence rates of hip fracture and MOF and to compare observed MOF rates to those predicted by the imputation method for the Netherlands.
