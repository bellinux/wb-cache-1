40|$|AbstractThree {{competing}} hypotheses {{have been}} proposed for the cortical representation of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These are: (i) the regions surrounding the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> maintain their spatial values; (ii) the {{opposite sides of the}} <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are represented adjacently at the cortex, so that the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is “sewn-up”; and (iii) the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is sewn-up with compensation occurring in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> so that spatial values are distorted only in the immediate surround of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> To distinguish between these hypotheses we used a two-dot alignment task, with the two dots straddling the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> at varying dot separations. Thresholds in the two-dot alignment task are limited by the cortical separation of the two dots. When thresholds for alignment across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are compared with thresholds over intact retina at the same eccentricity, the three hypotheses predict: (i) no change in thresholds; (ii) a lowering of thresholds; and (iii) a lowering of thresholds but only at separations slightly greater than the diameter of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Thresoolds across the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were closely similar to thresholds across intact retina. The results do not support a sewing-up (with or without compensation) of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Rather, our results are consistent with a preservation of spatial values around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot...</b>|$|R

However, if an object does not reach through but ends in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> it is perceived as "cut off" at the boundary. Here we show that even {{when there is no}} corresponding stimulation at opposing edges of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> well known motion-induced position shifts also extend into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and elicit a dynamic filling-in process that allows spatial structure to be extrapolated into the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> We presented observers with sinusoidal gratings that drifted into or out of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> or flickered in counterphase.

Further, observers could perceive more of a grating's spatial structure inside the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than would be predicted from simple filling-in of luminance information from the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> edge. This is evidence for a dynamic filling-in process that uses spatiotemporal information from the motion system to extrapolate visual percepts into the scotoma of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Our findings also provide further support for the notion that an explicit spatial shift of topographic representations contributes to motion-induced position illusions...|$|R

5|$|Partial solar eclipses are {{hazardous}} to view because the eye's pupil is not {{adapted to the}} unusually high visual contrast: the pupil dilates according to {{the total amount of}} light in the field of view, not by the brightest object in the field. During partial eclipses most sunlight is blocked by the Moon passing in front of the Sun, but the uncovered parts of the photosphere have the same surface brightness as during a normal day. In the overall gloom, the pupil expands from ~2mm to ~6mm, and each retinal cell exposed to the solar image receives up to ten times more light than it would looking at the non-eclipsed Sun. This can damage or kill those cells, resulting in small permanent <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> for the viewer. The hazard is insidious for inexperienced observers and for children, because there is no perception of pain: it is not immediately obvious that one's vision is being destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, City Council Member Eric Ulrich, a Republican {{representing}} Ozone Park, {{came out}} against the plan as among other things, it prohibited left turns at Jamaica Avenue. He had been in favor of bus rapid transit along Woodhaven Boulevard, as he stated in a 2014 opinion editorial. The plan was modified in May 2016 {{in an effort to}} accommodate Ulrich's objections. It included restrictions on left-turns at only five intersections, including none at Jamaica Avenue. The left-turn restrictions were put into the plan to speed up travel times by eliminating the signal time allocated to split phasing—a traffic-signal setup where traffic in one direction has a green light, while the other directions of traffic have a red light, in order to allow drivers at the green light to turn left without conflicts from oncoming traffic. The restrictions also reduce conflicts between turning vehicles and pedestrians. Instead of banning left turns at Jamaica Avenue, the left turn bays would be re-engineered around the BMT Jamaica Line subway columns to decrease <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> and collisions. Local community members were also opposed to the plan due to the reduction of traffic lanes along the boulevard's service roads from two lanes to a single lane.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the keep has {{attracted}} much historical interest. Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design, combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications. More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation. The {{design of the}} Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms, as the buttresses created additional <b>blind</b> <b>spots</b> for the defenders, whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack. Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford, whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep. A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham, Norfolk, in 1146, for example. Historians have therefore questioned {{to what extent the}} design can be seen as legitimately transitional. Instead, historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism. Heslop argues that the plain, simple elegance of the architecture would, for mid-12th century nobility, have summoned up images of King Arthur, who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links. The banded, angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, then the idealised image of imperial power, and the keep as a whole, including the roof, may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reliability}} of visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{and how it}} is influenced by the distribution of spatial attention in and around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> were studied. Our data suggest that visual filling-in at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> is 1) less reliable than it has been assumed, and 2) easier under diffused attention around the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> than under focal attention restricted in the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These findings put important constraints on understanding the filling-in in terms of its neural substantiation. Recent neurophysiological studies suggest that V 1 neurons corresponding to the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> in retinotopic map extend their receptive fields far beyond the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and are not silent during the filling-in (Komatsu, Kinoshita, and Murakami, 2000). For those neurons to subserve filling-in, it may be crucially important for top-down attention to match their receptive fields. 1...|$|R

In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in <b>blind</b> <b>spots.</b> Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

A radial grating (D= 12 °) was presented to one eye, centered on the natural <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Observers perceived a complete figure in monocular view; the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> area was filled-in based on the surrounding information. Simultaneously, a circular grating smaller than the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> (D= 4 °), was presented to the fellow eye in the region corresponding to the other eye's <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> The amount of rivalry as indexed by how often the smaller circular grating remained visible was measured.

40|$|The neural {{mechanism}} that mediates perceptual filling-in of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> {{is still under}} discussion.

This theory predicts that independent stimuli presented to the left and right of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> should lead to neighboring/overlapping activations in visual cortex when the blind-spot eye is stimulated, but separated activations when the fellow eye is stimulated. Using functional MRI, we directly tested the remapping hypothesis by presenting flickering checkerboard wedges to the left or right of the spatial location of the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> either to the blind-spot eye or to the fellow eye. Irrespective of which eye was stimulated, we found separate activations corresponding to the left and right wedges.

40|$|When visual stimuli {{that cover}} the entire <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are {{presented}} monocularly, the color and brightness of the surrounding field are seen within the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> although it receives no retinal input. Important questions about such perceptual filling-in are whether neurons in the visual system representing visual field locations within the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> are activated when filling-in occurs and, if so, what the properties of these neurons are. To address these questions, we recorded the activities of single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V 1) of the awake monkey. We first identified the area of V 1 representing {{the region of the}} <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> and then assessed neural responses to stationary visual stimuli of various size. We found that there are neurons in layer 4 and deeper laminae, particularly layer 6, that respond to large stimuli covering the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> which induces perceptual filling-in. Most of these neurons had very large binocular receptive fields that extended outside the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> These neurons also preferred relatively large stimuli and exhibited color selectivity. These results indicate that when a large uniform surface is presented on the <b>blind</b> <b>spot,</b> neurons at the V 1 region representing the <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> transmit signals essential for filling-in that inform of the presence of a large surface as well as the absence of smaller stimuli at the <b>blind</b> <b>spot.</b> Key words: filling-in; blind spot; V 1; monkey; surface perception; completion; visual perception When we look at a surface of homogeneous color and luminance, light rays coming into the eye from each point within the surface area stimulate retinal photoreceptors, and this point-wise information may be the basis of our perception of color and luminance.

In 2008, SWOV presented a long-term outlook to what was then called the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management and proposed a set of four concrete measures. This was done with a <b>blind</b> <b>spot</b> crash analysis as a basis. In the meanwhile, the Ministry has taken action on many points. Monitoring should indicate to which extent the measures that were proposed by SWOV have actually been or are being implemented.
