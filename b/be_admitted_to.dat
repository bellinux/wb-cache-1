A multidisciplinary team including speech pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists plays {{a large role in}} supporting a person affected by a stroke and their rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|In the Delaware {{case the}} {{district}} court judge in Gebhart ordered that the black students <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the white high school due to the substantial harm of segregation and the differences that made the separate schools unequal.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose their courses, as long as they completed 150 credits.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{remained}} {{involved in}} Philippine affairs. During Roosevelt's election campaign in 1904, he urged that Philippine agricultural products <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. without duty. This caused growers of U.S. sugar and tobacco to complain to Roosevelt, who remonstrated with his Secretary of War. Taft expressed unwillingness {{to change his}} position, and threatened to resign; Roosevelt hastily dropped the matter. Taft returned to the islands in 1905, leading a delegation of congressmen, and again in 1907, to open the first Philippine Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been {{the exception rather than the}} rule.|$|E

5|$|The West Point Association of Graduates (WPAOG) {{also offers}} {{scholarship}} support {{to people who}} are qualified but not selected. The scholarships usually cover around $7,000 to civilian universities; the students who receive these scholarships do so under the stipulation that they will <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> and attend West Point a year later. Those who do not must repay the AOG. Marion Military Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, Georgia Military College, Hargrave Military Academy, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, and Northwestern Preparatory School are approved programs that students attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.|$|E

5|$|Willkie {{had long}} been neglectful of his health and diet, smoking heavily, and rarely exercising. His heavy {{drinking}} had charmed the reporters in Philadelphia in 1940, but by 1944 it was becoming a problem. In August 1944, Willkie felt weak while traveling by train to his Rushville home. There, he suffered a heart attack, {{but he had to}} be persuaded to see a doctor and he refused to <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> a hospital.|$|E

5|$|Bormann {{was one of}} {{the leading}} proponents of the ongoing {{persecution}} of the Christian churches. In February 1937 he decreed that members of the clergy should not <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the NSDAP. The following year he ruled that any members of the clergy who were holding party offices should be dismissed, and that any party member who was considering entering the clergy had to give up his party membership. While Bormann's push to force the closure of theological departments at Reich universities was unsuccessful, he was able {{to reduce the amount of}} religious instruction provided in public schools to two hours per week and mandated the removal of crucifixes from classrooms. Speer notes in his memoirs that while drafting plans for Welthauptstadt Germania, the planned rebuilding of Berlin, he was told by Bormann that churches were not to be allocated any building sites.|$|E
5|$|Central to Gray's was {{the system}} shared across the Inns of Court of {{progress}} towards {{a call to}} the Bar, which lasted approximately 12 to 14 years. A student would first study at either Oxford or Cambridge University, or at one of the Inns of Chancery, which were dedicated legal training institutions. If he studied at Oxford or Cambridge he would spend three years working towards a degree, and <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> one of the Inns of Court after graduation. If he studied at one of the Inns of Chancery he would do so for one year before seeking admission to the Inn of Court to which his Inn of Chancery was tied—in the case of Gray's Inn, the attached Inns of Chancery were Staple Inn and Barnard's Inn.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1899, San Diego Normal School became the first California normal school to offer summer courses, and {{maintained}} this position until 1913. On June 21, 1900, the first class was graduated: 23 women and three men. Later that year, the east wing of the initial building was finished, adding 18 rooms. In 1903, $61,000 was appropriated by the state for a west wing; it included a gym, library, laboratories, lecture rooms, and a museum. The west wing was completed in September 1904. In 1906, the California legislature required that students have {{a high school diploma}} in order to <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> a normal school. This was the same requirement as for entry into the University of California.|$|E

5|$|Knights and Ladies of the Thistle {{may also}} <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> the Order of the Garter. Formerly, many, but not all, Knights {{elevated}} {{to the senior}} Order would resign from the Order of the Thistle. The first to resign from the Order of the Thistle was John, Duke of Argyll in 1710; the last to take such an action was Thomas, Earl of Zetland in 1872. Knights and Ladies of the Thistle may also be deprived of their knighthoods. The only individual to have suffered such a fate was John Erskine, 6th Earl of Mar who lost both the knighthood and the earldom after participating in the Jacobite rising of 1715.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|The British mandate in Palestine, {{where an}} Arab {{majority}} lived alongside a Jewish minority, presented the British {{with a similar}} problem to that of India. The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to <b>be</b> <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed {{to the creation of}} a Jewish state. Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve. The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.|$|E
