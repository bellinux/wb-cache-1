50|$|Many {{variations}} of the Prins reaction exist because it lends itself easily to cyclization reactions {{and because it is}} possible to capture the oxo-carbenium ion with a large array of nucleophiles. The halo-Prins reaction is one such modification with replacement of protic acids and water by lewis acids such as stannic chloride and <b>boron</b> <b>tribromide.</b> The halogen is now the nucleophile recombining with the carbocation. The cyclization of certain allyl pulegones in scheme 7 with titanium tetrachloride in dichloromethane at −78 °C gives access to the decalin skeleton with the hydroxyl group and chlorine group predominantly in cis configuration (91% cis). This observed cis diastereoselectivity is due to the intermediate formation of a trichlorotitanium alkoxide making possible an easy delivery of chlorine to the carbocation ion from the same face. The trans isomer is preferred (98% cis) when the switch is made to a tin tetrachloride reaction at room temperature.|$|E
50|$|Flavone {{inhibitor}} of cyclin-dependent kinases; the (-)-cis form induces apoptosis {{in certain}} tumor cells.Tetrahydropyridine (1) is obtainable by reacting N-methyl-4-piperidone with 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (trimethyl-Phloroglucinol) in HOAc and bubbling through HCl gas, which must cause dehydration of the initially formed 3° alcohol to o,o,p-trimethoxy-MPTP. For the next step, hydroboration {{of the product}} from the last step {{is done by the}} addition of diborane to the olefin, followed by oxidation of the hydroborane adduct with a peroxide then affords the hydration product as the trans isomer (2). {Although borane is the usual reagent, it appears here that it is generated in situ from BF3 and NaBH4.} The stereochemistry of that hydroxy group is reversed in 2 steps starting by {{what appears to be a}} Swern oxidation to a ketone; which is then reduced with NaBH4 to afford (3). The cis relationship is apparently based on the principle that the hydride ion approaches from the less sterically occluded/precluded side, which in this case is opposite to the Ar. 3 is then acylated with acetic anhydride in the presence of BF3. Using an excess of the latter reagent leads to selective desmethylation of the ether adjacent to the newly introduced acetyl function (4). Claisen condensation of that product with methyl-2-chlorobenzoate would then afford the β-diketone (5). A stream of dry HCl gas in a condensation reaction splits out one equivalent of water and formation of the pyran ring by an addition-elimination reaction (6). Desmethylation of the two remaining methoxy groups (phenolic ethers), for example <b>boron</b> <b>tribromide,</b> would then afford alvocidib (7).|$|E
