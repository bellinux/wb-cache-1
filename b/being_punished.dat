5|$|Hartnett {{felt the}} strain of {{managing}} a team during the 1939 season as he faced player discontent over the pampering of Dizzy Dean while pitcher Larry French went over his head to complain to owner Philip Wrigley about his lack of pitching assignments. French felt he was <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> for requesting to have Gus Mancuso as his catcher. In addition, Hartnett was forced to catch more games {{due to the lack}} of hitting from the other Cubs catchers. On August 28, 1939, he broke Ray Schalk's Major League record of 1,727 career games as a catcher. His record for longevity was surpassed by Al López during the 1945 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1886 {{a colonel}} renowned {{for lack of}} {{discipline}} published newspaper articles criticizing the Minister of War, an act of insubordination forbidden by law. Instead of <b>being</b> <b>punished,</b> the colonel was supported by his commander, Field Marshal (nowadays Divisional General) Deodoro da Fonseca. The minister, {{as well as the}} conservative cabinet headed by João Maurício Wanderley, decided not to penalize the colonel in an attempt to quiet dissention. However, the cabinet went further and removed any constraint on military officers broadcasting their views. In consequence of this policy, subordinates were thenceforth able to publicly criticize their superiors, thus undermining both military and political authority, including that of the cabinet itself.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term administrative detention, and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E
5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> in the eighth circle of Hell, in the tenth bolgia (ditch). Here she and other falsifiers such as the alchemists and the counterfeiters suffer dreadful diseases, Myrrha's being madness. Myrrha's {{suffering}} in the tenth bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E
5|$|Alberta Chief Returning Officer Lorne Gibson, {{as one of}} his 182 post-election {{recommendations}} to the government, suggested that the appointment of returning officers be handled by his own, non-partisan, office. He had previously made this suggestion in 2006, but the government had not acted on it. He also recommended following the election that his office, rather than the government's Justice department, be responsible for prosecuting election-related offenses; the latter did not lay charges in any of 19 alleged campaign finance violations Gibson brought to its attention. In February 2009, Gibson appeared before the legislature's all-party committee on legislative offices to answer questions about the conduct of the election; there, he echoed opposition claims that the government, and not his office, was to blame for most problems. Shortly after, the committee voted 8–3 against re-appointing him, with all Progressive Conservatives on the committee opposing his re-appointment and all opposition MLAs supporting it. Opposition leaders David Swann and Brian Mason suggested that Gibson was <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> for criticizing the government.|$|E

5000|$|Albert Bandura {{followed}} up his 1961 study {{a few years}} later with another that again tested differences in children's learning/behavior or actual performance after seeing a model <b>being</b> rewarded, <b>punished,</b> or experiencing no consequences for aggressive behavior towards a Bobo doll (here and following, [...] ) [...]|$|R
50|$|These {{experiments}} relate empirically to Bandura's {{social learning}} theory. This social science {{theory suggests that}} people learn through observing, imitating, and modeling; moreover, it specifically suggests that people learn not only by <b>being</b> rewarded or <b>punished</b> (as suggested by theories in behaviorism), but also by watching others <b>being</b> rewarded or <b>punished</b> (observational learning). The experiments are important because they sparked much further study related to observational learning. As well, the data offered further practical working hypotheses, e.g., regarding how children might be influenced from watching violent media.|$|R
5|$|Love, sex {{and desire}} become {{important}} elements of the plot in Sant Singh Sekhon's Punjabi play Kalakar (1945), which places the epic drama in the modern age. It depicts Ahalya as a free-spirited woman, who dares to be painted nude by Inder (Indra), a pupil of the art professor, Gautama, and defends her decision against her husband's criticisms. N. S. Madhavan's Malayalam story (April 2006) also retells Ahalya's tale in a modern setting, wherein Ahalya, accused of adultery, is beaten by her husband, leaving her in a coma from which the neurologist, Rama, revives her. The 2015 film Ahalya gives a feminist twist to the tale where the policeman Indra turns into a stone doll, after visiting Ahalya. The tale was also parodied in the Telugu film Attarintiki Daredi. However, the practice of retelling the classical Ahalya–Indra tale in a contemporary setting is not new. The Yoga Vasistha (1001–1400) narrates {{a tale of two}} adulterous lovers, Queen Ahalya and the Brahmin Indra. Here, Ahalya and Indra fall in love and continue their affair, despite <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> by Ahalya's jealous husband. After death, they reunite in their next birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number of inmates suffering from mental illnesses and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|Demolitions began {{soon after}} the {{withdrawal}} of the Jacobite threat in 1746. The bastions of the Telfer Wall along Lauriston Place were demolished in 1762, as they were obstructing traffic. The Netherbow survived until 1764, when it too was removed as an obstruction. The West Port and the Potterow Port were removed in the 1780s. By now, the New Town was under construction, and although smuggling of goods through the city walls was still <b>being</b> <b>punished,</b> complaints about the zealousness of the guards were widely circulated. The Old College of the University of Edinburgh (constructed from 1789), and then the Royal Museum of Scotland (constructed from 1861), were built over sections of the wall around the Potterow Port. Forrest Road was laid out in the 1840s, resulting in the loss of another section of the Telfer Wall. During construction works around the Advocates' Library and Parliament House in 1832 and 1845, fragments of walling were uncovered, which were attributed to the King's Wall. Two sections of the increasingly neglected town wall collapsed in the mid-1850s. In 1854, a large portion of wall (20 feet high and 3–4 feet thick), and the embankment against which it was built fell into Leith Wynd between the High Street and Calton Road. A week later the Dean of Guild ordered the removal of a 150 feet stretch of the wall from that location. In 1856, a lightning strike appears to have been the cause of the collapse of a 40 to 50 feet stretch of the wall enclosing Greyfriars Kirkyard.|$|E

5|$|Few records exist of Thomas Coke's early years, {{although}} {{it is known that}} he was educated in Longford, Derbyshire, before going to a school in Wandsworth run by French refugees. In 1765 he was sent to Eton College, where he was joined by William Windham, a close friend in his later life. Coke was apparently happy at Eton, and was excellent at field sports; on one occasion 70 snipes he had killed were found in his room, and on another he narrowly avoiding <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> for shooting a pheasant in Windsor Park. He was not particularly interested in his academic studies, {{but by the time he}} left Eton in 1771 Coke had developed a close circle of friends and connections from the landowning class, and practical skills to deal with his future estates. After leaving school he undertook a Grand Tour of Europe, financed by his father and his great-aunt (who offered him £500 not to go to a university, regarding them as dens of vice). Coke visited France and Italy, where he witnessed the marriage of the Young Pretender to Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern; Louise apparently fell in love with Coke, preferring the similarly-aged Englishman to her 52-year-old alcoholic husband.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is <b>being</b> <b>punished</b> because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
