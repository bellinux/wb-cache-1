5|$|A {{signature}} {{feature of}} Parthian architecture was the iwan, an audience hall supported by arches or barrel vaults and open on one side. Use of the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> replaced the Hellenic use of columns to support roofs. Although the iwan was known during the Achaemenid period and earlier in smaller and subterranean structures, {{it was the}} Parthians who first built them on a monumental scale. The earliest Parthian iwans are found at Seleucia, built in the early 1st century AD. Monumental iwans are also commonly found in the ancient temples of Hatra and perhaps modeled on the Parthian style. The largest Parthian iwans at that site have a span of 15m (50ft).|$|E
5|$|After the {{eleventh}} century, as masonry techniques advanced, ashlar blocks became more rectangular, resulting in more stable walls that could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing {{that can be}} seen in corbelling, buttressing, lintels and arching. At the same time there was increasing influence from English and continental European designs, known as Romanesque. The Romanesque style had its origins in Roman building techniques and early churches in the Byzantine Empire and Italy and was characterised by massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> roofs. The introduction of this style to Scotland is associated with the ecclesiastical reforms that began in the reign of Máel Coluim III (r. 1058–93), bringing continental ideas of monasticism and church organisation to the country. The oldest Romanesque church in Scotland is probably the small chapel built for Máel Coluim's wife Margaret on Castle Rock, Edinburgh, with a vaulted semi-circular apse. In the twelfth century a number of new parish churches were built by lords on their land. They were often small aisless buildings with two or three connected cells, each of diminishing size, ending in a rounded apse. One of the best preserved is at Dalmeny in Lothian.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of continental forms of monasticism to Scotland {{is associated with}} Saxon princess Queen Margaret (c. 1045–93), the second wife of Máel Coluim III (r. 1058–93), although her exact role is unclear. It is known {{that she was in}} communication with Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new Benedictine abbey at Dunfermline (c. 1070). Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, Edgar (r. 1097–1107), Alexander (r. 1107–24) and particularly David I (r. 1124–53), tended to be of the reformed type that followed the lead set by Cluny Abbey in the Loire from the late tenth century. Most belonged to the new religious orders that originated in France in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues of poverty, chastity and obedience, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by reformed Benedictine, Augustinian and Cistercian houses. This period also saw the {{introduction of}} more sophisticated forms of church architecture that had become common on the Continent and in England, known collectively as Romanesque. These used rectangular ashlar blocks that allowed massive reinforced walls and round arches that could bear the weight of rounded <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> roofs and could incorporate refined architectural moulding and detailing.|$|E

50|$|It can {{be thought}} of as formed by two <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults</b> that cross at right angles to each other: the open space within the vault is the {{intersection}} of the space within the two <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults,</b> and the solid material that surrounds the vault is the union of the solid material surrounding the two barrel vaults.In this way it differs from a groin vault, which is also formed from two <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults</b> but in the opposite way: in a groin vault, the space is the union of the spaces of two <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults,</b> and the solid material is the intersection.|$|R
25|$|A <b>barrel</b> <b>vault,</b> {{also known}} as a tunnel vault or a wagon vault, is an {{architectural}} element formed by the extrusion of a single curve (or pair of curves, {{in the case of a}} pointed <b>barrel</b> <b>vault)</b> along a given distance. The curves are typically circular in shape, lending a semi-cylindrical appearance to the total design. The <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> is the simplest form of a vault: effectively a series of arches placed side by side (i.e., one after another). It is a form of barrel roof.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceiling of}} the chapel is a {{flattened}} <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> springing from a course that encircles the walls {{at the level of}} the springing of the window arches. This <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> is cut transversely by smaller vaults over each window, which divide the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> at its lowest level into a series of large pendentives rising from shallow pilasters between each window. The <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> was originally painted brilliant-blue and dotted with gold stars, to the design of Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia. The pavement is in opus alexandrinum, a decorative style using marble and coloured stone in a pattern that reflects the earlier proportion in the division of the interior and also marks the processional way from the main door, used by the Pope on important occasions such as Palm Sunday.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{comparison}} to other vaulting techniques, the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> is inherently a weaker design {{compared to the}} more complex groin vault. The <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> structure must rest on long walls creating less stable lateral stress, whereas the groin vault design can direct stresses almost purely vertically on the apexes.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> (also {{called a}} wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a <b>barrel</b> <b>vault,</b> the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} type of vaulted roof is the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> {{in which}} a single arched surface extends from wall to wall, {{the length of the}} space to be vaulted, for example, the nave of a church. An important example, which retains Medieval paintings, is the vault of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe, France, of the early 12th century. However, the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> generally required the support of solid walls, or walls in which the windows were very small.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the {{eleventh}} century, naves {{were covered with}} <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults,</b> either a half barrel or a quarter barrel, a device used in Romanesque architecture throughout Europe. Later the groin vault was used. In Catalonia, these <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults</b> were used without reinforcements, while in Castile and León arches were used as support. The use of the groin vault (arising from the crossing of two perpendicular <b>barrel</b> <b>vaults)</b> had been lost and was later taken up by great master builders. The groin vault in turn {{gave way to the}} ribbed vault, which later became very common in Gothic architecture.|$|R
25|$|Barrel vaults {{are known}} from Ancient Egypt, and were used {{extensively}} in Roman architecture. They {{were also used}} to replace the Cloaca Maxima with a system of underground sewers. Other early <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> designs occur in northern Europe, Turkey, Morocco, and other regions. In medieval Europe, the <b>barrel</b> <b>vault</b> was {{an important element of}} stone construction in monasteries, castles, tower houses and other structures. This form of design is observed in cellars, crypts, long hallways, cloisters and even great halls.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the dome}} {{constitutes}} the principal {{characteristic of the}} Byzantine church, throughout Asia Minor are numerous examples in which the naves are vaulted with the semicircular <b>barrel</b> <b>vault,</b> {{and this is the}} type of vault found throughout the south of France in the 11th and 12th centuries, the only change being the occasional substitution of the pointed <b>barrel</b> <b>vault,</b> adopted not only on account of its exerting a less thrust, but because, as pointed out by Fergusson (vol. ii. p.46), the roofing tiles were laid directly on the vault and a less amount of filling in at the top was required.|$|E
