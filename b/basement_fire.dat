50|$|Another {{historic}} building was located on 200 Fairview Road {{as a small}} frame house with a Queen Porch built for the Centennial. Even though the house had Class 2 Historical status the township's Historical Committee reached a compromise allowing the house to be demolished after realizing fire damage from a <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> would cost an extensive amount to fix. The original house was demolished in August 2013 and a new house was completed in late 2014.|$|E

50|$|Brookside, {{also known}} as the Bass Mansion, was added, in 1982, to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1889, John Henry Bass (1835-1922), hired local architects Wing and Mahurin to build a Romanesque summer home named Brookside. He {{improved}} the landscape's aesthetic value with a man-made lake outlining the north, east and south exposures of the home. In 1902, a gas explosion ignited a <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> destroying all but a portion of the exterior masonry. By 1903, the resurrected home incorporated a combination of stone, concrete and steel which endure to this day.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} college building cornerstone {{was laid}} in May 1783, {{it opened in}} 1788 after selling off acreage and starting a lottery to fund the project. The hall was still incomplete by 1794 and was destroyed by a <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> January 11, 1827. The oldest existing building, Middle Hall, was erected in 1844 {{on the site of}} the original college building. By 1860, Middle Hall was joined by East and West Halls. All three structures, known as the Hill Dorms, are on the Maryland Register of Historic Places.|$|E
50|$|Many trees {{still had}} snow on {{them from the}} winter storm of the {{previous}} week to exacerbate the damage. Nearly 300,000 power outages occurred. PECO Energy reported about 185,000 of its southeastern Pennsylvania customers lost power. Power was not completely restored to the last few until {{the afternoon of the}} 6th. Pennsylvania Power and Light reported about 79,000 of their customers lost power in Eastern and Central Pennsylvania; while Metropolitan Edison reported around 14,000 of its customers lost power in Berks County. Numerous schools cancelled classes on both the 1st and 2nd. Recycling and garbage pick-ups were delayed. This winter storm added additional strains to snow removal budgets and tight salt supplies. Reading, Hamburg, Boyertown, Birdsboro, Barto, Bechtelsville and Douglassville all suffered power outages. In Bucks County, downed wires in Milford caused a <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> in one home on Sleepy Hollow Road. In Montgomery County, the worst reported tree and ice damage occurred in Lansdale and Hatfield. A utility pole fire in Pottstown knocked out power to the borough's water treatment plant. There were over 100 reports of downed wires throughout Northampton County.|$|E
5000|$|Saugus General Hospital {{was founded}} in 1946 as a 26-bed {{surgical}} center. In 1961 a major addition was constructed, which raised capacity to 142 beds, including 20 bassinets for newborns. On February 3, 1964, a fire was started in the hospital's <b>basement.</b> The <b>fire</b> resulted in $2000 in damages and the relocation of 96 patients. It was the sixth {{in a series of}} arsons in town that included fires in three schools and one church. However, the Saugus youth who admitted to starting the other five fires denied starting the blaze at Saugus General Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The first station {{built at}} Quincy Point was a Greek Revival wood frame {{structure}} erected in 1844; this was replaced in 1893 by a Shingle style building {{that included a}} tall tower for drying hoses. The current building was constructed in 1941 to a design by George E. Robinson, a Boston architect with a known reputation for his firehouse designs. His design lacked the then-typical hose drying tower, opting instead for drying facilities (eventually supplemented by a heating system to speed the process) in the <b>basement.</b> (Modern <b>fire</b> hoses {{no longer need to}} be dried after use.) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the past}} twenty years, many severe {{basement}} fires occurred and caused huge losses of human lives and damages to property in Taiwan. During a building fire, smoke at high temperatures and poisonous gases (such as CO) may easily spread through corridors and ventilation systems in the entire building. Therefore, protecting against the basement fires in commercial buildings is of important concern for Taiwan’s fire protection authority. This paper utilizes FDS (Fire Dynamic Simulator) to construct a computer simulation model for investigating the Cardon <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> that occurred in Taipei (1993). The fire accident unfortunately caused tremendous property losses and heavy casualties (22 died and 7 were injured). The major important parameters of the flow field- such as speed {{to the spread of}} fire, smoke movement, upper layer temperature, and CO concentration are obtained to analyze and understand the fire dynamic characteristics. The computed results reasonably agree with post-accident reports. The simulation results obtained may be utilized to improve the better and safer designs for basement building fire protection capability. The information can also be valuable for the similar fire disaster prevention and mitigation in the future...|$|E
40|$|This Fire Protection Engineering {{analysis}} was performed on Building 910 in Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA to examine the building’s fire safety and fire protection criteria which originally adhered to the 1985 Uniform Building Code. The object of this analysis {{is to determine the}} degree of compliance with the prescriptive codes in place today as well compliance with performance based analysis. For the prescriptive analysis consisted of evaluating the buildings occupancy classification, type of construction, egress design, fire detection and alarm systems, fire sprinkler system, Halon System, and structural fire protection are evaluated in terms of the life safety of the occupants. Each system was examined based on the requirements of the 2013 California Building Code and the 2013 California Fire Code, and the corresponding NFPA codes and standards. The sprinkler water demand was calculated and compared to the available supply to ensure adequacy of the water pressure and flow. The fire alarm system was analyzed for proper spacing of detection and adequate response of audio and visual notification appliances. The electrical demand of the alarm system was calculated to ensure the battery backup supply was sufficient for the required duration. The Halon system was evaluated to verify an adequate supply and concentration for total flooding as well as keeping in acceptable toxicity limits. The structural fire protection analysis confirmed proper materials and separation requirements existed in the building. In the performance based design analysis computer models were used to simulate egress in fire conditions. These models produced outputs that could be compared to pre-selected acceptable tenability limits for the occupants to determine if the Available Safe Egress Time (ASET) was longer than the Required Safe Egress Time (RSET). This outcome would signify a successful performance. In the first design fire scenario several scattered items located under a part of machinery related to a boiler ignites after being exposed to radiative heat from a nearby boiler. The fire is shielded from the high temperature ceiling sprinklers which are located at a height of 18 feet which never activate during the 10 -minute fire model due to the combination of ceiling height, temperature ratings and the relatively small size of the fire. The boiler room doors were assumed to be left propped open enabling the passage of smoke into the exit corridor. The RSET was calculated to be 140 seconds while the ASET was 580 seconds. The tenability test was easily passed for the <b>basement</b> <b>fire</b> as the relatively few (50) basement occupants exit the building in {{less than half of the}} available time. In the second design fire scenario a work station with an excessive fire load is ignited when a space heater is left on for several hours. The ensuing fire size is potentially 1. 5 MW, however the sprinklers activate beginning at 70 seconds at the heat release rate (HRR) of 195 kW and the fire does not grow any larger. The required safe egress time (RSET) is calculated to be 253 seconds, while the conditions remain tenable for at least 260 seconds in both directions of egress...|$|E

5000|$|The new {{building}} {{was completed in}} 1908, and all the students were moved to it. This structure, designed in the Craftsman style by architect Charles Insco Williams, {{was the first to}} be named Olive Branch High School, although it also still housed the lower grades of sub-district 3. Known locally as the [...] "little round school house", [...] "little round building" [...] or [...] "little round O.B.", this building had a unique circular design with four classrooms that pointed inward to face a central cafeteria and gymnasium. The building was destroyed when a boiler in the <b>basement</b> caught <b>fire</b> on November 10, 1913. Classes were held in a barn until a replacement building was finished in December 1914, at a cost of just under $15,000, for which $7,000 in bonds were issued earlier that year. Built on the same foundation, it was identical to the original building, but had doors added to each classroom so students could easily exit the building in case of fire.|$|R

5|$|While passing {{near the}} British Isles on September6 as an extratropical storm, Danielle {{produced}} severe sea {{conditions on the}} western part of the isles. Major beach erosion was observed, and many people required rescuing. Coastal portions of Cornwall were evacuated as high waves inundated many homes, and an all-terrain police vehicle was shoved into the sea by a rogue wave in the Isles of Scilly. An 11‑year-old boy and his father were trapped in a sea cave on the north coast of Cornwall due to rough surf. Two other men from Port Isaac also became isolated in the same location after their boat capsized. All four were eventually rescued by a helicopter that hovered near the entrance of the sea cave. At the West Sands Caravan Park near Selsey, West Sussex, twelve families were evacuated to higher ground. A yacht filled with eight people ran aground near Calshot; they required rescuing by the Solent Coastguards. Flash flooding was reported throughout Wiltshire, especially in the city of Melksham.

5000|$|A serious fire erupted {{just after}} 1pm on 8 May 1979 at the Manchester store {{opposite}} Piccadilly Gardens, {{said at the}} time to be the largest Woolworths in Europe, with six floors plus two <b>basement</b> levels.

Of the 12 calls made to the fire service that day, none came from the store itself. It is believed that the fire was started by a damaged electrical cable, which had furniture stacked in front of it. An inquiry showed that, although the store's fire precautions met all legal requirements, the spread of the fire and the high number of casualties were in part due to the absence of measures such as a fire sprinkler system {{to stop the spread of}} the fire from the furniture department, and the use of polyurethane foam in the furnishings, a material which is highly inflammable and highly toxic but cheap and at that time legal in furniture; however, this would have consequences for later legislation.|$|R
50|$|Burke's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He {{fought with}} extreme gallantry {{in the streets}} of war-torn Nuremberg, Germany, where Company D, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry, was engaged in rooting out fanatical defenders of the citadel of Nazism. As battalion transportation officer he had gone forward to select a motor-pool site, when, in a desire to perform more than his assigned duties and participate in the fight, he advanced beyond the lines of the forward riflemen. Detecting a group of about 10 Germans making preparations for a local counterattack, he rushed back to a nearby American company, secured a light machinegun with ammunition, and daringly opened fire on this superior force, which deployed and returned his fire with machine pistols, rifles, and rocket launchers. From another angle a German machinegun tried to blast him from his emplacement, but 1st Lt. Burke killed this guncrew and drove off the survivors of the unit he had originally attacked. Giving his next attention to enemy infantrymen in ruined buildings, he picked up a rifle dashed more than 100 yards through intense fire and engaged the Germans from behind an abandoned tank. A sniper nearly hit him from a cellar only 20 yards away, but he dispatched this adversary by running directly to the <b>basement</b> window, <b>firing</b> a full clip into it and then plunging through the darkened aperture to complete the job. He withdrew from the fight only long enough to replace his jammed rifle and secure grenades, then re-engaged the Germans. Finding his shots ineffective, he pulled the pins from 2 grenades, and, holding 1 in each hand, rushed the enemy-held building, hurling his missiles just as the enemy threw a potato masher grenade at him. In the triple explosion the Germans were wiped out and 1st Lt. Burke was dazed; but he emerged from the shower of debris that engulfed him, recovered his rifle, and went on to kill 3 more Germans and meet the charge of a machine pistolman, whom he cut down with 3 calmly delivered shots. He then retired toward the American lines and there assisted a platoon in a raging, 30-minute fight against formidable armed hostile forces. This enemy group was repulsed, and the intrepid fighter moved to another friendly group which broke the power of a German unit armed with a 20-mm gun in a fierce fire fight. In 4 hours of heroic action, 1st Lt. Burke single-handedly killed 11 and wounded 3 enemy soldiers and took a leading role in engagements in which an additional 29 enemy were killed or wounded. His extraordinary bravery and superb fighting skill were an inspiration to his comrades, and his entirely voluntary mission into extremely dangerous territory hastened the fall of Nuremberg, in his battalion's sector.|$|R
