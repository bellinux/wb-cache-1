Four split and two whole inactivated virus (WIV) influenza vaccine bulks were produced and compared with respect to release criteria, stability of the bulk and haemagglutinin recovery. One clarified harvest of influenza H 3 N 2 A/Uruguay virus prepared on 25. 000 fertilized eggs was divided equally over six downstream processes. The main unit operation for purification was sucrose gradient zonal ultracentrifugation.

Thus, accidental contamination of biologics with mycoplasmas represents a potential risk for the health of individuals who receive cell-derived biological and pharmaceutical products. To assess the efficiency of inactivation of mycoplasmas by the agents used in the manufacture of egg-derived influenza vaccines, we carried out a series of experiments aimed at monitoring the viability of mycoplasmas spiked into both chicken allantoic fluid and protein-rich microbiological media and then treated with <b>beta-propiolactone,</b> formalin, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, Triton X- 100, and sodium deoxycholate, which are agents that are commonly used for virus inactivation and disruption of viral particles during influenza vaccine production. Twenty-two mycoplasma species (with one to four strains of each species) were exposed to these inactivating agents at different concentrations. The most efficient inactivation of the mycoplasmas evaluated was observed with either 0. 5 % Triton X- 100 or 0. 5 % sodium deoxycholate. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at concentrations of ≥ 0. 08 % was also able to rapidly inactivate (in less than 30 min) all mycoplasmas tested. In contrast, negligible reductions in mycoplasma titers were observed with 0. 0125 to 0. 025 % formaldehyde. However, increasing the concentration of formaldehyde to 0. 1 to 0. 2 % improved the mycoplasmacidal effect. Incubation of mycoplasmas with 0. 1 % <b>beta-propiolactone</b> for 1 to 24 h had a marked mycoplasmacidal effect.

The seven strains reached the peak of virus production 3 to 5 days after inoculation of the cell culture; PV yielded the highest virus titer (10 (9) plaque-forming units/ml). The infectivity of virus suspensions containing 10 (7) to 10 (8) plaque-forming units/ 0. 1 ml was inactivated by <b>beta-propiolactone</b> in 0. 5 h, acetylethylenimine in 3. 0 h, and ethylenimine in 1. 0 h. Most of the vaccine lots prepared with the different strains and inactivating agents passed a modified National Institutes of Health potency test. The vaccines prepared with the PV strain had consistently higher antigenic values (equal or better than four) than the other six strains. This difference was highly significant (F 6, 12 = 59. 8), whereas there were no statistically significant differences among the antigenic values of the vaccine lots prepared with the three inactivating agents. Batches of lyophilized and liquid vaccine stored at 4 C maintained potency for over 1 year. Ten dogs vaccinated with a vaccine prepared with the PV strain and inactivated with ethylenimine developed a good antibody response and resisted challenge 60 days after vaccination, while seven of eight nonvaccinated controls died of rabies.

As DDA could be administered to animals at a site different from the measles virus antigens, or 1 day previously, and still significantly enhance the DTH response, DDA is probably acting more as an immune modulator than as a simple adjuvant.

We show that non-inactivated, purified rabies virus unfolds cooperatively in two events centered at approximately 62 and 73 °C. <b>Beta-propiolactone</b> (BPL) treatment does not alter significantly viral unfolding behavior, indicating that viral inactivation does not alter protein structure significantly. The first unfolding event was absent in bromelain treated samples, causing an elimination of the G-protein ectodomain, suggesting that this event corresponds to G-protein unfolding. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that this first event was shifted to higher temperatures in the presence of three monoclonal, G-protein specific antibodies. We show that dithiothreitol treatment of the virus abolishes the first unfolding event, indicating that the reduction of G-protein disulfide bonds causes dramatic alterations to protein structure. Inactivated virus samples heated up to 70 °C also showed abolished recognition of conformational G-protein specific antibodies by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis.

DNA preparations exposed to chemicals known to bind covalently to DNA [N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, dimethyl sulfate, formaldehyde, <b>beta-propiolactone,</b> propylene oxide, streptozotocin, nitrogen mustard, and 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea] were digested to a mixture of deoxynucleoside 3 '-monophosphates by incubation with micrococcal endonuclease (EC 3. 1. 31. 1) and spleen exonuclease (EC 3. 1. 16. 1). The digests were treated with [gamma- 32 P]ATP and T 4 polynucleotide kinase (ATP: 5 '-dephosphopolynucleotide 5 '-phosphotransferase, EC 2. 7. 1. 78) to convert the monophosphates to 5 '- 32 P-labeled deoxynucleoside 3 ', 5 '-bis-phosphates. These compounds were then separated on polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layers in ammonium formate and ammonium sulfate solutions. Autoradiograms of the chromatograms obtained by this high-resolution procedure showed the presence of nucleotides derived from chemically altered, as well as normal, DNA constituents. Maps from DNA exposed {{to any of the}} chemicals used exhibited a spot pattern typical for the particular chemical. This method detected a single adduct in 10 (5) DNA nucleotides without requiring that the compound under investigation be radioactive and thus provides a useful test to screen chemicals for their capacity to damage DNA by covalent binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{formalin}} on the infectivity and immunogenicity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotype Indiana were investigated. We found that formalin inactivation of VSV prevents infection of Vero cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, {{as shown by}} fluorometric cell analysis and inhibition of plaque formation. Inactivated VSV failed to induce significant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses in vivo or after restimulation in vitro. In contrast, the early immunoglobulin M (IgM) response, which is T help independent in the VSV system, was unaltered, suggesting normal antigenicity for and induction of B cells. However, no switch to IgG occurred, demonstrating failure of induction of T help. If cross-reactive T help was provided by previous infection with a second serotype of VSV (New Jersey), the IgG response was almost completely restored, confirming {{that the absence of}} IgG was due to lack of T help. A formalin-treated preparation of glycoprotein of VSV led to a delayed but otherwise normal IgG response, whereas treatment of VSV with UV light or <b>beta-propiolactone</b> reduced IgG titers to the same extent as did formalin. These results suggest that loss of infectivity and the ensuing lack of amplification of viral antigens of formaldehyde-inactivated VSV is the major factor impairing induction of specific T-helper cell responses...|$|E
40|$|A general {{treatment}} of macrocyclization reactions occurring under thermodynamic control is presented. The fundamental quantities {{on which the}} treatment is based are the effective molarities of the cyclic oligomers and the equilibrium constant for the intermolecular model reaction between monofunctional reactants (K(inter)). Four typical cases have been considered, namely, addition and condensation of a monomer of the type A-B, addition of A-A, and addition of A-A + B-B. A critical comparison with the classical theory of Jacobson and Stockmayer is presented. It is shown that the phenomenon characterized by the critical monomer concentration (cut-off point) is a limiting phenomenon which would occur only for infinitely large values of K(inter). The treatment has been successfully applied to the DOS/DTC-induced cyclooligomerization of <b>beta-propiolactone</b> in CDCl 3 solution that yields well-behaved ring-chain equilibrates closely adhering to the theoretical model. Best fit of the experimental product distributions to the general equations gave the equilibrium constant (K(inter)) of the intermolecular model reaction, {{as well as the}} effective molarities (EM(i)) for the cyclic oligomers from trimer to octamer. The EM(i) values decrease in proportion of the - 2. 5 power of the oligomerization degree, thus providing a strong indication that the oligomeric polylactones are essentially strainless. The extremely low value of K(inter) (2. 5) is responsible for the absence of a cut-off point, which is usually present in ring-chain polymeric equilibrates...|$|E
40|$|Inactivation of HIV- 1 {{contaminated}} {{materials or}} biological samples {{is of great}} importance and {{requires the use of}} a reliable assay to detect residual infectivity. In this study we treated cell-free or cell-associated (monocyte-derived macrophages) HIV- 1 with two chemicals known for their antiviral activities, <b>beta-propiolactone</b> (beta PL) and formaldehyde (FO), and tested it for the presence of residual infectivity. HIV- 1 infected primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) or cell-free HIV- 1 were fixed with increasing concentrations of either beta PL or FO for 1 day at 4 degrees C. Then either fresh primary MDM or fresh medium was added, and the supernatant p 24 levels were assayed up to 12 days after infection. All the supernatants harvested were added to indicator cells, fresh primary MDM, to assess for residual infectivity. The results show that p 24 measurement is not a reliable assay for the detection of residual infectious virions after chemical fixation of HIV-infected primary MDM. In contrast, the use of indicator primary cells (MDM) is a much more sensitive and reliable assay. By performing an indicator cell assay we showed that FO efficiently inactivates cell-associated and cell-free HIV- 1 at concentrations as low as 1 % v/v. In contrast beta PL is more efficient in inactivating cell-free than cell-associated virus and does not inactivate cell-associated HIV- 1 at concentrations as high as 1 % v/v...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} two whole IgG polyvalent antivenoms (A and B) were compared in a randomised, blinded clinical trial in 67 patients systemically envenomed by Bothrops asper in Colombia. Both antivenoms were fractionated by caprylic acid precipitation and had similar neutralising potencies, protein concentrations and aggregate contents. Antivenom B was additionally treated with <b>beta-propiolactone</b> to lower its anticomplementary activity. Analysing all treatment regimens together, {{there were no significant}} differences between the two antivenoms (A= 34 patients; B= 33 patients) in the time taken to reverse venom-induced bleeding and coagulopathy, to restore physiological fibrinogen concentrations and to clear serum venom antigenaemia. Blood coagulability was restored within 6 - 24 h in 97 % of patients, all of whom had normal coagulation and plasma fibrinogen levels 48 h after the start of antivenom treatment. Two patients (3. 0 %) had recurrent coagulopathy and eight patients suffered recurrence of antigenaemia within 72 h of treatment. None of the dosage regimens of either antivenom used guaranteed resolution of venom-induced coagulopathy within 6 h, nor did they prevent recurrences. A further dose of antivenom at 6 h also did not guarantee resolution of coagulopathy within 12 - 24 h in all patients. The incidence of early adverse reactions (all mild) was similar for both antivenoms (15 % and 24 %; P> 0. 05) ...|$|E
