50|$|More recently, Gordon Muir Giles {{has been}} {{reporting}} on interventions {{for persons with}} acquired neurological impairments and <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder.</b> Beginning in the 1980s applied behaviour analysis principles were introduced for use with persons with TBI. By the late 1990s however it was recognised that up {{to a third of}} persons with TBI and <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> were unable to make use of standard behavioural interventions. Non-aversive approaches to <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> after TBI are consistent with concepts in psychiatric rehabilitation and positive behavioural supports in work with persons with mental retardation but were developed independently from them. The interventions stress a philosophy of normalisation, respect, non-confrontation, positive engagement, support, and functional and behavioural skill development. The approach is based on the observation that much of the behavioural disregulation is hostile/irritable aggression and not instrumental in nature. The interventions attempt to reduce environmental stressors and instigations to aggression and to use inclusion and positive engagement to reduce the frequency of aggressive behaviour. Evidence is currently limited to small-scale proof of concept designs and the approaches have not been subjected to randomised controlled investigations.|$|E

50|$|Automatism is a {{rarely used}} {{criminal}} defence. It {{is one of}} the mental condition defences that relate to the mental state of the defendant. Automatism can be seen variously as lack of voluntariness, lack of culpability (unconsciousness) or excuse (Schopp). Automatism means that the defendant was not aware of his or her actions when making the particular movements that constituted the illegal act. For example, Esther Griggs in 1858 threw her child out of a first floor window believing that the house was on fire, while having a night terror. Brian Thomas strangled his wife in their campervan in a more recent case in Aberporth in an episode of rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> (a disorder related to sleepwalking), where he dreamed there was an intruder on top of his wife. The defence of automatism is denying that the person was acting {{in the sense that the}} criminal law demands. As such it is really a denial-of-proof - the defendant is asserting that the offence is not made out. The prosecution does not have to disprove the defence as is sometimes erroneously reported; the prosecution has to prove all the elements of the offence including the voluntary act requirement. Automatism is a defence even against strict liability crimes like dangerous driving, where no intent is necessary.|$|E

Currently, it is unclear whether these changes are present in so-called idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder,</b> a condition associated with a high rate of future conversion to Parkinsons disease. In this study, we explore the utility of resting state functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} to detect basal ganglia network dysfunction in rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder.</b> We compare these data to a set of healthy control subjects, and to a set of patients with established early Parkinsons disease.

Twenty-six patients with polysomnographically-established rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder,</b> 48 patients with Parkinsons disease and 23 healthy control subjects were included in this study. Resting state networks were isolated from task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data using dual regression with a template derived from a separate cohort of 80 elderly healthy control participants.

However, idiopathic {{rapid eye movement}} sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> can precede parkinsonism and dementia by several years. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging and neuromelanin-sensitive sequences, we previously found that the signal intensity was reduced in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus area of patients with Parkinson’s disease and {{rapid eye movement sleep}} <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder.</b> Here, we studied the integrity of the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex with neuromelanin-sensitive imaging in 21 patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep <b>behaviour</b> <b>disorder</b> and compared the results with those from 21 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. All subjects underwent a clinical examination, motor, cognitive, autonomous, psychological, olfactory and colour vision tests, and rapid eye movement sleep characterization using video-polysomnography and 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. The patients more frequently had preclinical markers of alpha-synucleinopathies, including constipation, olfactory deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and subtle motor impairment. Using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging, reduced signal intensity was identified in the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus complex of the patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour. The mean sensitivity of the visual analyses of the signal performed by neuroradiologists who were blind to the clinical diagnoses was 82. 5 %, and the specificity was 81 % for the identification of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour.

40|$|This research, as a multiple-participant case study, has {{explored}} {{the integration of}} Self Psychology and art therapy with three women who have disorders of self known as Narcissistic <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disorders.</b> These disorders are defined in Self Psychology {{by the presence of}} perversion, addiction and/or delinquency that represent the enactment of fantasies that are markedly and decidedly narcissistic in nature. In this thesis, only addiction and perversion were considered feasible for psychotherapy in which the integration of Self Psychology and art therapy were achieved. The findings of this research support this integration as a form of psychotherapy that is successful in treating women who can be diagnosed as having Narcissistic <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disorders.</b> In the case of the abuse of alcohol, the abuse of food and the presence of sexual self-mutilation, this integration was found to provide patient-participants with the opportunity to use the art as external, healthy transitional selfobjects that could replace the external ersatz selfobjects of food and alcohol and the objects that had become sexualised as part of the perversion. In breaking from findings on treating addiction within Self Psychology, this research provided evidence to support the use of the transitional selfobjects in the form of art within the self-selfobject relationship with the psychotherapist-researcher. This finding backs the move to the use of transference and the self-selfobject psychotherapeutic relationship as the guiding context for psychotherapy, while moving away from the notion that people with Narcissistic <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disorders</b> should use the psychotherapist for the purposes of healing. Instead, the emphasis in the current findings is that the art can be used within the therapeutic relationship, providing two forms of selfobjects for the patient, each with a different purpose. This research has generated guidelines for psychotherapists and art therapists who wish to integrate art therapy and Self Psychology. An absence of literature in art therapy based on the paradigm of Self Psychology has made these guidelines a working model that will need further refinement and research. These guidelines are derived from the analysis of data that revealed how the integration of Self Psychology and art therapy articulated and manifested the diagnosis, understanding and treatment of three women with Narcissistic <b>Behaviour</b> <b>Disorders</b> in long-term art therapy informed by Self Psychology.
