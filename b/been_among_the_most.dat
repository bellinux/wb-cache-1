5|$|Although {{the series}} is {{extremely}} popular in Japan, by 2002 the success in Japan had not transferred to North America. Although the first four games {{to be released in}} America generally received good reviews, Nintendo had to give away copies of Dragon Warrior. However, those four games have <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> sought-after titles for the NES, especially Dragon WarriorIII and IV. It was not until Dragon WarriorVII was released that Dragon Quest became critically acclaimed in North America, although reception was still mixed. The series gained more universal praise with Dragon QuestVIII, and began to sell better outside Japan and Dragon QuestIX sold over 1million copies outside Japan.|$|E

It was assumed that the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog had almost died out by the late 19th century, because their work was being done by other breeds or machines, but they were rediscovered in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|The Puranas {{have been}} {{influential}} in the Hindu culture. They are considered Vaidika (congruent with Vedic literature). The Bhagavata Purana has <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> celebrated and popular text in the Puranic genre, and is of non-dualistic tenor. The Puranic literature wove with the Bhakti movement in India, and both Dvaita and Advaita scholars have commented on the underlying Vedanta themes in the Maha Puranas.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus is {{considered}} to have <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important Greek astronomers, because he introduced the concept of exact prediction into astronomy.

25|$|Fluency in Pashto {{is often}} the main {{determinant}} of group acceptance as to who is considered a Pashtun. Pashtun nationalism emerged following the rise of Pashto poetry that linked language and ethnic identity. Pashto has national status in Afghanistan and regional status in neighboring Pakistan. In addition to their native tongue, many Pashtuns are fluent in Urdu, Dari, and English. Throughout their history, poets, prophets, kings and warriors have <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> revered members of Pashtun society. Early written records of Pashto began to appear around the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|A {{complete}} ring {{has much}} simpler structure than a commutative ring. This owns to the Cohen structure theorem, which says, roughly, that a complete local ring tends {{to look like}} a formal power series ring or a quotient of it. On the other hand, the interaction between the integral closure and completion has <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important aspects that distinguish modern commutative ring theory from the classical one developed by the likes of Noether. Pathological examples found by Nagata led to the reexamination of the roles of Noetherian rings and motivated, among other things, the definition of excellent ring.|$|E
25|$|Tickets to Maple Leafs' {{home games}} have long <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{difficult}} to acquire even during losing seasons. The Air Canada Centre holds 18,900 seats for Leafs games, with 15,500 reserved for season ticket holders. Because {{of the demand}} for season tickets, their sale {{is limited to the}} 10,000 people on the waiting list. As of March 2016, Leafs' season tickets saw a renewal rate of 99.5 percent, a rate that would require more than 250 years to clear the existing waiting list. With an average of US$1.9 million per game, the Leafs had the highest average ticket revenue per game in the 2007–08 season.|$|E

25|$|Mexico has {{traditionally}} <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> visited {{countries in the}} world according to the World Tourism Organization and it is the most visited country in the Americas, after the United States. The most notable attractions are the Mesoamerican ruins, cultural festivals, colonial cities, nature reserves and the beach resorts. The nation's wide range of climates, from temperate to tropical, and unique culture – a fusion of the European and the Mesoamerican – make Mexico an attractive destination. The peak tourism seasons in the country are during December and the mid-Summer, with brief surges during the week before Easter and Spring break, when many of the beach resort sites become popular destinations for college students from the United States.|$|E
25|$|The {{school has}} nearly 2,000 students, {{exceeding}} its design capacity and resulting in overcrowding {{and many other}} major problems. Fremont's population has grown from less than 50,000 when the school was built in 1964 to well over 200,000 today. Almost every school in the city has space issues stemming from this population explosion (four of the five {{high schools in the}} district have at least 1,500 students), but Mission has <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> impacted. Even after a significant redistricting by the Fremont Unified School District in the late 1990s, which reassigned much of the Warm Springs area students (mostly from Weibel Elementary School, causing significant unrest in the community) from Mission to Irvington High School, Mission's enrollment is once again at about 2,200.|$|E
25|$|All {{these five}} types {{were found in}} numbers, in many localities, and have evidently <b>been</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common and {{generally}} used implements during the Equatorial Stone Age. In minor respects they exhibit considerable variety, and there are large differences in their size, thickness, and weight. The type P-T was the most numerous. The greater part have holes drilled from each side (with the holes having less in diameter in the middle than on their surfaces), though in some the aperture is as broad internally as externally. The positions of the holes vary, some being central, although {{most of them are}} nearest to the top. The lower edge is always the sharpest; and, while many would not have cut butter, there are a few sharp enough to cut wood. Their weight ranges from 3¼ to 29 ounces, and like the stars in stone they have been fashioned from a diversity of rocks.|$|E
