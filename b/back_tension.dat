2500|$|Tube sinking, {{also known}} as free tube drawing, reduces the {{diameter}} of the tube without a mandrel inside the tube. The inner diameter (ID) is determined by the inner and outer diameter of the stock tube, the outer diameter of the final product, the length of the die landing, the amount of <b>back</b> <b>tension,</b> and the friction between the tube and the die. This type of drawing operation is the most economical, especially on thick-walled tubes and tubes smaller than [...] in diameter, but does not give the best surface finish.

The release is held in the fist, with the mechanism usually poking out between index and middle finger. A handled release uses one of two different styles of a mechanism either by using a <b>back</b> <b>tension</b> or a thumb switch.

5000|$|Mechanically, {{the device}} is simple: the only moving parts are the spear shaft and the rubber tubing. A loop of tubing is {{attached}} to a block of material, often wood, with a hole drilled in it which is slightly larger in diameter than the shaft. The shaft is placed in the hole, notched in the loop and pulled <b>back,</b> <b>tensioning</b> the tubing. When the shaft is released, the tubing propels it forward, faster and further than a diver could by hand.|$|R
50|$|Thumb switch release {{aids are}} the most complicated, with the most moving parts of the three most common releases. They work on the {{depression}} of a thumb switch that is mounted to a T-handle's style of release. The attraction to these release aids are {{that they are a}} good midpoint between a caliper and <b>back</b> <b>tension</b> style of release aids, making the transition {{from one to the other}} a little smoother over a longer period of time.|$|E
50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>tension</b> release {{aids are}} the {{simplest}} mechanically, {{with only one}} moving part. However, {{as a result of}} this, they are the hardest style of release to learn how to use.

These releases are known for their accuracy and dependability on the tournament archery scene. They depend on the fulcrum of a lever over a half-moon-shaped piece of metal in order for the release to go off.|$|E

40|$|The {{single stand}} rolling mill {{governing}} equation is a non-linear function on several parameters (input thickness, front and <b>back</b> <b>tensions,</b> yield stress and friction coefficient among others). Any alteration {{in one of}} them will cause alterations on the rolling load and, consequently, on the outgoing thickness. This paper presents a method to determinate the appropriate adjustment for thickness control considering three possible control parameters: roll gap, front and <b>back</b> <b>tensions.</b> The method uses a predictive model based in the sensitivity equation of the process, where the sensitivity factors are obtained by differentiating a neural network previously trained. The method considers as the best control action the one that demands the smallest adjustment. One of the capital issues in the controller design for rolling systems is the difficulty to measure the final thickness without time delays. The time delay is a consequence of the location of the outgoing thickness sensor that is always placed to some distance {{to the front of the}} roll gap. The proposed control system calculates the necessary adjustment based on a predictive model for the output thickness. This model permits to overcome the time delay that exists in such processes and can eliminate the thickness sensor, usually based on X-ray. Simulation results show the viability of the proposed technique...|$|R

40|$|Objective. Assess the eect of dierent {{controlled}} lumbar {{back support}} tightness levels on trunk muscle activity. Design. Two-way repeated measure design assessing lumbar <b>back</b> support <b>tension</b> and submaximal trunk extension moments on trunk muscle electromyographic activity. Background. Biomechanical studies on lumbar back supports often use electromyography (EMG) {{to assess the}} aect on trunk muscle activity. However, the lumbar back support may alter the electromyographic signal by changing the electrode–muscle distance. Methods. Subjects performed trunk extensions at three static submaximal extension moment levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 % MVC) while stabilized at the hips and shoulders, with the <b>back</b> support <b>tensioned</b> to three dierent tightness levels (44. 5, 66. 7 and 89. 0 N) {{as well as a}} no-back support condition. Results. Statistical analysis failed to find a significant eect (P 6 0 : 05) of lumbar <b>back</b> support <b>tension</b> on the average normalized EMG across the 10 trunk muscles sampled. Conclusions. For static experimental tasks, as long as electrodes are protected from direct contact with the back support, studies assessing the eect of lumbar back supports on the trunk muscles via EMG during static tasks are not subject to confounding due to dierences in tensions across subjects. Relevance The {{results of this study suggest}} that variable tensions from previous studies for static exertions with lumbar back supports do not significantly alter the pick-up volume of protected electrodes.

40|$|The texture {{inhomogeneity}} during rolling {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} problems. Especially, shear textures develops more easily during ferritic rolling of steel sheets at high temperatures owing to friction between rolls and the material. In this study, the influence of front and back tensions on the texture development during ferritic rolling has been studied. The rolling textures were simulated using the full constraints Taylor-Bishop-Hill model with the strain history obtained from finite element analysis. The calculated textures showed that the <b>back</b> <b>tension</b> rolling could reduce the shear component more effectively than front tension or rolling without tension.

30|$|This {{could be}} due to the {{alternating}} expansion and constriction that is a reciprocal recovery period to each other, which makes the impacts on alveolus less. For a 7 -week Alt-RAMEC, the three constrictions reciprocally relieve the expansion force and alternate the buccal alveolus from pressure to tension side and the palatal alveolus from tension to pressure side. Similarly, the four expansions reciprocally relieve the constriction force and alternate the buccal alveolus from <b>tension</b> <b>back</b> to pressure side and the palatal alveolus from pressure <b>back</b> to <b>tension</b> side. At the same time, the expansion and constriction force also reciprocally disarticulates the circumaxillary sutures with less impact on the sutures.

40|$|Abstract [...] Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} for carefully controlled plane-strain strip drawing experiments. Transparent aluminum oxide (sapphire) dies {{have been used to}} make direct observations of the die-work interface in strip drawing, including the distortion of scribed lines which were used for estimating velocity profiles at the interface. Such profiles can be used as input to theoretical models (Appleby et al., 1984), thus permitting the calculation of interface friction rather than requiring its assumption. Experiments were conducted with tungsten carbide, as well as sapphire, dies in which process parameters such as reduction, speed, die angle, lubricant, and <b>back</b> <b>tension</b> were varied, and die separating forces and drawing loads were measured. In general the frictiot ~ was lower for the sapphire dies, but the variation with process parameters was similar. For one experiment, residual stresses in the product strip were measured. The results are believed to be documented in sufficient detail to be of general use in evaluating theoretical models...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} interstand tension, {{resulting}} from the increase in relative rolling velocity in successive stands of continuous rolling with a round–oval–round sequence, on the roll load, rolling torque and workpiece deformation has been investigated. For this purpose, a simplified analytical approach has been formulated and validated by comparison with available experimental results. Based on this approach, a limiting value was determined for {{the increase in the}} ratio of relative rolling velocity between stands. When this limiting value is reached, the state of stress in the workpiece within the roll gap changes to a uniaxial state of stress that can lead to the loss of the ability of the work rolls to grip the workpiece and consequently these changes might make the rolling process unstable. The results have also shown that the roll load decreases with increasing interstand tension while the torque increases with an increase in <b>back</b> <b>tension</b> and decreases with an increase in front tension. The reduction in the outgoing maximum width of the workpiece as a result of interstand tension is linearly related to the increase in the ratio of relative rolling velocity between stands...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to predict the {{front-end}} curvature in hot strip finishing mills and to prevent it by controlling the rolling conditions. A theoretical model based on the slab method is developed for predicting the front-end curvature by taking into account the entrance angle of the strip, the friction condition and the <b>back</b> <b>tension.</b> To validate the developed theoretical model, the theoretically obtained curvature value is compared with the results of finite element analysis. Consequently, it is shown that the calculation results of the theoretical model are in good agreement with the measured results of the finite element analysis. Furthermore, a curvature control model based on geometrical and mathematical approaches that can reduce the front-end curvature by the control of the roll speed ratio of the upper to lower rolls is proposed. The proposed curvature control model is verified by finite element analysis, and it is shown that the front-end curvature can be reduced considerably using the proposed model. Therefore, it is concluded that the proposed control model for reducing the front-end curvature in a hot strip finishing mill can be used to improve the quality of the rolled product...|$|E
