5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off,</b> the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E
5|$|The brigade's next {{mission was}} Operation Manna. This time {{they would be}} landing in Greece. The Soviet Red Army advance in the east had forced the Germans to {{withdraw}} from the country or risk <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from any support or reinforcements. Over the night of 12/13 October 1944, the first of the brigade's units parachuted onto Megara airfield near Athens to prepare a landing zone for the follow-up waves {{from the rest of the}} brigade. The brigade moved into Athens and then over three months fought their way to Salonika and the border with Bulgaria.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, Bute {{was able}} to {{personally}} appoint the Constable of Cardiff Castle, and the constable by law acted as the effective mayor of Cardiff, ran the town's council and had wide powers when appointing local officials. He inherited the title of Lord-Lieutenant of the county in 1815, giving him the right to recommend the appointments of new magistrates and various other civic posts; potential candidates for these posts were advised to vote for Bute's representatives at elections. In 1825 he became the colonel {{in chief of the}} Royal Glamorgan Militia, and used this authority to instruct the militia to vote for his candidates. Those who publicly voted against Bute faced charitable donations and support <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> His later control of the Cardiff Docks also helped to provide patronage and influence voting behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, the Allied {{mission was}} simple. The fleet {{needed to protect}} the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> themselves. For the Persians, the {{strategic}} situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around {{the east coast of}} Euboea. The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea.|$|E
5|$|The Wellingtons and {{the rest}} of the New Zealand brigade were part of the force {{assigned}} to attack the village of Shunet Nimrin. At 03:30 when the brigade crossed over the Ghoraniyeh pontoon, the regiment came under command of the 180th (2/5th London) Brigade, providing protection for their right flank as they advanced on the village. The difficult terrain and the strength of the Turkish defences hindered progress, and by dusk they were still some distance away from their objective. The next day the advance continued, but in the face of growing Turkish resistance, and with the arrival of Turkish reinforcements, they were in danger of <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and surrounded. So on 4 May the whole force withdrew back across the River Jordan, leaving the Wellingtons behind to protect the bridge-head.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, {{exhausted}} North Korean {{troops were}} caught unaware by the landings at Inchon, far behind their lines. Those forces that remained after 15 days of fighting {{were forced to}} retreat in a total rout or risk <b>being</b> completely <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> Isolated North Korean resistance continued until September 18, but on that date UN troops were mounting a full-scale breakout offensive and pursuing retreating North Korean units to the north, ending the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, felt he could not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Khrushchev {{was on the}} Southwest Front, and he and Timoshenko {{proposed}} a massive counteroffensive in the Kharkov area. Stalin approved {{only part of the}} plan, but 640,000Red Army soldiers would still become involved in the offensive. The Germans, however, had deduced that the Soviets were likely to attack at Kharkov, and set a trap. Beginning on 12 May 1942, the Soviet offensive initially appeared successful, but within five days the Germans had driven deep into the Soviet flanks, and the Red Army troops were in danger of <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> Stalin refused to halt the offensive, and the Red Army divisions were soon encircled by the Germans. The USSR lost about 267,000soldiers, including more than 200,000men captured, and Stalin demoted Timoshenko and recalled Khrushchev to Moscow. While Stalin hinted at arresting and executing Khrushchev, he allowed the commissar to return to the front by sending him to Stalingrad.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Soviet troops {{advanced}} into Yugoslavia {{and forced}} the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups E and F in Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia to rescue them from <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> By this point, the Communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern Serbia, the Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of {{the capital city of}} Belgrade on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945. Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former allies.|$|E

5|$|When Galatas {{fell to the}} Germans on 25 May, the 20th Battalion was {{in danger}} of <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off.</b> It {{successfully}} regrouped and assisted in the recapture of the town. The battalion withdrew on 26 May, which marked the beginning a retreat to Hora Sfakion, on the southwest coast of Crete. Kippenberger rejoined the battalion after his previous command, the 10th Brigade, was disestablished after the capture of Galatas. On arrival at the evacuation beaches, it was found that there was insufficient room on the Australian destroyers that were the designated transport for all of the battalion's personnel. The bulk of the battalion was evacuated on 30 May although Kippenberger was forced to select 40 men to stay behind and form a rearguard under the command of Burrows. After manning defensive positions to prevent Germans infiltrating the cordon around the evacuation beaches, the rearguard was evacuated the following day.|$|E
5|$|As the {{situation}} worsened, early on 9 February 'A' Company, {{which had been}} in reserve, and HQ Company were sent forward to provide further assistance to the 22nd Infantry Brigade, which was slowly being pushed back towards the tactically important Tengah airfield, via the village of Ama Keng. They took up positions at Bulim, east of the airfield; shortly afterwards {{they were joined by}} 7 Platoon, from 'B' Company, which had been detached from the Causeway sector. The remnants of the 22nd, numbering around only 500 men from its original 2,500, with a further 500 or so isolated and attempting to fight their way through, was pushed further back throughout the day. Orders were passed for a counter-attack around the airfield but as the size of Japanese forces in the area grew to around 20,000 men, they were later cancelled in favour of establishing a line between Bulim and Jurong, to the east of the airfield. Established in the early afternoon, within this line, the 2/4th's 'A' Company was positioned east of Bulim with 7 Platoon, 'B' Company, while the remnants of 'D' Company, amounting to only 47 men, were moved south, where they joined with 'C' Company, which was supporting the Indian 44th Brigade, which although it had not yet been engaged, had fallen back from the south-west coast to avoid <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> and had established itself west of Ulu Pandan, behind the Sungei Jurong.|$|E
5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan {{tried his}} hand at a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help of his}} uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by him that was successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E

5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945, the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS fought first against British-supported partisans in the Julian Alps, and was then {{deployed}} to the coastal area around Trieste and the Marano-Grado Lagoon. In danger of <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by Allied forces, the brigade soon {{returned to the}} Julian Alps, having to fight {{its way through the}} Tagliamento river valley between Osoppo and Gemona. Toward the end of April 1945, the brigade fought British and New Zealand forces on the southern fringe of the Julian Alps. The brigade replacement company, which had been sent to Cividale from its training centre at Pottenstein, Bavaria, managed to destroy a number of British tanks with panzerfausts and the assistance of a tank company. In the final weeks of the war the brigade was part of a Kampfgruppe (battlegroup) commanded by SS-Brigadeführer und Generalmajor der Waffen-SS (Brigadier) Heinz Harmel, which was ordered to keep the Karawanks passes open between Yugoslavia and Austria. This task was critical in allowing German forces to withdraw from Yugoslavia in order to surrender to British rather than Yugoslav forces. The Kampfgruppe succeeded in its final task, {{and was one of the}} last German units to surrender, when it encountered the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid <b>being</b> <b>cut</b> <b>off</b> by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E
