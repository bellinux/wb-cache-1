5|$|In 1894, the Devon and Somerset <b>Badger</b> Club {{was founded}} by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed {{standard}} {{for this type of}} terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting <b>badger</b> digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset <b>Badger</b> Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset <b>Badger</b> Club, the aims of which were to promote <b>badger</b> digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of a {{range of}} animals have been found {{including}} the Pleistocene lion (Felis leo spelæ), Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) and <b>Badger</b> (Meles meles). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. <b>Badger</b> Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built on during the Roman era up {{to the end of the}} 4th century.|$|E
50|$|The West Virginia <b>Badgers</b> were a {{professional}} indoor football team based in Charles Town, West Virginia. The <b>Badgers</b> were {{a member of}} American Indoor Football (AIF). The <b>Badgers</b> began play in 2012 as an expansion member of the AIF. In 2012, they were based in Fredericksburg, Virginia, and were known as the Virginia <b>Badgers.</b> The <b>Badgers</b> played all their games {{on the road for}} their two seasons in the AIF.|$|R
50|$|The {{absence of}} <b>badgers</b> from Hokkaido, and the {{presence}} of related M. leucurus in Korea, suggest that the ancestral <b>badgers</b> reached Japan from the southwest via Korea. Genetic studies indicate that there are substantial differences between Japanese and Asian <b>badgers,</b> which were formerly considered conspecific, and that the Japanese <b>badgers</b> are genetically more homogenous.|$|R

5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and honey <b>badger</b> with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the honey <b>badger.</b> These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E

5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned <b>badger</b> and honey <b>badger</b> advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E

5|$|Nelson and <b>Badger</b> {{spent most}} of 1779 {{cruising}} off the Central American coast, ranging {{as far as the}} British settlements at British Honduras (now Belize), and Nicaragua, but without much success at interception of enemy prizes. On his return to Port Royal he learned that Parker had promoted him to post-captain on 11 June, and intended to give him another command. Nelson handed over the <b>Badger</b> to Cuthbert Collingwood while he awaited the arrival of his new ship, the 28-gun frigate , newly captured from the French. While Nelson waited, news reached Parker that a French fleet under the command of Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing, was approaching Jamaica. Parker hastily organized his defences and placed Nelson in command of Fort Charles, which covered the approaches to Kingston. D'Estaing instead headed north, and the anticipated invasion never materialised. Nelson duly took command of the Hinchinbrook on 1 September.|$|E

5|$|About 40percent of the tributaries that {{originally}} flowed {{over the surface}} of the watershed were piped or relocated during urban development, especially {{on the north side of}} the main stem. Generally, the remaining free-flowing tributaries begin south of the main stem and run north; the major exception is Crystal Springs Creek, which begins as a groundwater discharge and flows south. The other major tributaries are Hogan, Kelley, Butler, Sunshine, and <b>Badger</b> creeks. Crystal Springs and Kelley creeks contribute more flow to the main stem than the other tributaries.|$|E

5|$|By 1895 {{the only}} backs {{remaining}} from the 1893 Championship-winning team were Bancroft and Gould. Gould was now partnered with Owen <b>Badger,</b> who kept his {{place for the}} whole campaign. As the other teams adopted the Welsh style of play, Wales lost their advantage; the livelier English forwards outplayed their Welsh counterparts to give England victory in the opening game of the 1895 Championship.

25|$|The {{second half}} {{started with the}} <b>Badgers</b> marching 83 yards on the Gophers and scoring on a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Jared Abbrederis from Joel Stave. On the Gophers first play of the second half, RB David Cobb would stripped by Chris Borland and Borland would also recover the fumble. The <b>Badgers</b> had the ball at the Golden Gophers 26-yard line but could not get in the end zone. They tried a 38-yard field goal but missed. Minnesota would punt after unable {{to pick up a}} first down. The <b>Badgers</b> took over with very good field possession but would also punt the ball back to Minnesota. The Gophers picked up one first down but the <b>Badgers</b> defense again held firm and forced a punt that was returned by Jared Abbrederis down to the Gophers 33-yard line as the third quarter came to a close. Three straight incompletions by the <b>Badgers</b> would set up a fourth down where the <b>Badgers</b> tried a trick punt play that failed. A big 31-yard completion by the Gophers on their drive put them inside the <b>Badgers</b> 40-yard line. They could not pickup another first down and the <b>Badgers</b> defense held on a fourth down try by the Gophers. The <b>Badgers</b> would punt after three running plays. Minnesota would drive into the <b>Badgers</b> red zone but only to again be forced to turn the ball over on downs. The <b>Badgers</b> were then able to run out the final four minutes and 52 seconds and win their 10th in a row versus the Golden Gophers, 20–7.|$|R
50|$|Week 10 of the 2014 {{football}} season Aranda was named Coordinator of the Week by Athlon Sports after his Wisconsin <b>Badgers</b> defense shutout Rutgers Scarlet Knights 37-0.

50|$|The <b>Badgers</b> {{pulled out}} a hard fought victory against the Illini in Champaign. It was {{a tale of two}} halves as the Illini owned the first half and the <b>Badgers</b> took over in the second half. Illinois offensively outgained the <b>Badgers</b> 301 yards (149 rushing, 151 passing) for the Illini to 285 yard (195 rushing, 90 passing) for the <b>Badgers.</b> It was only the second time this season that the <b>Badgers</b> had been out gained (Ohio State). Four {{turnovers}} and special teams miscues cost Illinois in this game. The Illini rotated two quarterback throughout the game, Nathan Scheelhaase and freshman Reilly O'Toole. O'Toole threw two interceptions in the second half and Scheelhaase threw one late in the fourth quarter which just about sealed the win for the <b>Badgers.</b>|$|R
