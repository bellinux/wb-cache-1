50|$|Henry Perky invented {{shredded}} wheat cereal in Denver, Colorado, in 1890. Inspired by his observation of a dyspeptic diner <b>blending</b> <b>wheat</b> with cream, {{he developed a}} method of processing wheat into strips that were formed into pillow-like biscuits. The wheat is first cooked in water until its moisture content reaches about 50%. It is then tempered, allowing moisture to diffuse evenly into the grain. The grain then passes {{through a set of}} rollers with grooves in one side, yielding a web of {{shredded wheat}} strands. Many webs are stacked together, and this moist stack of strands is crimped at regular intervals to produce individual pieces of cereal with the strands attached at each end. These then go into an oven, where they are baked until their moisture content is reduced to 5%.|$|E

Morphology observation {{showed that the}} CaCO 3 particles were finely dispersed in matrix. Incorporation of CaCO 3 up to 10 wt% into the composites caused Young's modulus and tensile strength to increase markedly. On the other hand, the moisture absorption and elongation at break decreased slightly. (C) 2008 Yi Hu Song. Published by Elsevier B. V. on behalf of Chinese Chemical Society.

40|$|Two {{procedures}} {{conducive to}} <b>blending</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten with other polymers {{in view of}} enhancing the mechanical properties of rigid gluten materials, were investigated. Method 1 involved extrusion of an aqueous gluten dough at 30 – 110 °C. In method 2, gluten was processed in 70 % ethanol at temperatures ≤ 130 °C in a pressurised reactor. After solvent removal, the dried powders were compression moulded into products exhibiting fewer defects than gluten moulded directly without any pre-treatment, suggesting that application of either method improved polymer flow. In temperature regimes where little or no crosslinking occurred during the shear treatments, the mechanical properties of compression moulded samples were also better than those of directly moulded gluten. Further improvements were observed when glutenin aggregates depolymerised via breaking of disulfide bonds. This occurred in method 2 at temperatures exceeding 90 °C. Materials processed via method 2 at 110 °C displayed {{a high level of}} strain hardening in compression tests, which suggests an increase in molecular entanglements. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Starch amylose is {{synthesized}} {{through the}} activity of the granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS). In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), there are three structural genes encoding iso- forms of GBSS. Naturally occurring mutations (null alleles) resulting in the loss of one or more GBSS isoforms have recently been identified. The presence of one or two GBSS null alleles results in the production of starch with reduced amylose content. Reduced amylose wheats have been termed `partial waxy 2 ̆ 7. Wheats with three GBSS null alleles produce essentially amylose-free, or waxy, starch. Partial waxy wheats are sources of flours with optimal quality characteristics in certain Asian wet noodle products. In addition, partial waxy wheats are essential to the development of waxy wheats with acceptable agronomic performance. Biochemical features of starch from waxy wheats {{are similar to those of}} waxy maize. Waxy wheats may find application in the production of modified food starches, as <b>blending</b> <b>wheats</b> for the formulation of superior noodle flours, and as a means to manipulate amylose contents in substrates for extrusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A high–speed color sorter has the {{potential}} to help wheat breeders purify their white wheat breeding lines and white wheat exporters meet purity requirements of end users. For this reason, a commercial color sorter was evaluated for sorting mixed red and white <b>wheat.</b> Ten <b>wheat</b> <b>blends</b> containing 95 % white and 5 % red wheat by mass were produced by mixing common cultivars of hard white and hard red winter wheat. The sorter was set to accept white wheat and reject red wheat in single pass when viewed by either a green or red filter. Percentages of red and white wheat in the accept and reject portions were determined by soaking in sodium hydroxide, a definitive method for determining if a wheat kernel is red or white. In order to reject most of the red wheat in a single pass through the sorter, at least 15 % of the original wheat mass needed to be rejected. For <b>wheat</b> <b>blends</b> with white <b>wheat</b> of consistent color that contrasted considerably with the red wheat contaminant, this rejection would reduce red wheat mass in the accept portion to < 1 %. This reduction could be achieved for most other blends when rejecting 20 to 25 % of the mass or through re–sorting the accept portion.

Methods: Defatted soy flour (DSF) was <b>blended</b> with <b>wheat</b> flour with extraction rate of 82 - 84 % at 3, 7, and 7 % levels plus 3 % sugar. Bread produced with these blends compared with regular Taftoon bread and was tested for chemical and organoleptic characteristics. The organoleptic characteristics of blends consist of taste and flavor, crust texture, fragrance and aroma, appearance, bendability, and overall acceptability were determined through taste panel by 213 judges. Forty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly given codes and allocated to different groups via tables with random numbers to feed on three DSF-fortified bread blends and control bread for 30 days. Results: The <b>blending</b> of <b>wheat</b> flour with DSF altered the organoleptic properties of breads.

40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this document focuses {{on the performance of}} a partially defatted soybean flour called low-fat soybean flour (LSF). This soybean flour type has not received widespread application as a food ingredient. This has resulted from a lack of information available on the performance of LSF in a variety of food systems. Based upon its compositional and functional properties, LSF has shown potential for use in a flour blend. Past studies have focused on the usage of flour <b>blends</b> containing <b>wheat</b> flour partially replaced by an oilseed or legume flour. Wheat-soy flour blends have mostly been studied for use in yeast-leavened bread production. These blends have been able to enhance the protein content of yeast-leavened breads; however, favorable and unfavorable alterations to dough and bread development have been observed. In an effort to determine whether LSF could make favorable contributions to bread systems when used in a flour <b>blend</b> with <b>wheat,</b> several studies were performed in comparison to <b>blends</b> of <b>wheat</b> and defatted soy flour (DSF). For all experiments, wheat flour was replaced by soybean flour up to 12 % based on weight and/or equivalent protein;To understand the protein-water interaction character of LSF in a flour blend, water-holding capacity (WHC) was examined. WHC was evaluated for blends at 2, 4, 6, and 12 % replacement of wheat flour based on weight and equivalent protein. Findings showed that wheat-LSF blends had very similar WHC character to wheat-DSF blends. Dough development testing using a 10 -g mixograph was performed on flour blends at the replacement levels of 2, 6, and 12 %. The parameters of mix (peak) time, rate of development, and shear force during development were quantified. Dough development testing was conducted with and without the use of the dough conditioners, sodium stearoyl-lactylate and calcium stearoyl- 2 -lactylate. Wheat-LSF blend required longer mixing; however, these mix times were decreased after dough conditioner use. Effects on the physical and sensory properties of yeast-leavened bread were evaluated after making bread using the specified wheat-soybean flour blends at 2, 6, and 12 % replacement of wheat flour. The physical properties loaf weight, loaf volume, crumb firmness, and crust/crumb color were evaluated. Sensory evaluation of bread crumb was accomplished using an 11 -member sensory panel. Panelists provided sensory perception data for the perceived intensity of the following bread attributes: bread aroma, nutty aroma, crumb firmness, bread flavor and nutty flavor. Nutty flavor was associated with breads that contained soybean flour. Overall wheat-LSF breads had similar physical and sensory properties to wheat bread that did not contain any soybean flour.
