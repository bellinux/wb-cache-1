5|$|ZnO has a {{relatively}} large direct band gap of ~3.3eV at room temperature. Advantages associated with a large band gap include higher breakdown voltages, ability to sustain large electric fields, lower electronic noise, and high-temperature and high-power operation. The <b>bandgap</b> of ZnO can further be tuned to ~3–4eV by its alloying with magnesium oxide or cadmium oxide.|$|E
5|$|ZnO is {{a wide-bandgap}} {{semiconductor}} of the II-VI semiconductor group. The native doping of the semiconductor due to oxygen vacancies or zinc interstitials is n-type. This semiconductor has several favorable properties, including good transparency, high electron mobility, wide <b>bandgap,</b> and strong room-temperature luminescence. Those properties are valuable in emerging applications for: transparent electrodes in liquid crystal displays, energy-saving or heat-protecting windows, and electronics as thin-film transistors and light-emitting diodes.|$|E
40|$|Bloch's theorem {{was a major}} {{milestone}} {{that established}} the principle of <b>bandgaps</b> in crystals. Although it was once believed that <b>bandgaps</b> could form only under conditions of periodicity and long-range correlations for Bloch's theorem, this restriction was disproven by the discoveries of amorphous media and quasicrystals. While network and liquid models have been suggested for the interpretation of Bloch-like waves in disordered media, these approaches based on searching for random networks with <b>bandgaps</b> have failed in the deterministic creation of <b>bandgaps.</b> Here, we reveal a deterministic pathway to <b>bandgaps</b> in random-walk potentials by applying the notion of supersymmetry to the wave equation. Inspired by isospectrality, we follow a methodology in contrast to previous methods: we transform order into disorder while preserving <b>bandgaps.</b> Our approach enables the formation of <b>bandgaps</b> in extremely-disordered potentials analogous to Brownian motion, and also allows the tuning of correlations while maintaining identical <b>bandgaps,</b> thereby creating a family of potentials with 'Bloch-like eigenstates'...|$|R

40|$|Phononic <b>bandgaps</b> of Parylene-C microfibrous {{thin films}} (muFTFs) were {{computationally}} determined by treating them as phononic crystals comprising identical microfibers arranged either on a square or a hexagonal lattice. The microfibers could be columnar,chevronic, or helical in shape, {{and the host}} medium could be either water or air. All <b>bandgaps</b> were observed to lie in the 0. 01 -to- 162. 9 -MHz regime, for microfibers of realistically chosen dimensions. The upper limit of the frequency of <b>bandgaps</b> was the highest for the columnar muFTF and the lowest for the chiral muFTF. More <b>bandgaps</b> exist when the host medium is water than air. Complete <b>bandgaps</b> were observed for the columnar muFTF with microfibers arranged on a hexagonal lattice in air, the chevronic muFTF with microfibers arranged on a square lattice in water, and the chiral muFTF with microfibers arranged on a hexagonal lattice in either air or water. The softness of the Parylene-C muFTFs makes them mechanically tunable, and their <b>bandgaps</b> can be exploited in multiband ultrasonic filters. Comment: 32 pages, 9 figure...|$|R
5|$|Samarium {{carbides}} {{are prepared}} by melting a graphite-metal mixture in an inert atmosphere. After the synthesis, they are unstable in air and are studied also under inert atmosphere. Samarium monophosphide SmP is a semiconductor with the <b>bandgap</b> of 1.10eV, {{the same as}} in silicon, and high electrical conductivity of n-type. It can be prepared by annealing at 1100°C an evacuated quartz ampoule containing mixed powders of phosphorus and samarium. Phosphorus is highly volatile at high temperatures and may explode, thus the heating rate has to be kept well below 1°C/min. Similar procedure is adopted for the monarsenide SmAs, but the synthesis temperature is higher at 1800°C.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{is already}} used as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide <b>bandgap</b> of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation {{to gain access to the}} active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector recently was used in the European LYRA program.|$|E
5|$|The band {{structure}} of carbon nanotubes having certain (n,m) indexes {{can be easily}} calculated. A theoretical graph based on this calculations was designed in 1999 by Hiromichi Kataura to rationalize experimental findings. A Kataura plot relates the nanotube diameter and its <b>bandgap</b> energies for all nanotubes in a diameter range. The oscillating shape of every branch of the Kataura plot reflects the intrinsic strong dependence of the SWCNT properties on the (n,m) index rather than on its diameter. For example, (10,1) and (8,3) tubes have almost the same diameter, but very different properties: the former is a metal, but {{the latter is a}} semiconductor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Bandgaps</b> of a {{structure}} with electrorheological fluids sandwiched between planar metallic fractal electrodes are investigated {{in the microwave}} regime. Our results show that <b>bandgaps</b> are tunable {{as a result of}} the electrorheological effect induced by the external electric field applied directly to the structure. A finite- difference time- domain simulation reveals that the tunability of <b>bandgaps</b> is not related to the average dielectric constant but is caused by the field- induced structural change in the electrorheological fluids.

5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar <b>bandgap</b> (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by wet chemical etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E
25|$|In a {{semiconductor}} heterostructure, {{where a small}} <b>bandgap</b> {{material is}} sandwiched between two layers of a larger <b>bandgap</b> material, the Stark effect can be dramatically enhanced by bound excitons. This is because the electron and hole which form the exciton are pulled in opposite directions by the applied electric field, but they remain confined in the smaller <b>bandgap</b> material, so the exciton is not merely pulled apart by the field. The quantum-confined Stark effect is widely used for semiconductor-based optical modulators, particularly for optical fiber communications.|$|E

30|$|A closer {{inspection}} of Figure 6 b,c reveals two unusual behaviors in M Co/N Fe MCW {{in comparison with}} the other five MCWs. Firstly, its higher-order <b>bandgaps</b> has a narrower width than those of the lower-order <b>bandgaps,</b> in sharp contrast with the other five MCWs. Secondly, the <b>bandgaps</b> of transversely magnetized M Co/N Fe MCWs are wider than the corresponding ones in the longitudinally magnetized case, and the other five MCWs, on the other hand, exhibit a completely opposite behavior.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} wave {{propagation}} in infinite two-dimensional periodic beam networks using finite element simulations and experimental techniques. Although the characteristic pass and stop bands (i. e., <b>bandgaps)</b> {{of these systems}} have been heavily investigated in earlier research efforts, more careful scrutiny on the problem leads us {{to the conclusion that}} the <b>bandgaps</b> in the triangular beam lattice are because of the localized resonance, similar to the mechanism in acoustic metamaterials with artificial resonators made of multiple constituent materials. In this study, we show, for the first time, that flat phonon modes and locally resonant <b>bandgaps</b> can be generated in a system comprised only one material phase. In addition, we conduct a parametric study on the effects of network global topology, local geometry as well as defect density on the locally resonant <b>bandgaps...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{introduce}} a dispersion equation for 3 D photonic crystals made of parallel layers of non-overlapping spheres, valid when both wavelength and separation between layers are {{much larger than}} the distance between neighbouring spheres. This equation is based on the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (KKR) wave calculation method developed by Stefanou et al. and can be used to predict the spectral positions of <b>bandgaps</b> in structures made of dispersive spheres. Perfect agreement between the spectral positions of <b>bandgaps</b> predicted with our simplified equation and those obtained with the numerical code MULTEM 2 was observed. We find that this simplified relation allows us to identify two types of bandgaps: those related to the constitutive parameters of the spheres and those related to the three dimensional periodicity (distance between layers). <b>Bandgaps</b> of the first type are independent of the frequency and the distance between layers, while those of the second type depend only on these two quantities. We then analyze the influence of the constitutive parameters of the spheres on the spectral position of <b>bandgaps</b> for spheres immersed in dielectric or magnetic homogeneous media. The number and positions of the <b>bandgaps</b> are affected by the permitivity (permeability) of the host medium if the spheres have dispersive permitivity (permeability) ...|$|R
25|$|The bipolar {{point-contact}} transistor {{was invented}} in December 1947 at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain {{under the direction of}} William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948, was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as <b>bandgap</b> voltage reference, silicon <b>bandgap</b> temperature sensor and to handle electrostatic discharge.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} {{used to make}} a photodiode {{is critical}} to defining its properties, because only photons with sufficient energy to excite electrons across the material's <b>bandgap</b> will produce significant photocurrents.|$|E
25|$|Heterojunction {{transistors}} {{have different}} semiconductors for {{the elements of}} the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger <b>bandgap</b> material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in <b>bandgap</b> allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as Δφp, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base Δφn is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of {{a new type of}} solitons occuring in periodic systems without photonic <b>bandgaps</b> is reported. Solitons are nonlinear self-trapped wave packets. They have been extensively studied in many branches of physics. Solitons in periodic systems, which have become the mainstream of soliton research in the past decade, are localized states supported by photonic <b>bandgaps.</b> In this Letter, we report the {{discovery of}} a new type of solitons located at the Dirac point beyond photonic <b>bandgaps.</b> The Dirac point is a conical singularity of a photonic band structure where wave motion obeys the famous Dirac equation. These new solitons are sustained by the Dirac point rather than photonic <b>bandgaps,</b> thus provides a sort of advance in conceptual understanding over the traditional gap solitons. Apart from their theoretical impact within soliton theory, they have many potential uses because such solitons have dramatic stability characteristics and are possible in both Kerr material and photorefractive crystals that possess self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities. The new results elegantly reveal that traditional photonic <b>bandgaps</b> are not required when Dirac points are accessible. The findings enrich the soliton family and provide valuable information for studies of nonlinear waves in many branches of physics, including hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and Bose Einstein condensates...|$|R

25|$|The first diode lasers were {{homojunction}} diodes. That is, {{the material}} (and thus the <b>bandgap)</b> of the waveguide core layer {{and that of}} the surrounding clad layers, were identical. It was recognized that there was an opportunity, particularly afforded by the use of liquid phase epitaxy using aluminum gallium arsenide, to introduce heterojunctions. Heterostructures consist of layers of semiconductor crystal having varying <b>bandgap</b> and refractive index. Heterojunctions (formed from heterostructures) had been recognized by Herbert Kroemer, while working at RCA Laboratories in the mid-1950s, as having unique advantages for several types of electronic and optoelectronic devices including diode lasers. LPE afforded the technology of making heterojunction diode lasers.|$|E

25|$|But it {{so happens}} that the atomic states at the {{cleavage}} plane are altered (compared to their bulk properties within the crystal) by the termination of the perfectly periodic lattice at that plane. Surface states at the cleaved plane have energy levels within the (otherwise forbidden) <b>bandgap</b> of the semiconductor.|$|E
25|$|Essentially, as a result, when light propagates {{through the}} {{cleavage}} plane and transits to free space {{from within the}} semiconductor crystal, {{a fraction of the}} light energy is absorbed by the surface states where it is converted to heat by phonon-electron interactions. This heats the cleaved mirror. In addition, the mirror may heat simply because the edge of the diode laser—which is electrically pumped—is in less-than-perfect contact with the mount that provides a path for heat removal. The heating of the mirror causes the <b>bandgap</b> of the semiconductor to shrink in the warmer areas. The <b>bandgap</b> shrinkage brings more electronic band-to-band transitions into alignment with the photon energy causing yet more absorption. This is thermal runaway, a form of positive feedback, and the result can be melting of the facet, known as catastrophic optical damage, or COD.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} {{inorganic}} semiconductors, such as silicon, gallium arsenide, etc., {{there is very}} little interaction between electrons and holes (very small exciton binding energy), and therefore the optical and electronic <b>bandgap</b> are essentially identical, and the distinction between them is ignored.
