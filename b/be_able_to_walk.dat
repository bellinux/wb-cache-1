5|$|At a Jewish synagogue, where Grace and Leo's {{wedding is}} to take place, Grace learns from her mother, Bobbi (Debbie Reynolds), that her father will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> her down the aisle. Grace panics, but Karen {{suggests}} that Will should walk with her instead. She agrees and calls upon him. Although Will at first declines to give her away because of the prior argument, they make up and he finally escorts her down the aisle. After the wedding reception, Will, Grace, Leo, Jack, and Karen walk through Central Park enjoying Grace and Leo's marriage.|$|E
5|$|James Nesbitt and {{his agent}} {{attended}} {{a meeting with}} Jane Tranter in late 2005 regarding the 2006 series of Murphy's Law. At {{the conclusion of the}} meeting, she offered him a script for Jekyll, suggesting that he might like the role. Nesbitt took the script role as a way of putting a distance between his previous work. The casting of Nesbitt as Tom Jackman and Hyde was publicised on 12 December 2005, but filming was not scheduled to begin until September 2006, increasing Nesbitt's anticipation to play the roles. Writer Steven Moffat said that the dual-role required a very skilled actor, and a well-known actor was necessary because it was such an expensive show to produce. The production team decided Nesbitt's two characters would be mainly differentiated over a change in performance rather than by extensive make-up because they wanted Hyde to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> around in public without attracting attention.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people start}} {{to show up at}} the Quahog's Men's Club and Lois and her friends start to get annoyed. In order to get back at them, they enter the club. Everyone dances, except for Bonnie, because her husband is handicapped. Joe feels {{self-conscious}} about his disability, and decides to get surgery so that he will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> again. When Joe comes out of the operation, he invites his friends to go do physical activities such as rock climbing, karate, and dance. Joe starts to not care about his friends and his wife, and finds three new jock friends that share his status. Lois and Peter are worried about Joe, and Lois suggests that Peter should find a new friend to replace him. Meanwhile, Joe realizes that he has outgrown Bonnie and leaves her. Desperate to get their friend back, Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire try to re-cripple Joe, failing miserably until Bonnie comes along with Joe's handgun and shoots (and misses) Joe's spine. Sick of waiting in pain, Joe takes the gun and shoots himself in the spine, re-crippling himself. They all then go to the Drunken Clam where Joe apologizes to Peter, Cleveland and Quagmire for how he acted and they all forgive him.|$|E

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by weakness of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to weakness of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes weakness of the eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the Interstate Highways, the {{corridor}} was to be upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, the alternatives were narrowed down to two, with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200students would no longer <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to school if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in progress, with portions of the highway between Mohawk and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.|$|E

50|$|When {{settlers}} {{first arrived}} at Blandford, {{in the winter}} they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> over the ice to Tancook and to Chester. In 1845, Charles Lordly, Esq had goods hauled from Shoal Cove (Blandford) by three pairs of oxen and two horses over the ice to Tancook. The ice was cut with axes {{to a depth of}} two feet without finding water. The following month he had molasses and barrels of four hauled over the ice to Chester. Mr. Arch Zinck reported the last time people <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> Tancook over the ice was 1932.|$|R

25|$|The public used to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> {{across the}} top of Holter Dam (which {{provided}} easy access to both sides of the river), but the dam was closed to the public after the September 11 attacks.

25|$|Spastic {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic quadriplegia are {{the least}} likely to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with quadriplegia also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs {{on one side of the}} body and impairs normal movement.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{impaired}} balance, patients {{suffering from}} ataxic cerebral palsy often walk {{with their feet}} unusually far apart (a wide gait). In addition, the low muscle tone caused by ataxic cerebral palsy causes people suffering from the disease to appear very unsteady, as their body is constantly trying to counterbalance itself. Infants with the disease often take a significantly longer {{amount of time to}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> without support, and over 50% of all children with ataxic cerebral palsy experience some form of a learning disability or speech impediment.|$|E

25|$|Number One (real name unknown) is {{the leader}} of the TNT. He is wheelchair-bound, has a long beard and a bald scalp. Running gag in the series is his age: he claims to be alive well even from the Neanderthal era and to meet various {{characters}} from history, such as Nero, Homer and Maximilien Robespierre. He has a habit of telling stories of his past to his agents, who all fall asleep in the end, causing him to angrily wake them up by brandishing his stick. Another running gag is his time spent in his wheelchair: in all of the stories, he is still paraplegic, never shown to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2010 Yon {{was found}} to be curled up and unmoving near a dried stream. He was brought into the center's {{rehabilitation}} room, where it was discovered that he had pulmonary edema, which had nearly killed him; however, he was able to eat by the next day and gradually got better. He was unable to walk for the remainder of December, though by the end of January he had regained this ability and, during February and March, he improved enough to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> up and down stairs. However, his condition then took a turn for the worse, and he died on the night of April 9 at an estimated fifteen years and one month old. He weighed 3.5 kilograms and was 78.5 centimeters long. He is the oldest Iriomote cat on record.|$|E
500|$|Despite his knee, Orr's {{performance}} in the Canada Cup led to him being named to the tournament All-Star team and he was named the overall MVP for the tournament.

And he would hardly <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> in the afternoon. And then, at night, he would be the best player on one of the greatest teams ever assembled. He was the best player in every game; he was the best player in the tournament. He couldn't skate like he used to, but he could still go." [...] According to teammate Darryl Sittler, [...] "Bobby Orr was better on one leg, than anybody else was on two." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Walk" [...] is {{the first}} X-Files script by John Shiban, who commented {{that it was a}} {{challenge}} for him.

The episode required several visual effects which were almost not completed in time.|$|E
500|$|To {{further the}} {{traditional}} [...] "Sonic formula", every level was designed in a tube-like fashion; Sonic would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> onto walls, thus changing {{the direction of}} gravity and {{the rotation of the}} level itself, much like the special stages in Knuckles' Chaotix. In addition, an unusual, fish-eye lens-styled camera was put into place so players could see more of their surroundings at any given time. [...] Senn has highlighted that the 3D gameplay still kept true to the Sonic series formula of collecting rings and speeding through game levels. [...] Wallis also made mention of the game's overall layout, consisting of three acts per zone and varying in focuses on speed, exploration, and puzzle solving.|$|E
500|$|People with nontraumatic {{causes of}} SCI {{have been found}} to be less likely to suffer {{complete}} injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis, and to have shorter hospital stays. Their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission, but when they were tested upon discharge, those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups' results were the same. In addition to the completeness and level of the injury, age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk. [...] However, in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> functionally, T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing, and C7 and below to live independently.|$|E

500|$|Laurentia Tan {{was born}} on 24 April 1979 in Singapore. She moved with her family to London {{at the age of}} three years due to her father's work. Tan {{developed}} cerebral palsy and profound deafness after birth, and doctors informed her parents that she would probably not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk.</b> Her family decided to settle in the United Kingdom as they felt she would be better able to reach her full potential with the medical facilities and specialist educational support available there. When she was in school, she fell so often and sustained so many minor injuries that her teachers and the school nurse affectionately nicknamed her [...] "Trouble". At five years she was unable to sit and walk properly, and took up horse riding at the Diamond Centre for Disabled Riders in London as a form of physiotherapy. This activity also helped her confidence and self-esteem.|$|E
500|$|She {{spent six}} months in a {{wheelchair}} and another 18 months on crutches. Mortimer's right foot has six screws and a plate, and her left foot has two screws; her ankles are continuously sore, and occasionally lock up.

When Mortimer's casts were removed her walking rehabilitation was in the water, and she thinks she would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> without the aquatic rehab. Before the injury, she had 10 sessions per week in the pool (swimming [...] each session) in addition to weight training and running. After the accident her weekly threshold at the local YMCA pool was [...] and four sessions in the weight room. Her disability is not usually evident to spectators, {{and according to the}} Canadian Press she walks with a [...] "halfway normal gait." ...|$|E
500|$|After Sonnen's {{win over}} Nate Marquardt in early 2010, Sonnen became a {{polarizing}} figure {{due to his}} criticism of Silva and overall trash talk (including comments directed towards Silva's manager, teammates, coaches, wife and home country of Brazil). Silva remained relatively quiet until a UFC 148 media call in June 2012, when he stated through an interpreter: [...] "Chael Sonnen's {{going to get his}} ass kicked like he's never gotten his ass kicked before. What I'm going to do inside the Octagon is something that's going to change the image of the sport. This is going to be violent and I am sorry. I'm {{going to make sure that}} every one of his teeth are broken, that his arms are broken and his legs are broken. He's not going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of the Octagon by himself. I can guarantee that. He will need a plastic surgeon afterwards. And I know that he’s listening, so the game’s over. No more shit talking. It’s on now." [...] This caught some by surprise, who perceived his remarks as out of character.|$|E
