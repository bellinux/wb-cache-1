5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point kick. To close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5|$|In 1333–34, {{an attempt}} by some {{dissatisfied}} Oxford scholars to found a new university at Stamford, Lincolnshire, was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> universities of Oxford and Cambridge petitioning King Edward III. Thereafter, until the 1820s, no new universities were allowed to be founded in England, even in London; thus, Oxford and Cambridge had a duopoly, which was unusual in western European countries.|$|E

5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} to set in motion the escheat scheme were <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{worsening}} military situation {{on the evening of}} March 22, General Ngô Quang Trưởng authorised General Lâm Quang Thi to pull his forces back to Da Nang. However, as the main roads were <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese, General Thi's only option was to use a coastal corridor between Thuan An and Tu Hien, and board transport vessels belonging to the 106th Navy Squadron and head back to Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|No Major League Baseball (MLB) {{team had}} played in Cuba since March 21, 1959. Castro made {{attempts}} to lure American baseball teams back to Cuba to no avail. In the 1970s, George McGovern, a United States Senator, pushed {{the idea of an}} exchange of MLB and college basketball teams as a way to bridge the impasse between the two governments, similar to the ping-pong diplomacy that aided US-China relations; however, this was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> United States Department of State.|$|E

5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court was a massive vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} {{remedial legislation}} to override Manitoba, {{but they were}} <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of his belief in provincial rights.

5|$|The {{firewall}} {{makes all}} decisions by itself {{to lessen the}} chance of being weakened by a misinformed decision. Applications known to be safe are allowed Internet access, and vice versa for malicious applications. Unknown ones are analyzed and blocked if they exhibit malicious behavior. In both PC Magazine and PC Pro testing, the firewall did not incorrectly block any safe applications from Internet access. All malware was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> firewall. PC Magazine testing reflected the same results. The firewall also stealthed all ports. Exploits were <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> intrusion prevention system, which prevents threats from leveraging vulnerabilities. The system is updated whenever a vulnerability is identified for Windows-based computers. Attempts to disable the firewall were unsuccessful; registry changes, process termination, and simulated mouse clicks all failed. Disabling Windows services {{had no effect on}} the firewall since it works at the kernel driver level. This version automatically adjusts configuration for different networks based on the physical address of the gateway rather than IP addresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea came}} closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon {{received}} Premier League approval {{to relocate to}} Dublin, Ireland, but the move was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Football Association of Ireland.

5|$|The {{other major}} reagent is a camphor-derived reagent {{developed}} by Varinder Aggarwal of the University of Bristol. Both enantiomers are easily synthesized, although the yields {{are lower than}} for the oxathiane reagent. The ylide conformation is determined by interaction with the bridgehead hydrogens and approach of the aldehyde is <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> camphor moiety. The reaction employs a phosphazene base to promote formation of the ylide.|$|E

5|$|The {{reign of}} Alexios III Angelos (r. 1195–1203) had been troubled from the outset: the {{aristocracy}} conspired against him, his pressing demand for {{new sources of}} revenue was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> refusal of Senate, clergy and merchants to contribute, while the lower and middle classes of the imperial capital frequently displayed their discontent with riots against corrupt officials. The most notable of these was a large-scale uprising in February 1200 against the warden of the praetorium, Constantinople's chief prison, John Lagos, which was bloodily suppressed by imperial troops.|$|E
5|$|The work is unfinished; {{a number}} of details, most noticeably the pope's right hand, are missing. Other {{passages}} are bland and uniform, with some key areas still <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> underdrawing. Many of Titian's characteristic finishing touches are missing; Paul's fur-lined sleeves do not contain the polishing white strokes of the 1543 portrait, or his usual final overglaze or glossing.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to it, while the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E
50|$|AS {{numbers are}} {{assigned}} in <b>blocks</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to regional Internet registries (RIRs).

5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation of politicians had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for the return trip was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, the Ju 87s {{gave the}} German Army yet more {{valuable}} support. On 29 December 1941, the Soviet 44th Army {{landed on the}} Kerch Peninsula. The Luftwaffe was only able to dispatch meager reinforcements of four bomber groups (Kampfgruppen) and two dive bomber groups belonging to StG 77. With air superiority, the Ju 87s operated with impunity. In the first 10 days of the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula, half the landing force was destroyed, while sea lanes were <b>blocked</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Stukas inflicting heavy losses on Soviet shipping. The Ju 87's effectiveness against Soviet armour was not yet potent. Later versions of the T-34 tank could withstand Stuka attack in general, unless a direct hit was scored but the Soviet 44th Army had only obsolescent types with thin armour which were nearly all destroyed.|$|E
