40|$|A new {{approach}} for procuring logging residues has been introduced, {{in which the}} residues are compacted into cylindrical bales known as composite residue logs (CRLs). Some large-scale productivity studies have been undertaken on different <b>bundling</b> <b>machines,</b> and preliminary calculations on the possible benefits associated with bundling {{have been based on}} limited material or on prototypes. The aims of the study presented here were to measure the effects of concentrating forest fuel on bundling productivity with a WoodPac machine and to test if there was a difference between bundling logging residues and small stems. The results show that the WoodPac machine produced 19. 3 bundles per effective hour (E), equivalent to 28. 5 MWh, in a clear-cut spruce stand. Productivity was not influenced by the amount of green mass as long as there was more than 5 Mg per 100 m driving distance and the material was collected in heaps. About 20 % of the handled material was shaved off, mainly as fine material, so 24 % more was handled than appeared in the bundles. Productivity could be raised to 24 bundles per E with logging residues, but with young stems the productivity may be 50 % lower. Forwarding bundles was at least 2. 5 times more productive than forwarding loose logging residues. In conclusion, bundling could be of interest when economical and environmental aspects of the whole chain are considered...|$|R
40|$|When {{recovering}} {{logging residues}} (LR) for bioenergy its density should be increased before road transport, otherwise a low {{proportion of the}} trucks’ load capacity will be used. One way this can be currently done is to compress LR into bundles that are forwarded to roadside landing. A less well-developed alternative is to forward loose LR and bundle it at landing. In the presented study, a prototype specifically developed for road-side bundling was found to produce larger, heavier bundles than bundling machinery intended for in-field use (mean length, diameter and raw bulk density 4. 7 m, 0. 8 m and 285 kg m– 3, respectively, with 299 – 445 kg oven dry matter per <b>bundle).</b> The <b>machine</b> was a so at least 30...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{wood fuel}} supply systems involve procurement, storage, {{chipping}} and transport. What happens during this chain of handling affects both fuel {{quality and the}} price of the fuel. An optimal supply system has {{to meet the demands of}} end user, fulfil quality criteria and, moreover, maintain an acceptable working environment. Densifying logging residues into bundles (or composite residue logs, CRL) can be an alternative method to improve wood fuel transport and handling properties. This work reports on storage effect on CRLs weighing around 400 - 600 kg, made of green and summer-dried residues using two prototypes <b>bundling</b> <b>machines</b> Fiberpac and Wood Pac. The former presses residues into a continuous long bundle, 75 cm in diameter, and cut it at a length of 3 m. Wood Pac rotates and presses logging residues into a log like unit with the same dimension as Fiberpac-CRLs. Working environment related to microbial presence in the surrounding air during chipping was assessed. Average moisture content was lower in all the CRLs by the end of the storage (February-August) in covered stacks. Higher dry matter losses were measured in CRLs made from green residues compared to the summer-dried ones. The average loss was around 1 % per month in all treatments. Microbial activity was generally higher in CRLs made from green residues irrespective of the machine used. Changes in heating values and ash content were marginal in all the treatments. Ash contents were higher in the CRLs made from green residues than the summer-dried material. Loss of needles during the summer is the main reason since needles normally have high contents of minerals. The concentrations of air-borne fungal and bacterial particles in air samples taken during the chipping and handling of the CRLs were at levels that does not constitute a health risk for the workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{recovery}} of logging residue offers many benefits, {{and can be}} effectively performed with several techniques. This study {{presents the results of}} four distinct trials conducted on the Italian Alps with a truck-mounted bundler, and compares them with the figures obtained by the Austrian and German colleagues {{on the other side of}} the Alps. Average productivity varied between 14 and 22 <b>bundles</b> per productive <b>machine</b> hour (PMH), or between 10 and 15 <b>bundles</b> per scheduled <b>machine</b> hour (SMH). Mass production ranged from 3. 1 to 4. 3 oven-dry tonnes SMH- 1. If the machine is used for at least 800 SMH year- 1 bundling costs will range between e 7 and 9 MWh~ 1, which is within the profitability limit indicated in Nordic studies. Although bundling may represent an additional cost in the slash-to-chip chain, it offers the important benefit of efficient outdoor winter storage, which is crucial in a region where the supply and demand of fuel biomass are often diachronic. The truck-mounted bundler used on the Alps adopts the same mechanism and achieves the same performance of the Nordic forwarder-mounted application. The main difference lies in its superior road mobility, which is crucial when covering scattered landings. © 2009 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{learning}} {{the preferences of}} humans from observations of their choices. It builds on work in economics and decision theory (e. g. utility theory, revealed preference, utilities over <b>bundles),</b> <b>Machine</b> Learning (inverse reinforcement learning), and cognitive science (theory of mind and inverse planning). Chapter 1 lays the conceptual groundwork for the thesis and introduces key challenges for learning preferences that motivate chapters 2 and 3. I adopt a technical definition of 'preference' that is appropriate for inferring preferences from choices. I consider what class of objects preferences should be defined over. I discuss the distinction between actual preferences and informed preferences and the distinction between basic/intrinsic and derived/instrumental preferences. Chapter 2 focuses on the challenge of human 'suboptimality'. A person's choices are a function of their beliefs and plans, {{as well as their}} preferences. If they have inaccurate beliefs or make inefficient plans, then it will generally be more difficult to infer their preferences from choices. It is also more difficult if some of their beliefs might be inaccurate and some of their plans might be inefficient. I develop models for learning the preferences of agents subject to false beliefs and to time inconsistency. I use probabilistic programming to provide a concise, extendable implementation of preference inference for suboptimal agents. Agents performing suboptimal sequential planning are represented as functional programs. Chapter 3 considers how preferences vary under different combinations (or &compositions') of outcomes. I use simple mathematical functional forms to model composition. These forms are standard in microeconomics, where the outcomes in question are quantities of goods or services. These goods may provide the same purpose (and be substitutes for one another). Alternatively, they may combine together to perform some useful function (as with complements). I implement Bayesian inference for learning the preferences of agents making choices between different combinations of goods. I compare this procedure to empirical data for two different applications. by Owain Rhys Evans. Thesis: Ph.

50|$|During {{the middle}} {{part of the}} decade, Holdsworth went on to work with various {{well-known}} progressive rock and jazz fusion artists. These included Soft <b>Machine</b> (<b>Bundles),</b> The New Tony Williams Lifetime (Believe It and Million Dollar Legs), Pierre Moerlen's Gong (Gazeuse! and Expresso II) and Jean-Luc Ponty (Enigmatic Ocean). He has often since expressed his enjoyment of the experience gained {{with all of these}} groups, in particular his time spent with drummer Tony Williams. 1976 brought about the first of Holdsworth's many frustrations with the music industry, when CTI Records released a recording of a rehearsal session on which he played, passing it off as an official studio album entitled Velvet Darkness. This angered Holdsworth, who said that he still loathes the album intensely and wished it were never made public.|$|R
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{material}} life of information and its devices; of electronic waste in its physical and electronic incarnations; a cultural and material mapping of the spaces where electronics in the form of both hardware and information accumulate, break down, or are stowed away. Where other studies have addressed "digital" technology through a focus on its immateriality or virtual qualities, Gabrys traces the material, spatial, cultural and political infrastructures that enable the emergence and dissolution of these technologies. In the course of her book, she explores five interrelated "spaces" where electronics fall apart: from Silicon Valley to Nasdaq, from containers bound for China to museums and archives that preserve obsolete electronics as cultural artifacts, to the landfill as material repository. Digital Rubbish describes the materiality of electronics from a unique perspective, examining the multiple forms of waste that electronics create as evidence of the resources, labor, and imaginaries that are <b>bundled</b> into these <b>machines.</b> Ranging across studies of media and technology, as well as environments, geography, and design, Jennifer Gabrys draws together the far-reaching material and cultural processes that enable the making and breaking of these technologies...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The recurring theme of server virtualization being a <b>bundled</b> single virtual <b>machine</b> file – consisting of the operating system, applications and settings – easily stored, deployable or transportable {{within the bounds of}} its operating parameters, the Achilles heel of such a VM (virtual machine) file is the likelihood of its getting corrupt or irrecoverably lost. Such disastrous occurrences are not unheard of, and are regularly tackled using a system of data backups to extenuate loss or corruption of entire VM files. However, the backing up process of VM files itself can compound recurring costs at an unexpected rate in the form of frequent acquisition of storage hardware in which to store the VM files. In this paper first we shows, a detailed cost comparison that based on power and cooling has been drawn in a table format between physical server and VMware server [VMware esx], secondly we analyze the role that the Billboard Manager has to play in shuttling the VM files in a secure and encrypted manner so as to extract the maximum operating potential of server virtualization and virtualization storage system in a private cloud domain...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequence}} {{opens with}} a parody of the Breaking Bad title card, with The Simpsons displayed across the screen with the symbols for Thorium (Th) and Silicon (Si) appearing {{at the beginning of}} each word. Marge, aping the downtrodden demeanor of Walter's wife Skyler, sits on the couch drinking coffee. She goes into the kitchen to begin baking cupcakes, using food coloring to turn the batter blue and adding frosting and sprinkles in other shades of this color. She places one batch in a silver briefcase, which she gives to Bart before he leaves the house. Homer, dressed in the dark hat and sunglasses Walter dons for his [...] "Heisenberg" [...] persona, sneaks a taste of the batter while Marge is baking and is later woken from a nap by the smell. The scene cuts to a church bake sale, where Marge sells a cupcake to Milhouse as Homer watches from a distance. Back at the Simpson house, Marge runs her earnings through a currency-counting <b>machine,</b> <b>bundles</b> the money, and adds it to a large pile on the dining table. The camera zooms out to reveal a live-action scene (taken from the episode [...] "Hazard Pay") of Walter White and his partner Jesse Pinkman sitting on a couch drinking beer and watching the sequence on a TV.|$|R
5000|$|When IBM was {{designing}} the IBM PC {{they followed the}} paradigm of existing home computers in wanting to have a built-in BASIC. They sourced this from Microsoft - IBM Cassette BASIC - but Microsoft also produced several other versions of BASIC for MS-DOS/PC DOS including IBM Disk BASIC (BASIC D), IBM BASICA (BASIC A), GW-BASIC (a BASICA-compatible version that did not need IBM's ROM) and QBasic, all typically <b>bundled</b> with the <b>machine.</b> In addition they produced the Microsoft BASIC Compiler aimed at professional programmers. Turbo Pascal-publisher Borland published Turbo Basic 1.0 in 1985 (successor versions are still being marketed by the original author under the name PowerBASIC). Microsoft wrote the windowed AmigaBASIC that was supplied with version 1.1 of the pre-emptive multitasking GUI Amiga computers (late 1985 / early 1986), although the product unusually did not bear any Microsoft marks. These languages introduced many extensions to the original home-computer BASIC, such as improved string manipulation and graphics support, access to the file system and additional data types. More important were the facilities for structured programming, including additional control structures and proper subroutines supporting local variables. However, by {{the latter half of}} the 1980s, users were increasingly using pre-made applications written by others, rather than learning programming themselves, while professional programmers now had a wide range of more advanced languages available on small computers. C and later C++ became the languages of choice for professional [...] "shrink wrap" [...] application development.|$|R
