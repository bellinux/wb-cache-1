40|$|Consider random vectors {{formed by}} {{a finite number}} of {{independent}} groups of i. i. d. random variables, where those of the last group are stochastically smaller than those of the other groups. Conditions are given such that certain functions, defined as suitable means of supermodular functions of the random variables of the vectors, are supermodular or increasing directionally convex. Comparisons based on the increasing convex order of supermodular functions of such random vectors are also investigated. Applications of the above results are then provided in risk theory, queueing theory, and reliability theory, with reference to (i) net stop-loss reinsurance premiums of portfolios from different groups of insureds, (ii) closed cyclic multiclass Gordon-Newell queueing networks, and (iii) reliability of series systems formed by units selected from different <b>batche...</b>|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to design a new extended release gastroretentive mutiparticulate delivery system for verapamil (VP) by incorporation into hydrogel beads made of chitosan. The beads were formed by dropping solutions of VP and chitosan in a solution of tripolyphosphate using a syringe pump with adjustable constant rate. The formed beads were then further crosslinked using glutraldehyde and the excess glutraldehyde were then washed. The physical properties of the prepared beads such as beads sizes, shapes, friabilities and loading efficiencies were determined. The floating characteristics and the release profiles were also studied. The produced beads from all batches showed a very good spherical geometry with mean diameter {{in the range of}} 1. 3 – 2. 0 mm. The drug loading efficiency was around 42 % for all batches. The % friabilities were less than 1 % indicating that the beads surfaces are highly resistant to attrition. <b>Batche...</b>|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that meat colour {{represents}} an important aspect for sensorial evaluation of any food product,research in the field of poultry meat processing regarding efficient methods for hoarding/storage on long term ofindustrially slaughtered poultry carcasses approaches a continuous finding/optimization of certain solutions foravoiding negative consequences due to oxidation, which could include colour loss and/or its modification. The current study aimed to evaluate the effects of three storage regimes differing by temperature and time(L = - 14 °C, 30 days; L = - 16 °C, 60 days; L = - 18 °C, 90 days) on three anatomical cut regions (breast, upper thighand lower thigh), to characterize the colour of broiler chicken meat. Objective description of colour for frozen anddefrosted chicken meat was realised through the CIEL*a*b* Cartesian coordinate system. Overall, the preservation method determines a higher luminosity at samples gathered from L batch chickencarcasses for breast and upper thigh musculature, and L for lower thigh musculature in comparison with thecounterparts from the other experimental <b>batche...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{the second part of}} a two-part series {{dedicated}} to the development of an on-line comprehensive HICxRPLC-UV/MS method for the characterization of a commercial inter-chain cysteine-linked ADC (brentuximab vedotin, Adcetris®). The first part focused on the optimization of the chromatographic conditions. In the second part of this series of papers, the structural characterization of the Brentuximab Vedotin was extensively discussed. With the combination of HIC and RPLC–MS data, the average DAR was easily measured in HIC and, at the same time, the predominant positional isomers were identified in RPLC–MS in one single injection. It was also demonstrated that the retention data obtained in the first and second dimensions was particularly useful to assist ADC characterization through the identification of sub-units. Using this methodology, the presence of odd DARs (1, 3 and 5) and their relative abundance was assessed by a systematic evaluation of HIC x RPLC-UV/MS data for both commercial and stressed ADC samples. Finally, once the exhaustive characterization of ADC was completed, MS could be conveniently replaced by UV detection to quickly assess the conformity of different ADCs <b>batche...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the country's need for {{vegetable}} protein, the Gover nment has encouraged the development of soybean culture in the irrigated areas of the sout h. However, when soybean is introduced in soils where it has not been grown previously, the necessary nitrogen-fixing bacteria are often lacking, and inoculants must be introduced to gether with the seeds. Given the increasing interest of the private sector in producing ino culants, the purpose of this project was to assist in the establishment of a quality control authority for inoculants, and to specify standards for their productionThe Soil and Fertilizer Research Institute (SFRI) was designated as a reference laboratory for the control of inoculant quality. The project supplied laborator y equipment and provided training for laboratory staff in its use. Training was also arranged i n inoculant production and inoculant quality controlA request for bids for the supply of soybean inoculum meeting define d standards, which were based on the advice of SFRI, was issued by the Ministry fo r Agriculture. Regular samples were taken by SFRI staff from the different <b>batche</b> s of inoculants produced by the company whose bid was accepted; after evaluation of the quality, SFRI permitted release. Based on an independent evaluation of the inoculant qua lity, it was concluded that improvements were still needed in the quality of products release d in Turkey, but that the results already obtained were encouraging in view of the short dura tion of the projectThe Government's general objective should be to increase the quality of inoculants provided to farmers. It was recommended that SFRI continue to be off icially recognized as the controlling agency for the quality of all soybean inoculants, both domestically produced and imported, sold in Turkey. Legislation should therefor e be enacted defining the standards required and the methods for quality control. In order t hat standards could be raised gradually, two conditions needed to be met. Firstly, experiment al results of the crop response to inoculants are needed; it was therefore recommended that S FRI coordinate a network of field experiments and initiate on-farm trials. Secondly, the technical conditions needed to produce inoculants of the required quality must be determin ed; SFRI could carry out this work in cooperation with the inoculant manufacturer...|$|E
40|$|The Averno 2 {{eruption}} (AV 2) occurred 3. 7 ka b. p in {{the northwest}} sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc), {{at the intersection of}} NE-SW and NW-SE fault systems bordering the resurgent block. The eruption, one of the youngest of the caldera, was followed only by the 1538 AD eruption of Monte Nuovo. The eruption of AV 2 was fed by alkaline magma tapped from a chemically zoned (weakly peralkaline alkali-trachyte to alkali-trachyte) chamber [Civetta et al., 1988, Rosi and Sbrana 1987]. Eruptive products of AV 2 eruption were subdivided into three members (A to C) by Di Vito et al., [2001]. 21 representative samples of AV 2 deposits were analyzed for grain-size and componentry whereas 16 depositional units (about 100 juvenile clasts each) were sampled to measure bulk density, bulk vesicularity and assess texture characteristics of individual clasts. According to bulk density, vesicularity and textural data three main pyroclasts types were identified: i) low-density, light coloured, microvesicular, microlite-free; ii) high-density, dark-brown, microlite-rich; iii) banded made up of mm-thick stripes of (i) and (ii) types. The three types record variations of magma properties resulting from various degassing histories and syn-eruptive crystallization of groundmass. Characteristics and relative abundance of juvenile clast types throughout the stratigraphic sequence were used to make inferences and place constrains on temporal variations in magma rise and eruptive mechanisms. Occurrence in the very early fallout bed of dense juvenile clasts suggests the initial disruption of a limited volume of degassed magma. Member A was dominated by type (i) clasts suggesting that plinian episodes were fed by the fast supply of volatile-rich highly evolved magma from below whereas subsequent eruptions were fed by volatile poor-magma less evolved (member C). Members B and C contain (i), (ii) and (iii) types; an increasing abundance through time of clasts (ii) and (iii) suggests increasing importance of intra-eruption degassing, mostly occurring during time breaks between two successive eruptive pulses. Additionally, these degassing pulses were likely responsible for the emplacement of the fine-ash fall out beds. The pulsating activity of AV 2 appears to be transitional in style between subplinian and vulcanian. We propose that transitions in eruptive style from plinian to surge activity were controlled by magmatic processes and not by water-magma interaction. This study also allows us to characterize the magma chamber of AV 2. Petrography and chemical analysis (SEM-EDS and electron microprobe) were performed on pumice samples, melt inclusions, and host minerals. The least evolved melt inclusions are found in zoned diopside clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the pumice fall of member C (Cmb layer), whereas the most evolved melt inclusions are found in hedenbergite clinopyroxene phenocrysts from the pumices fall of member A (A 0 layer), the first-erupted pumices. The observed compositional trend indicates that the erupted deposits were drained by a single magmatic reservoir. The compositional evolution of the AV 2 magmatic system seems to have resulted from different processes occurring at different stages, pre-eruptive magma mixing, due to an input of a small <b>batche</b> of mafic magma into the reservoir, and then crystal fractionation to produce the most evolved compositions. The pumice products are characterised by a heterogeneous mineral population represented in part by crystals formed at the margin of the reservoir and a syn-eruptive mixing is identified in intermediate samples during the magma extraction. The H 2 O concentration determined by FTIR measurements of the melt inclusions suggest that this magma body resided and crystallized at shallow level prior to eruption, possibly about 4 km depth...|$|E
