25|$|Identification of Japanese {{knotweed}} is {{not always}} easy. Many other plants are suspected of being knotweed, due often to the similar appearance of leaves and stems. Dogwood, lilac, Houttuynia (Houttuynia cordata), ornamental Bistorts such as Red Bistort (Persicaria amplexicaulis), lesser knotweed (Persicaria campanulata), Himalayan Balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Broadleaved Dock (Rumex obtusifolius), <b>Bindweed</b> (Convolvulus arvensis), bamboo, Himalayan Honeysuckle (Leycesteria formosa), and Russian Vine (Fallopia baldschuanica) have been suspected of being Fallopia japonica.|$|E

Some foods that snails eat are: Alyssum, fruit and leaves of apple, apricot, artichoke (a favorite), aster, barley, beans, <b>bindweed,</b> California boxwood, almost any cabbage variety, camomile, carnation, carrot, cauliflower, celeriac (root celery), celery, ripe cherries, chive, citrus, clover, cucumbers (a favorite snail food), dandelion, elder, henbane, hibiscus, hollyhock, kale, larkspur (Consolida or Delphinium genera), leek, lettuce (liked, and makes good snails), lily, magnolia, mountain ash, mulberry, chrysanthemum, nasturtium, nettle, nightshade berries, oats, onion greens, pansy, parsley, peach, ripe pears, peas, petunia, phlox, plum, potatoes (raw or cooked), pumpkins, radish, rape, rose, sorrel, spinach, sweet pea, thistle, tomatoes (well liked), turnip, wheat, yarrow, zinnia. They will eat sweet lupines, but will reject bitter lupines and other plants with high quinolizidine alkaloids. Snails also avoid plants that produce other defensive chemicals, defensive stem hairs, etc.|$|E
500|$|The {{subject matter}} of the carvings of the central {{brackets}} as misericords is very varied, but with many common themes recurring in different churches. Typically, the themes are less unified and less directly related to the Bible and Christian theology than are the themes of small sculptures seen elsewhere within churches, such as those on bosses. This is much the case at Wells, where none of the misericord carvings is directly based on a Bible story. The subjects, chosen either by the woodcarver, or perhaps by the individual paying for the stall, have no over-riding theme. The sole unifying element is the roundels {{on each side of the}} pictorial subject, which are all elaborately carved foliage, in most cases formal and stylised in the later Decorated manner, but with several examples of naturalistic foliage, including roses and <b>bindweed.</b> Many of the subjects carry traditional interpretations. The image of the [...] "Pelican in her Piety" [...] (believed to feed her young on her own blood) is a recognised symbol for Christ's love for the Church. A cat playing with a mouse may represent the Devil snaring a human soul. Other subjects illustrate popular fables or sayings such as [...] "When the fox preaches, look to your geese". Many of the subjects are depictions of animals, some of which may symbolise a human vice or virtue, or an aspect of faith.|$|E

40|$|Multiple cultivations {{lead to a}} {{repeated}} physical damage of the thistle. Each time it regrows, it uses further nutrients until it is weakened and a new crop will out-compete it. This method is also effective against other root-spreading weeds such as couch grass and <b>bindweeds.</b> •	After harvesting grains, perform stubble cultivation with a skim plough or a completely flat-cutting wing share cultivator {{at a depth of}} 7 - 10 cm. •	After the thistle plants have re-emerged (maximum 10 cm), repeat the cultivation 1 - 2 times while increasing the working depth. •	Sow a dense, fast-growing catch crop such as vetch or fodder radish after the stubble cultivation to further weaken the thistles.

40|$|In organic farming, {{reduced tillage}} is more {{demanding}} {{than in a}} system using herbicides.

Stubble cultivation in summer {{is the only way to}} effectively regulate thistles, wild rye, <b>bindweeds</b> and dock plants. The prerequisite for success is to use the existing technology properly and to set up the tools correctly and use them at the appropriate time. At a machinery demonstration on the organic farm Neuhof in Birr, Switzerland, cultivators and skim ploughs were presented for stubble cultivation. If the focus was on the controlling of perennial weeds, the flat cultivator scored the best results. Fully undercutting and exposing the roots is possible in one go even with skim ploughs. However, finding the correct settings seems to be more difficult. With statements by Hansueli Dierauer, FiBL consultant, André Meier, organic farmer and Django Hegglin, organic farmer...|$|R

60|$|About the Narcissus, please. I {{want them}} for my {{fishpond}} stream {{rather than for}} the bee-house one. The fishpond stream is very doleful, and wants to dance with daffodils if they would come and teach it. How happy we are in our native streams. A thunder-storm swelled the Tiber yesterday, and it rolled over its mill weirs in heaps, literally, of tossed water, the size of haycocks, but black brown like coffee with the grounds in it, mixed with a very little yellow milk.

60|$|In {{one room}} they stored nuts and acorns, rose and holly berries, a dried apple or two, and many pine cones to burn; for Dart showed {{her a little}} fireplace, and told her the Kobolds kept {{themselves}} very warm and jolly at their work.

The empty cocoon of a caterpillar still hung in one corner, and Bud said that should be her hammock with a curtain made of woven yellow <b>bindweed</b> hung before the nook. They swept the floor with fir-needle brooms, and spread a carpet of red oak leaves, which gave a very gay air to the place.

To judge from the tales which I have read or have been told about children, I must have been old for my age. But perhaps the workings of the mind and heart of a girl in her teens are not of general interest. Let me be brief. A stream of water ran on the southern side all the length of the garden, under a high, rocky bank (its boundary) which was densely overhung with ash and willow, and hedges of brier and bramble looped with <b>bindweed,</b> goose-grass, and traveller's joy. On the nearer bank of this stream which had been left to its wild, I would sit among the mossy rocks and stones and search the green tops of my ambush as if in quest of Paradise.|$|E
60|$|The reds we {{like best}} in flowers are the {{delicate}} roseate and pinky shades; {{they are more}} to us than the purest and most luminous tints. And here, as with bird notes which delight us on account of their resemblance to fresh, young, highly musical human voices, flowers please us best when they exhibit the loveliest human tints--the apple blossom and the <b>bindweed,</b> musk mallow and almond and wild rose, for example. After these we are most taken with the deeper but soft and not too luminous reds--the red which we admire in the red horse-chestnut blossom, and many other flowers, down to the minute pimpernel. Next come the intense rosy reds seen in the herb-robert and other wild geraniums, valerian, red campion and ragged robin; and this shade of red, intensified but still soft, {{is seen in the}} willow-herb and foxglove, and, still more intensified, in the bell- and small-leafed heath. Some if not all of these pleasing reds have purple in them, and there are very many distinctly purple flowers that appeal to us {{in the same way that}} red flowers do, receiving their expression from the same cause. There is some purple colour in most skins, and even some blue.|$|E
6000|$|The {{whiteness}} {{of the white}} flower where there is any red is never unhuman, probably because a very brilliant red or rose colour on some delicate skins causes the light flesh-tints to appear white by contrast, and is the complexion known as [...] "milk and roses." [...] The apple-blossom is a beautiful example, and the beloved daisy--the [...] "wee, modest, crimson-tipped flower," [...] which {{would be so much}} less dear but for that touch of human crimson. This is the herb-Margaret of so many tender and pretty legends, that has white for purity and red for repentance. Even those who have never read these legends and that prettiest, most pathetic of all which tells of the daisy's origin, find a secret charm in the flower. Among other common examples are the rosy-white hawthorn, wood anemone, <b>bindweed,</b> dropwort, and many others. In the dropwort the rosy buds are seen among the creamy white open flowers; and the expression is always very marked and beautiful when there is any red or purple tinge or blush on cream-whites and ivory-whites. When we look from the dropwort to its nearest relative, the common meadow-sweet, we see how great a charm the touch of rose-red has given to the first: the meadow-sweet has no expression of the kind we are considering--no human association.|$|E
