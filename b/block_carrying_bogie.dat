50|$|The use of {{individual}} components or systems such as, for example, the boiler, the <b>carrying</b> <b>bogies,</b> etc., {{for as many}} classes as possible, enabled considerable savings to be achieved in construction, in repair and in the stocks of spares parts needed.|$|R
50|$|Kim Il-sung's longest train journey {{took place}} in 1984 when he visited almost every socialist country in Eastern Europe. The train ride went via China, through the Soviet Union, with stops in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Romania. The rest of the trip went through the Soviet Union, again. A second train {{accompanied}} Kim's <b>carrying</b> <b>bogies</b> (wheels and axles) of the other gauge (sizes) needed.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the first engine, 61 002, which was built later, had a drive with three cylinders and larger supply tanks. To support the latter, the rear <b>carrying</b> <b>bogie</b> was extended to three axles. As {{a result of the}} more powerful drive, the punctuality of the train was improved - it had been unsatisfactory with 61 001. In addition the second locomotive had smoke deflectors on top next to the smoke exhaust, which were not fitted to 61 001.|$|R

5000|$|Bolster wagons are {{relatively}} lightweight. Heavier well wagon, for machinery loads, had deeper and stronger side girders. They had a cranked profile from the side, {{so that the}} load's centre of gravity was <b>carried</b> lower. <b>Bogie</b> bolsters could <b>carry</b> typical loads of 15 or 30 tons.|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} way to <b>carry</b> out <b>bogie</b> exchange is {{to lift the}} wagons off the bogies and replace them back on new bogies. This may require the wagons in a train to be uncoupled, and continuous brakes disconnected. As the bogies are swung out of the way, they sway, which wastes time settling them down.|$|R
50|$|Also, these {{machines}} record data in 256-byte blocks interspersed with gaps of carrier tone, each <b>block</b> <b>carrying</b> a sequence number and a CRC checksum, {{so that it}} is possible to rewind the tape and retry from the failed block when a read error occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Support for {{hardware}} tessellation only became {{mandatory in}} Direct3D 11 and OpenGL 4. Tessellation {{as defined in}} those APIs is only supported by newer TeraScale 2 (VLIW5) products introduced in September 2009 and GCN-based products (available from January 2012 on). The GCN SIP <b>block</b> <b>carrying</b> out the tessellation is the [...] "Geometric processor".|$|R
2500|$|The rear {{suspension}} system was of the sliding pillar type, a <b>block</b> <b>carrying</b> the stub axle rode {{up and down on}} two guide pillars mounted on a solid casting bolted {{to the side of the}} body.

40|$|The {{number of}} neurolytic coeliac plexus <b>blocks</b> <b>carried</b> out in England and Wales over a 5 year period (1986 - 1990) was ascertained. The {{number of cases}} of the major {{complications}} of permanent paraplegia and/or loss of anal and bladder sphincter function following on from such blocks, over the same period of time, was also ascertained. The information was obtained by means of a questionnaire which was sent to most of the pain clinics in England and Wales. There were 2730 neurolytic <b>blocks</b> <b>carried</b> out over the 5 year period. The {{number of cases of}} permanent paraplegia following on from the blocks was four. Of these four cases, three of them also had loss of anal and bladder sphincter function [...] loss of sphincter function never occurred in isolation. The incidence of major complications following neurolytic coeliac plexus block was thus one case per 683 blocks...|$|R
50|$|Another way of <b>carrying</b> out <b>bogie</b> {{exchange}} is {{to lower the}} bogies onto a trolley in a pit, after which the trolleys are rolled {{out of the way}} and others return. This keeps the train couplings and continuous brakes connected. In addition, the bogies never need leave a solid surface, so they can be wheeled in and out more quickly. This method was used at Dry Creek railway station, Adelaide.|$|R
50|$|The bitcoin {{scalability}} {{problem is}} a consequence of the fact that blocks in the blockchain are limited to one megabyte in size. Blocks larger than one megabyte are automatically rejected by the network as invalid. Bitcoin <b>blocks</b> <b>carry</b> the transactions on the bitcoin network since the last block has been created. This allows for around three transactions per second maximum capacity rate.|$|R

40|$|Conservative and {{reversible}} {{logic gates}} are widely {{known to be}} compatible with revolutionary computing paradigms such as optical and quantum computing. A fundamental conservative reversible logic gate is the Fredkin gate. This paper presents efficient adder circuits based on the Fredkin gate. Novel full adder circuits using Fredkin gates are proposed which have lower hardware complexity than the current state-of-the-art, while generating the additional signals required for carry skip adder architectures. The traditional ripple carry adder and several carry skip adder topologies are compared. Theoretical performance of each adder is determined and compared. Although the variable sized <b>block</b> <b>carry</b> skip adder is determined to have shorter delay than the fixed <b>block</b> size <b>carry</b> skip adder, the performance gains are not sufficient to warrant the required additional hardware complexity. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Single-action revolvers have no {{external}} safeties, {{and they}} usually have no internal safeties, such as a hammer block or transfer bar, to render them drop-safe. Most single-action revolvers have a half-cock [...] "safety" [...] notch on the hammer, {{but many of these}} are not drop-proof. Real antiques are in this category; modern non-exact replicas may have internal hammer <b>blocks.</b> <b>Carrying</b> such firearms with a loaded chamber under the hammer, rather than with the hammer left down on an empty chamber, is not safe.|$|R
50|$|The {{tractive}} force was transmitted from the drive axles to the bogies. From there the force was <b>carried</b> to the <b>bogie</b> mounted towing hook and the buffers.

50|$|The {{main feature}} of the Britalus engine is an {{enclosed}} barrel-shaped cylinder <b>block</b> <b>carrying</b> compressor and expander pistons and rotating within a compact three-lobed stationary housing. The pistons carry rollers that follow an internal cam, causing the reciprocal motion of the pistons for compression and expansion. The rotor is statically and dynamically balanced and thereby operates with minimal vibration. A sleeve pinion gear on {{the rear of the}} rotor connects to a layshaft spur gear and provides the output shaft drive to the connected load.|$|R
30|$|Nowadays, TCP is the {{preferred}} transport protocol for YouTube and other video servers since the majority of video content delivery over the Internet is not live and most users’ bandwidth is usually greater than the video coding rate [17, 18]. The HTTP/TCP architecture also solves the problem of access <b>blocking</b> <b>carried</b> out by many firewalls for unknown UDP ports. Additionally, the continuous improvements in latency reduction and throughput maximization achieved in new cellular technologies have allowed the use of TCP for minimizing the impact of errors without reducing severely the effective throughput.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme for the {{absolute}} calibration {{of a set}} of three individual RASNIK elements and of their bench supports. The RASNIK elements consist of three precision cubic <b>blocks</b> <b>carrying</b> the mask, the lens or the CCD. Simulations and measurements on a dedicated bench show that this procedure leads to the required precision on the relevant RASNIK parameters (< 5 microns).

By simple mixing of the components the formation of discrete dimeric and trimeric (metallo) porphyrin complexes predominates, in accordance to binding stoichiometry, while the amount of alternative structures can be neglected. Our results illustrate the power of multivalency to program the multicomponent self-assembly of specific entities into discrete functional nanostructures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a way to}} subdivide a 3 -manifold into angled blocks, namely polyhedral pieces that need not be simply connected. When the individual <b>blocks</b> <b>carry</b> dihedral angles that fit together in a consistent fashion, we prove that a manifold constructed from these blocks must be hyperbolic. The main application is a new proof of a classical, unpublished theorem of Bonahon and Siebenmann: that all arborescent links, except for three simple families of exceptions, have hyperbolic complements.
