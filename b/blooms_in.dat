25|$|Phosphate {{detergents}} were historically a {{major source}} of nutrient to the Great Lakes algae <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> particular in the warmer and shallower portions of the system such as Lake Erie, Saginaw Bay, Green Bay, and the southernmost portion of Lake Michigan. By the mid-1980s, most jurisdictions bordering the Great Lakes had controlled phosphate detergents, resulting in sharp reductions in the frequency and extent of the blooms.|$|E
25|$|Buckwheat, a short-season crop, {{does well}} on low-fertility or acidic soils, but the soil must be well drained. Too much fertilizer, {{especially}} nitrogen, reduces yields. In hot climates {{it can be}} grown only by sowing late in the season, so that it <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> cooler weather. The presence of pollinators greatly increases the yield. The nectar from buckwheat flower makes a dark-colored honey. It is sometimes used as a green manure, as a plant for erosion control, or as wildlife cover and feed.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{consumers}} {{rely upon}} primary production {{as a main}} food source. The most important consumers of the pelagic web of the LSZ are copepods, along with the rotifers, flagellates and ciliates mentioned above. All species of calanoid copepods have declined under high predation pressure from the recently introduced Amur River clam (Corbula amurensis). Because of this, and because copepods rely upon both photosynthetic and detrital food sources, copepods in the LSZ have limited feedback on primary production, unlike marine and lentic systems where copepods can graze down <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> a matter of days.|$|E

25|$|Sulfate aerosol (SO42− and {{methanesulfonic acid}} droplets) act as CCNs. These sulfate {{aerosols}} form partly from the dimethyl sulfide (DMS) produced by phytoplankton {{in the open}} ocean. Large algal <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> ocean surface waters occur {{in a wide range}} of latitudes and contribute considerable DMS into the atmosphere to act as nuclei. The idea that an increase in global temperature would also increase phytoplankton activity and therefore CCN numbers was seen as a possible natural phenomenon that would counteract climate change. An increase of phytoplankton has been observed by scientists in certain areas but the causes are unclear.|$|E
25|$|Plant life {{along the}} Kishwaukee is abundant. Various native flora from burr oaks, and lady's {{slippers}} to lousewort, and trilliums to trout lilies. Skunk cabbage <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> late February {{and at the}} other end of the spectrum goldenrods and gentians bloom in late October, 1,070 species of plant are found in the Kishwaukee Basin, around 34% of the state's native vascular plants. Of that number 14 are listed as endangered in Illinois and another 14 as threatened in the state as of 1997. In addition the prairie bush clover is a federally threatened species that occurs in the basin.|$|E
25|$|Amber Lewis' {{sculpture}} {{is similar}} to the readymade in that each component of the artwork is readily available when you step outside (tree and rocks) or can be easily bought at any local hardware store (rope and bucket.) This piece diverts from Duchamp's readymades in that Lewis' sculpture can not be easily moved since it is site specific and is hung from a tree which is immobile. Part of the sculpture is the way the tree changes over time and never looks the same from day to day. The tree from which the bucket hangs is constantly changing with the seasons. In winter the tree has no leaves, but <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> the spring to eventually create leaves in the summer, only to drop them in the fall.|$|E

25|$|Eutrophication poses {{a problem}} {{not only to}} ecosystems, but to humans as well. Reducing {{eutrophication}} should be a key concern when considering future policy, and a sustainable solution for everyone, including farmers and ranchers, seems feasible. While eutrophication does pose problems, humans {{should be aware that}} natural runoff (which causes algal <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> the wild) is common in ecosystems and should thus not reverse nutrient concentrations beyond normal levels. Cleanup measures have been mostly, but not completely, successful. Finnish phosphorus removal measures started in the mid-1970s and have targeted rivers and lakes polluted by industrial and municipal discharges. These efforts have had a 90% removal efficiency. Still, some targeted point sources did not show a decrease in runoff despite reduction efforts.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, diatom {{cells in}} these resting populations {{re-enter}} the upper mixed layer when vertical mixing entrains them. In most circumstances, this mixing also replenishes nutrients {{in the upper}} mixed layer, setting the scene for {{the next round of}} diatom <b>blooms.</b> <b>In</b> the open ocean (away from areas of continuous upwelling), this cycle of bloom, bust, then return to pre-bloom conditions typically occurs over an annual cycle, with diatoms only being prevalent during the spring and early summer. In some locations, however, an autumn bloom may occur, caused by the breakdown of summer stratification and the entrainment of nutrients while light levels are still sufficient for growth. Since vertical mixing is increasing, and light levels are falling as winter approaches, these blooms are smaller and shorter-lived than their spring equivalents.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1994, Chadwick's {{exhibition}} Effluvia opened at the Serpentine, London. This exhibition marked {{the high point of}} Chadwick's exposure, receiving widespread critical attention and national press coverage. The exhibition was seen by 54,000 visitors, breaking the record for the gallery. In 1995, Chadwick received her first solo exhibition in the United States at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, entitled Helen Chadwick: Bad <b>Blooms.</b> <b>In</b> 1995, Chadwick took up an artist residency in the assisted conception unit at King's College Hospital, London, photographing IVF embryos rejected for implantation. She used the photos in Unnatural Selection, a series on which she was working when she died. Chadwick's work is included in the collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Tate and the Museum of Modern Art.|$|E

25|$|A {{grove of}} Japanese cherry trees exists along a roadway from near Grenadier Cafe leading down to Grenadier Pond, with {{spectacular}} <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> late April to early May. The grove {{is one of}} several plantings of Japanese cherry trees in the park. The others are along West Road, the shore of the pond and west of the Jamie Bell playground. In 1959, the first Japanese Somei-Yoshino Cherry Tree was planted in High Park, a gift from the citizens of Tokyo. A plaque marks the spot in 1959 where the trees were presented by the Japanese ambassador to Toronto mayor Nathan Phillips. Over 2000 cherry trees were donated to Toronto. Another 34 cherry trees were donated to High Park in 2001 from the Sakura project. These were planted around the Maple Leaf garden on the eastern shore of the pond. In 2006 a further 16 were planted in the park.|$|E
25|$|Following the oil spill, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh {{declared}} two {{islands and}} parts of the Sunshine coast as disaster areas. Cleanup efforts were reportedly going to cost at least $100,000 a day and last more than a week as the oil continued to spread. The company in charge of the cargo ship is faced with a possible $1.5million in fines for the incident. Several search parties have been sent to the spill area to attempt to find the potentially explosive materials that were in the 31 containers. Press reports stated that if the ammonium nitrate were to mix with the heavy fuel, it could ignite the ammonium nitrate and cause a large explosion. If the chemical did not react with the fuel, but still leaked out, marine life could be threatened by large <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> algae. A team of 88 people were sent out to begin the cleanup process and another 58 were expected to join within the following days. On Moreton Island, a total of 290 people are working to clean up the oil with most of them focusing on Middle Creek and Cape Moreton. Even though hundreds of people were working on cleaning the spill, the average amount cleaned each day was 1km2 (0.6mi2). It was not until May of that year that Moreton Island was finally cleared of oil. The cleanup effort was undertaken by 2,500 people and led to the removal of roughly 3,000 tonnes of contaminated sand.|$|E
500|$|This species <b>blooms</b> <b>in</b> {{late spring}} or early summer. The flowers are purple or magenta, rarely rose-pink, about [...] wide.
