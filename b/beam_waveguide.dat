40|$|A lot of {{research}} is being done {{in the field of}} Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) for use in telecom, datacom, optical sensing and visible light applications. Optical packaging of these PICs is still a challenge; increasing complexity leads to a higher number of interconnects and, combined with the need for sub-micrometer accuracy, this places a significant burden on the overall packaging costs. One proposed method of optical packaging of multichannel PICs focusses on the alignment of waveguides using an actuator integrated into the <b>waveguide</b> <b>beam.</b> The <b>waveguide</b> itself consists of a small silicon nitride core surrounded by a thick silicon oxide cladding (TriPleX). Typical dimensions for these <b>waveguide</b> <b>beams</b> are 16 ?m in thickness and width and 250 to 1000 ?m in length. By depositing of a layer of polysilicon on top of the <b>waveguide</b> <b>beam,</b> it is effectively turned into a bimorph actuator. Heating the polysilicon, and subsequently the TriPleX beam below, causes a deflection of the endpoint of the waveguide in vertical direction. This deflection can be varied to find the optimal alignment between waveguides. Due to the characteristics of the deposition process, mainly the high temperature, layered structures are subject to residual stress when cooled down to room temperature. This residual stress consists of a thermal part, caused by the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the two layers, and an intrinsic part, which is related to, among others, impurities introduced during deposition and structural mismatch at the interface between layers. This residual stress causes an initial deformation of the bimorph <b>waveguide</b> <b>beam,</b> in the form of curvature and elongation. In order to accurately align the waveguides the initial deformation of the bimorph beam needs to be known. Predicting this deformation {{is the subject of this}} thesis.

50|$|A <b>beam</b> <b>waveguide</b> antenna {{is a type}} of {{complicated}} Cassegrain antenna with a long radio wave path to allow the feed electronics to be located at ground level. It is used in very large steerable radio telescopes and satellite ground antennas, where the feed electronics is too complicated and bulky, or requires too much maintenance and alterations, to locate on the dish; for example those using cryogenically-cooled amplifiers. The beam of incoming radio waves from the secondary reflector is reflected by additional mirrors in a long twisting path through the axes of the altazimuth mount, so the antenna can be steered without interrupting the beam, and then down through the antenna tower to a feed building at ground level.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Beam</b> <b>waveguide</b> antennas {{are used}} in large radio telescopes and {{satellite}} communication stations {{as an alternative to}} the most common parabolic antenna design, the conventional [...] "front fed" [...] parabolic antenna. In front feed, the antenna feed, the small antenna that transmits or receives the radio waves reflected by the dish, is suspended at the focus, in front of the dish. However, this location causes a number of practical difficulties. In high performance systems, complex transmitter and receiver electronics must be located at the feed antenna. This feed equipment usually requires high maintenance; some examples are water cooling for transmitters and cryogenic cooling for sensitive receivers. With the large dishes used in these systems, the focus is high off the ground, and servicing requires cranes or scaffolds, and outdoor work with delicate equipment high off the ground. Furthermore, the feeds themselves have to be designed to handle outdoor conditions such as rain and large temperature swings, and to work while tipped at any angle.|$|E
