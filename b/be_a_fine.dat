25|$|The Great Court Run is {{an attempt}} to run round the 400-yard {{perimeter}} of Great Court (approximately 367m), in the 43 seconds of the clock striking twelve. Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit {{on the day of the}} Matriculation Dinner. It is a rather difficult challenge: one needs to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> sprinter to achieve it, but it is by no means necessary to be of Olympic standard, despite assertions made in the press.|$|E
25|$|The L class {{proved to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> {{locomotive}} for express passenger service where their high power output {{was put to}} good use hauling The Gippslander and other services at the line speed limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, in heavy freight service they were somewhat less successful, as their relatively light weight and low factor of adhesion caused them to slip on heavy loads. Despite this, they were regularly used to haul heavy briquette trains of over 1,000 tons from the Latrobe Valley to Melbourne. They could also be seen on some suburban freight services.|$|E

It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children.

25|$|There is some {{dispute over}} how much direct {{operational}} control Haig maintained in the Hundred Days, Tim Travers arguing that he exercised “a symbolic form of leadership”, allowing his Army Commanders (Plumer, Byng, Horne, Birdwood and Rawlinson) a very free hand, whilst {{at the same time}} Ferdinand Foch, whose role had initially been confined to advice and deployment of reserves, was exerting ever-greater influence over strategy. Robin Prior argues that by the second half of 1918 both Lloyd George and Haig were “moving steadily to the sidelines”, although he also concedes that Haig intervened in operations much less now he knew the BEF to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> fighting instrument and “he proved far more effective as a commander” as a result. By contrast Sheffield argues that Haig was Foch’s principal subordinate—they met sixty times between April and November—and influenced his strategy (in Wiest's view Foch was also “a buffer between Haig and his political tormentors in London”.) “At last (Haig) was able to behave as the sort of “arms-length” Commander-in-Chief that was his ideal: setting broad objectives” but devolving detailed planning of battles. Besides, “he had presided over the transformation of the army” and “Haig’s performance as a general improved as the army matured. He was … doing fewer things better”. GHQ also {{played a key role in}} sequencing the attacks of the armies in late September, and keeping them fully supplied.|$|E

500|$|A refined {{scheme for}} stellar {{classification}} {{was published in}} 1943 by William Wilson Morgan and Philip Childs Keenan. The MK classification assigned each star a spectral type—based on the Harvard classification—and a luminosity class. [...] The Harvard classification had been developed by assigning a different letter to each star based {{on the strength of}} the hydrogen spectral line, before the relationship between spectra and temperature was known. [...] When ordered by temperature and when duplicate classes were removed, [...] the spectral types of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K and M. (A popular mnemonic for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is [...] "Oh <b>Be</b> <b>A</b> <b>Fine</b> Girl/Guy, Kiss Me".) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.|$|E

500|$|Juxtaposed {{against the}} {{struggle}} to survive is the enchanting but short beauty of childhood. The magic in the plot reinforces the sense of enchantment and gives the book a fairy-tale like quality, leading the BolognaRagazzi Awards jury to speak of [...] "the great Secret (that) lurks in the story". It is the child Calpurnia who follows the magic to find the river and save the adults from starvation. The contrast of an idealized and protected childhood with the harsh realities that adults must face is another theme common to Rawlings' writings, expressed in the famous speech about adult reality Ezra [...] "Penny" [...] Baxter delivers to his son Jody {{at the end of}} The Yearling: [...] "Ever’ man wants life to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> thing, and [...] easy. ’Tis fine, boy, powerful fine, but ’tain’t easy.

500|$|As smaller states {{ratified}} the constitution in late 1787 and early 1788, {{there was an}} immense quantity of pamphlets and other written matter for and against approval. Most prominent in support were the pamphlets later collected as The Federalist, written by Madison and two New Yorkers, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay; Mason's objections were widely cited by opponents. Mason had begun his Objections to this Constitution of Government in Philadelphia; in October 1787, it was published, though without his permission. Madison complained that Mason had gone beyond the reasons for opposing he had stated in convention, but Broadwater suggested the major difference was one of tone, since the written work dismissed as useless {{the constitution and the}} proposed federal government. Nevertheless, both Lee and Mason believed that if proper amendments were made, the constitution would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> instrument of governance. The Objections were widely cited in opposition to ratification, and Mason was criticized for placing his own name on it, at a time when political tracts were signed, if at all, with pen names such as Junius, so that the author's reputation would not influence the debate. Despite this, Mason's Objections were among the most influential Anti-Federalist works, and its opening line, [...] "There is no Declaration of Rights", likely their most effective slogan.|$|E
500|$|The cap is conical to convex to bell-shaped, {{occasionally}} {{with a low}} {{and broad}} umbo, and reaches [...] in diameter. When moist, it is partly translucent, and grooves corresponding {{to the position of}} the gills under tha cap can be seen.

The surface is initially —covered with what appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> white powder (remnants of the universal veil that covered the immature fruit body)—but this soon sloughs off, leaving it smooth. The cap surface is a dull violet color when young, then becomes somewhat paler near the margin. The flesh is up to 0.5mm thick, white, and lacks any distinctive odor and taste. The slender stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, and hollow. Its surface is dry, dull violet to grayish-violet over the entire length.

The gills are narrowly attached to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 19 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 1.2mm broad, thin, and pale brownish.

The color is blackish-brown at the center, dark brown to reddish-brown farther outward, and becoming much paler at the margin; sometimes the cap is evenly dark brown.

The stem is [...] long by [...] wide, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, central, slender, and hollow.

2500|$|In 1901, Annie Jump Cannon {{returned}} to the lettered types, but dropped all letters except O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, used in that order, as well as P for planetary nebulae and Q for some peculiar spectra. She also used types such as B5A for stars halfway between types B and A, F2G for stars one-fifth of the way from F to G, and so forth. Finally, by 1912, Cannon had changed the types B, A, B5A, F2G, etc. to B0, A0, B5, F2, etc. This is essentially the modern form of the Harvard classification system. A common mnemonic for remembering the spectral type letters is [...] "Oh, <b>Be</b> <b>A</b> <b>Fine</b> Guy/Girl, Kiss Me".|$|E

Fencing made of galvanized metal or hard-plastic sheets helps keep out some predators. A cover will protect against heavy rain.
