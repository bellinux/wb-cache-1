It can be clearly seen that the middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>zones</b> of 1  wt% Pt/Al-SBA- 15 had the highest hard coke content in the catalyst bed, whereas there was slightly less coke in the top zone. This suggests that the middle and <b>bottom</b> <b>zones</b> of the catalyst bed contributed the most activity, where the reaction took place. In addition, the lower coke content in the top zone is to some extent indicative of the low acidity of this catalyst and the fact that no diffusion limitations were encountered with it, since such limitations would result in coking and would cause the top section of the bed to be coke rich.|$|R
40|$|In the Pikes Peak {{oil field}} near Lloydminster, Canada, a {{significant}} amount of heavy oil reserves is located in reservoirs with a <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone.</b> The properties of the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone</b> and the operation parameters significantly affect oil production performance via the steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) process. Thus, in order to develop this type of heavy oil resource, a full understanding of the effects of these properties is necessary. In this study, the numerical simulation approach was applied to study the effects of properties in the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone</b> in the SAGD process, such as the initial gas oil ratio, the thickness of the reservoir, and oil saturation of the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone.</b> In addition, some operation parameters were studied including the injection pressure, the SAGD well pair location, and five different well patterns: (1) two corner wells, (2) triple wells, (3) downhole water sink well, (4) vertical injectors with a horizontal producer, and (5) fishbone well. The numerical simulation results suggest that the properties of the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone</b> affect production performance extremely. First, both positive and negative effects were observed when solution gas exists in the heavy oil. Second, a logarithmical relationship was investigated between the bottom water production ratio and the thickness of the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone.</b> Third, a non-linear relation was obtained between the oil recovery factor and oil saturation in the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone,</b> and a peak oil recovery was achieved at the oil saturation rate of 30 % in the <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone.</b> Furthermore, the operation parameters affected the heavy oil production performance. Comparison of the well patterns showed that the two corner wells and the triple wells patterns obtained the highest oil recovery factors of 74. 71 % and 77. 19 %, respectively, which are almost twice the oil recovery factors gained in the conventional SAGD process (47. 84 %). This indicates that the optimized SAGD process with the two corner wells and the triple wells pattern is able to improve SAGD production performance in a heavy oil reservoir with a <b>bottom</b> water <b>zone...</b>|$|R

Numerous past research studies have analysed the microstructural transformation of alloys in a mould, but few researchers have investigated this phenomenon on the cooling slope plate. A change in the microstructure of the alloy from dendritic to non-dendritic is clearly obtained as the alloy moves from the impact zone to <b>bottom</b> <b>zone</b> on the cooling slope plate.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} temperature and moisture gradients on starch gelatinization and egg denaturation, and on protein extractabilities during cake baking. Differences in crumb structure in the center, top, and bottom zones of cake as measured with X-ray microfocus-computed tomography were successfully related to the moment at which starch gelatinized and protein aggregated during baking, which stiffened the cell walls. The temperature in {{the top and bottom}} zones of cake increased faster than {{in the center of the}} cake due to facilitated heat transfer. This resulted in lower water availability in top and bottom zones, leading to incomplete gelatinization of starch after baking in these zones. In the top zone, extended starch gelatinization and protein polymerization led to later cell wall formation, resulting in a broader cell size distribution. The <b>bottom</b> <b>zone</b> of cake reached the highest temperatures during baking with more substantial starch gelatinization and egg denaturation within the first 25 min of baking. During the final 20 min of baking, little if any change in gelatinization enthalpy and protein extractability was found due to the very low water availability in this region. The <b>bottom</b> <b>zone</b> of the crumb showed a broader cell wall size distribution, which was associated with more collapse.

Along the vertical direction of the bed, a more uniform distribution of biomass particles is found at a low superficial velocity than at a high superficial velocity. With respect to lateral mixing, the biomass concentration in the center increases with the superficial velocity, whereas it decreases in the wall region. The biomass concentration in the bottom region decreases with the superficial velocity, but increases in the upper region of the bed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of oxygen precipitates in the bottom part of multicrystalline silicon ingots on the metal diffusion has been studied. According to the well known haze test, an experimental setup for the measurement of diffusion velocity at 700 °C was developed, in which the copper was detected using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence. Differences in the diffusion velocity and the gettering amount for copper in samples with low-oxygen and high-oxygen were observed. Thus gettering efficiency seems {{to be dependent on}} oxygen content. Metal precipitates detected were found to contain Si, O and Cu. Since these precipitates appear along grain boundaries, it is assumed that grain boundaries act as a diffusion channel. As a consequence, oxygen precipitates located at the grain boundary should be most effective for intrinsic gettering. The results of these studies are encouraging since they imply that an optimized oxygen precipitate concentration in the <b>bottom</b> <b>zone</b> of a multicrystalline silicon ingot can be used as an effective intrinsic diffusion barrier...|$|E
