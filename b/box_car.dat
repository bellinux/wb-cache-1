5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E
5|$|<b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer is {{the sole}} studio album by American rock band of the same name. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} May 21, 2002 through MCA Records. The band was a side-project of Blink-182 members Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker, with David Kennedy completing the band's studio lineup; a bassist and friend of Barker, Anthony Celestino, toured with the band throughout late 2002. The record was the only studio effort the trio produced together, and was recorded {{over the course of}} six weeks in late 2001.|$|E

5|$|Inspired by {{personal}} crises and global events, We Don't Need to Whisper was conceptualized as DeLonge taught himself to play instruments and created {{his own home}} studio. He recruited his longtime friend and guitarist David Kennedy of <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, as well as drummer Atom Willard and bassist Ryan Sinn to form Angels & Airwaves, who were primarily inspired by arena rock groups such as U2 and The Police. DeLonge's later public statements regarding the band's music prompted media interest and concern from his relatives and family.|$|E

25|$|The site {{chosen for}} the {{terminal}} complex was already owned by the railroad and served by tracks connecting with the East Dallas GC yard. The original Santa Fe station in Dallas {{was built on the}} site in 1884 and replaced by the 1896 Richardsonian Romanesque passenger station. The latter was one of six depots belonging to different railroads which became redundant with the completion of Union Station in 1916. The depot was razed and a vast, 100,000 cubic yard excavation done with the equivalent of a <b>box</b> <b>car</b> load of dynamite.|$|E

Locomotive #3 was sold to the Wiscasset and Quebec Railroad in 1894. The Sandy River Railroad had 16 <b>box</b> <b>cars</b> and 13 flat cars in 1894, and ordered 4 <b>box</b> <b>cars</b> and 8 flat cars from the Portland Company that year. Portland Company delivered 10 more <b>box</b> <b>cars</b> and 10 more flat cars in 1897.

25|$|Carol covers {{herself in}} walker viscera to {{blend into the}} horde as to {{approach}} the train yard unseen. She ignites a propane tank near the fence that explodes, creating a breach for the walkers to enter; this creates a panic throughout Terminus that allows Rick and the others to overpower their captors and kill them. They free {{the others in the}} <b>box</b> <b>car</b> and make their way out of Terminus. Carol, meanwhile, discovers the supplies taken from Rick's group and recovers some of them. She then finds Mary, and gets into a fight with her when she refuses to tell her where Rick's group was kept. When Carol gets the upper hand, Mary pleads for her life, insisting they were good people once, but Carol, disgusted with their cannibalism, shoots at her leg and leaves her to be overwhelmed by walkers.|$|E
25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a <b>box</b> <b>car</b> and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.|$|E
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega—who are chained together—jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every <b>box</b> <b>car.</b> If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

500|$|Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine was {{favorable}} in {{his review}} of <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, writing, [...] "Neither genre-obsessed nor intent on defying convention, <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer is the perfect union between pop-punk riffs and instrumentation that spans all rock genres from indie to folk. Finally, we have a pop band that is attempting {{to take advantage of}} the potential of its instruments." [...] Adam Dlugacz of PopMatters summarized <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer as [...] "pretty fantastic hardcore/emo/punk rock album. It seems to re-affirm the band's roots while proving that they are capable of more than the by-the-numbers approach of Blink. On the other hand, there's no reason this couldn't have been a Blink-182 album." [...] Robert Morast from Argus Leader felt the same, commenting, [...] "The music is good with brooding melodies that fester inside the soul. But for DeLonge, it just sounds like he's lost searching for his other half." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer was {{inspired}} by and is partly a tribute to bands DeLonge credited as an influence, such as Quicksand, Fugazi, and Refused. Musically, it is not drastically different than Blink-182, though it puts more emphasis on [...] "slower, heavier rhythms" [...] instead of being fast-paced. Stylically, reviewers variously dubbed the album post-hardcore, pop punk, punk rock, hardcore punk, emo, post-punk, or power pop. The subject matter found on <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer explores the apocalypse, conspiracies and Freemasonry. The album follows a central storyline, regarding an unnamed boy during {{the end of the}} world.|$|E
500|$|The post-hardcore {{sound of}} <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer {{inspired}} {{the change in}} tone and experimental nature the band approached Blink-182 with. Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: [...] "Before, we got one guitar sound that we changed a little bit through the record. This time {{we want to try}} a whole different setup for each song." [...] Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to [...] " [...] as the next Blink-182 record — {{think of it as the}} first Blink-182 record." [...] The members were also inspired after hearing [...] by Bad Astronaut and its expansive sound. [...] "Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two", said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. [...] "Box Car Racer opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album." ...|$|E

500|$|For DeLonge, he had {{developed}} an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was." [...] According to DeLonge, <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer was not [...] "meant {{to be a real}} band," [...] but rather [...] "something to do in some spare time that was really only expected to be on the low list of the totem pole of priorities in my life, and just to have an experimental creative outlet." [...] The project was at first solely acoustic guitar-based; he considered it in its earliest stages to be a [...] "Violent Femmes-esque acoustic record". The unnamed project went through other names, such as The Kill, and the album was initially titled Et tu, Brute?. He eventually settled on the name <b>Box</b> <b>Car</b> Racer, which was actually the name of a band Barker was in just after high school that DeLonge liked. He began writing songs {{about the end of the}} world, and connected it thematically with the biblical Book of Revelation and World War II. When reading about the war, DeLonge was [...] "freaked out" [...] to learn that Fat Man, the atomic bomb that was detonated over Nagasaki, was dropped from the B-29 bomber Bockscar (commonly misspelled Boxcar).|$|E
500|$|After electrification, {{the outer}} {{suburban}} routes were worked with carriage stock hauled from Baker Street by an electric locomotive that was exchanged for a steam locomotive en route.

These 'camel-back' bogie locomotives had a central cab, weighed 50tons, and had four [...] traction motors The second type were built to a <b>box</b> <b>car</b> design with British Thomson-Houston equipment, replaced with the Westinghouse type in 1919.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} album, the project {{morphed into a}} full band, with Barker, DeLonge, and Kennedy. Barker invited his friend Anthony Celestino to play bass.
