5|$|Minton {{played an}} {{important}} role behind the scenes of the Court as a peacemaker between its two opposing factions. These attempts to keep the peace led Justice Frankfurter to remark that while Minton would never <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great justice, he would <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great colleague by his fellow justices.|$|E
5|$|Leader of the Opposition and Labour leader Ed Miliband, {{who knew}} Benn {{personally}} {{as a family}} friend, said:I think Tony Benn will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> champion of the powerless, as a conviction politician, as somebody of deep principle and integrity. The thing about Tony Benn is that you always knew what he stood for, and who he stood up for. And I think that's why he was admired right across the political spectrum. There are people who agreed with him and disagreed with him, including in my own party, but I think people admired that sense of conviction and integrity that shone through from Tony Benn.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry {{has never}} been officially canonized, he has been {{referred}} to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. Henry is currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland. He continues to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, where the cathedral church is dedicated to Henry's memory. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Marco Pasinato.|$|E

5|$|Sharon calls Grant back to Walford, and he persuades Phil not to help Peggy. She {{tells them}} both {{she will not}} kill herself, and after {{settling}} old feuds with Dot, Stacey and Sharon, Peggy receives a vision of her old friend Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). She decides she wants to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong woman, not as weak in her bed, and takes a lethal overdose of pills that she hid from her sons and dies in her sleep that night. Phil is devastated to find her body, and a letter from her urges him to love himself as others love him. Peggy's funeral takes place on 4 July 2016, and Phil is due to do a eulogy to her there but gets too emotional and runs home. Sharon later calms him down by revealing that Peggy {{was the one who}} sent Eric to prison when Phil was a child, not corrupt police officers as he was previously told, and that she did it to protect him. Phil later works up the courage to finish his eulogy to Peggy at the wake, and then returns to her grave at the church to finish his goodbyes to her, unaware that Grant has secretly left a rose at the grave.|$|E
25|$|Dom's two-year-long stint saw {{the show}} receive huge ratings and the period <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> well done and iconic season. The {{character}} remains mentioned {{and referred to}} as a menacing and monumental character who brought the show back its excitement.|$|E
25|$|Sylvanus Morley {{was also}} to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{spokesman}} and {{representative of the}} Maya peoples, among whom he spent {{so much of his}} time, and who otherwise lacked the means to directly address some of their concerns with the wider public.|$|E

25|$|As {{he heads}} into his mid-30s, Bosman's {{opportunities}} for South Africa {{may begin to}} wane, and though he will <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> punishing Twenty20 batsman, it remains a mystery {{as to why he}} was never able to take his success in the format into 50-over or first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|The {{union with}} Saxony was of {{beneficial}} {{economic and cultural}} consequences for both participating societies. The Saxons were important in the dissemination of the early Enlightenment intellectual currents in the Commonwealth. Józef Aleksander Jabłonowski, the founder of a scientific society in Leipzig, {{was one of the}} Poles active in Saxony. The personal union times were to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> period of positive Polish-German interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{works are}} also a social satire and this {{publication}} will spur renewed interest in his satires. Rotimi is sure to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model in the literary genre whose views have shaped {{the conduct of the}} theatre and whose plays have demonstrated the power of drama to shape the thinking of the society and attempted to solve some of the problems encountered in everyday living.|$|E
50|$|He <b>is</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{interesting}} character. For example, in Manchester {{during the}} war he <b>was</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cloaked figure striding the parapets, as he carried out his duties <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fire warden. He was also known for startling the travelling public by carrying around a large string bag filled with garishly coloured stellated icosahedra.|$|R

25|$|The England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, {{was never}} truly settled {{throughout}} the 1980s, which will probably <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> low {{point for the}} team. While {{some of the great}} players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.|$|E
25|$|Archimedes (287-212 BC), of Syracuse, Sicily, {{when it was}} a Greek city-state, {{is often}} {{considered}} to be the greatest of the Greek mathematicians, and occasionally even named as one of the three greatest of all time (along with Isaac Newton and Carl Friedrich Gauss). Had he not been a mathematician, he would still <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great physicist, engineer, and inventor. In his mathematics, he developed methods very similar to the coordinate systems of analytic geometry, and the limiting process of integral calculus. The only element lacking for the creation of these fields was an efficient algebraic notation in which to express his concepts.|$|E
25|$|It {{ought to}} <b>be</b> <b>remembered,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{comment on the}} {{unfavourable}} description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered {{that one of the}} chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon le bonhomme or le bon (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme. They have not.|$|E

500|$|Tiberius {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} Roman generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and temporarily, parts of Germania, laid the foundations for the northern frontier. But he came to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> dark, reclusive, and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him tristissimus hominum, [...] "the gloomiest of men." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of Bloch's biography, Murray writes: [...] "Jeremy Thorpe had hoped to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> great {{political}} leader. I suppose they all do.

500|$|When {{asked about}} the impact Vonnegut had on his work, author Josip Novakovich stated that he has [...] "much to learn from Vonnegut—how to {{compress}} things and yet not compromise them, how to digress into history, quote from various historical accounts, and not stifle the narrative. The ease with which he writes is sheerly masterly, Mozartian." [...] Los Angeles Times columnist Gregory Rodriguez said that the author will [...] "rightly <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> darkly humorous social critic and the premier novelist of the counterculture", and Dinitia Smith of The New York Times dubbed Vonnegut the [...] "counterculture's novelist." ...|$|E
500|$|Nutter {{predominantly}} {{played as}} a left-sided full-back, {{although he did}} play on the left wing {{in the early stages}} of his career. He was left-footed. Gillingham manager Mark Stimson [...] described him as [...] "an attacking full-back with plenty of technical ability", and stated that Nutter would [...] "offer plenty of width down the left hand side", in-turn being [...] "a constant attacking threat". He expressed a passion to pass the ball along the floor, and always prefers to pass the ball out as opposed to hitting it long. Talking about his time at Stevenage, Nutter [...] stated he would like to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> player [...] "who tried to play football the right way, passing the ball, technically good to watch and an honest player".|$|E
500|$|Writing before Inside No. 9 was televised, {{broadcaster}} {{and journalist}} Mark Lawson suggested that, among anthology series, the programme possessed [...] "the potential to <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> singular achievement". Commending both the acting and writing of Inside No. 9, New Statesman television critic Rachel Cooke offered a positive verdict of the programme {{after seeing the}} first half of the series. Cooke expressed particular admiration of Pemberton and Shearsmith's ability to squeeze [...] "perfectly formed narratives – [...] characters with proper backstories, scenarios that are complicated and unwind relatively slowly – [...] into just 30 minutes". Also writing mid-series, journalist Gareth Lightfoot called Inside No. 9 [...] "hands down the best, freshest thing on [...] at the moment" [...] in the Evening Gazette, though he doubted whether it could truly be considered comedy.|$|E
