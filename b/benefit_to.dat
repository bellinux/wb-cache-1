Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a <b>benefit</b> <b>to</b> the player's civilization.

Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
