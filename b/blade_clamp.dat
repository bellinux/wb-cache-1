40|$|Background: Current {{development}} of surgery {{is due to}} medical practitioners and surgeons practices and experiments throughout the history. Albucasis, the Muslim Spanish physician in 10 century AD {{was one of the}} pioneers in surgery that had major influence by his innovations in surgical techniques, treatment approaches and invention of instruments. He introduced a type of surgical knife named Mokhdea in his treaties, Al Tasreef that had mobile lancet. Material and Method: In this paper, we represent this historical instrument according to Albucasis points of view. Also, this knife was reproduced and finally a modified version of it was suggested for current using according to ancient knowledge. Results: Albucasis presented a retractable surgical knife with figure in the 30 th volume of his book, Al Tasreef. According to his description, this instrument was made including <b>blade,</b> <b>clamp</b> and handle. Also, a standardized new scale up surgical knife was suggested. This instrument includes a blade united with a lever that moves throughout a rail in the handle. Conclusion: The idea of making retractable surgical knife dates back to about 1000 years ago; presented by Muslim physician, Albucasis. Also, new presented surgical knife is better compared with current knives because of its comfortable using, safety and scale up...|$|E

Although wing nuts are usually intended for operation without tools it is often impossible to apply sufficient force purely by hand. Wingnut spanners (US English: wrenches) greatly increase the torque that may be applied, ensuring that the <b>blade</b> is securely <b>clamped.</b>|$|R

After confirming that {{the tip of}} the glans is free of the <b>blades,</b> the <b>clamp</b> is locked, and a scalpel is used to cut the skin from the flat (upper) side of the clamp. In newborns, no sutures are required. Outside of the newborn period, cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive can be used instead of sutures.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Y 172 fiber slicer (also says Hartz slicer) {{is often}} used in slicing fiber in fabric inspection. However, there are some {{problems}} {{for this kind of}} slicer, such as low success, low efficiency, poor safety and so on. A new fiber automatic slicing instrument is proposed in this paper. Some creative designs are done, in aspects of slicing thickness adjustment, automatic fiber cutting, <b>blade</b> constant <b>clamping</b> and gravity pressure. This fiber slicing instrument changed traditional slicing method, and effectively resolved the problems of Y 172 fiber slicer. A reliable and efficient instrument is provided for fast and accurate slicing fiber...|$|R
50|$|As {{the planes}} are only {{used for a}} narrow task, they are not {{adjustable}} and they are made with fixed mouths and a <b>blade</b> that is <b>clamped</b> in place by a simple wedge, or by a clamp screw, not an adjuster. To add mass to such a small plane, they are commonly cast in a dense brass or bronze alloy. Luthiers making their own planes typically make them from offcuts of dense tropical hardwoods. Ibex is a widely known manufacturer of bronze planes.|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{results of}} numerical FE- calculations for modern skew propeller blades and their experimental validation. It {{is restricted to}} single <b>clamped</b> <b>blades,</b> an assumption easy to implement in the theoretical calculation but difficult to achieve in an experiment. Assumptions for the FE- calculations and the incomplete rigid clamped boundary condition in the experiment yield differences between experiment and theory, mainly in the eigenfrequencies. The fluid coupling to the structure {{is limited to the}} inviscid, incompressible case or k 1 << 1. In the limits of these assumptions the results of both, theory and experiments agree fairly...|$|R
40|$|Deformation {{control of}} a silicon-wafer slicer cutting a crystal ingot is studied analytically. The thin {{rotating}} <b>blade</b> is <b>clamped</b> at the outer boundary and prestressed in the radial direction, while the inner periphery is subjected to stationary, distributed in-plane and lateral slicing loads from the workpiece. The deflection of the blade is obtained analytically by introducing the multi-model expansion method, further applying the Galerkin method to the governing equations of the system. Numerical results are presented for an actual SUS 301 blade cutting a 6 "-diameter silicon ingot at a speed of 1550 rpm. Two control schemes that maintain the flatness of the rotating blade are examined in detail. In the first scheme, a pair of concentrated lateral forces are applied to the blade to reduce the blade deflection. In the second scheme, a pair of moments are also applied to the blade to improve the flatness of blade. Simulation results obtained show that the application of control moment {{is more effective than}} the simple lateral forces to the improvement of flatness of the slicing blade...|$|R
50|$|Bikes may {{be mounted}} in the {{carriers}} by clamping both wheels and providing some additional vertical support, by clamping the rear wheel and the front dropouts (necessitating {{the removal of the}} front wheel, which may be mounted separately on <b>blades),</b> or by <b>clamping</b> the top tube (usually in the case of rear hitch mounted carriers). There is a device available that connects from the stem to the seat post, to provide a top tube equivalent suitable for mounting in these carriers for step-through frame bicycles that do not have a top tube. Carriers that clamp on the front dropouts may also provide a built-in locking mechanism.Carriers have been developed especially for the rear of pickup trucks that attach either to the bed or its sides.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of an ID sawblade slicing a crystal ingot is studied analytically with {{the effect of}} the air film stiffness between the ingot and the blade taken into account. The rotating <b>blade</b> is <b>clamped</b> and stressed initially in the radial direction at the outer periphery, while the inner edge is subjected to both the in-plane stationary and the lateral dynamic slicing loads from the workpiece. The solution is obtained by using the Fourier expansion method, and also the Galerkin method on the governing equations of the system. The distributed air film between the blade and the ingot is approximated by a set of parallel translational springs. Numerical results are presented for an actual SUS 301 blade cutting a 6 "-diameter silicon ingot at a speed of 1550 rpm. Both the steady-state and the transient {{response of}} the blade are obtained. Effects of the spring stiffness and the location on the blade deflection are examined. The results obtained show that the blade deflection is greatly affected by the air film stiffness, and that the flatness of the rotating blade is improved effectively by controlling the air flow rate and increasing the air film stiffness appropriately between the blade and the ingot...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexural}} vibration of {{a rotating}} propeller <b>blade</b> with <b>clamped</b> shank is analyzed with {{the object of}} presenting, in matrix form, equations for the elastic bending moments in forced vibration resulting from aerodynamic forces applied at a fixed multiple of rotational speed. Matrix equations are also derived which define the critical speeds end mode shapes for any excitation order and the relation between critical speed and blade angle. Reference is given to standard works on the numerical solution of matrix equations of the forms derived. The use of a segmented blade as an approximation to a continuous blade provides a simple means for obtaining the matrix solution from the integral equation of equilibrium, so that, in the numerical application of the method presented, the several matrix arrays of the basic physical characteristics of the propeller blade are of simple form, end their simplicity is preserved until, with the solution in sight, numerical manipulations well-known in matrix algebra yield the desired critical speeds and mode shapes frame which the vibration at any operating condition may be synthesized. A close correspondence between the familiar Stodola method and the matrix method is pointed out, indicating that any features of novelty are characteristic not of the analytical procedure but only of the abbreviation, condensation, and efficient organization of the numerical procedure {{made possible by the}} use of classical matrix theory...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of jig {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all jigs {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to <b>clamp</b> the <b>blade</b> or tool in some way. The jig then has some means of referencing the <b>clamped</b> <b>blade</b> to the grinding or honing apparatus so that the bevel angle is maintained. One of the more common approaches {{is to have the}} jig ride on a roller. These types of jigs are usually used with a sharpening stone or plate, such as a waterstone, oilstone or diamond abrasive surface. Other types of jigs are used to present the blade to the wheel of a grinder. There are generally two types of hand sharpening jigs, push jigs and side to side jigs. Push jigs run perpendicular to the length of the stone and a side to side jig runs with the blade parallel to the length of the stone.|$|R
40|$|In 1877, von G. W. Eck made an {{anastomosis}} {{between the}} portal vein and vena cava inferior and by ligating {{the upper part}} of the portal system, the portal blood was transferred to the vena cava inferior. This method of so-called Eck's fistula was thereafter further studied and improved on by many authorities. Above all, the method which is used “three <b>bladed</b> <b>clamp</b> forceps” after Jeger, Horsley, or Yabuki, etc., is generally brought into practice nowadays, as it is the most non-dangerous, however, the result of the operation is either in failure or unsatisfactory unless a large animal which possesses some large blood-vessels is employed. The new method established by the author is well improved on and can be applied even to such animal as rabbit which possesses relatively small blood-vessels. Turning my attention that it is very convenient to use the simple forceps which has no middle blade, I reformed the “Hernio-clamp-forceps” to make use of compressing arteries. The whole length of the forceps and its blade-length measure 18 cm, and 8 cm, respectively. It curves to a crescent-shape and the portion 3 cm long, near the point is defaced on its curved face, making the blade-thickness to 0. 1 cm. This defaced portion is of use to compress together the portal vein and the vena cava inferior which are to be communicated. By using this clamp-forceps it was ascertained that the blood-vessels which measure only 0. 4 cm, diameter also can be anastomosed without closuring their circulation of the blood. The process of the new method is quite similar as before until it reaches to the vena cava inferior and the portal vein and firstly, the portal vein is caught with a ligature by inducing of an anuerysm-needle at the first branch of the porta hepatis, it is prepared for the subsequent ligation. Secondly, for the vena cava inferior, the hepatorenal ligament is separated and pressed the liver as much as possible and a ligature is caught to this vein, coinciding with the above loop of ligature of the portal vein. Both the blood-vessels are peeled their tunica adventitia at the anastomosed region and the two ligatures above mentioned are softly and carefully pulled by an assistant and let the both blood-vessels bring in contact with. The operator fixes horizontally the two blood-vessels with forceps and compresses them together, keeping the circulation of the blood of portal vein. On this ocassion, it must be careful not to pinch the ligature or the adjacent tissues. As the two blood-vessels are kept horizontally, the circulation of the blood of the large vena cave inferior is not interfered. Next, at the region where the tunica adventitia is peeled a certain longitudinal section is done and an anastomosis in situ is followed by a running suture. By this method, not only the operation on dog is easily performed but also it is well applied on small animal such as rabbit which was hitherto considered to be very difficult. However, on rabbit as its blood-vessels are very small and at the same time their walls are also very thin, it is frequently very hard to perform the anastomosis, keeping the circulation of the blood...|$|R
40|$|Background: Each year, {{more than}} 200 million {{children}} under the age of 5 years, almost all in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), fail to achieve their developmental potential. Risk factors for compromised development often coexist and include inadequate cognitive stimulation, poverty, nutritional deficiencies, infection and complications of being born low birthweight and/or premature. Moreover, many of these risk factors are closely associated with newborn morbidity and mortality. As compromised development has significant implications on human capital, inexpensive and scalable interventions are urgently needed to promote neurodevelopment and reduce risk factors for impaired development. Method/Design: This cluster randomized trial aims at evaluating the impact of volunteer community health workers delivering either an integrated neonatal survival kit, an early stimulation package, or a combination of both interventions, to pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy, compared to the current standard of care in Kwale County, Kenya. The neonatal survival kit comprises a clean delivery kit (sterile <b>blade,</b> cord <b>clamp,</b> clean plastic sheet, surgical gloves and hand soap), sunflower oil emollient, chlorhexidine, ThermoSpot(TM), Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable instant heater. Community health workers are also equipped with a portable hand-held electric scale. The early cognitive stimulation package focuses on enhancing caregiver practices by teaching caregivers three key messages that comprise combining a gentle touch with making eye contact and talking to children, responsive feeding and caregiving, and singing. The primary outcome measure is child development at 12 months of age assessed with the Protocol for Child Monitoring (Infant and Toddler version). The main secondary outcome is newborn mortality. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on effectiveness of delivering an innovative neonatal survival kit and/or early stimulation package to pregnant women in Kwale County, Kenya. Study findings will help inform policy on the most appropriate interventions for promoting healthy brain development and reduction of newborn morbidity and mortality in Kenya and other similar setting...|$|R
40|$|Dry {{friction}} dampers {{are widely}} used to reduce vibration. The forced vibration response of a simplified turbine blade with {{a new kind of}} under-platform dry friction dampers is studied in this paper. The model consists of a <b>clamped</b> <b>blade</b> as two rigidly connected beams and two dampers in the form of masses which are allowed to slide along the blade platform in the horizontal direction and vibrate with the blade platform in the vertical direction. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the two dampers, and the horizontal and transverse platform vibrations are coupled by friction at the contact interfaces which is assumed to follow the classical discontinuous Coulomb’s law of friction. The vertical motion of the dampers leads to time-varying contact forces and can cause horizontal stick-slip motion between the contact surfaces. Due to the relative horizontal motion between the dampers and the blade platform, the vertical contact forces and the resultant friction forces act as moving loads. The Finite Element (FE) method and Modal Superposition (MS) method are applied to solve the dynamic response, together with an algorithm that can capture nonsmooth transitions from stick to slip and slip to stick. Quasi-periodic vibration is found even under harmonic excitation...|$|R
40|$|In the ﬁeld of turbomachinery, {{vibration}} amplitude is often reduced by dissipating the kinetic {{energy of the}} blades with devices that utilize dry friction. Under-platform dampers, for example, are often placed in the underside of two consecutive turbine blades. Dampers are kept {{in contact with the}} under-platform of the respective blades by means of the cen-trifugal force. If the damper is well designed, vibration of blades instigate a relative motion between the under-platform and the damper. A friction force, that is a non-conservative force, arises in the contact and partly dissipates the vibration energy. Several contact mod-els are available in the literature to simulate the contact between the damper and the under-platform. However, the actual dynamics of the blade-damper interaction have not fully understood yet. Several test rigs have been previously developed to experimentally investigate the performance of under-platform dampers. The majority of these experimen-tal setups aim to evaluate the overall damper efﬁciency in terms of reduction in response amplitude of the blade for a given exciting force that simulates the aerodynamic loads. Unfortunately, the experimental data acquired on the blade dynamics do not provide enough information to understand the damper dynamics. Therefore, the uncertainty on the damper behavior remains a big issue. In this work, a novel experimental test rig has been developed to extensively investigate the damper dynamic behavior. A single replaceable <b>blade</b> is <b>clamped</b> in the rig with a speci-ﬁc clamping device. With this device the blade root is pressed against a groove machined in the test rig. The pushing force is controllable and measurable, to better simulate the actual centrifugal load acting on the blade. Two dampers, one {{on each side of the}} blade, are in con-tact with the blade under-platforms and with platforms on force measuring supports. These supports have been speciﬁcally designed to measure the contact forces on the dam-per. The contact forces on the blade are computed by post processing the measured forces and assuming the static equilibrium of the damper. The damper kinematics is rebuilt by using the relative displacement, measured with a differential laser, between the damper and the blade under-platform. This article describes the main concepts behind this new approach and explains the design and working of this novel test rig. Moreover, the inﬂuence of the damper contact forces on the dynamic behavior of the blade is discussed in the result section...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{electro-mechanical}} generator systems which {{harvest energy}} from an aquatic environment. Such systems {{are needed to}} create maintenance-free sensor platforms for use in autonomous wireless sensor networks which have applications in water quality monitoring. Many energy harvesting mechanisms specific to an aquatic environment already exist {{but the majority of}} them have been developed for use in renewable energy generation schemes for large-scale electrical power generation. Energy harvesting, however, remains focused on the miniature scale aiming to generate enough power to run a wireless sensor node. This work therefore focuses on the identification, analysis, prototyping and miniaturization issues of existing marine wave-based energy converters. The analysis of different possible energy harvesting mechanisms is performed and their power densities are investigated as a function of their size. In {{order to be able to}} maximize the power density of the chosen energy harvester under all operating conditions, expressions have been derived for a generalized load impedance which optimizes the generator damping and resonant frequency, through changes in load resistance and reactance. Within this maximization, an AC/DC H-bridge converter is simulated as an interface between the harvester and its load. This converter is designed to mimic the required generalized load impedance and tune it so that the entire system adapts to the external working frequency. A prototype of the energy harvester was designed and tested. Based on the observation of a natural whistle made of a doubly <b>clamped</b> <b>blade</b> of grass that produces sounds when it is blown on, a MEMS harvester extracting energy from vortex-induced-vibrations was designed. The study of its feasibility as an energy harvester and the determination of its dimensions at a microscopic scale are interesting as it presents a new way of extracting energy using an electromagnetic transduction mechanism and a manufacturing advantage. A prototype of a generator harvesting energy from Vortex-Induced-Vibrations was developed using conventional engineering processes. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a novel radiator capable of producing ultrasonic waves in air and liquids has been investigated. For commercial transducers when operating in air or liquids, impedance matching is the necessary condition for maximum transfer of energy to the medium (thus no standing waves are involved). 'However, "for this radiator {{the formation of the}} mechanical standing waves on it is the key condition for directional radiation of energy into the surrounding environment. Under this condition the radiator exhibits a practical conversion of electrical energy into ultrasound. To further improve the {{performance of}} the radiator. the wavelength coincidence condition must be satisfied. This condition implies that the wavelength of the bending vibration developed on the blade to be the same as that in the medium to which it is coupled. Consequently, an end-fire radiation pattern is obtained. The theory of this when applied to water and also for a double blade configuration are presented. The main component of the radiator consists. of a cantilever blade on which a pair of piezoelectric (PZT) ceramic bars are fixed. These the so called excitation gauges, are fixed on both sides of a thin rectangular metal <b>blade</b> near the <b>clamped</b> end. When wavelength coincidence condition is fulfilled, the radiator transmits ultrasonic wave in a highly directional pattern. The direction of propagation of ultrasound is solely steered by frequency of the applied signal. System imperfections such as inter modal coupling when used underwater are considered. An analytical approach is developed to investigate the performance of the radiator for transmission of digital signals in air as well as in water. This method is used to evaluate the efficiency of the device as a suitable means for communication between divers or a diver and an underwater stationary station. Amplitude modulation of speech signals demonstrated the capabilities of a new underwater transmission. system whose narrow beam width is the condition to obtain power gain and performance. The possibility of the same system {{to be used as a}} passive sonar is also examined. Finally, simulations of the above system to be implemented in beam-forming in air and in water have been developed...|$|R
