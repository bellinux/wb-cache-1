5|$|The Code sought {{not only}} to {{determine}} what could <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> on screen, but also to promote traditional values. Sexual relations outside of marriage could not <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as attractive and beautiful, presented {{in a way that}} might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible. All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience. Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, {{as long as it was}} clear that they were the exception to the rule.|$|E

5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. Unlike those of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations and distinct patterns changing over time. He may <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down or on an elevated seat, or engaging {{in a range of}} contemporary situations.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Shueisha {{announced}} the series {{will have a}} live-action adaptation of the series. It is slated to premiere in 2017.

5|$|Not {{long after}} the film was released, late Muppet creator Jim Henson {{proposed}} a live-action show based on the film, titled Little Mermaid's Island. Ariel was to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Marietta DePrima, and she would interact with various puppet characters created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Two episodes of this series were filmed but not aired due to complications after Henson's death.|$|E

5|$|During the {{production}} of the season, Groening and Brooks pitched a live-action spin-off series centered in Krusty the Clown (expected to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Dan Castellaneta) entitled Krusty (although they began planning the series since 1992). Groening and Michael Weithorn wrote a pilot episode where Krusty moved to Los Angeles and got his own talk show. A recurring joke throughout the script was that Krusty lived in a house on wooden stilts which were continuously being gnawed by beavers. Eventually, the contract negotiations fell apart and Groening decided to stop work on the project.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the innovative visual effects for the film, Stokdyk created a miniature of a skyscraper section at 1:16 scale with New Deal Studios' Ian Hunter and David Sanger. Stokdyk chose to design the miniature instead of using computer-generated imagery so damage done to the building could <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> realistically and timely without guesswork involving computer models. In addition, to Sony Imageworks, Cafe FX provided visual effects for the crane disaster scene when Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, as well as shots in the climactic battle.|$|E
5|$|The Legion spurred {{several million}} Roman Catholics across the U.S. {{to sign up}} for the boycott, {{allowing}} local religious leaders to determine which films to protest. Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or miscegenation could not <b>be</b> <b>portrayed.</b> Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt had inspired {{at least some of the}} vitriol from the Catholic groups.|$|E

5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural instinct towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of August 2009, {{it was revealed that}} Catelyn Stark would <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Jennifer Ehle. On August 20, more casting announcements were made, including Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister and Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys Targaryen, as well as Richard Madden in the role of Robb Stark, Iain Glen as Ser Jorah Mormont, Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark and Maisie Williams as Arya Stark. On September 1 Lena Headey was announced as Cersei Lannister. On September 23, Martin confirmed that Rory McCann had been cast as Sandor Clegane. Isaac Hempstead-Wright was confirmed as Bran Stark on October 14, followed by an announcement of Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo three days later.|$|E
5|$|Cane Ashby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Young and the Restless. He is portrayed by Australian actor Daniel Goddard, who originally auditioned for Brad Snyder on As the World Turns but was recommended {{for a role}} on The Young and the Restless instead. The role was to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as an American, but Goddard's Australian descent influenced the character's background. Former head writer Lynn Marie Latham introduced him during the episode airing on January 12, 2007 as an Australian bartender {{in search of his}} family. Latham created Cane as the son of Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and Jill Abbott (Jess Walton) but the character's background was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell in 2009, re-establishing him as the son of Colin and Genevieve Atkinson (Tristan Rogers and Genie Francis).|$|E

5|$|During {{the same}} off-season, Tomjanovich and the Rockets civil suit vs. the Lakers occurred. Houston's side argued that Los Angeles {{had failed to}} control Washington. During the trial, {{numerous}} players and coaches {{who were at the}} game testified, while Washington sat at the defense table, listening to himself <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as a dangerous rogue. Kunnert testified during the trial and contradicted Washington's testimony, angrily branding him a liar. While the two were playing for San Diego, their wives became close friends, but their relationship only worsened over time; Washington believed the NBA was keeping Kunnert on his team to prevent him from suing him. Jack Ramsay, Portland's coach, however, said that he chose Kunnert over San Diego center Swen Nater when his team was asked by the league to submit a list of players they considered fair compensation for Walton.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king. Armed conflict broke out between John and Longchamp, and by October 1191 Longchamp was isolated in the Tower of London with John {{in control of the}} city of London, thanks to promises John had made to the citizens in return for recognition as Richard's heir presumptive. At this point Walter of Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen, returned to England, having been sent by Richard to restore order. John's position was undermined by Walter's relative popularity and by the news that Richard had married whilst in Cyprus, which presented the possibility that Richard would have legitimate children and heirs.|$|E
50|$|Three {{different}} {{actors have}} played Tommasino {{in the three}} feature films. In The Godfather, as a middle-aged man, he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Corrado Gaipa. Tommasino <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> as partially paralyzed because Gaipa was a wheelchair user in real life. In The Godfather Part II, a much younger Tommasino <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Mario Cotone. In The Godfather Part III, as an elderly man, he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Vittorio Duse.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1975 film, The Hindenburg, Pruss <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Charles Durning. This {{portrayal}} is inaccurate because Pruss <b>is</b> <b>portrayed</b> as {{ignoring the}} advice of the 2nd Captain Ernst Lehmann, who only traveled as an observer, saying [...] "I'll do the worrying on this trip". In the docudrama Hindenburg: The Untold Story he <b>was</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Albert Welling. In the 2011 RTL television movie he <b>is</b> <b>portrayed</b> by Jürgen Schornagel.|$|R

5|$|The {{two main}} deities found in Hoysala temple {{sculpture}} are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a trident {{and a small}} drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image {{with which they are}} associated. Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> with these attributes as Shiva's consort, Parvati. Various depictions of Lord Shiva exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in action such as slaying a demon (Andhaka) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant (Gajasura) and holding its skin up behind his back. He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with Nandi the bull. He may be represented as Bhairava, another of Shiva's many manifestations.|$|E
5|$|While {{the series}} retells the real {{events of the}} gangland war, several {{inaccuracies}} have been pointed out and some deliberate fictionalizations have been made. The Purana Taskforce, as presented in this series, is not a portrayal of the real taskforce, as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers, including those who previously served and were not sacked, to <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> by actors in the media. As a result, the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers, leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack, which never in fact occurred.|$|E
5|$|Written in 1866, Augusta Jane Evans {{domestic}} novel St. Elmo {{became one}} of the best-selling novels of the 19th century. Its popularity would spur the creation of popular consumer products, parodies and even the names of several towns. Evans was concerned about how the novel's themes would <b>be</b> <b>portrayed</b> on the stage and did not approve the first script for a St. Elmo play until 1909. It is also unknown if Evans was aware of any intention to adapt the novel for the screen. Lloyd Lonergan adapted the play for the Thanhouser Company. The Book News Monthly said that Lonergan received a share of interest in the company for his good work in producing the scenario. Lonergan already had a single share of 100 total shares of the company from the initial $10,000 in capital in 1909.|$|E
