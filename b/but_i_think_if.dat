500|$|In July 2012, Strummer's daughters, Jazz and Lola, gave a rare {{interview}} {{to discuss the}} upcoming tenth anniversary of their father's passing, his legacy {{and the possibility of}} a Clash reunion had their father lived. Jazz said [...] "There was talk about the Clash reforming before he died. But there had been talk for years and years about them reforming. They had been offered stupid amounts of money to do it, but they were very good at keeping the moral high ground and saying no. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> Dad hadn't died, it would have happened. It felt like it was in the air." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E

2500|$|Weber's second wife, {{astronomer}} Virginia Trimble, {{was seated}} {{in the front row}} of the audience during the LIGO press conference. In an interview with Science Magazine afterwards, she was asked if Weber really saw gravitational waves. [...] She replied, “I don’t know. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> there had been two technologies going forward they would have pushed each other, as collaborators not as competitors, and it might have led to an observation sooner.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{closed session}} {{as a result}} of {{security}} constraints, U.S. Representative William Dickinson (R-Alabama) told Lavelle, [...] "I am not sure why we are here today. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> I had been in your position, I would have done the very same thing. And if that means stretching the rules is part of it, then good for you." [...] Dickinson blamed the [...] "crazy rules for this crazy war which has no parallel or anything to compare with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cole's game {{incorporates}} an attacking {{approach to}} his play, which supports his teams' forward play. As a youth, he [...] "always liked scoring goals and attacking", but grew {{to love the}} role of defending, as being a left-back was the only opportunity of breaking into the seniors. Prior to his inclusion in the Arsenal first team, Cole studied the conduct of fellow defender Nigel Winterburn to improve his play; Winterburn concurrently offered pointers to improve his positioning. He modelled his game on Brazilian Roberto Carlos: [...] "He's got natural talent, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> you train hard enough you can be nearly as good as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> they put themselves in the same predicament, and the fact that I have been at Liverpool for 12 years and that I would like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 18 February 2016, {{a series}} {{representative}} confirmed Grimshaw's {{departure from the}} judging panel, confirming: [...] "We are sad {{to see him go}} but wish him all the best." [...] On 5 April 2016, Fernandez-Versini announced her departure from the series, choosing instead to concentrate on her music career. On 10 May, Ora confirmed she would not return for the 13th series of the show. On 1 June 2016, the line-up for series 13 was confirmed as Cowell, Scherzinger, Osbourne and Walsh. In December 2016, Walsh confirmed we would continue to judge the series through 2018, stating he had signed through [...] "the next two years". That same month, both Osbourne and Scherzinger cast doubt on their return, with Osbourne citing her dual-work on The Talk, and Scherzinger stating: [...] "I can't confirm that I'm going to [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> I did return {{it would have to be}} with this panel because I'm really close with this panel. [...] I've really enjoyed myself and we're really close." [...] On 13 April 2017, Cowell announced his intentions to retain the same judging panel for the fourteenth series. In June 2017, it was announced that the judging panel would remain the same as the previous series.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> he {{was going}} to hunt {{elephants}} with it, because I know, from remarks dropped by him, that he has hunted large game in India and Africa, and likes it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> he tries to hunt elephants with it, {{he is going to be}} disappointed.|$|R

6000|$|... "I suppose they'll {{take it to}} Mr. Wickerby.

I am going at any rate; and shall be in Paris to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] {{answered}} the youth, [...] "I {{am not sure}} I can say with certainty that I truly believe that it is; <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> we were to go on shore, the people there {{would be able to}} tell us how to go to Apple Island." ...|$|E

60|$|OLIVER. Just {{left the}} gap?--Perhaps, if {{everything}} has to come asunder. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> ever {{there is to be}} life--hope,--then you had to come back.
