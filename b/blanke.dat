5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school in 1934, deHavilland was offered a {{scholarship}} to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher. She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. That summer, Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for a major new production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl. After one of Reinhardt's assistants saw her perform in Saratoga, he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia. One week before the premiere, the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project, leaving 18-year-old deHavilland to play Hermia. Impressed with her performance, Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed. During that tour, Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production, and he offered her the film role of Hermia. With her mind still set on becoming a teacher, deHavilland initially wavered, but eventually Reinhardt and executive producer Henry <b>Blanke</b> persuaded her to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12, 1934, with a starting salary of $200 a week.|$|E

25|$|In neurologically normal subjects, <b>Blanke</b> {{and colleagues}} then {{showed that the}} {{conscious}} experience {{of the self and}} body being in the same location depends on multisensory integration in the TPJ. Using event-related potentials, <b>Blanke</b> and colleagues showed the selective activation of the TPJ 330–400 ms after stimulus onset when healthy volunteers imagined themselves in the position and visual perspective that generally are reported by people experiencing spontaneous OBEs. Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the same subjects impaired mental transformation of the participant's own body. No such effects were found with stimulation of another site or for imagined spatial transformations of external objects, suggesting the selective implication of the TPJ in mental imagery of one's own body.|$|E
25|$|Research by Olaf <b>Blanke</b> in Switzerland {{found that}} it is {{possible}} to reliably elicit experiences somewhat similar to the OBE by stimulating regions of the brain called the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ; a region where the temporal lobe and parietal lobe of the brain come together). <b>Blanke</b> and his collaborators in Switzerland have explored the neural basis of OBEs by showing that they are reliably associated with lesions in the right TPJ region and that they can be reliably elicited with electrical stimulation of this region in a patient with epilepsy. These elicited experiences may include perceptions of transformations of the patient's arms and legs (complex somatosensory responses) and whole-body displacements (vestibular responses).|$|E

After watching Copeland faint, an offended <b>Blankes</b> punches Barbara back for foiling them, which promptly gets Mahoney involved in a brawl with him. After the fight, when Lt.

2500|$|Terence Hines (2003) {{has written}} that {{spontaneous}} out-of-body experiences can be generated by artificial stimulation {{of the brain and}} this strongly suggests that the OBE experience is caused from [...] "temporary, minor brain malfunctions, not by the person’s spirit (or whatever) actually leaving the body." [...] In a study review of neurological and neurocognitive data (Bünning and <b>Blanke,</b> 2005) wrote that OBEs are due to [...] "functional disintegration of lower-level multisensory processing and abnormal higher-level self-processing at the temporoparietal junction." [...] Some scientists suspect that OBEs are the result of a mismatch between visual and tactile signals.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} by 1592 Shakespeare was a playwright in London, {{and that he}} had enough of a reputation for Robert Greene to denounce him in the posthumous Greenes, Groats-worth of Witte, bought with a million of Repentance as [...] "an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a <b>blanke</b> verse as the best of you: and being an absolute Johannes , is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey."

50|$|He {{introduces}} {{the project of}} measuring neural correlates of consciousness using paradigms like minimal contrasts of images, masking (subliminal stimuli), binocular rivalry, and attentional blink.

50|$|The film {{begins in}} a large garage structure, where Lt. Proctor (Lance Kinsey) and Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano) meet up with former cadets, (now Sgts.) Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle <b>Blankes</b> (Brant van Hoffman). It seems {{one of the two}} police academies is getting the axe due to the state government's unwillingness to {{continue}} financing two academies, and Mauser wants Copeland and <b>Blankes</b> to make sure Lassard screws up. The men agree to the plan, knowing this may be their only chance at revenge at Lassard for (somewhat deservingly) graduating them at the bottom of their class. Afterwards, Mauser and Proctor find themselves and their car stuck inside the garage (as they were forewarned it was closing soon), but when they both get out to try to forcibly open the gate arm, the car falls out of park and starts rolling backwards down the ramp, while Proctor tries futilely to stop it.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was once}} {{commonly}} argued that [...] "young Juvenal" [...] was Thomas Lodge, co-author with Greene of the comedy A Looking Glass for London; however, Lodge {{was out of}} England at the time, and Greene's language implies that all three playwrights were aware of Greene's illness. Most modern commentators now agree that Greene had in mind Thomas Nashe, educated at St John's College, Cambridge, later called [...] "gallant young Juvenal" [...] by Francis Meres in Palladis Tamia, an apparent allusion to Greene's earlier use of the epithet. Greene's phrase [...] "bombast out a blank verse" [...] {{appears to be an}} allusion to a remark by Nashe in the preface to Greene's Menaphon (1589) in which Nashe defended Greene against his detractors, who [...] "out-brave better pens with the swelling bumbast of a bragging <b>blanke</b> verse". Nashe was also much younger than Greene, unlike Lodge, which would explain why Greene calls him [...] "sweet boy". However, there are no known comedies co-written by Greene and Nashe.|$|E

The third is [...] "no lesse deserving than the other two" [...] but has been driven to [...] "extreme shifts" [...] to survive.
