50|$|Of these provisions, {{it was the}} new <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> {{that would}} be {{effectively}} challenged by the case.|$|E
50|$|This {{process is}} {{intended}} to streamline <b>border</b> <b>procedures,</b> reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and some U.S. airports {{that may not be}} equipped to otherwise handle international travelers. With the exceptions of LaGuardia and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, however, many more U.S. airports now have customs facilities than when the preclearance program first started in 1952.|$|E
5000|$|The border {{inspection}} posts of the provinces, autonomous regions, {{and municipalities}} are directly managed by the Central Government and are responsible for specific <b>border</b> inspection <b>procedures.</b>|$|R
50|$|The planned Regional Eurostar and Nightstar {{services}} were {{to call at}} platform 2 to undertake <b>border</b> control <b>procedures.</b> The services to Plymouth and Swansea were scheduled to change motive power from a British Rail Class 92 to a Class 37/6 here.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crossings}} {{should be}} opened, facilitating {{the movement of}} people and goods; Israel should refrain from restricting residents' movements and from targeting residents in <b>border</b> areas; <b>procedures</b> of implementation should be dealt with 24 hours {{after the start of}} the ceasefire.|$|R
50|$|When the {{war began}} Skelani was cut off from Srebrenica but also from its {{connections}} with Serbia. Since the war Skelani has remained isolated, cut off from access to many basic necessities. Instead {{of being able to}} go to Bajina Basta to hospital or go shopping residents have to travel to Srebrenica over still difficult roads. Time-consuming international <b>border</b> <b>procedures,</b> mistrust and prejudice make crossing the border into Serbia difficult.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{operates}} border preclearance {{facilities at}} a number of ports and airports in foreign countries. They are staffed and operated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. Travelers pass through U.S. Immigration and Customs, Public Health, and Agriculture inspections before boarding their aircraft, ship, or train. This process is intended to streamline <b>border</b> <b>procedures,</b> reduce congestion at ports of entry, and facilitate travel between the preclearance location and U.S. airports unequipped to handle international travelers.|$|E
5000|$|New <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> and {{extended}} authority to land borders: The Act specified that the officers {{in charge of}} any vessel arriving by sea had to submit a list of passengers with their biographical information to the immigration inspectors at the port. Requirements of this sort {{had been part of}} United States federal law since the requirement for a manifest of immigrants in Section 4 of the Steerage Act of 1819. However, in this case the list needed to be submitted immediately upon arrival and was used to inspect aliens prior to admitting them. The inspectors at ports of entry had the authority to conduct a medical examination of aliens suspected of being unfit or having dangerous diseases, marking the beginning of medical exclusion of immigrants in the United States. Aliens who were detained for a medical examination were still considered to not have formally entered the United States.|$|E
40|$|A <b>bordering</b> <b>procedure</b> is here {{proposed}} {{to evaluate the}} eigensystem of hermitian matrices, and more in general of normal matrices, when the spectral decomposition is known of then– 1 ×n– 1 principal minor. The procedure is also applicable to special real and nonsymmetric matrices here named quasi-symmetric. The computational cost to write the characteristic polynomial isO(n 2), using {{a new set of}} recursive formulas. A modified Brent algorithm is used to find the roots of the polynomial. The eigenvectors are evaluated in a direct way with a computational cost ofO(n 2) for each one. Some numerical considerations indicate where numerical difficulties may occur. Numerical results are given comparing this method with the Givens-Householder one...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} causes of {{rejections}} of African exports at the EU border as a barrier in accessing EU markets. Our results indicate that natural geographical hurdle, poor trade-related infrastructure, inefficient <b>border</b> <b>procedure</b> {{and a lack of}} technical personnel increase the incidences of rejection at the EU border and add to Africa's challenges in accessing EU markets. In addition, in line with the growing literature, this study finds empirical support for the proposition that institutions, infrastructure and logistic quality matter for increased market penetration and continuous integration into the global trading system. Thus, the barrier created by EU rejection of Africa's exports can be addressed through the strengthening of African's institutions and trade facilitation measures particularly her custom and border management including transit regimes...|$|R
50|$|Today {{the only}} {{remaining}} border crossings in Berlin are located at Tegel and Schönefeld airports (Schönefeld located outside Berlin city limits) and all Cold War-specific <b>border</b> control <b>procedures</b> have disappeared altogether. They are staffed by German Federal Police and Customs for normal international traffic screening purposes.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{increasing}} body of empirical evidence {{about the impact of}} trade facilitation on export competitiveness and growth. Studies reviewed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2002) indicate that trade transaction costs amount to up to 15 percent of the value of traded goods globally. A subsequent OECD study (2003) found trade transactions costs to be higher on agricultural and food products, fish, and forest and wood products (since these products are subject to additional <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> due to sanitary and phytosanitary requirements). These are products for which many developing countries have an advantage. The same study also reported that small and medium enterprises suffer most from poor trade-related practices and poorer developing countries have a larger share of such enterprises. A number of other studies have illustrated the specifics of why trade facilitation matters and specific sources of trade costs. One study, for example, found that barriers to export performance in Africa are closely related to firm characteristics and policies that raise trade costs. This includes non-transparent customs laws and administration. Much less evidence was found that transport infrastructure, in comparison, {{had a significant impact on}} export performance (Clarke, 2005).|$|E
5000|$|The Latvian Foreign Ministry has reiterated [...] "that Latvia has no {{territorial}} {{claims to}} the Russian Federation", however, and though there is some opposition (particularly among right wing parties) to formally ceding the Abrene region, surveys show that most Latvians don't believe that the transferred territory will ever again be administered by Latvia. Many in Latvia - especially the former residents of the areas now in Russia - are interested in seeking compensation from the Russian Federation, though. Currently, the Republic of Latvia compensates those who lost property. The former residents also complain {{of the difficulty of}} visiting their family graves, asking that the Latvian and Russian governments facilitate <b>border</b> <b>procedures.</b> Despite Latvia's assurances that it makes no territorial claims, Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed that Latvian wishes to get control of the area and that such claims are against the spirit of Europe. On April 29, 2005, Latvia announced that it would sign an interpretative declaration in conjunction with the proposed border agreement with Russia, noting that the border agreement would in no way affect [...] "the legal rights of the Latvian state and its citizens" [...] under the 1920 treaty. As a consequence, Russia scrapped the border agreement, as it saw this as attempt to prolong debate on Abrene.|$|E
30|$|We {{have tried}} to respond {{responsibly}} to the estimation problems created {{by the fact that}} homicides in Mexico rose quickly on the heels of our second change in <b>border</b> <b>procedures.</b> It would certainly be better to have information at the household level on the number of trips made to specific places in Mexico along with demographic and economic characteristics. Ideally this would be matched with survey information that reported something about their typical motivations for crossing the border as well as their level of concern about violence over the border. But even with only highly aggregated information {{we have been able to}} conclude that changes in US <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> have had a large and enduringly negative impact on tourism and travel on the Mexican border, one that has clearly been economically and socially meaningful. The wider message for the tourism and hospitality industry is that changes to <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> bear very close attention.|$|E
50|$|When enforced, 95 {{people out}} of 700,000 who had entered Japan in one month were refused entry. They were {{people who had been}} {{deported}} and had tried to change identity to illegally reenter Japan — indicating fingerprinting is a normal <b>border</b> control <b>procedure</b> of any country.|$|R
25|$|According to intuition, {{the process}} will {{converge}} to the first exit point of the domain. However, this algorithm takes almost surely {{an infinite number of}} steps to end. For computational implementation, the process is usually stopped when it gets sufficiently close to the border, and returns the projection of the process on the <b>border.</b> This <b>procedure</b> is sometimes called introducing an -shell, or -layer.|$|R
50|$|Refugees who are {{included}} in the list of Interpol can be arrested when crossing the <b>border.</b> The <b>procedure</b> for filing an appeal with Interpol is a long and complex one. For example, the Venezuelan journalist Patricia Poleo and a colleague of Kazakh activist Ablyazov, Tatiana Paraskevich, who were granted refugee status, sought to overturn the politically motivated request for as long as one and a half years, and six months, respectively.|$|R
40|$|<b>Border</b> <b>procedures</b> {{have so far}} {{received}} little attention in the legal literature dealing with European asylum law. Literature on immigration detention in Europe has also neglected the use of detention in <b>border</b> <b>procedures.</b> This is remarkable {{because one of the}} reasons that Member States resort to <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> can be traced back to the centrality of territorial presence within the modern State for the enjoyment of rights. The triangular relationship between an application for international protection, refusal of entry, and a deprivation of liberty has remained imprecise. This indeterminacy has had important repercussions for the way in which the right to liberty has been protected at the borders of Europe. However, the way in which the Recast Asylum Procedures Directive circumscribes Member States' use of this procedure is unprecedented. This article uses the Dutch implementation of the Asylum Procedures Directive in order to unpack the above-mentioned triangular relationship between an application for international protection, refusal of entry, and a deprivation of liberty. It will show that European Union regulation in this area is distinctive because it entails recognition of the fact that, when it comes to the enforcement of migration control, individual rights are at stake...|$|E
30|$|Canally and Timothy (2007) {{find that}} <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> are a {{significant}} factor constraining the decision by US college students (based on a survey conducted at Arizona State University) to cross the border, {{but they do not}} provide an estimate of its impact on tourism flows or its changing importance over time.|$|E
40|$|Business {{views on}} the most {{important}} barriers to trade facilitation are taken from two region-wide surveys in 2006 covering the ASEAN priority integration sectors, namely: agro-based, fisheries, automotive, electronics, e-ASEAN, healthcare, rubber, textile and apparel, wood-based, air travel, tourism, and logistics. The data were reassembled into (1) <b>border</b> <b>procedures,</b> (2) individual barriers, (3) broad categories of barriers, and the results ranked in terms of incidence and significance. <b>Border</b> <b>procedures</b> such as unofficial facilitation fees, tedious goods declaration, poor information on procedures, difficult release of goods, and complex refund and appeals process were the most widespread and serious. Logistics businesses were similarly affected by lengthy documentation, burdensome inspection, varying goods nomenclature, facilitation fees, poor regional coordination, and inefficient clearance. Across all types of barriers, for the goods sector, Customs procedures and their manner of implementation were prevalent, while quantity control measures, official and unofficial fees, and technical standards were significant. For the services sector, the operator's licensing requirement was the most common and severe, while high excise taxes, user fees, lengthy visa procedures, and market limits were further impediments. Logistics operators confirmed the singular importance of Customs procedures particularly time consuming documentation, followed by foreign ownership and transport-specific limitations. Time and monetary costs of complying were substantial.

50|$|Trade {{facilitation}} {{involves a}} wide range of activities centered on lowering trade transaction costs for firms in global commerce. These costs include the price of moving freight from the factory to final destinations. Firms must manage <b>border</b> clearance <b>procedures</b> and pay trade services fees, among many other steps after goods and services are produced. As such, trade facilitation involves much more than trucking goods across national borders or shipping a package by sea transport.|$|R
50|$|The {{program was}} {{announced}} in November 2014 by President Barack Obama, along {{with a number of}} immigration reform steps including increased resources for <b>border</b> enforcement, new <b>procedures</b> for high-skilled immigrants, and an expansion of the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.|$|R
3000|$|We use data {{collected}} by Mexican authorities that, unlike US data, distinguishes day trips from longer trips. The two changes in <b>border</b> <b>procedure</b> and document requirements divide our monthly data into three periods: an early period that lasts until 9 / 11, a middle period from September 2001 to January 2008 and a late period extending from February 2008 to December 2012. Since {{we are working with}} monthly data, we end the first period in August of 2001 and the second in December of 2007. We use data on three confounding factors. The NBER declares March of 2001 to be a business cycle peak as well as December of 2007. As we are interested in short day trips we use a business conditions index for the US border states in which the states are weighted by population. The individual state indices are from the Philadelphia FRB (2015) and constructed using Stock and Watson’s (1989) dynamic single factor model from “four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (US city average).” [...]...|$|R

30|$|The {{diminution}} of day trips {{over the past}} decade and a half has mirrored the declining fortunes of Mexican border towns. 7 The popular press attributes this exclusively to the rise of violence and insecurity on the border subsequent to the drugs war, initiated by the Calderón administration. Undoubtedly the rise in crime reduced day trips and tourism to Mexico. 8 However, we hope to show that changes in the rules and regulations concerning crossing the border have had a practically and statistically significant effect on day trips. It is difficult to see how a reduction in legitimate commerce associated with a reduction in day trips caused by a change in <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> could have done anything other than increase criminal activity. 9 To the extent that it did so we will underestimate the effect of the change in <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> in what follows: since we will take the homicide rate (our measure of day trip deterring criminality) to be exogenous we underestimate the effect of tighter border restrictions.|$|E
40|$|Facilitation {{of trade}} {{logistics}} aims at simplification and harmonization of <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> and related documentation. This is an accelerator for global trade {{and economic growth}} and therefore a priority in global trade policy. Trends in logistics and supply chain security and innovations in European customs policy offer great opportunities {{to increase the efficiency}} of trade logistics. IT innovations {{play a crucial role in}} the realization of these merits. This paper presents a vision on how IT could reap these benefits, with an emphasis on two research projects that specifically address this challenge: CASSANDRA and Extended Single Window...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} of constructing an individualized edentulous impression tray {{has been described}} whereby the tray is constructed on top of two was reliefs; the border was relief creates the space for the border moulding material, and the top wax relief contained in tinfoil acts as a broad-based tissue stop during the <b>border</b> moulding <b>procedure</b> and eventually it will create space for the final “wash” impression. The tray fulfills the objectives of selective-pressure technique by capturing the basal seat areas without tissue displacement and the borders with functional tissue displacement.

50|$|Border {{zones are}} areas where movement, {{property}} ownership or other activity is prohibited or restricted by legistlation. Unlike regular territory, border zones are under administrative {{control of the}} border authorities. Entrance is generally only with an individual permit. Entering a border zone without authorization is a crime or misdemeanor and grounds for arrest. Border zones are instituted to pinpoint illegal intruders, conceal and obscure and prevent interference with <b>border</b> security <b>procedures</b> and equipment, and thus aid border guards with their work. For example, Russia maintains sizable border zones.|$|R
50|$|The 38-year-old Raed Zeiter {{worked as}} a judge at a magistrates court in Jordan while his {{hometown}} was Nablus. As stated before, Israeli soldiers remarked that he had charged at them with a metal pole, which was disputed by a witness who stated that Zeiter and the soldiers had been arguing before Zeiter was shoved down and shot. The incident occurred at the Allenby Bridge crossing between the Palestinian territories and the nation of Jordan. While the <b>border</b> crossing <b>procedures</b> there are usually recorded, the army later said that the cameras on site had malfunctioned.|$|R
40|$|Neglected {{tropical}} diseases (NTD) in low- {{and middle-income}} countries {{are still not}} on target per the World Health Organizationâ??s (WHO) elimination goal of 2020. Mass drug administration (MDA) {{is one of the}} effective strategies supported by the WHO for the control and subsequent elimination of NTD. This quantitative study explored how supply chain logistic capacity may be hampering MDA coverage in countries in which the diseases are endemic. The study examined secondary data from WHO data bank for MDA coverage, to quantify the relationship between supply chain logistics capacity, as measured by the World Bankâ??s logistics performance index (LPIs), and the control of NTD using MDA. The ecological theory of health behavior was the theoretical framework for this study. The research questions explored whether a low- and/or middle-income countryâ??s supply chain infrastructure, logistics services, customs and <b>border</b> <b>procedures,</b> and supply chain reliability, predict the coverage of MDA in controlling NTD. A multiple regression model determined the linear relations between each predictor: supply chain infrastructure (H 1), logistics services (H 2), custom and <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> (H 3), and supply chain reliability (H 4) and the control of neglected diseases as determine by MDA. Results indicated that supply chain capacity, custom and border processes, and supply chain reliability are statistically significant in predictors of MDA coverage in the control of NTD in developing countries. This study may enhance social change by improving supply chain capacity for more effective distribution of PCT drugs, thus helping with the elimination of NTDs and improved health outcomes in low- and middle-income countries...|$|E
3000|$|We {{have found}} that the flow of {{short-term}} visits over the US–Mexico border was significantly reduced by the changes to <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> set in train by 9 / 11. Our findings add to the literature on the importance of border documents and visas for tourism flows. The reductions in border tourism and day trips were clearly of tremendous importance for the Mexican border economy and particularly for its tourism and retail sector. The potential size of the reduction in spending is quite large. As it is the Secretarìa de Turismo (2014) estimates that total spending by persons on day trips (Excursionistas internacionales sin pernocta) was 1.53 billion USD in 2012. How much larger might that figure have been had there been no border changes? [...]...|$|E
30|$|What {{about the}} middle period? What impact did the post 9 / 11 changes to <b>border</b> <b>procedures</b> have on day trips prior to the early 2008 changes in {{document}} requirements? In this case, our procedure of adjusting the AR(1) projection downwards to adjust for the influence of homicides is almost exactly the same, we subtract (0.0489  +  0.0192)*geomortrate from the AR(1) projection that begins in September of 2001.22 Figure  3 shows the AR(1) projection as a solid line {{and there is a}} dashed line with its downwards adjustment. We can see that there is very little downwards adjustment prior to 2008. That is simply because the homicide rate is very low until 2008. In this case the unadjusted gap between the (log of the) projected values and the (log of the) actual number of day trips is 0.21 (21  %) and the adjusted is 0.17 (17  %). These are averages over the middle period but by December 2007 it had risen to 0.26 (26  %).|$|E
40|$|Transit in Latvia {{is often}} {{considered}} as a branch. The traditional modes of transport in Latvia include road transport, railroad transport, air transport, water transport and pipeline transport. In Latvia there has been made a relatively balanced transport net that in the whole insures the transportation of cargo and traffic of passengers. Transit development is based on two major markets - the European Union and the CIS and Asian markets service. As an important precondition in transit development is considered the simplifying of <b>border</b> crossing <b>procedures.</b> Poor road conditions reduced transit operation traffic.

However, the track {{capacity}} in Schwanheide was not sufficient to carry out <b>border</b> control <b>procedures</b> for passengers and freight. Therefore, freight trains were handled in Kuhlenfeld station, which was 18 km from the border. Before departure of a freight train from the so-called [...] "wagon border crossing" [...] (Wagengrenzstelle) at Kuhlenfeld, {{it had to be}} ensured that Boizenburg and Schwanheide stations could take the train. If the train had to make an intermediate stop, the border controls would have to be repeated in Schwanheide, which led to delays for other trains.|$|R
