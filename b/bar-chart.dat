While qualitative POCTs are widely available, quantitative POCTs present significant challenges. Here we describe a novel method that integrates an Au core/Pt shell nanoparticle (Au@PtNP) encapsulated target-responsive hydrogel with a volumetric <b>bar-chart</b> chip (V-Chip) for quantitative POCT. Upon target introduction, the hydrogel immediately dissolves and releases Au@PtNPs, which can efficiently catalyze the decomposition of H 2 O 2 to generate a large volume of O 2 to move of an ink bar in the V-Chip. The concentration of the target introduced can be visually quantified by reading the traveling distance of the ink bar.

Desirable capabilities of microfluidics-based diagnostic devices include simpli-city, portability, low cost {{and the performance of}} multiplexed and quantitative measurements, ideally in a high-throughput format. Here we present the multiplexed volumetric <b>bar-chart</b> chip (V-Chip), which integrates all these capabilities in one device. A key feature of the V-Chip is that quantitative results are displayed as bar charts directly on the device—without the need for optical instruments or any data processing or plotting steps. This is achieved by directly linking oxygen production by catalase, which is proportional to the concentration of the analyte, with the displacement of ink along channels on the device. We demonstrate the rapid quantification of protein biomarkers in diverse clinical samples with the V-Chip. The development of the V-Chip thus opens up the possibility of greatly simplified point-of-care and personalized diagnostics...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the severe}} health risks {{associated}} with lead pollution, rapid, sensitive, and portable detection of low levels of Pb 2 + in biological and environmental samples is of great importance. In this work, a Pb 2 +-responsive hydrogel was prepared using a DNAzyme and its substrate as cross-linker for rapid, sensitive, portable, and quantitative detection of Pb 2 +. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were first encapsulated in the hydrogel as an indicator for colorimetric analysis. In the absence of lead, the DNAzyme is inactive, and the substrate cross-linker maintains the hydrogel in the gel form. In contrast, the presence of lead activates the DNAzyme to cleave the substrate, decreasing the cross-linking density of the hydrogel and resulting in dissolution of the hydrogel and release of AuNPs for visual detection. As low as 10 nM Pb 2 + can be detected by the naked eye. Furthermore, to realize quantitative visual detection, a volumetric <b>bar-chart</b> chip (V-chip) was used for quantitative readout of the hydrogel system by replacing AuNPs with gold-platinum core-shell nanoparticles (Au@PtNPs). The Au@PtNPs released from the hydrogel upon target activation can efficiently catalyze the decomposition of H 2 O 2 to generate a large volume of O 2. The gas pressure moves an ink bar in the V-chip for portable visual quantitative detection of lead with a detection limit less than 5 nM. The device was able to detect lead in digested blood with excellent accuracy. The method developed {{can be used for}} portable lead quantitation in many applications. Furthermore, the method can be further extended to portable visual quantitative detection of a variety of targets by replacing the lead-responsive DNAzyme with other DNAzymes. ? 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|E

These properties are at variance with all other types of chemical bond and derive from the dual nature of the H-bond, which is not really ‘a bond’ but rather ‘two bonds’ formed by a same central proton with the two lone pairs located on the so-called donor and acceptor atoms. These considerations emphasize the role played by PA/pKa equalization in strengthening the H-bond, a hypothesis often invoked but never fully verified in the past which is now reconsidered in this Communication by a new instrument, the pKa slide rule.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In medical practice, {{clinically}} unexpected measurements {{might be}} quite properly {{handled by the}} remeasurement, removal, or reclassification of patients. If these habits are not prevented during clinical research, how much of each is needed to sway an entire study? METHODS AND RESULTS: Believing {{there is a difference}} between groups, a well-intentioned clinician researcher addresses unexpected values. We tested how much removal, remeasurement, or reclassification of patients would be needed in most cases to turn an otherwise-neutral study positive. Remeasurement of 19 patients out of 200 per group was required to make most studies positive. Removal was more powerful: just 9 out of 200 was enough. Reclassification was most powerful, with 5 out of 200 enough. The larger the study, the smaller the proportion of patients needing to be manipulated to make the study positive: the percentages needed to be remeasured, removed, or reclassified fell from 45 %, 20 %, and 10 % respectively for a 20 patient-per-group study, to 4 %, 2 %, and 1 % for an 800 patient-per-group study. Dot-plots, but not <b>bar-charts,</b> make the perhaps-inadvertent manipulations visible. Detection is possible using statistical methods such as the Tadpole test. CONCLUSIONS: Behaviours necessary for clinical practice are destructive to clinical research. Even small amounts of selective remeasurement, removal, or reclassification can produce false positive results. Size matters: larger studies are proportionately more vulnerable. If observational studies permit selective unblinded enrolment, malleable classification, or selective remeasurement, then results are not credible.
