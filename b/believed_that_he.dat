Therefore, the date of his death is uncertain.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{offensive}} success in junior, Giordano went unselected at the NHL Entry Draft. He accepted {{an invitation to}} attend the Phoenix Coyotes' training camp where, according to then-Owen Sound General Manager Mike Futa, Giordano impressed team officials but <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be best served by playing a second season in the OHL. Giordano finished the 2003–04 season with 49 points.|$|E
5|$|Macartney {{missed the}} 1924–25 Test series when England toured Australia. He played {{in only two}} {{first-class}} matches {{in the early stages}} of the season, scoring 11 runs at 3.66 and taking five wickets at 23.40. The withdrawal of Macartney from competition was attributed to a flare-up of an injury he had suffered during World War I, but sceptics <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E

5|$|Polish {{historian}} Rafał Jaworski {{states that}} the estimates {{of the size of}} Bolesław's army range between 2,000–5,000 Polish warriors, in addition to Thietmar's reported 1,000Pechenegs, 300German knights, and 500Hungarian mercenaries. Less is known about Yaroslav's army, but it is assumed that he managed to collect a force of similar size. It is also <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was aware of Bolesław's intentions and had time to make defensive preparations.|$|E
5|$|After Morta's {{death in}} 1262, Mindaugas took her sister (name unknown) {{as his wife}} despite her being married to Daumantas. This cruel act {{motivated}} Daumantas to become an ally of Treniota and assassinate Mindaugas {{with two of his}} sons. Treniota was Mindaugas' nephew. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was son of Duke of Samogitia, either Vykintas or Erdvilas. If it really was Vykintas, then there was a double marriage: Vykintas' sister married Dausprungas and Dausprungas' (and Mindaugas') sister married Vykintas. Erdvilas is mentioned only once in the 1219 treaty. The other nephew, Lengvenis, played a role in Lithuanian state in 1242–1260.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, he {{attempted}} to secure a position with the Tyler administration, claiming {{that he was a}} member of the Whig Party. He hoped to be appointed to the Custom House in Philadelphia with help from President Tyler's son Robert, an acquaintance of Poe's friend Frederick Thomas. Poe failed to show up for a meeting with Thomas to discuss the appointment in mid-September 1842, claiming to have been sick, though Thomas <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been drunk. Though he was promised an appointment, all positions were filled by others.|$|E

5|$|Brock felt {{he needed}} to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's orders from the government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|Bryan <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could, if nominated, {{unite the}} disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, {{part of his}} {{strategy}} was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|Chandler <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had enough}} support at the 1944 Democratic National Convention to be {{nominated}} as President Roosevelt's running mate for the upcoming presidential election. That support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation and Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated Harry S Truman as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him {{the chance to be}} president.|$|E

5|$|Ellis {{started the}} 1967 season with Columbus. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was not on}} the major league club because the Pirates already had a number of African American players; he felt that the team did not want to {{alienate}} white fans. Ellis was sent down to the Macon Peaches of the Southern League, which Ellis believed was due to the length of his hair. Ellis said that he was promoted back to Columbus after shaving his head. He had a 2–0 win-loss record with Macon and a 5–7 record with Columbus.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} his two-year-old {{season with a}} record of five wins and a second place from six starts. At the end of the season, some even <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was better than his sire Ormonde, the 'horse of the century'. One writer rated him ten pounds superior to the next best two-year-old La Fleche, with her being one pound superior to Flyaway. Some were more cautious, however, suggesting that Orme had not beaten any top horses.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using his deep belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. The Nazis wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E

Alain Daniélou <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died around 274 BCE. Sailendra Nath Sen <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died around 273-272 BCE, and that his death {{was followed by a}} four-year struggle of succession, after which his son Ashoka became the emperor in 269-268 BCE.|$|R

5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not like to face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{believed}} that securing the states' accession to India {{was crucial to}} reaching a negotiated settlement with the Congress for the transfer of power. As a relative of the British King, he was trusted {{by most of the}} princes and was a personal friend of many, especially the Nawab of Bhopal, Hamidullah Khan. The princes also <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would {{be in a position to}} ensure that independent India adhered to any terms that might be agreed upon, because Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel had asked him to become the first Governor General of the Dominion of India.|$|E
5|$|Philipp was {{promoted}} to Major (major) and given command as the Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1—1st Fighter Wing) on 1 April 1943, conducting Defense of the Reich operations against the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). He {{was promoted}} to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel) on 1 October 1943 and was killed in action a week later on 8 October during an attack on Bremen. It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was shot down by the P-47 Thunderbolt pilot Robert S. Johnson. Philipp managed to bail out but his parachute failed to open.|$|E
