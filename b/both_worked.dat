Kine or Wilkie oversaw effects on a production; due {{to the number of}} effects, <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on Quatermass and the Pit. The team pre-filmed most of their effects for use during the live broadcasts. They also oversaw {{practical}} effects for the Ealing filming and Riverside transmission, and constructed the bodies of the Martian creatures.|$|E
5|$|With a {{possible}} set list shaping up during rehearsals, Blackmore convinced {{a friend of}} his, Derek Lawrence, to be the band's producer. They had met years before, when <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> for producer Joe Meek and Lawrence ran an independent production company that recorded singles for release in the United States. Lawrence had many contacts in the US and was present at some of Roundabout's sessions, remaining impressed.|$|E
5|$|Fields' {{career as}} a film editor {{commenced}} in 1960, when the director Irving Lerner recruited her to be {{the editor of the}} film Studs Lonigan; Fields and Lerner had <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on The Savage Eye. In 1963 she edited An Affair of the Skin, which was directed by Ben Maddow (another Savage Eye contact). Over the next five years, Fields edited several other independent films; the best known is The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle (1967), which was shown on the television program Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. She also made documentaries funded by the United States government through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{comparison}} of two works of German language literature of the 70 's, Verena Stefan's Hautungen and Peter Handke's die linkshandige Frau, which examines the background of <b>both</b> <b>works,</b> their themes, structure, style and language, {{as well as their}} interpretation of women's emancipation. A study of the literary background of the works will be undertaken, leading to a comparison of literary and social orientations reflected in the works. The central themes of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> will be examined in a parallel fashion to illuminate thematic similarities and differences. An interpretation of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> as women's literature and their emancipatory tendencies (conscious and unconscious) will be undertaken, to analyze the true extent of emancipatory tendencies in <b>both</b> <b>works.</b> Finally the genre, style and language of <b>both</b> <b>works</b> will be analysed, to define essential stylistic differences between the two works...|$|R

5|$|Friedman {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York on July 31, 1912. His parents, Sára Ethel (née Landau) and Jenő Saul Friedman, were Jewish {{immigrants}} from Beregszász in Carpathian Ruthenia, Kingdom of Hungary (now Berehove in Ukraine). They <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> as dry goods merchants. Shortly after Milton's birth, the family relocated to Rahway, New Jersey. In his early teens, Friedman was injured in a car accident, which scarred his upper lip. A talented student, Friedman graduated from Rahway High School in 1928, just before his 16th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Keith Morton Houchen {{was born}} in Middlesbrough to Ken and Vernie Houchen, who <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> in social clubs, and grew up some five minutes from Ayresome Park. He grew up with three brothers; Jimmy, Dennis, and Patrick, who all joined the Coldstream Guards; and one sister, Jackie. He {{attended}} St Mary's College as a youth. A promising athlete and gifted footballer, as a youngster he travelled to London for a trial with Crystal Palace along with John and Terry Fenwick, but was told he was too lightweight at the time. After an unsuccessful trial with Aston Villa, he became an apprentice at Chesterfield in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Method and Luma <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on {{creating}} the various ants {{seen in the}} film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action shots with digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E

40|$|Main {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} a {{comparison}} of K. M. Čapek-Chod's Turbina and The man of seven sisters by J. Havlíček with emphasis on comic in <b>both</b> <b>works.</b> Thesis is based on theoretical discourse about comic in general and on resulsts of existing evaluations of Turbina and The man of seven sisters. Comparison of the interpetation by itself, {{which is based on}} the comic in <b>both</b> <b>works</b> shows that comic {{is an integral part of}} <b>both</b> <b>works</b> and that <b>both</b> <b>work</b> express positively material bodily values of human life through the comic. Turbina does the work by showing invincibility of a man that resides in the immortality of mankind as a whole. The man of seven sisters nods in agreement to material bodily values by showing comical efforts to overcome this immortality of mankind...|$|R
5|$|On {{the first}} of August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with {{producer}} Derek Lawrence and sound engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 {{had been used to}} book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions. Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of Deep Purple in May, feeding the band’s ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil: Extinction began {{principal}} {{photography in}} Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico in May, 2006 after filming locations {{had to be}} changed from the Australian Outback to Mexico, causing production dates to be pushed back repeatedly from November 2005 to May 2006. Numerous sets were designed by production designer Eugenio Caballero including Umbrella's underground laboratory, the Las Vegas Strip, the New York-New York Hotel & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, Realto Ponte, Luxor Hotel and the replica of the Spencer Mansion. The film entered post-production in late July 2006 with details about production being kept secret and with the film's special effects being covered by Tatopoulos Studios and Mr. X Inc., whom <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on the 2006 film Silent Hill.|$|E

Claire Townsend, a United Artists (UA) executive who had helped finance the film, played a lieutenant. Rick Van Ness, who had scouted the location, had a role as a Grateful Dead fan who gives the hero a ride. He also served as production manager.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover art was {{directed}} by John Gillespie. John Holmstrom and guitarist Johnny Ramone <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> on illustration, with the entire back cover contemplating a military theme, while the inner sleeve artwork depicted many of the themes portrayed in songs. The subject matter of songs varied throughout the album, though nearly all the tracks on the album incorporated humor into the lyrics. The musical style showed more of a surf rock influence, and many songs had minimal structuring.|$|E
5|$|The group {{included}} Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona's mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns {{had known the}} Paynes for years; Kate had met Fiona in 2000 when they <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> in Leicester General Hospital's intensive care unit. Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} artists {{traditionally}} {{associated with the}} movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in Tournai. The German Hans Memling and the Estonian Michael Sittow <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. Simon Marmion is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from Amiens, an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471. The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent. By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed {{to the spread of}} the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe. Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. <b>Both</b> <b>worked</b> predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E
5|$|Bok {{applied for}} and {{received}} UN refugee status on September 15, 1999, and {{after several months}} of waiting, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis {{to move to the}} U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13, 1999, and from there he flew to Fargo, North Dakota. His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church, <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job. Bok worked several jobs, making pallets and plastic knobs for the gearshift of cars. He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames, Iowa, and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo. It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs, founder of the American Anti-Slavery Group based in Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Juan José Arévalo Bermejo {{was born}} into a middle-class family in 1904. He became a primary school teacher for a brief while, and then earned a {{scholarship}} to a university in Argentina, where he earned a doctorate in the philosophy of education. He returned to Guatemala in 1934, and sought a position in the Ministry of Education. However, he was denied the position he wished for, and felt uncomfortable under the dictatorship of Ubico. He left the country and held a faculty position in Argentina until 1944, when he returned to Guatemala. In July 1944 the Renovación Nacional, the teachers' party, had been formed, and Arévalo was named its candidate. In an unexpected surge of support, his candidacy was endorsed by many of the leading organizations among the protesters, including the student federation. His lack of connection to the dictatorship and his academic background <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> in his favor among the students and teachers. At the same time, {{the fact that he had}} chosen to go into exile in conservative Argentina rather than revolutionary Mexico reassured landowners worried about socialist or communist reform.|$|E
5|$|Later, Michael tells Rex he {{must stay}} with his Aunt Carol, as Michael {{is working on}} a case with a {{dangerous}} suspect. His partner, Bird, goes to his house, after trying to call him to make sure he is alright, but then looks in the garage and finds Michael's work on his accident and Detective Hawkins. Bird goes to Dr. Judith Evans, who reluctantly advises Bird to check on Michael. Michael goes to Ed Hawkins' house, shoots Hawkins in the leg, and asks him for evidence. Hawkins says heroin was taken from various evidence lockers and sent out for sale through Westfield Distribution, and further evidence is on his laptop. Hawkins tries to overpower Michael, forcing him to kill Hawkins, right before Bird enters the house. Michael takes Bird's gun and handcuffs him. Bird suggests that to get into Hawkins' laptop, they use a hacker they <b>both</b> <b>worked</b> with previously, right before he knocks out Michael, who wakes up in the red reality.|$|E
