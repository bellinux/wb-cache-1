5|$|There {{are eight}} extant subspecies, {{although}} differences <b>between</b> <b>them</b> are slight.|$|E
5|$|Up to six {{subspecies}} {{have been}} described, although only two are generally recognised {{on the basis}} of mitochondrial data. Though morphologically similar, the subspecies show a significant genetic distance <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> and no hybrids <b>between</b> <b>them</b> have been reported.|$|E
5|$|A: Europe's tally {{includes}} three awards {{won by the}} Soviet Union and an award won by Russia. It also includes five Special/Honorary Awards: two won by Italy, two won by France and one shared <b>between</b> <b>them</b> for The Walls of Malapaga (1949).|$|E
50|$|If we take prisoners, we keep 'em {{separate}} till we {{have had}} time to examine them, so they can't cook up a story <b>between</b> <b>'em.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yus,' remarked another, 'she got {{me through}} my last {{confinement}} simply wonderful. If {{it come to}} choosin' <b>between</b> <b>'em</b> I'd back Mrs. 'Odges against forty doctors.' ...|$|R
5|$|According to the Donnison Report (discussed in {{the next}} section), the schools were of four types, though the {{boundaries}} <b>between</b> <b>them</b> were not always clear-cut.|$|E
5|$|All theatres {{were closed}} {{down by the}} puritan {{government}} on 6 September 1642. Upon {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King's Company and the Duke's Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire divided <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Highway 427 was {{not officially}} {{designated}} until 1972, several sections of freeway {{were already in}} place prior to that date. The designation was applied following {{the completion of the}} interchanges at the QEW and Highway401 as well as the expansion of the section <b>between</b> <b>them</b> into a collector-express system.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't listen, miss. But {{when one}} is in and out one cannot stop one's ears. I hope there isn't going to be {{anything}} wrong <b>between</b> <b>'em</b> about the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Apologetic] Of course, in my {{profession}} I can't {{afford to take}} notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring <b>between</b> <b>'em,</b> as the sayin' is. 'Tisn't 'ardly my business like.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's such {{a lot of}} 'em at it," [...] grumbled Veronica. [...] "There are times, <b>between</b> <b>'em</b> all, {{when you}} don't know whether you're {{standing}} on your head or your heels." ...|$|R
5|$|An author for the South Asia Analysis Group {{explained}} the protests as expressions of middle-class angst {{arising out of}} a collapse of a social contract <b>between</b> <b>them</b> and the liberal state.|$|E
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{there has}} been little {{response}} to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of Zipf's Law, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison <b>between</b> <b>them</b> is unlikely to be enlightening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wal, {{the mate}} {{he went and}} had a talk with the cap'n; and they 'greed <b>between</b> <b>'em</b> that Mr. More was to hold her in talk while the cap'n went and took {{observations}} in the state-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--there's a {{difference}} <b>between</b> <b>'em,</b> though he do call himself a teetotaller," [...] said Nance Mockridge. [...] "She'll wish her cake dough afore she's done of him. There's a blue-beardy look about 'en; and 'twill out in time." ...|$|R
50|$|In Shakespeare's {{version of}} this {{encounter}} in Julius Caesar, Favonius' opening lines {{in his role as}} Poet are:POET. Within Let me go in to see the generals; There is some grudge <b>between</b> <b>'em,</b> 'tis not meet they be alone.|$|R
5|$|Before long, Bohemond granted Jabala (which {{was still}} to be conquered) to the Templars {{although}} Raymond-Roupen had promised the town to the Hospitallers. The papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, brokered an agreement between the military orders, dividing the town <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> However, Bohemond remained hostile to the Hospitallers. After he confiscated their property in Antioch, Pelagius excommunicated him.|$|E
5|$|Bhattacharya {{links the}} archaeological discoveries of Indus valley civilization to present-day Shaktism of later Hindu religion. Other {{scholars}} like David Kinsley and Lynn Foulston acknowledge some {{similarities between the}} cult of goddess in Indus valley civilization and Shaktism, but {{think that there is}} no conclusive evidence that proves a link <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brodie coached and mentored the Southport College team in 2014–15, and {{organised}} {{a charity}} match <b>between</b> <b>them</b> and the Redheugh Boys Club in May 2015 {{to raise money}} for Diabetes UK. His partner gave birth to their first child, Charlie, in August 2016.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 19th century the six towns that {{eventually}} became Stoke-on-Trent—Burslem, Tunstall, Stoke-upon-Trent, Hanley, Fenton and Longton—were all established settlements. Despite occupying only a small geographic area and all based around the pottery industry, there was little political or social co-operation <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{settlement}} {{period of the}} Niagara area, following the American Revolutionary War, new wagon routes were built over native footpaths. Grimsby and Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) quickly became established settlements, but travel was cumbersome <b>between</b> <b>them.</b> Pioneers were forced to travel south along the Niagara Road to Queenston, where they turned west and followed the Iroquois Road.|$|E
5|$|Each engine {{had its own}} {{intake and}} the engine {{nacelles}} were paired with a splitter plate <b>between</b> <b>them</b> to minimise adverse behaviour of one powerplant influencing the other. Only above Mach 1.6 was an engine surge likely to affect the adjacent engine.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{designed}} 'em {{for each}} other; {{they were made}} for each other, sent into the world for each other, born for each other, Winkle,' said Mr. Ben Allen, setting down his glass with emphasis. 'There's a special destiny in the matter, my dear sir; there's only five years' difference <b>between</b> <b>'em,</b> and both their birthdays are in August.' ...|$|R
5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions though there is some functional overlap <b>between</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology (informally, evo-devo) {{is a field}} of biological research that compares the developmental processes of different organisms to infer the ancestral relationships <b>between</b> <b>them</b> and how developmental processes evolved.|$|E
5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose <b>between</b> <b>them,</b> {{and they may not}} all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose <b>between</b> <b>them</b> until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E

I wonder whether it would be worth any gentleman’s while, now, to buy that obserwation for the Papers; or the Parliament!’ ...|$|R
