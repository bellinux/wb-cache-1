5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} {{gripped the}} United States during the Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|As {{retribution}} for the Italian actions at Beirut, {{four days}} after the battle the central Ottoman government ordered the Wilyets of Beirut, Aleppo, and Damascus to expel all Italian citizens from their jurisdictions, resulting in the deportation of over 60,000 Italians from the region. Despite the retaliatory expulsion of Italian citizens from the area, the battle gave the Italian forces complete naval superiority in the approaches to the Suez Canal and Italian forces in Eritrea could now <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> without hesitation, eliminating much of the Ottoman threat to the region. Thus the battle was both a strategic and tactical Italian victory.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Major General Millard F. Harmon, {{commander}} of U.S. Army {{forces in the}} South Pacific, convinced Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, {{commander of}} Allied forces in the South Pacific Area, that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus on 13 October, a naval convoy delivered the 2,837-strong 164th U.S. Infantry Regiment, a North Dakota Army National Guard formation from the U.S. Army's Americal Division, commanded by Colonel Robert Hall, to Guadalcanal.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{sequence of}} prompt and probe trials {{was used to}} teach picture names to three severely retarded children. On prompt trials the experimenter presented a picture and said the picture name {{for the child to}} imitate; on probe trials the experimenter did not name the picture. A procedure whereby correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> nondifferentially <b>reinforced</b> <b>was</b> compared with procedures whereby correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> differentially <b>reinforced</b> according to separate and independent schedules of primary reinforcement. In Phase 1, correct responses to prompts and probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> nondifferentially on a fixed ratio (FR) 6 or 8 schedule; in Phase 2, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on an FR schedule of the same value; in Phase 3, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on a continuous reinforcement (CRF; every correct response reinforced) schedule; in Phase 4, correct responses to prompts <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on a CRF schedule and correct responses to probes <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> on the FR schedule; in Phase 5, a reversal to the conditions of Phase 3 was conducted. For all three children, the FR schedule for correct responses to prompts combined with the CRF schedule for correct responses to probes (Phases 3 and 5) generated the highest number of correct responses to probes, the highest accuracy (correct responses relative to correct responses plus errors) on probe trials, and the highest rate of learning to name pictures...|$|R

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b> Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

In the final phase, both responses were placed on extinction. In the second component, a target response <b>was</b> <b>reinforced,</b> then four alternative responses <b>were</b> <b>reinforced</b> while the target response was placed on extinction. In the final phase, all responses were placed on extinction. Six of nine participants demonstrated lower resurgence of the target response following reinforcement of multiple response alternatives. The {{results of this study}} suggest teaching multiple response alternatives is a possible treatment strategy to mitigate response resurgence...|$|R
5|$|As winter {{broke in}} 1799, on 1 March, General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and his army of 25,000, the Army of the Danube, crossed the Rhine at Kehl. Instructed {{to block the}} Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in {{northern}} Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Charles' army could <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, and use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl.

5|$|Construction of a {{full-scale}} mockup {{was completed in}} June 1945 by Factory No. 81, but the order for five prototypes was given to Factory No. 381 as Factory No. 81 was already fully committed to other programs. Manufacturing drawings were delivered to Factory No. 381 {{by the end of}} August, but the prototypes were delayed because the plant had no experience building metal aircraft and lacked the necessary tooling. By the end of the year, the factory had only managed to complete a single airframe for static load testing. This showed that the rear fuselage, wings and tail needed to <b>be</b> <b>reinforced,</b> and the opportunity was taken to enlarge the vertical stabilizer as well. These tests and modifications required six months of work so that the first flying prototype was not completed until July 1946. Manufacturer's testing of the first prototype began on 27 August, after ground testing had required replacing the engine twice, and the first flight was made on 11 September.|$|E

5|$|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I was keen to {{lure the}} Elector back into the Imperial fold after he had {{switched}} allegiance to fight for King Louis XIV before the war. Given this duplicity, Marlborough thought {{the best way to}} secure Bavaria for the Alliance was to negotiate from a position of strength by invading the Elector's territories, hoping to persuade him to change sides before he could <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b> By 22 June Marlborough's army had linked up with elements of the Margrave of Baden's Imperial forces at Launsheim; by the end of June their combined strength totalled nearly 80,000 men (see map on right). The Franco-Bavarian army camped at Ulm were numerically inferior to the Allies, and {{a large part of the}} Elector's troops were scattered about garrisons in his territories as far as Munich and the Tyrolese frontier, but his position was far from desperate: if he could hold out for a month, Tallard would arrive from the Rhine with French reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{joined the}} war on the Allies' side on 5 May 1915, declaring war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May 1915 and on Germany on 28 August 1916. The British Army's {{involvement}} in the Italian campaign did not start until late 1917, when troops were sent to help prevent a defeat on the Italian front. On 24 October 1917 {{in the battle of}} Caporetto the Second Italian Army collapsed and the Italians were forced to retreat to the Piave River, where they could <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> with five British and six French Divisions from the Western Front, complete with supporting arms and commanded by General Herbert Plumer. The reinforced Italians successfully managed to halt the Austro-Hungarian advance at the battle of the Piave river. During the Allied counter-attack in October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Army collapsed after taking heavy losses at the battle of Vittorio Veneto. An armistice was signed shortly afterwards on 3 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Maximilian {{attempted}} {{to resolve the}} dispute by bringing a military force to Poland, thereby starting the War of the Polish Succession. After a failed attempt to take Kraków in late 1587, successfully defended by Zamoyski, he retreated to gather more reinforcements but was pursued by the forces loyal to Sigismund. Zamoyski at first wanted to avoid a large battle, as he hoped for more reinforcements and supplies, but, when {{it became apparent that}} Maximilian would <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> first, he decided to press an attack. He also received the king's and royal permission to cross the borders and attack Maximilian in Silesia. Zamoyski divided his army into several regiments that were able to march quickly, at approximately 24 kilometers a day. He reformed his army after a week near Częstochowa. In the meantime, on 22 January 1588, Maximilian crossed the border into his own territory, towards Byczyna (Pitschen).|$|E

5|$|On 10 June, the Duke met for {{the first}} time the President of the Imperial War Council, Prince Eugene – {{accompanied}} by Count Wratislaw – at the village of Mundelsheim, halfway between the Danube and the Rhine. By 13 June, the Imperial Field Commander, Prince Louis of Baden, had joined them in Großheppach. The three generals commanded a force of nearly 110,000 men. At conference it was decided that Eugene would return with 28,000 men to the Lines of Stollhofen on the Rhine to keep an eye on Villeroi and Tallard and prevent them going to the aid of the Franco-Bavarian army on the Danube. Meanwhile, Marlborough's and Baden's forces would combine, totalling 80,000 men, for the march on the Danube to seek out the Elector and Marsin before they could <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Church of St John the Baptist, {{known to}} the locals as Sveti Yani or Sveti Yan, is located on a high cliff on the western {{outskirts}} of Asenovgrad, which belong to the old town. To allow its construction, the terrain around its foundations had to <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b> The church lies close to several less ancient chapels, such as Saint Barbara's, Saint George's and Chapel of the Entry of the Most Holy Mother of God into the Temple. Nearby are also a 17th-century water fountain and remains of medieval fortifications which date to the 11th–13th century. Together, these buildings contribute {{to that part of}} Asenovgrad's medieval atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{device of}} ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, {{including}} {{many of the}} psalms, was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to {{the point that they}} could be expressed as a context-free grammar) which ensured a rhythm. In Chinese poetry, tones as well as stresses create rhythm. Classical Chinese poetics identifies four tones: the level tone, rising tone, departing tone, and entering tone.|$|E

5|$|Things {{remained}} {{quiet in}} the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland insisted that it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b> He was vociferously opposed by General Lewis W. Walt, the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing NVA and the NLF in the hinterlands. Westmoreland won out, however, and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.|$|E
5|$|According to {{aviation}} historian Bill Gunston, on 24 April 1946 {{representatives from}} Mikoyan-Gurevich and the Yakovlev OKB tossed a coin {{to determine which}} aircraft {{would be the first}} Soviet jet to fly. (MiG had brought the I-300, and Yakovlev the Yak-(3)-15.) MiG won and the I-300's first flight lasted six minutes. These early flights revealed problems with the stability of the aircraft and vibration problems with the new articulated heatshield. It was stiffened before the twelfth flight, but that only partially cured the problem. The first aircraft crashed, killing the pilot, during a demonstration in front of high-ranking officials on 11 July when the attachment lugs of the wing leading edge fairings failed and they hit the horizontal stabilizers. The remaining two prototypes began flight testing the following month, but preparations for the 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution delayed the start of the State acceptance trials until 17 December. Meanwhile, the horizontal stabilizer of the second prototype disintegrated during flight, but the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely. Another such incident happened to the third prototype in February 1947 and forced the tail to <b>be</b> <b>reinforced.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga saga, when Earl Páll herd of Earl Rögnvaldr's {{arrival in}} Shetland, he held council {{and decided to}} {{immediately}} gather forces and attack Earl Rögnvaldr before he could <b>be</b> <b>reinforced</b> by the incoming men he knew were coming from the Suðreyjar. That night Earl Páll was joined by five chieftains, with four ships—this brings his total forces to five ships. The fleet sailed to Rousay, where they arrive at sunset. During the night the force is further strengthened by arriving men. In the morning, as the fleet is about to set out for Shetland to meet Earl Rögnvaldr, about ten or twelve ships were spotted coming from the Pentland Firth. Earl Páll and his men were certain these ships were those of Frakökk and Ölvir; in consequence, the earl ordered the fleet to intercept. The saga states that when Ölvir's ships were east of Tankerness, they then sailed west from Mulls Head, Deerness. By this time, Earl Páll was further strengthened by a chieftain from Tankerness. The earl then ordered his ships to be bound together, and for a bondi to gather stones for the upcoming battle. When the earl and his troops have fully prepared themselves, the saga states that Ölvir's forces made their attack.|$|E
