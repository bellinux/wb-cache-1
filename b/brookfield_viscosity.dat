5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated spring to a disk or bob spindle immersed in test fluid and the spring deflection measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid.

Successful test methods will deliver a % torque reading between 10 and 100. The rheological behavior of the test fluid can be observed using the same spindle at different speeds, but because the geometry of the fluid around a rotating bob or disk spindle in a large container does not allow a single shear rate to be assigned, proper rheometry is not feasible using this setup.|$|R

This research work focused on the investigation of the properties of asphalt binder modified with different percentages of two different nanomaterials. These materials are nanoclay, and nanosilica. The nanosilica was manufactured from two different sources: silica fume and rice husk. Nanomaterials and asphalt binder were first characterized. A mechanical mixer was then used at 1500 rpm to mix the nanomaterials with the binder. Required mixing time was determined. Three different nanomaterial percentages were mixed with the binder. The modified binders were tested for rheological properties. Results showed that, nanosilica synthesized from silica fume tends to decrease the penetration value and increase the softening point temperature. The nanoclay on the other hand was found to increase the penetration and decrease the softening point temperature. At temperature of 135 °C and up to 150 °C, increasing nanosilica percentage was found to increase <b>Brookfield</b> Rotational <b>Viscosity</b> (RV), while nanoclay, at small percentages, increased the RV and then decreased it at higher percentages. At higher temperature, up to 165 °C, the RV values did not change significantly using both nanomodifiers. Nanosilica from rice husk showed improvement in the RV results. Finally, the Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) results showed obvious improvement in the performance grade leading to higher resistance to permanent deformation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the effect of temperature and time depolymerization of natural latex rubber using NaNO 2, H 2 O 2 and Ascorbic Acid (0. 4 : 0. 2 : 0. 1) mol at pH about 5 towards its molecular weight reduction, then studied the effect on the quality of adhesives produced. The stages of this research include making concentrated natural rubber latex, its depolymerization, rubber crepe making, rubber compounding and followed by rubber adhesives manufacturing. Depolymerization is conducted by varying the temperature (50, 70 and 90 oC) with the duration (4, 6, 8, and 10 hours). The indication of molecular weight reduction is determined by the mooney viscosity test, while the quality of the rubber adhesives is evaluated from the <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> test and its peel strength. Concentrated Natural Rubber was successfully prepared using 2 % (v / v) ammonium laurate 20 % and 0. 2 % (v / v) 2 % sodium alginate resulted in dry rubber content 49. 36 %, mechanical stability 91 seconds, ammonia 0. 58 % and Viscosity Mooney 193. 80 cp. Chemical depolymerization is able to reduce the viscosity mooney of natural rubber approximately 95 %. The results showed that the greatest molecular weight reduction was depolymerization at 70 ° C for 8 hours indicated by decreasing the mooney viscosity from 193. 80 to 10. 05 cp. From the results of testing the quality of the adhesives, the lower the molecular weight the adhesive power between layers of rubber is higher with lower Viscosity Brookfield.

The test results indicate that <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> shows a fairly strong cor-relation with G*/sinδ at high service temperature.

The relationship between the creep stiffness and the failure strain at- 12,- 18 and- 24 ℃ is very good (R 2 = 0. 81) as compared with the others. Creep stiffness decreases as failure strain increases. The Bitumen Test Data Chart (BTDC) basically allows one to take different physical property measurements (viscosity, penetration, Fraass temperature, and/or softening point) and predict the consistency of the material over a wide temperature range. Family curves of the BTDC could be used to compare the characteristics of a binder as it ages.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the main}} problem {{pertaining}} {{to the use of}} the recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) material in hot mix asphalt (HMA) is the ageing of bitumen, which limits the percentage of applied RAP in the HMA. In this respect, rejuvenation of bitumen binder is the major but the most costly part of recycling. This paper investigates the novelty of using waste cooking oil (WCO), which is frequently found as a polluting waste material in landfills and rivers from the food industry, to rejuvenate the bituminous binder. The physical properties of the original bitumen, aged bitumen and rejuvenated bitumen were measured and compared by the conventional bitumen binder tests including softening point, penetration and <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity,</b> and statistical analyses were used to assess the results. In general, the results showed that the aged bitumen was rejuvenated by the WCO due to a change in its physical properties, which resemble the physical properties of original bitumen (80 / 100). The optimum percentage of waste cooking oil for the rejuvenated aged bitumen group of 50 / 60, 40 / 50, and 30 / 40 was recognised by adding 1, 3 - 4, and 4 - 5 WCO, respectively.

In this paper, the effect of different soft segment length on influencing the structure property relationship of polyurethane prepolymer was studied. The soft segment length was varied by using poly (propylene oxide) glycol having different molecular weight and also by blending two polyols having similar chemical composition but of different molecular weight. The formation of the prepolymer was investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results reveal that with increasing soft segment length, the weight average molecular weight and storage time of the prepolymer increases, whereas the <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> decreases due to higher content of soft segment. The curing time was found higher in prepolymer having longer soft segments due to lower isocyanate content.

Asphalt binders were recovered by extraction and distillation from asphalt mixtures premixed at different temperatures (140 ℃, 160 ℃, 180 ℃ for HMA, 100 ℃ and 120 ℃ for WMA) in the mixing plant. Penetration@ 25 ℃, softening point (R&B) and rotational <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> tests were carried out. Results show that the aging of asphalt binder increases as the mixing temperature is elevated, and remarkably accelerates at the temperatures higher than 150 ℃. Warm mix asphalt (for example, mixing temperature at 100 ℃or 120 ℃) can greatly reduce the aging of asphalt. Aging of the asphalt binder is one of the factors that would affect the mixture’s fatigue life. Four-point beam fatigue test samples were mixed and compacted at 140 ℃ for HMA and 120 ℃ for WMA, and fatigue tests with a frequency of 10 Hz and three constant strain levels (150 micro-strain, 300 micro-strain, 450 micro-strain, respectively) were performed. Results show that WMA’s fatigue life was higher than the control HMA, which indicates that it may reduce aging of asphalt binder and improve fatigue performance of asphalt mixture at lower production temperatures...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} program {{was based on}} laboratory and field studies. All work {{was limited to the}} use of a 10 -mesh crumb rubber in the dry process. An evaluation of the asphalt-rubber interactions indicated {{that there should be a}} reasonable level of interaction between the crumb rubber and the asphalt cement selected for the project. A suggested criterion for defining an acceptable level of interaction would be to establish a minimum viscosity of 15 Poise (<b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity)</b> for a neat asphalt cement modified with 20 percent crumb rubber. When designing a crumb rubber modified mixture, the aggregate gradation should be substantially gapped. The target gradation used in the construction of the Babbit, Minnesota test sections should be considered as a guideline for an acceptable gapped gradation. Stockpile gradations should be adjusted for crumb rubber gradations volumetrically; generally, 1 gram of crumb rubber occupies the same volume as 3 grams of aggregate for a given sieve size. The optimum asphalt content for CRM mixtures should be based on air voids from 1. 5 to 3 percent. During construction, the crumb rubber (supplied in 50 Ibs. bags) should be added through the recycled asphalt (RAP) hopper (drum plant) or directly into the pug mill (batch plant). Laydown and compaction procedures should proceed as usual. Use of vibration on the rollers should be used at the discretion of the field engineer. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} whey protein {{concentrates}} on physical and rheological properties of yogurt were studied. Five commercial whey protein concentrates (340 g kg− 1 protein nominal) {{were used to}} fortify milk to 45 g protein kg− 1. Fermentation was performed with two different starters (ropy and non-ropy). Resulting yogurts were compared with a control yogurt enriched with skim milk powder. The water-holding capacity of the yogurt fortified with skim milk powder was 500 g kg− 1 and ranged from 600 to 638 g kg− 1 when fortified with whey protein concentrates. Significant rheological differences have been noticed between the yogurts fortified with different whey protein concentrates, independent of the starter used. Three whey protein concentrates generated yogurts with a behavior similar to the control. The two others produced yogurt with lower firmness (15 g compared with 17 g), lower <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> (6 Pa s compared with 9 Pa s), lower yield stress (2 Pa compared with 4 Pa), lower complex viscosity (13 Pa s compared with 26 Pa s), and lower apparent viscosity (0. 4 Pa s compared with 1 Pa s) than the control, respectively. The yogurts with the lowest firmness and viscosity were produced with concentrates which contained the highest amount of non-protein nitrogen fraction (160 g kg− 1 versus 126 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen), and the highest amount of denaturation of the whey protein (262 versus 200 g kg− 1 of the total nitrogen) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{concern with}} {{sustainable}} development has driven efforts {{to the study}} of green technologies to minimize the environmental impacts without compromising pavement quality. In this scenery, the paving industry has started to research and apply warm asphalt mixtures, which are produced in lower temperatures than conventional mixtures and reduce the expenses in fuels. The warm mixtures can result from the addition of an oil, usually organic, to the conventional binder, decreasing the binder's viscosity. Moringa oleifera Lam Seeds possess an oil content varying between 38 and 40 % and have antioxidant and lubricant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the changes in properties related to consistency and the effective variation of mixing and compaction temperatures due to asphalt modification with the oil of Moringa oleifera Lam as green additive. The Moringa oleifera Lam oil was extracted by pressing of seeds. Then, 6 mixtures were made using 50 / 70 PAC and Moringa Oleifera Lam oil in different proportions (0. 5 %, 1 %, 1. 5 %, 2 %, 2. 5 % and 3 %), as well as a reference sample (pure PAC). The binders were analysed using <b>Brookfield</b> <b>Viscosity,</b> Penetration, Softening Point and Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFOT) Tests. The results showed that the addition of Moringa oleifera Lam oil must be made for contents in the range of 0. 5 % to 1 %, once that to these contents there is a significant reduction in machining and compaction temperatures (&# 8776; 5 °C) without compromising the asphalt binder performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to introduce the emerging non-contacting spray coating process and {{compare it to the}} existing coating techniques. Particular emphasis was given to the details of the spraying process of paper coating colour and the base paper requirements set by the new coating method. Spraying technology itself is nothing new, but the atomisation process of paper coating colour is quite unknown to the paper industry. The differences between the rheology of painting and coating colours make it very difficult to utilise the existing information from spray painting research. Based on the trials, some basic conclusion can be made:The {{results of this study suggest}} that the <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> of spray coating colour should be as low as possible, presently a 50 mPas level is regarded as an optimum. For the paper quality and coater runnability, the solids level should be as high as possible. However, the graininess of coated paper surface and the nozzle wear limits the maximum solids level to 60 % at the moment. Most likelydue to the low solids and low viscosity of the coating colour the low shear <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity</b> correlates very well with the paper and spray fan qualities. High shear viscosity is also important, but yet less significant than the low shear viscosity. Droplet size should be minimized and besides keeping the brrokfield viscosity low that can be helped by using a surfactant or dispersing agent in the coating colour formula. Increasing the spraying pressure in the nozzle can also reduce the droplet size. The small droplet size also improves the coating coverage, since there is hardly any levelling taking place after the impact with the base paper. Because of the lack of shear forces after the application, the pigment particles do not orientate along the paper surface. Therefore the study indicates that based on the present know-how, no quality improvements can be obtained by the use of platy type of pigments. The other disadvantage of them is the rapid deterioration of the nozzle lifetime. Further research in both coating colour rheology and nozzle design may change this in the future, but so far only round shape pigments, like typically calcium carbonate is, can be used with spray coating. The low water retention characteristics of spray coating, enhanced by the low solids and low viscosity, challenge the base paper absorption properties. Filler level has to be low not to increase the number of small pores, which have a great influence on the absorption properties of the base paper. Hydrophobic sizing reduces this absorption and prevents binder migration efficiently. High surface roughness and especially poor formation of the base paper deteriorate thespray coated paper properties. However, pre-calendering of the base paper does not contribute anything to the finished paper quality, at least at the coating colour solids level below 60 %. When targeting a standard offset LWC grade, spraycoating produces similar quality to film coating, but yet blade coating being on a slightly better level. However, because of the savings in both investment and production costs, spray coating may have an excellent future ahead. The porousnature of the spray coated surface offers an optimum substrate for the coldset printing industry to utilise the potential of high quality papers in their business...|$|E
40|$|Organo-modified nanoclay has got {{considerable}} attention {{in recent years}} to improve the performance of asphalt binders. However, various aspects such as rutting performance using Multiple Stress Creep Recovery (MSCR) test, fatigue performance using Linear Amplitude Sweep (LAS) test and ageing resistivity potential using advanced rheological parameter are still unexplored for better rheological characterisation. The present study deals with rutting, ageing resistivity potential and fatigue performance of asphalt binder (AC- 10) modified with organo-modified nanoclay (CL- 30 B). Different percentages (0, 2, 4 and 6 % by weight of binder) of CL- 30 B were mixed with AC- 10 using a high-shear mixer. Different rheological studies, such as <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity,</b> Superpave performance grading, time-temperature sweep, MSCR and LAS tests, were conducted on CL- 30 B-modified asphalt binders. Effects of CL- 30 B on performance were observed to be predominant in intermediate to high-temperature range as obtained from the master curve. The ageing resistivity of asphalt binder increased with the addition of CL- 30 B. The Superpave rutting parameter (G*/Sin delta) increased and non-recoverable creep compliance (J(nr)) estimated from MSCR decreased with inclusion of CL- 30 B, indicating a better rutting performance of asphalt binders. The number of cycles to fatigue estimated from the LAS test showed improvement in fatigue performance of asphalt binder with addition of CL- 30 B. The high-temperature performance grade of CL- 30 B-modified binder was found to be higher compared to virgin binder. The relationship between J(nr) and G*/Sin delta, and recovery (R) and storage modulus (G') parameters are presented in this paper. In addition, ranking of asphalt binder based on various parameters (i. e. G*/Sin delta, AI, J(nr), R, N-f) is discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Different {{aliphatic}} waterborne polyurethane dispersions (PUDs) were synthesized {{by using}} different polyols (Mw: 1000 Da) of randomly copolymerized polycarbonate diols with hexamethylene and pentamethylene (C 6 –C 5), tetramethylene (C 6 –C 4) and trimethylene (C 6 –C 3); these copolymers differed in {{the length of}} the methylene groups and the structural regularity due to the combination of even and odd units. <b>Brookfield</b> <b>viscosity,</b> extent of particle crowding and broadening of the particle size distribution of the PUD synthesized with C 6 –C 4 polyol followed a different trend than for the other because of the even number of methylene units in the polyol. The PUDs showed monomodal particle size distribution which was narrower in C 6 –C 4 (i. e. the dispersion with higher structural regularity) and the mean particle size decreased by decreasing {{the length of the}} methylene unit of the copolymer. The properties of the polyurethanes were affected by the phase separation between the hard and soft segments, the more regular packing of even methylene units in the copolymer and the crystallized polar segments due to carbonate groups. Thus, the glass transition values of the soft segments in the polyurethanes were similar because of the more regular packing of even methylene units in C 6 –C 4 polyol and the crystallized segments produced by interactions of carbonate groups. PU(C 6 –C 5) and PU(C 6 –C 4) showed similar degree of phase separation, the higher degree of phase separation corresponded to PU(C 6 –C 3). Furthermore, the crystallinity of the polyurethanes increased with decreasing the number of methylene units in the polyol, but PU(C 6 –C 4) was the most crystalline because of the more regularly packed even methylene groups in the polyol chain. The thermal stability of the polyurethanes increased from PU(C 6 –C 5) to PU(C 6 –C 3) because the more net interactions between the carbonate groups in the soft segments. The lower was the number of methylene groups between carbonate units in the copolymer, the higher was the elastic modulus of the polyurethanes. The tensile strength and elongation-at-break values of the polyurethanes increased by increasing the number of methylene groups between carbonate units in the copolymer. Finally, the peel strength was maximal in the joint made with PU(C 6 –C 5) and the shear strength was the highest in the joint made with PU(C 6 –C 3), in agreement with the variation of the viscoelastic and mechanical properties of the polyurethanes.
