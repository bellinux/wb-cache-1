25|$|As the {{inhabitants}} of Redwall Abbey bask in the glorious Summer of the Late Rose, all is quiet and peaceful. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not as they seem. Cluny the Scourge—the evil one-eyed rat warlord, is hell-bent on destroying the tranquility {{as he prepares to}} fight a bloody battle for the ownership of Redwall. This dazzling story in the Redwall series is packed with all the wit, wisdom, humor, and blood-curdling adventure of the other books in the collection, but has the added bonus of taking the reader right back to {{the heart and soul of}} Redwall Abbey and the characters who live there.|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{featured}} guest appearances by actors J. G. Hertzler and Jeffrey Combs best known to Star Trek fans from the series [...] where they respectively played Martok and the double role of Weyoun and Brunt. Combs described his character as the [...] "Don King of my quadrant", {{but was a}} little uneasy about appearing on Voyager after 35 episodes of Deep Space Nine {{as some of the}} sets from his former show had been re-used in a different manner, saying [...] "It felt like how an old person might feel going home, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> not quite the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark {{returned}} during [...] "Episode 6646", {{which focused}} on an eclipse. Kate was left questioning whether she had really seen him. Brewer said that her character would be torn when Mark returns, as she had moved on with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Mark's reappearance [...] "just throws it all out of whack". When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> different now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because she thought he was dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E
50|$|The Is {{album was}} {{recorded}} in the Netherlands with engineer Gertjan ("Joe"). Firks and Frye had come out from the States and they lived at the studio for a couple weeks in semi-rural seclusion. Frye left unexpectedly mid-project <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> continued. Then came another tour, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> starting to fall apart.|$|R

500|$|Aarhus has {{a robust}} and diverse nightlife. The action tends to {{concentrate}} {{in the inner}} city, with the pedestrianised riverside, Frederiksgade, the Latin Quarter and Jægergårdsgade on Frederiksbjerg as the most active centres at night, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> stirring elsewhere around the city too. The nightlife scene offers everything from small joints with cheap alcohol and a homely atmosphere to fashionable night clubs serving champagne and cocktails or small and large music venues with bars, dance floors and lounges. [...] A short selection of well-established places where {{you can have a}} drink and socialise, include the fashionable lounge and night club of Kupé at the harbour front, the relaxed Ris Ras Filliongongong offering waterpipes and an award-winning beer selection, Fatter Eskild with a broad selection of Danish bands playing mostly blues and rock, the wine and book café of Løve's in Nørregade, Sherlock Holmes, a British-style pub with live music and the brew pub of Sct. Clemens with A Hereford Beefstouw restaurant across the cathedral. [...] There are several clubs, discos and cafés aimed at gays and lesbians, including Danish D-lite (sports), Gbar (nightclub) and Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club).|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for IGN, Matt Fowler wrote, [...] "With Jon's final choice in [...] "Oathbreaker," [...] the show {{seemed to make}} a huge step forward into the endgame. One where we might see {{things that have been}} set up for a long time start to pay off. Not everyone's story is firing on all {{cylinders}} at the moment, Tyrion was actively bored while waiting for news this week, but enough {{is going on in the}} North and at King's Landing to carry the series right now." [...] Likewise, Todd VanDerWerff of Vox wrote, [...] ""Oathbreaker" [...] is a crisp, lean, nicely paced episode of Game of Thrones. It's one of those episodes where the characters are mostly being positioned for future episodes, but it's a solidly executed version of that basic template." [...] Alyssa Rosenberg of the Washington Post wrote that she believed this was [...] "The strongest episode of the sixth season of Game of Thrones to date." [...] While Erik Kain of Forbes noted [...] "The season has been full of revelations, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> still building. That's okay. I love the tension and not knowing exactly what's coming." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early in May 2014, the Algerian {{military}} {{said it was}} engaged in an operation aimed at tracking down militants who infiltrated the country's territory in Tamanrasset near the Libyan border, during which it announced that it managed to kill 10 [...] "terrorists" [...] and seized a large cache of weapons {{near the town of}} Janet consisting of automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition boxes. The Times reported on 30 May that Algerian forces were strongly present in Libya and it was claimed shortly after by an Algerian journalist from El Watan that a full regiment of 3,500 paratroopers logistically supported by 1,500 other men crossed into Libya and occupied a zone in the west of the country. They were later shown to be operating alongside French special forces in the region. However, all of these claims were later denied by the Algerian government through Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal who told the senate that [...] "Algeria has always shown its willingness to assist [...] sister countries, <b>but</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> clear: the Algerian army will not undertake any operation outside Algerian territory".|$|E

60|$|After a time I {{got over}} it; that is, the heartache ceased to ache all the time. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> never {{quite the same}} again. Life always seemed rather dreary and empty, in spite of Hester and my roses and my Sunday-School.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes; I {{have been}} home {{for this week}} past. <b>But</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> all so at sixes and sevens among us all that a fellow can't go and do just what he would like." ...|$|E
