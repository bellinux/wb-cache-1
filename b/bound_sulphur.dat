40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the possibilities of minimizing the sulphur content in Kraft lignin. Kraft lignin contains about 1. 5 to 3 % sulphur. The sulphur {{is believed to be}} present in lignin as inorganic sulphur, as elemental sulphur, as adsorbed polysulphide and/or as organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur.</b> For the determination of these different types of sulphur components, different approaches and methods were used. For the determination of inorganic sulphur, lignin was washed with water at pH 6 and pH 2 and the wash waters were analysed with ion chromatography (IC). For the determination of total sulphur content in the lignin, two methods were used; Schöniger combustion followed by ion chromatography (IC) and wet digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The elemental sulphur content in water-extracted lignin was determined after n-pentane extraction. ICP analysis was performed on the washed lignin. Calcium present in the lignin may bind polysulphides and thus be a source of the observed sulphur. The lignin was thus ion-exchanged to remove any calcium. To further investigate how the sulphur content in lignin can be decreased, two different types of reactions were performed on lignin; oxidation and reduction. The oxidation reactions were made in sodium hydroxide with oxygen at different temperatures and time on both original and water-extracted lignin. The reduction reactions were made on water-extracted lignin with Raney nickel in three different solvent systems: methanol: water, acetone: water and sodium hydroxide.   The original lignin contained 2. 6 % sulphur as determined by ICP. Washing lowered the content to 1. 85 % sulphur. By n-pentane extraction the elemental sulphur was lowered to a level of 1. 82 % sulphur, which was considered to be organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur.</b> Neither the ion exchange nor the oxidation lowered the sulphur content significantly.   The reduction reactions successfully the organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> from 1. 82 % to a level of 0. 54 %.   The relative distribution of the sulphur content in the studied softwood lignin was as follows: about 29 % as inorganic sulphur, about 1 % as elemental sulphur and approximately 70 % as organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur,</b> of which 49 % could be removed by Raney nickel...|$|E
40|$|The Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM) was {{commissioned}} by the Senate Department of Urban Development, Berlin, {{to carry out the}} investigations regarding the mass balance of the sulphur containing components of three selected groundwater samples from an industrial contaminated site in Berlin. The soil and groundwater contamination was caused by chemical waste of the former industrial site. The information on content of different organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds, colloidal sulphur and dissolved sulphides is of great importance for the layout and dimensioning of groundwater cleaning plants (active carbon, catalyst). It was therefore decided to carry out investigations {{in order to be able}} to estimate the mass balance of sulphur content of ground water from three different sampling points, which represent the typical specific contamination prior to the process of calling tender for the cleaning of groundwater. Within the frame of this investigation - both the group parameters as total sulphur content, purgeable and adsorbable organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> (POS, AOS) and extractable high and semi-volatile organic sulphur compounds as well as the main organic individual sulphur contaminants are to be determined after identification with GC-MS and GC-AED.

The synthesis of the DNPH derivative of L-xylosone, for use as an analytical standard, is also described. These data were used to calculate the predicted sulphite binding power of fermented ciders at various levels of free sulphur dioxide. Analysis of free and <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> dioxide in the ciders, after equilibration with known amounts of added sulphite, was used to calculate the experimental sulphite binding power.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of elemental <b>sulphur</b> and <b>sulphur</b> <b>bound</b> in inorganic and organic compounds was investigated for three surface {{samples of the}} oil-source rock from the Upper Jurassic strata in the Dinarides. Concentrations of elemental sulphur are very low and the concentrations of <b>sulphur</b> <b>bound</b> in pyrite and sulphates are relatively low. On the other hand, organically-bound sulphur in both kerogens and bitumens is rather high, representing almost {{a tenth of the}} bitumens and the kerogens by weight. Among the organo-sulphur compounds in bitumens, analyzed by GC-MS, alkylthiophenes, alkylbithiophenes, alkylthiolanes, alkylbenzothiophenes and alkyldibenzothiophenes were identified. Among the pyrolysis products of kerogens alkylthiophenes, alkenylthiophenes and benzothiophenes were identified. Based on similar sulphur distribution and the same organo-sulphur compounds identified in the bitumens and kerogen pyrolysates, samples are thought to be geochemically related. The extremely high concentrations of organic matter and of organically-bound sulphur indicate that the depositional environment of the Upper Jurassic strata in the Dinarides was most probably anoxic and iron lean...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} summary {{information about}} the importance of sulphur as an important macrobiogenic element in plant nutrition, as well as about sulphur cycle in soil, development of sulphur content in recent years and possibilities of sulphur supply to crops being grown. Sulphur is an important macroelement in plant nutrition and it is part of important amino acids, vitamins and proteins. Sulphur content in crops predetermines {{the quantity and quality of}} harvested products. Sulphur in our latitudes entered in soil particularly due to atmospheric depositions. With desulphurization of power plants, there has been a significant decline in sulphur entering soil in recent decades, from an approximate figure of 120 kg of pure sulphur per hectare in 1990 to mere 6 8 kg of sulphur per hectare in 2013. Due to small intake of sulphur in soil, plants that draw off large amounts of sulphur and due to the fact that sulphur is swiftly washed off from the topsoil to deeper soil layers where it is inaccessible to the crops, there is often lack of sulphur in the nourishment of crops being grown, which regards both sulphur demanding crops, such as oil crops, and crops such as cereals where lack of sulphur has not manifested itself as much so far. Soil contains sulphur in an inorganic and organic form. Inorganic sulphur in agricultural land is represented to a lesser extent than organic sulphur, but it is the main source of plant available sulphur and it is a highlydynamic soil component. In soil, it is usually contained in the form of sulphates. Intake of sulphates and their concentration in the soil solution impacts pH, amount of Fe and Al oxides and behaviour of soil colloids. We can influence the content of inorganic sulphur by supplying mineral fertilizers, but we cannot increase the overall long-term supply of sulphur in soil in this way. Long-term and main supply of sulphur in soil is represented by organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>bound</b> in <b>sulphur</b> amino acids, sulfolipids, sulphonic acids and sulphated polysaccharides. We can influence this component of the overall sulphur content by organic fertilization, green manuring, afterharvest residues and sewage sludge application...|$|R

40|$|We have {{determined}} (1) the abundance and isotopic composition of pyrite, monosulphide, elemental sulphur, organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur,</b> and dissolved sulphide; (2) {{the partition of}} ferric and ferrous iron; (3) the organic carbon contents of sediments recovered at two sites drilled on the Peru Margin during Leg 112 of the Ocean Drilling Program. Sediments at both sites are characterised by high levels of organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> (OBS). OBS comprises up to 50 % of total sedimentary sulphur and up to 1 % of bulk sediment. The weight ratio of S to C in organic matter varies from 0. 03 to 0. 15 (mean = 0. 10). Such ratios are like those measured in lithologically similar, but more deeply buried petroleum source rocks of the Monterey and Sisquoc formations in California. The sulphur content of organic matter is not limited by the availability of porewater sulphide. Isotopic data suggest that sulphur is incorporated into organic matter within a metre of the sediment surface, at least partly by reaction with polysulphides. Most inorganic Sulphur occurs as pyrite. Pyrite formation occurred within surface sediments and was limited by the availability of reactive iron. But despite highly reducing sulphidic conditions, only 35 - 65 % of the total iron was converted to sulphide; 10 - 30 % of the total iron still occurs as Fe(III). In surface sediments, the isotopic composition of pyrite {{is similar to that}} of both iron monosulphide and dissolved sulphide. Either pyrite, like monosulphide, formed by direct reaction between dissolved sulphide and detrital iron, and/or the sulphur species responsible for converting FeS to FeS 2 is isotopically similar to dissolved sulphide. Likely stoichiometries for the reaction between ferric iron and excess sulphide imply a maximum resulting FeS 2 :FeS ratio of 1 : 1. Where pyrite dominates the pool of iron sulphides, at least some pyrite must have formed by reaction between monosulphide and elemental sulphur and/or polysulphide. Elemental sulphur (S°) is most abundant in surface sediments and probably formed by oxidation of sulphide diffusing across the sediment-water interface. In surface sediments, S° is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulphide, FeS and FeS 2 and is unlikely to have been involved in the conversion of FeS to FeS 2. Polysulphides are thus implicated as the link between FeS and FeS 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{limitation}} of {{fossil fuel resources}} {{and the necessity of}} reducing CO 2 emission require an increase of the efficiency of coal based power plants. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a potential concept to realise these objectives. In the IGCC a broad range of different coals can be used to produce a fuel gas for gas turbines or synthesis gas for chemical applications. The direct use of hot flue gas for driving a gas turbine requires a hot gas cleanup to achieve corrosion prevention of the turbine blades and prevention of catalysts from poisoning. Main problems are related to alkali metal, sulphur, and chlorine compounds released during the coal gasification process. High and low-rank coals differ in the amount, mode of occurrence and release mechanism of alkali metal, sulphur, and chlorine. Therefore, release experiments have been done with 8 different coals at 1400 °C, 1 atm and a gas stream with 7. 5 % O 2 and 2. 5 % water steam. Differences of the release mechanisms of high and low-rank coals were identified. The modes of occurrence of several inorganic coal constituents were shown to have a remarkable effect on the release, e. g., the results could distinguish between organic and inorganic <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur...</b>|$|E
40|$|Chemical and spectroscopic {{studies have}} shown that in {{agricultural}} soils most of the soil sulphur (> 95 %) is present as sulphate esters or as carbon-bonded sulphur (sulphonates or amino acid sulphur), rather than inorganic sulphate. Plant sulphur nutrition depends primarily on the uptake of inorganic sulphate. However, recent research has demonstrated that the sulphate ester and sulphonate-pools of soil sulphur are also plant-bioavailable, probably due to interconversion of carbon-bonded sulphur and sulphate estersulphur to inorganic sulphate by soil microbes. In addition to this mineralization of bound forms of sulphur, soil microbes are also responsible for the rapid immobilization of sulphate, first to sulphate esters and subsequently to carbon-bound sulphur. The rate of sulphur cycling depends on the microbial community present, and on its metabolic activity, though it is not yet known if specific microbial species or genera control this process. The genes involved in the mobilization of sulphonate- and sulphate estersulphur by one common rhizosphere bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, have been investigated. Mutants of this species that are unable to transform sulphate esters show reduced survival in the soil, indicating that sulphate esters are important for bacterial S-nutrition in this environment. P. putida S- 313 mutants that cannot metabolize sulphonate-sulphur do not promote the growth of tomato plants as the wild-type strain does, suggesting that the ability to mobilize <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> for plant nutrition is an important role of this species...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of free molecular and <b>bound</b> forms of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide and oxygen on the viability and culturability of a selected strain of Acetobacter pasteurianus and a selected strain of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine. Methods and Results: Acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts associated with wine spoilage were isolated from bottled commercial red wines. One bacterium, A. pasteurianus strain A 8, and one yeast, B. bruxellensis strain B 3 a, were selected for further study. The resistance to sulphur dioxide and the effect of oxygen addition on these two selected strains were determined by using plating and epifluorescence techniques for monitoring cell viability in wine. Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 was more resistant to sulphur dioxide than B. bruxellensis B 3 a, with the latter being rapidly affected by a short exposure time to free molecular form of sulphur dioxide. As expected, neither of these microbial strains was affected by the <b>bound</b> form of <b>sulphur</b> dioxide. The addition of oxygen negated the difference observed between plate and epifluorescence counts for A. pasteurianus A 8 during storage, while it stimulated growth of B. bruxellensis B 3 a. Conclusions: Acetobacter pasteurianus A 8 can survive under anaerobic conditions in wine in the presence of sulphur dioxide. Brettanomyces bruxellensis B 3 a is more sensitive to sulphur dioxide than A. pasteurianus A 8, but can grow in the presence of oxygen. Care should be taken to exclude oxygen from contact with wine when it is being transferred or moved. Significance and Impact of the Study: Wine spoilage can be avoided by preventing growth of undesirable acetic acid bacteria and Brettanomyces/Dekkera yeasts through the effective use of sulphur dioxide and the management of oxygen throughout the winemaking process. © 2005 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of sediments in coastal areas and harbours {{is due to}} a wide range of organic pollutants and trace elements; in these areas sediments may be a significant sink and/or source of these pollutants. Remediation and environmental recovery of sediments are extremely important in harbour areas, considered the need to dredge sediments in order to keep channels of navigation open. The main goal of this project is to assess a novel washing procedure for dredged sediments, that is environment friendly and suitable for the variety of pollutants, by exploiting the surface-active and complexing properties of natural organic substances. Dredged sediments from the industrial area of the Venice lagoon were analysed to evaluate the concentrations of POPs and the total concentrations of several trace elements (such as Cr, Zn, Cd, As, Hg, etc.). Furthermore, we used a modified sequential extraction procedure in order to evaluate the concentration of the chemical fractions: the exchangeable, the carbonate bound, the Fe and Mn oxides <b>bound,</b> the <b>sulphur</b> and organic matter bound, the residual bound.

Investigation {{of the distribution of}} hydrogeochemical variables and their connection with the occurrence of NO 3 -–N provides better insights into the prediction of the environmental risk associated with nitrogen use within agricultural systems. The research objective was to evaluate the effect of hydrogeological setting on agriculturally derived groundwater NO 3 -–N occurrence. Piezometers (n = 36) were installed at three depths across four contrasting agricultural research sites. Groundwater was sampled monthly for chemistry and dissolved gases, between February 2009 and January 2011. Mean groundwater NO 3 -–N ranged 0. 7 – 14. 6 mg L− 1, with site and groundwater depth being statistically significant (p < 0. 001). Unsaturated zone thickness and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) were significantly correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO) and redox potential (Eh) across sites. Groundwater NO 3 -–N occurrence was significantly negatively related to DOC and methane and positively related with Eh and Ksat. Reduction of NO 3 -–N started at Eh potentials < 150 mV while significant nitrate reduction occurred < 100 mV.

40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} obtainable from {{a member}} of the chlorophyceae has been investigated for the first time. This polysaccharide is of an acidic nature and its extraction from the alga has been effected with hot dilute sodium carbonate solution. Uronic acid residues {{do not appear to be}} present and the acidity of the material has been shown to be dependent on the presence of organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur.</b> It is suggested that such sulphur exists as a sulphuric acid ester group of the type R. O. SO 2. OH, but complete quantitative confirmation of this view is difficult to obtain. The polysaccharide has been shown to consist in part of methyl pentose units, which are apparently removed preferentially during dilute acid hydrolysis, since the simple sugar fractions from such hydrolyses are richer in methyl pentose than the original material. Methylation of simple hydrolysis products has led to the isolation of a fully methylated methyl pentose and the identification of the sugar as (1) rhamnose, the presence of which in algal carbohydrates has not previously been reported. Little evidence has been obtained as to the constitution of the remaining part of the carbohydrate complex but it apparently contains a certain amount of highly unstable material. An arbitrary separation of the polysaccharide extract into two fractions according to their solubility in 50 % alcohol has been effected. The fractions differ appreciably in their equivalent weights but in view of their very similar sulphate figures it appears that the higher equivalent weight of the more soluble fraction is due to the presence in it of a certain amount of sodium salt. There is a well-defined difference in the rhamnose contents of the two fractions, suggesting that a more profitable separation into a rhamnosan and a rhamnose-free polysaccharide might be possible. <p...|$|E
40|$|A pyrolysis-gas Chromatographic (py-g. c.) {{method for}} {{estimation}} of the Sorg/C ratio in kerogens {{and other forms of}} sedimentary macromolecular organic matter is described. The method is based upon flash pyrolysis at 610 °C for 10 s and areal integration of the FID peaks attributed to 2, 3 -dimethylthiophen, 1, 2 -dimethylbenzene and n-non- 1 -ene. Comparison of the ratio [2, 3 -dimethylthiophen]/[n-non- 1 -ene + 1, 2 -dimethylbenzene], denoted TR, with chemically determined atomic Sorg/C ratio revealed a distinct correlation (r 2 = 0. 89), suggesting that TR appears to broadly reflect the latter ratio for a variety of geological materials. Py-g. c. of untreated, whole rock samples indicated that whilst the atomic Stot/C ratio determined by elemental analysis was strongly influenced by the presence of inorganic sulphur, TR showed no such dependence. The independence of TR from matrix effects demonstrates that this method has an advantage in that samples may be directly analysed for organic sulphur content with little or no preparation. A trivariate plot was used to depict the relative abundances of each of the three individual components used to derive TR. On the basis of their position within this plot, samples derived from marine and hypersaline sedimentary environments could be clearly distinguished from those of freshwater lacustrine or predominantly higher plant origin. Maturity was also shown to significantly influence the relative abundance of thiophens, most notably in those sequences which contained kerogens with high initial organic sulphur contents. In these samples a preferential loss of 2, 3 -dimethylthiophen relative to alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons was observed with increasing maturation. Quantitative pyrolysis data showed that the absolute amounts of thiophens generated from sulphur-rich kerogens is high {{and that there is a}} marked depletion in yields with increasing maturity.

40|$|A new {{route for}} the {{formation}} of gammacerane from tetrahymanol is proposed; in addition to dehydration and hydrogenation, sulphurisation and early C [...] -S cleavage are shown to be important in the pathway of formation, especially in marine sediments. Evidence is twofold. First, relatively large amounts of the gammacerane skeleton are sequestered in S-rich macromolecular aggregates formed by natural sulphurisation of functionalised lipids. Selective cleavage of polysulphide linkages with MeLi/MeI led to formation of 3 -methylthiogammacerane, indicating that the gammacerane skeleton is primarily <b>bound</b> via <b>sulphur</b> at position 3, consistent with the idea that tetrahymanol (or the corresponding ketone) is the precursor for gammacerane. Second, upon mild artificial maturation of two sediments using hydrous pyrolysis, gammacerane is released from S-rich macromolecular aggregates by cleavage of the relatively weak C [...] -S bonds. The stable carbon isotopic compositions of gammacerane and lipids derived from primary producers and green sulphur bacteria in both the Miocene Gessoso-solfifera and Upper Jurassic Allgäu Formations indicate that gammacerane is derived from bacterivorous ciliates which were partially feeding on green sulphur bacteria. This demonstrates that anaerobic ciliates living at or below the chemocline are important sources for gammacerane, consistent with the fact that ciliates only biosynthesize tetrahymanol if their diet is deprived of sterols. This leads to the conclusion that gammacerane is an indicator for water column stratification, which solves two current enigmas in gammacerane geochemistry. Firstly, it explains why gammacerane is often found in sediments deposited under hypersaline conditions but is not necessarily restricted to this type of deposits. Secondly, it explains why lacustrine deposits may contain abundant gammacerane since most lakes in the temperate climatic zones are stratified during summer...|$|R

40|$|The use of sodium-thiosulfate (Na-thiosulfate) as a reagent for the {{extraction}} of mercury (Hg) from soil was investigated. High organic matter content in soil {{plays a major role}} in retaining metals. It has previously been reported that using the cold vapour atomic absorption method, powerful reagents such as EDTA, DTPA and cysteine could not release Hg from soil samples. The optimal conditions for using Na-thiosulfate to extract soil-Hg are presented here. Our results show that 50 +/- 5 % of total Hg was extracted from soil samples using 0. 01 mol L- 1 of the reagent without pH adjustment. Increasing the reagent concentration above this level showed no significant change in Hg extraction. From this extraction three fractions of Hg were obtained, the labile, slowly labile and un-extractable. We further applied the use of a kinetic extraction approach that has never been applied for Hg. We observed a correlation between the first two fractions and the quantity of organic matter content in soils. The labile fraction could be released by using any concentration of the reagent. However, the slowly labile fraction was dependent on time and increased concentrations of Na-thiosulfate. Furthermore, our results suggest that the labile and slowly labile fractions involve two different sites of reduced sulphur groups contained in soil organic matter and Hg levels present in the soil samples did not appear high enough to saturate all these high affinity sulphur sites. The capacity of Na-thiosulfate to reduce (Hg(II)) to (Hg(0)), was determined to be negligible. Our results further suggest the implication of iron (Fe(II)) for reducing Hg(II) to Hg(0).

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} sulphur-containing products from Curie-point pyrolysis (Py) of eighty-five samples (kerogens, bitumen, and petroleum asphaltenes and coals) using gas chromatography (GC) in combination with sulphur-selective detection. Peak areas of approximately forty individual organic sulphur pyrolysis products (OSPP) were measured, and the results analysed {{with the aid of}} multivariate data reduction techniques (principal components analysis, (PCA)). The structural relationships proposed in an earlier publication (et al., 1989 a) in which OSPP can be grouped according to common 'carbon skeletons' are supported by PCA. The distribution of OSPP varies both as a function of kerogen type (as defined by elemental composition) and maturity, reflecting differences in the relative abundance of the various carbon skeleton types. Sulphur-containing products from Type I, Type II, and, to some extent, Type II-S kerogens are dominated by OSPP derived from 'moieties' (i. e., discrete structural components within the macromolecule) possessing linear carbon skeletons, while coals and Type III kerogens give rise to higher relative abundances of OSPP with branched carbon skeletons. Type I kerogens are distinguished from Type II kerogens due to the type of linear carbon skeleton, the former yielding higher relative amounts of 2 -n-alkylthiophenes and thiolanes and the latter 2, 5 -di-substituted sulphur-containing products. Products from sulphur-rich (Type II-S) kerogens differ by higher relative abundances of OSPP derived from precursors with isoprenoid and/or steroidal side-chain carbon skeletons, and by higher absolute abundances of all OSPP. Petroleum and, to a lesser extent, bitumen asphaltenes give rise to OSPP with longer carbon skeletons than do kerogens or coals. This observation supports the models proposed by et al. (1990 a) in which sulphur-containing moieties in asphaltenes are bound by fewer intermolecular bridges (i. e., are less extensively cross-linked) and, consequently, more readily yield longer chain products on pyrolysis. From these observations, we suggest that Py-GC in combination with PCA provides useful information concerning the chemical nature of organically <b>bound</b> <b>sulphur</b> in geomacromolecules.

Commercially grown, 2 -cane and 4 -cane Sauvignon blanc vines were used with a row orientation of north-south. Two exposure treatments were imposed in the following manner: complete leaf removal was undertaken in the fruit zone and 50 % shade cloth was erected to give a uniform shading treatment to half the trial vines. Weekly thirty-berry and whole bunch samples were taken {{from each of the}} 32 plots {{with the exception of the}} veraison period when two samples per week were taken. Vine vigour was assessed using pruning and leaf area per vine data. Harvest occurred on different dates for 2 -cane and 4 -cane pruned vines so that fruit attained from both treatments had similar °Brix. Fruit was processed at the Lincoln University winery. Must analysis and wine analysis were undertaken. As expected, 4 -cane vines had almost double the yield of 2 -cane vines. Higher crop load significantly reduced leaf area per shoot and shoot thickness. Lower leaf area to fruit ratio for 4 -cane berries resulted in delayed onset of veraison and slowed the rate of sugar accumulation. Crop load, which limited leaf area to fruit ratio, appeared to be the dominant factor in determining timing of grape physiological ripeness as expressed by °Brix over other factors such as fruit exposure. Malic acid, tartaric acid, IPMP (iso-propylmethoxypyrazine) and IBMP (iso-butyl-methoxypyrazine) were lower at equivalent °Brix in 4 -cane compared with 2 -cane berries. Significantly higher concentrations of quercetin were found in exposed compared to shaded berries. Must analysis showed a significant influence of crop load on berry titratable acidity and pH, reflecting berry ripening results. Exposure significantly increased the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds in 4 -cane must yet showed no influence on 2 -cane must. After wine processing lower malic acid concentrations in wines made from 100 % exposed fruit became evident in lower wine titratable acidity but showed no influence on wine pH.

40|$|Mössbauer {{spectroscopy}} of iron (II) (N, N′‐Dicyclohexylthiourea) 6 (ClO 4) 2 {{shows the}} existence of two isomers. At low temperatures (T 3 ̆c 200 °K) a form A with quadrupole splitting ΔE = 3. 31 mm∕sec is stable. At and above room temperature a form B with ΔE = 1. 32 mm∕sec is stable. For 200 °K 3 ̆c T 3 ̆c 300 °K both forms are observed with the B∕A ratio increasing with increasing temperature. The values of ΔE are typical of Fe 2 + with an orbital singlet and an orbital doublet ground state for A and B, respectively. The isomer shift and magnetic susceptibility results indicate that both forms of the molecule contain high‐spin ferrous ions. Infrared spectra show that in both forms in the iron is <b>bound</b> to the <b>sulphur</b> atoms {{of each of the}} six dicyclohexylthiourea ligands. Mössbauer spectra in external magnetic fields show that the sign of the principal component of the electric field gradient is negative for form A and positive for form B, and that the asymmetry parameter of the electric field gradient tensor is negligible in both forms. The only consistent interpretation of all the results outlined above is in terms of a trigonally distorted octahedral coordination of the Fe 2 + for both isomers. In form A, the distortion is such that the prolately deformed (t 02 g) orbital is lowest while in form B the oblately deformed degenerate pair (t+ 2 g) and t- 2 g are lowest. The foregoing suggest a low symmetry ligand field component (Δ) of variable sign, going from a compression (Δ 3 ̆e 0) along the trigonal axis at low T to an elongation (Δ 3 ̆c 0) at higher temperatures. The transition is discussed in terms of perturbations of the coordination sphere possibly induced by temperature dependent changes in the hydrogen bonding to the perchlorate anions...|$|R
