50|$|<b>Black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ants</b> often {{explore their}} {{surroundings}} quite extensively during early summer months {{in an effort}} to increase the food supply to their queen and her young, and also as a way of testing new ground in preparation for the nests' summer flight. In some cases, these explorations lead to a burrowing through mortar and brick.|$|R
50|$|Lasius neglectus is a polygynous, {{sometimes}} invasive, ant of {{the genus}} Lasius. The ant was identified in 1990 after establishing a colony in Budapest, Hungary. Superficially, they are similar in appearance to the common <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius niger, but have significantly different behavioural patterns, particularly in the social structure within colonies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger), {{also known}} as the common black ant, is a {{formicine}} ant, the type species of the subgenus Lasius, found all over Europe and in some parts of North America, South America and Asia. The European species was split into two species; L. niger is found in open areas, while L. platythorax is found in forest habitats. It is monogynous, meaning colonies have a single queen.|$|E
5000|$|Lasius is a genus of {{formicine}} ants. [...] The type {{species for}} this genus is the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius niger. Other major members, which live in drier heathland, are the cornfield ant, L. neoniger, and L. alienus. Other species include the temporary social parasites of the L. mixtus {{group and the}} hyper-social parasite Lasius fuliginosus. Lasius flavus is also a commonly seen species, building grassy hillocks in undisturbed pasture. In the Alps, these mounds - always aligned east to catch the first rays of the rising sun - have been traditionally used by goatherds as natural compasses.|$|E
5000|$|Midden {{formation}} in insects was first observed in <b>Black</b> <b>Garden</b> <b>Ants,</b> Lasius niger. The middens {{created by the}} ants are called [...] "kitchen middens" [...] and are composed of food scraps, ant corpses, and other detritus. A reason for the behavior {{has yet to be}} determined though it is thought to serve as a feeding ground for larvae.|$|R
500|$|Ants {{climb the}} host plants and {{feed on the}} {{honeydew}} secreted by the aphids. Many species of ants have developed behaviours {{to enable them to}} protect and encourage their aphids. <b>Black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ants</b> (Lasius niger), for example, remove predators such as ladybirds from the vicinity of aphids, thus keeping their [...] "milch cows" [...] safe. On a test plot of field beans (Vicia faba), plants without black bean aphids yielded an average of 56 seeds per plant, those with aphids and no ants yielded 17 seeds, and those with both ants and aphids averaged eight seeds per plant.|$|R

40|$|The {{selective}} {{forces that}} shape and maintain eusocial societies are an enduring puzzle in evolutionary biology. Ordinarily sterile workers can usually reproduce {{given the right}} conditions, so the factors regulating reproductive division of labour may provide insight into why eusociality has persisted over evolutionary time. Queen-produced pheromones that affect worker reproduction have been implicated in diverse taxa, including ants, termites, wasps and possibly mole rats, but to date have only been definitively identified in the honeybee. Using the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius niger, we isolate the first sterility-regulating ant queen pheromone. The pheromone is a cuticular hydrocarbon that comprises {{the majority of the}} chemical profile of queens and their eggs, and also affects worker behaviour, by reducing aggression towards objects bearing the pheromone. We further show that the pheromone elicits a strong response in worker antennae and that its production by queens is selectively reduced following an immune challenge. These results suggest that the pheromone has a central role in colony organization and support the hypothesis that worker sterility represents altruistic self-restraint in response to an honest quality signal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMany animals avoid {{attack from}} predators through {{toxicity}} or the emission of repellent chemicals. Defensive mimicry has evolved in many species to deceive shared predators, {{for instance through}} colouration and other morphological adaptations, but mimicry hardly ever seems to involve multi-trait similarities. Here we report on a wingless parasitoid wasp that exhibits a full spectrum of traits mimicing ants and affording protection against ground-dwelling predators (wolf spiders). In body size, morphology and movement Gelis agilis (Ichneumonidae) is highly similar to the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger) that shares the same habitat. When threatened, G. agilis also emits a volatile chemical {{that is similar to}} an ant-produced chemical that repels spiders. In bioassays with L. niger, G. agilis, G. areator, Cotesia glomerata and Drosophila melanogaster, ants and G. agilis were virtually immune to spider attack, in contrast the other species were not. Volatile characterisation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified G. agilis emissions as 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, a known insect defence semiochemical that acts as an alarm pheromone in ants. We argue that multi-trait mimicry, as observed in G. agilis, might be much more common among animals than currently realized...|$|E
40|$|Honeydew is the {{keystone}} upon which ants and aphids build their mutualistic relationship. We have investigated how sugar and volatile compounds from honeydew {{are involved in}} the discovery, the recognition and the exploitation of aphid colonies by the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius niger. In addition to semiochemicals produced by aphids, honeydew volatile compounds are used by ant scouts to orient themselves and distantly recognize myrmecophilous species. Once discovered, aphid colonies producing sugars which are the most beneficial to the ants are preferentially tended. In this respect, the ways each sugar acts upon the feeding behavior of ant foragers and triggers the laying of a recruitment trail are essential to understand how their collective exploitation of aphid colonies proceeds and why mutualistic interactions between ants and aphids are maintained. Sensitivity of ant scouts to honeydew sugars was also investigated. Dose-response curves revealed between-sugar differences with foragers being very sensitive even to small amounts of melezitose, a sugar specifically produced by aphid colonies. We discuss about the relevance of honeydew cues used by ants in the selection of sugary resources, the recognition of their honeydew-producing partners {{as well as in the}} assessment of size and nutritive value of exploited aphid colonies.

40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} {{benefits for}} social insect colonies headed by polyandrous queens have received intense attention, whereas sexual selection remains little explored. Yet mates {{of the same}} queen may engage in sperm competition over the siring of offspring, and this could confer benefits on queens if the most successful sire in each colony (the majority sire) produces gynes (daughter queens) of higher quality. These benefits could be increased if high-quality sires make queens increase the percentage of eggs that they fertilize (unfertilized eggs develop into sons in social hymenopterans), or if daughters of better genetic quality are over-represented in the gyne versus worker class. Such effects would lead to female-biased sex ratios in colonies with high-quality majority gynes. I tested these ideas in field colonies of Lasius niger <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ants,</b> using body mass of gynes as a fitness trait {{as it is known}} to correlate with future fecundity. Also, I established the paternity of gynes through microsatellite DNA offspring analyses. Majority sires did not always produce heavier gynes in L. niger, but whenever they did do so colonies produced more females, numerically {{and in terms of the}} energetic investment in female versus male production. Better quality sires may be able to induce queens to fertilize more eggs or so-called caste shunting may occur wherever the daughters of better males are preferentially shunted to into the gyne caste. My study supports that integrating sexual selection and social evolutionary studies may bring a deeper understanding of mating system evolution in social insects...|$|R
40|$|The {{myrmecophilous}} isopod Platyarthrus hofffmannseggii Brandt, 1833 and the myrmecophilous springtail Cyphoderus albinus Nicolet, 1842 {{are commonly}} found in nests {{of a wide range}} of ant species in Belgium. Here we report the first record of both myrmecophiles in nests of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus in the Citadelpark of Ghent, Belgium. Platyarthrus hoffmannseggii was found in two of the Lasius neglectus nests studied. In one of the two C. albinus was also discovered. In the localities where the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus was introduced, as is also the case in the Citadelpark in Ghent, it out-competes all native ant species. This ant has a dramatic effect on the local native ant fauna. However, some of the myrmecophilous species associated with the native ant-fauna are less threatened as they are accepted by this invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant...</b>|$|R

40|$|The mutualistic {{relationships}} between certain ant and aphid species are well known, the primary benefits being {{protection for the}} aphids and carbohydrate-rich honeydew for the ants. Questions remain, however, as to the exact semiochemical factors that establish and maintain such relationships. In this study we used a series of treatments and associated controls placed {{at the end of}} a two-way olfactometer to determine the degree of attractiveness of a complete plant-aphid-honeydew system as well as individual components of that system. Both the olfactometer branch selected by the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> (Lasius niger), and the linear speed with which ants moved through the device, were measured. Study results showed that ants were attracted not just to the complete plant system and the honeydew itself, but also to the microbial flora in the absence of plant or honeydew, and specifically to a bacterium from the black bean aphid (Aphis fabae) honeydew, Staphylococcus xylosus. This bacterium produces a blend of semiochemicals that attract the ant scouts. This information suggests the presence of a naturally-occurring, reliable biotic cue for detection of potential aphid partners. This would have to be confirmed in natural conditions by further field experiments. Rather than being opportunistic species that coincidentally colonize a sugar-rich environment, microorganisms living in aphid honeydew may be able to alter emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), thus significantly mediating partner attraction. A bacterial involvement in this mutualistic relationship could alter the manner in which these and similar relationships are viewed and evaluated. Future studies into mutualism stability and function among macroscopic partners will likely need to transition from a two-partner perspective to a multiple-partner perspective, and consider the microbial component, with the potential for one or more taxa making significant contributions to the relationshipPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} insect life history and behavioural decisions and underlying cellular biochemistry, with particular focus on bethylid parasitoid wasps in the genus Goniozus. This comprises the first major body of work attempting to draw links between the underlying metabolome of an organism and its behaviour. This thesis further optimised the first known example of a combined LC-MS and NMR metabolomic approach capable of analysing extremely low biomass samples (< 1 mg), a vital requirement when studying the behaviour of individual organisms. Part 1 of this thesis details the optimisation and validation of this metabolomic approach, whilst also examining the effects of aging on the metabolome of adult Goniozus wasps. Part 2 applies this approach {{to examine the effects}} of diet, host species and host aging on Goniozus wasp behaviour and biochemistry. Comparisons of the metabolomes of starved and honey fed wasps indicate that G. legneri is capable of utilising a carbohydrate rich diet as an energy source. Aged honey fed wasps possessed higher levels of large storage lipids, such as tri- and diacylglycerides, than starved wasps of the same age. Metabolomic analysis also detected a legacy effect on the metabolome of G. legneri associated with differences in the species of host each wasp was reared on. A similar legacy effect was confirmed when examining the metabolomes of wasps reared on artificially aged hosts. Whilst Goniozus wasp oviposition behaviour was altered by the species of host presented, no links between changes in a wasp’s metabolome and its resulting contest behaviour were found. Part 3 of this thesis {{examines the}} morphological, behavioural and chemical mimicry of another wasp, the hyperparasitoid Gelis agilis. G. agilis demonstrated an enhanced predation avoidance rate compared with control species, similar to that of the <b>black</b> <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius niger. Agitation of G. agilis also resulted in the chemical emission of a known ant alarm pheromone...|$|E
40|$|The {{expansion}} {{process of}} the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant,</b> Lasius neglectus in Europe and Asia is described in terms of: a) local expansion through colony growing measured on four supercolonies (Seva, Debrecen, Buda Castle and Budattny) from two distant and climatically different countries (Spain, Hungary), and b) regional expansion, using data from all published and several new non-native localities. Short, local distance processes (few meters to 89 m year- 1), as colony budding, are two to five orders of magnitude smaller than long regional distances (ten km to > 1000 km). This suggests direct human intervention in the invasive spread. The regional trend also shows that the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> has been quickly and steadily {{increasing the number of}} non native localities (77) and countries (14) it has reached during the last 30 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{invasive}} <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> Lasius neglectus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) {{has been}} spreading rapidly in Europe {{ever since the}} 1990 s. This ant established enormous supercolonies in many European cities and poses {{a serious threat to}} the local native faunas. The spread of this species has not slowed down in the last decades, but in the recent years the sizes of the known L. neglectus populations have generally been declining or have stagnated, or they sometimes have disappeared entirely. Only rarely have they increased. In this paper, we summarize these monitoring data collected by the private, diligent monitoring activities of myrmecologists on populations of the invasive <b>garden</b> <b>ant</b> in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Spain. The reasons for this collapse are thought to be: (1) depletion of the local resources, (2) gradation of pathogens and (social) parasites, (3) climatic factors, (4) intra-population mechanisms, (5) confrontation with highly competitive native species, (6) and lack of suitable nesting microhabitats. As similar phenomena were observed in the cases of supercolonies of other invasive ant species, it seems that they decline more generally than has been thought...|$|R
