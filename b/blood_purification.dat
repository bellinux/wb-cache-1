CVCs have historically been extensively used in hemodynamic monitoring, tumor therapy, <b>blood</b> liquid <b>purification,</b> infusion and parenteral nutrition support. However, CVC use can cause a variety of complications. The most common complication is catheter-related blood-stream infections (CRBSIs) [1]. The International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) studied medical-surgical ICUs and found that the pooled rate of CRBSIs in China was 4.1 / 1000 central line-days, which was approximately 5 times higher than the rate of 0.8 / 1000 central line-days found in comparable US ICUs [2]. However, in 2631 cases across 7 ICUs, the estimated CRBSI rate was 7.66 / 1000 in August 2008 and July 2010 in four Chinese hospitals [3]. The cost per infection has been estimated to range from $ 34, 508 to $ 56, 000, and the annual cost of caring for patients with CRBSIs is $ 296 million to $ 2.3 billion in Spain [4].

40|$|In a {{wide variety}} of {{applications}} such as waste water treatment, biological reactors, gas-liquid reactors, <b>blood</b> oxygenation, <b>purification</b> of liquids, etc., it is necessary to produce small bubbles in liquids. Since gravity plays an essential role in currently available techniques, the adaptation of these applications to space requires the development of new tools. Under normal gravity, bubbles are typically generated by forcing gas through an orifice in a liquid. When a growing bubble becomes large enough, the buoyancy dominates the surface tension force causing it to detach from the orifice. In space, the process is quite different and the bubble may remain attached to the orifice indefinitely. The most practical approach to simulating gravity seems to be imposing an ambient flow to force bubbles out of the orifice. In this paper, we are interested in the effect of an imposed flow in 0 and 1 g. Specifically, we investigate the process of bubble formation subject to a parallel and a cross flow. In the case of parallel flow, we have a hypodermic needle in a tube from which bubbles can be produced. On the other hand, the cross flow condition is established by forcing bubbles through an orifice on a wall in a shear flow.

Since lysozyme alone does not have antimicrobial activity against Vibrio anguillarum and Aeromonas salmonicida, a four-step protein purification protocol was used to isolate and identify antibacterial fractions from bacterially challenged coho salmon mucus and <b>blood.</b> The <b>purification</b> consisted of extraction with hot acetic acid, extraction and concentration on a C 18 cartridge, gel filtration, and reverse-phase chromatography on a C 18 column. N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses revealed that both the blood and the mucus antimicrobial fractions demonstrated identity with the N terminus of trout H 1 histone. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated {{the presence of the}} entire histone, as well as fragments thereof, including a 26 -amino-acid N-terminal segment.

50|$|The {{main idea}} behind viral {{processing}} {{is to stop}} the viruses in a given sample from contaminating the desired product. The two most widely used methods of viral processing are viral removal and viral inactivation. The former is a method in which all viruses are simply removed from the sample completely. The latter method {{is one in which}} the viruses may remain in the final product, but in a non-infective form. These techniques are used widely in the food and blood plasma industries, as those products can be harmed by the presence of viral particles. Some of the more common viruses removed by these methods are the HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses; hepatitis A, B, and C; and parvoviruses. The methods used in the plasma industry have been summarized (Horowitz B., Minor P., Morgenthaler J. J., Burnouf T., McIntosh R., Padilla A., Thorpe R. and van Aken W. G.

50|$|A {{wearable}} {{artificial kidney}} is a wearable dialysis machine {{that a person}} with end-stage kidney disease could use daily or even continuously. A wearable artificial kidney (WAK) is not available, but research teams {{are in the process}} of developing such a device. The goal is to develop a portable device that will be able to imitate the functions of the regular kidney. This device would allow for a patient to be treated twenty-four hours a day. With the development of miniature pumps, the idea of an effective wearable hemodialysis device has become more achievable. Many patients are already receiving a continuous peritoneal dialysis treatment which allows them to remain ambulatory. One of the problems with this treatment is that only a small portion of dialysis patients use peritoneal dialysis as their method of treatment because it requires large amounts of dialysate to be stored and disposed of throughout the treatment. In a healthy individual the kidneys filter blood for roughly 168 hours a week compared to an individual with end-stage renal disease whose treatment plan is to be on dialysis for approximately 12 hours a week. This treatment is inadequate and results in a lower quality of life as well as a high mortality rate for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Therefore, there is a need for an around-the-clock device that will allow ESRD patients to be administered higher doses of dialysis continuously while still maintaining a normal life. The FDA has approved the first human clinical trial in the United States for a wearable artificial kidney designed by <b>Blood</b> <b>Purification</b> Technologies Inc. of Beverly Hills, California. The present prototype of the WAK is a 10-pound device, powered by nine-volt batteries, which connects to a patient via a catheter, and should use less than 500mL of dialysate. It is designed to run continuously on batteries which will allow patients to be ambulatory when wearing the device ultimately leading to a greater quality of life.The device is also designed to make improvement in other physiological aspects of the patient’s health such as improvement in volume control, a decrease in hypertension and sodium retention, as well as a decreased chance of developing cardiovascular disease and stroke.|$|E

The lower limits of detection of these systems were established against the WHO international standards for HBV DNA and were found to be 1. 43, 82, and 9 IU/ml, respectively. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation of plasma samples (1 to 6 log 10 IU/ml) ranged between 0. 05 to 8. 34 % and 0. 16 to 3. 48 % for the Abbott PCR, 1. 53 to 26. 85 % and 0. 50 to 12. 89 % for artus-DB, and 0. 29 to 7. 42 % and 0. 94 to 3. 01 % for artus-DSP, respectively. Ninety HBV clinical samples were used for comparison of assays, and paired quantitative results showed strong correlation by linear regression analysis (artus-DB with Abbott PCR, r = 0. 95; Abbott PCR with artus-DSP, r = 0. 97; and artus-DSP with artus-DB, r = 0. 94). Bland-Altman analysis showed a good level of agreement for Abbott PCR and artus-DSP, with a mean difference of 0. 10 log 10 IU/ml and limits of agreement of − 0. 91 to 1. 11 log 10 IU/ml. No genotype-specific bias was seen in all three systems for HBV genotypes A, C, and D, which are predominant in this region. This finding illustrates that the Abbott real-time HBV and artus-DSP systems show more comparable performance than the artus-DB system, meeting the current guidelines for assays {{to be used in the}} management of hepatitis B...|$|R
