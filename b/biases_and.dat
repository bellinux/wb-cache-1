Studies have internal validity when, random error apart, reported differences between exposed and unexposed individuals can be attributed only to the exposure under investigation. Internal validity may be affected by bias, that is, by any systematic error that occurs in the design or in the conduction of a clinical research. Here we focus on two major categories of bias: selection <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> information <b>bias.</b> We describe three types of selection biases (incidence-prevalence <b>bias,</b> loss-to-follow-up <b>bias,</b> <b>and</b> publication <b>bias)</b> <b>and</b> a series of information biases (i. e. misclassification bias [...] recall bias, interviewer <b>bias,</b> observer <b>bias,</b> <b>and</b> regression dilution <b>bias</b> [...] <b>and</b> lead-time <b>bias...</b>|$|R

Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited <b>biases</b> <b>and</b> stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the human}} {{forecaster}} {{was responsible for}} generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations. Today, human input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters, such as model <b>biases</b> <b>and</b> performance. Using a consensus of forecast models, as well as ensemble members of the various models, can help reduce forecast error. However, regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system, large errors within any particular piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run. Humans are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the end user. Humans can use knowledge of local effects that may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast. While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans {{may no longer be}} needed in the forecast process {{at some point in the}} future, there is currently still a need for human intervention.|$|E
5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion Torrent PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} <b>biases</b> <b>and</b> bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E

40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} the joint development between implicit approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> early adolescent alcohol use, and examined whether {{the link between}} approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use was moderated by working memory (WM). Methods: The current study used data from a 2 -year, 4 -wave online sample of 378 Dutch early adolescents (mean age 14. 9 years, 64. 8 % female). First, using latent growth curve modeling, we examined trajectories of approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use over time. Second, we examined relations between baseline approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> WM {{and the development of}} alcohol use. Third, we examined the joint development of approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use. Fourth, we examined whether the nature of this joint development varied for different levels of WM. Results: Unconditional growth curve model analyses indicated that the functional forms of alcohol use <b>and</b> cognitive <b>bias</b> were best captured by quadratic and linear trajectories, respectively. We found that cognitive bias decreased over time. We found no significant relations between baseline predictors and observed increases in alcohol use. We found relations between the intercepts, but not to growth factors, in the joint development of alcohol use <b>and</b> approach <b>bias.</b> WM was not found to moderate relations between growth in approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use in this sample. Conclusions: While we observed evidence of association between approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use at baseline, {{there was no evidence of}} relations between development trajectories of the two. These findings replicate prior research demonstrating a role of implicit approach bias in predicting early adolescent alcohol use but do not demonstrate, in a light drinking early adolescent sample, the importance of interrelations between changes in approach <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> alcohol use over time, or a moderating role of WM. It is important to consider the potential consequences of repeated online approach bias assessment (e. g., changes in stimulus valence) when interpreting these results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{different}} discretization techniques {{can be expected}} to affect the classification <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> variance of naive-Bayes classifiers. We call such an effect discretization <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> variance. Proportional kinterval discretization (PKID) tunes discretization <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> variance by adjusting discretized interval size and number proportional to the number of training instances. Theoretical analysis suggests that this is desirable for naive-Bayes classifiers. However PKID is sub-optimal when learning from training data of small size. We argue that this is because PKID equally weighs <b>bias</b> reduction <b>and</b> variance reduction. But for small data, variance reduction can contribute more to lower learning error and thus should be given greater weight than bias reduction. Accordingly we propose weighted proportional k-interval discretization (WPKID), which establishes a more suitable <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> variance trade-off for small data while allowing additional training data to be used to reduce both <b>bias</b> <b>and</b> variance. Our experiments demonstrate that for naive-Bayes classifiers, WPKID improves upon PKID for smaller datasets 1 with significant frequency; and WPKID delivers lower classification error significantly more often than not in comparison to three other leading alternative discretization techniques studied. ...|$|R
