25|$|The Madonna {{was first}} {{restored}} in 1905. By then the statue's core was riddled with woodworm tunnels {{and threatened to}} collapse. The restorers carefully wrapped the statue in a plaster cast, insufflated the cavities to remove <b>bore</b> <b>dust,</b> impregnated them with insecticides and finally filled them {{with a mixture of}} glue, chalk and water, turning the figure around repeatedly in the process so as to reach every nook and angle. The surface holes were then sealed with bolts of oak. The restoration cost a total of 3,200 Goldmarks, part of which was paid by the Prussian state.|$|E
40|$|This bachelor's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to using wood in wine-making. Firstly, is focused on chemical composition of wood and its physical parametres, its individual components in particular. There are described types of woods mostly used in viticulture and its consecutive utilisation at coopery. An individual chapter {{is dedicated to}} coopery where are described: technological manufacturing of timber, burning out the barrels {{and its effect on}} the change of their chemical characteristics as well as analysing the barrels as means to wine fertilisation and wine ripening. There is also mentioned individually the barrique-type barrels and barrels for ageing of special (mostly fortified) wines. In this connection possible diseases and flaws of wines connected to ageing in wooden barrels are described. The following chapter focuses on using preparations replacing barrique barrels which also add oak and vanilla shades to wine such as wooden chippings, desks and oak <b>bore</b> <b>dust.</b> A special attention is paid to corks, their production, types and effect on wine while ageing in bottles. The end of this thesis dealt with using tannins extracted from timber which are recently becoming very popular...|$|E
40|$|Arhopolus tristis attacks logs, stumps, and standing, dead {{or dying}} pine (Pinus) trees, {{primarily}} the main stem {{as well as}} branches above 60 mm diameter. Particularly heavy infestations occur in trees damaged by fire. Early larval stages feed in the inner phloem, leaving irregular trails of compacted red-brown <b>bore</b> <b>dust.</b> In heavily attacked, fire-damaged trees, the phloem zone can be completely destroyed from below ground level to above 6 metres (Fig. 2). Later larval stages usually make tunnels in the outer sapwood, mostly parallel with the grain. The depth of penetration varies with the population density {{as well as with}} the age and condition of the host material. Tunnels have been recorded to a depth of 100 mm in the wood 4 months after initial attack. Beetles also contribute to the devaluation of logs by vectoring sapstain-causing fungi such as Ophiostoma spp. Hosts Eight species of pine (mainly Pinus radiata) have been recorded as hosts in New Zealand. Occasionally, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsugo menziesii) and larch (Larix decidua) are attacked. Records from eucalypts probably refer to beetles merely sheltering under bark rather than real attack. In Europe, Norway spruce (Picea abies) is a common host...|$|E

Overwintering adults construct egg tunnels for brood 1 in June, and {{a second set of}} tunnels in late July for brood 2. Some members of brood 1 emerge as adults in late July and construct additional tunnels, while others overwinter as mature larvae and emerge as adults in July, along with another segment of the population that has overwintered as early larvae. A smaller bark beetle often found in spruce is the foureyed spruce bark beetle Polygraphus rufipennis Kirby.|$|R
50|$|Dogwood twig borer adults {{emerge in}} early June, rarely in large numbers. They feed on dogwood twigs and cause {{girdling}} around {{the tips of}} branches. Females lay their eggs singly on healthy twigs. When the eggs hatch, larvae enter the twig and bore down into the centre. Parts of the twig are sometimes internally separated from the dogwood {{as a series of}} closely packed holes are drilled to remove the <b>boring</b> <b>dust</b> (frass). The beetle larvae winter in the stems. Some larvae continue to develop for up to two years. Larvae that pupate during the spring usually emerge from the stem between the middle of May and early June. Dogwood twig borer larvae are sometimes called Elm twig girdlers.|$|R

5000|$|In tanoaks, {{the disease}} may be {{recognized}} by wilting new shoots, older leaves becoming pale green, and {{after a period of}} two to three weeks, foliage turning brown while clinging to the branches. Dark brown sap may stain the lower trunk's bark. Bark may split and exude gum, with visible discoloration. After the tree dies back, suckers try to sprout the next year, but their tips soon bend and die. Ambrosia beetles (Monarthrum scutellare) will most likely infest a dying tree during midsummer, producing piles of fine white dust near tiny holes. Later, bark beetles (Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis) produce fine, red <b>boring</b> <b>dust.</b> Small black domes, the fruiting bodies of the Hypoxylon fungus, may also be present on the bark. Leaf death may occur {{more than a year after}} the initial infection and months after the tree has been girdled by beetles.|$|R
6000|$|First, as I said, the {{subterranean}} steam would blast a <b>bore.</b> The <b>dust</b> and stones, rasped and blasted out of {{that hole}} would be spread about the sea-bottom as an ash-bed sloping away round the hole; then the molten lava would rise in the bore, and flow out over the ashes and the sea-bottom--perhaps in one direction, perhaps all round. [...] Then, usually, the volcano, having vented itself, would be quieter for a time, till the heat accumulated below, and more ash was blasted out, making a second ash-bed; and then would follow a second lava flow. Thus are produced the alternate beds of lava and ash which are so common.|$|R
40|$|Megaplatypus mutatus Chapuis (Coleoptera: Platypodidae) (Fig. 1), {{an exotic}} insect {{introduced}} from the neotropical region, is an emerging pest in Southern Italy (Tremblay et al., 2000; Allegro & Griffo, 2008). The platypodid beetle {{is a primary}} and polyphagous pest infesting only healthy standing trees of several botanical species (Corylus, Prunus, Juglans, Pyrus, Malus, Populus, etc.); cut wood or “sick” trees are not colonized. M. mutatus is a xylomicetophagous species (=Ambrosia beetle). In Campania it may cause dramatic damages, especially in commercial plantations of Populus nigra. Male platypodid infest new trees primarily in late spring: coarse <b>boring</b> <b>dust</b> can be observed on attacked trees, which usually exude sap through the entrance holes. Females join the males soon after a successful attack and complete most of the typical galleries, excavated on a transversal plane through the xylem, as they lay eggs. The young larvae feed on symbiontic fungus and the last instant also on wood, boring each a vertical pupal chamber. Economic losses in poplar woods are due to stem fracture caused {{by the presence of}} parental gallery systems, the massive diffusion of the fungi in the xylem and wood alteration (Fig. 2). From a poplar wood infested by M. mutatus in Campania (Fig. 3), a fungus responsible of a chromatic wood alteration has been identified. Wall tissues from M. mutatus galleries coated with a firm mycelium were sampled (Fig. 4, 5). Several fungal colonies with a red mycelium and a strong coloration on PDA have been isolated. All the red strains belong to the genus Verticillium spp. (Fig. 6). The fungus establish a physical contamination with the platypodid and are massively present in the brood galleries. To our knowledge, this is a new association and up to now the possible role of this relationship is unknown. A typical symbiontic species recorded for M. mutatus in Argentina is an ascomycota of the genus Raffaelea (Jones & Blackwell, 1998; Gebhardt & Oberwinkler, 2005). Differences in environmental conditions and in ecological interactions may explain the presence of Verticillium spp. in the galleries of M. mutatus on poplar in Campania. Biological investigations in order to characterize the beetle-fungus association are in progress...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{fabrication}} {{process has been}} described {{for the development of}} a hollow stainless steel microneedle array using femto second laser micromachining. Using this method, a complicated microstructure can be fabricated in a single process step without using masks. The mechanical stability of the fabricated microneedle array was measured for axial and transverse loading. Skin histology was carried out to study the microneedle penetration into the rat skin. Fluid flow through the microneedle array was studied for different inlet pressures. The packaging of the microneedle array, to protect the microneedle <b>bore</b> blockage from <b>dust</b> and other atmospheric contaminations, was also considered. Finally, the microneedle array was tested and studied in vivo for insulin delivery to a diabetic rat. The results obtained were compared with the standard subcutaneous delivery with the same dose rate and were found to be in good agreement...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 Behavioral {{responses}} {{exhibited by}} the Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, to various attractant sources were investigated under both laboratory and field conditions. Tests were designed to observe olfactory responses. Results were correlated and compared with collections from sampling nets and with emergence patterns. Field data were collected during the flight seasons of 1962, 1963, and 1964. Laboratory tests revealed that the attractant produced by females boring in both host and non-host logs arrested adult beetles. Crawling beetles did not exhibit a directed response to attractive materials without {{the presence of an}} air stream passing over the material toward the insect. Beetles crawling near to an attractant source were passively arrested. A histological study of both male and female digestive tracts indicated that the midgut may be the point of origin of the attractant material. Rapid changes in the appearance of the ventricular epithelium that occurred shortly after feeding indicated a disintegration of nucleated cells into the lumen. Since this phenomenon was much less pronounced in the male, it was thought to include more than simple digestive processes, and therefore be responsible for release of the attractant compound by the female. Differences in hindgut epithelium associated with feeding were not apparent. The occurrence of seasonal activities depends upon the time of spring emergence and is directly regulated by environmental conditions. The exact time of emergence depends upon climatic conditions during the period of development and maturation. The beetle is stimulated to flight by temperature and light, but later olfactory stimuli predominate in regulation of its flight. Field attraction by logs of various tree species, attack and subsequent brood development were studied. The finding that the unmated female produces an attractant while feeding on phloem of various tree species was confirmed. Attack and development varied between the different tree species. Response of field populations to attraction produced by reemerged females was less than response to virgin females. Significant responses were obtained using low concentrations of Douglas-fir oleoresin and pine oleoresin fractions. Largest responses occurred with 2 - 1 / 2 percent Douglas-fir oleoresin. Tests with fractions of pine oleoresin showed that alpha pinene was the most attractive constituent, followed by limonene. Tests confirmed that Douglas-fir beetles respond to fresh uninfested Douglas-fir logs. The freshness of cut definitely regulated the responses obtained. The sex ratio of two females to one male responding to oleoresin compounds and to fresh cut logs indicated the importance of oleoresin vapors in host selection, since the female initiates the gallery. Oleoresin functions as an attractant for the beetles in flight but at high concentrations repels crawling beetles. Investigations confirmed that the number of beetles attracted decreases immediately after mating. Those beetles mated early in the morning before flight had started remained nearly nonattractive all day, while check samples continued to show the expected diurnal pattern of response. Experiments with <b>boring</b> <b>dust</b> extracts collected in the laboratory and later tested in the field suggested the volatility of the attractive substance. Limited attraction to dust extracts collected in water as opposed to those collected in ethyl alcohol indicated that the attractant is too volatile to be retained in water...|$|R
