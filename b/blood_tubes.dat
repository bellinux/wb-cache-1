The {{aim of this study}} was to compare three plastic <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> with a standard glass <b>blood</b> collection <b>tube</b> and each plastic collection tube with the other two for possible additional tube-to- tube differences. Material and Methods: A total of 284 blood samples were obtained from 42 patients receiving warfarin during their routine controls, besides 29 healthy volunteers. Subgroup analyses were done according to health status. Results: Our study demonstrated that different <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> have a statistically significant influence on coagulation tests. The magnitude of the effect depends on the tube used. However most of the tests performed on samples obtained from any tube correlated significantly with results obtained from other tube samples. Conclusion: Although <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> with different brands or properties will have distinct effects on coagulation tests, the influence of these <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> may be relatively small to interfere with decision-making on dose prescription, therefore lack clinical importance.

40|$|Background: CD 21 is a 145 kDa {{membrane}} glycoprotein expressed {{mainly on}} B-cells and follicular dendritic cells. It {{is involved in}} activation, survival and proliferation of B-cells. CD 21 can be cleaved to give soluble CD 21 (sCD 21), which is constantly shed in healthy people whereas the level of sCD 21 is low in patients suffering from various autoimmune diseases. Methods: Blood was collected from 12 healthy donors into Heparin, EDTA and gel-separation tubes. Furthermore, plasma from 6 healthy donors was combined and EDTA or EGTA was subsequently added to analyze its influence on sCD 21 levels measured by ELISA. Results: Differences in sCD 21 levels were observed dependent on <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> used. sCD 21 levels measured by ELISA were significantly higher if heparin/gel containing tubes were used compared to EDTA <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes.</b> Upon addition of EDTA/EGTA to plasma drawn using Heparin <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes,</b> sCD 21 levels decrease to amounts found in EDTA-containing <b>blood</b> collection <b>tubes</b> suggesting calcium as the responsible factor rather than magnesium.

40|$|Background: Due to {{the high}} {{prevalence}} of hemolysis in specimens received from the emergency department (ED), several strategies have been proposed to improve sample quality, {{but none of these}} seem effective to overcome the problem. In a preliminary study we showed that the use of S-Monovette blood collection system was effective to lower the risk of hemolysis in venous blood samples collected from intravenous catheters. This study was hence aimed to verify whether the replacement of a conventional vacuum system with S-Monovette may be effective to reduce the bur-den of hemolysis in the daily practice of a large urban ED. Materials and methods: The study was divided in two observational periods of 4 months each. In the former period, blood was collected from intravenous catheters using BD Vacutainer SST II Plus plastic serum tubes, whereas in the latter period the blood was drawn from intravenous catheters using S-Monovette <b>blood</b> <b>tubes</b> in aspiration mode.

40|$|Introduction: Although serum-providing <b>blood</b> <b>tubes</b> with {{a barrier}} are still widely used {{due to their}} {{significant}} advantages, the use of <b>blood</b> <b>tubes</b> with a barrier to provide plasma is becoming widespread. We compared 22 analytes in a BD Vacutainer® Barricor LH Plasma tube for local clinical validation of this new lithium heparin tube with a barrier. Materials and methods: Samples from 44 volunteers were collected in different tubes (Becton Dickinson and Company) : Z tube without additive (reference), clot-activator tube with gel (SST), lithium heparin tube without gel (LiH), and lithium heparin tube with barrier (Barricor). Analyte concentrations in different tubes were compared with the reference tube. All tubes were also evaluated according to additional testing (different centrifugation durations, blood-sampling techniques and individual differences). Results: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), glucose (Glc), potassium (K), lactate dehydrogenase (LD), sodium (Na), and total protein (TP) had a significant bias in Barricor (9. 19 %, - 3. 24 %, - 4. 88 %, 21. 60 %, - 0. 40 %, 5. 03 %, respectively) relative to the reference tube. There was no statistical difference between different centrifugation durations and individual differences for AST, K and LD in LiH and/or Barricor (P > 0. 05). There was a significant bias for LD between LiH and Barricor in terms of blood-sampling techniques (21. 2 % and 12. 4 %, respectively). Conclusions: Recently, the use of plasma has become prominent due to some of its advantages. In this study, plasma AST, K, LD, Glc and TP levels in Barricor were clinically different in comparison to serum. The results of additional tests showed that higher levels of LD in Barricor did not result from haemolysis, and they {{might be related to}} other factors including number of platelets, cellular fragility, or functional environment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Biomaterials in {{the form}} of {{implants}} (sutures, bone plates, joint replacements, etc.) and medical devices (pacemakers, artificial hearts, <b>blood</b> <b>tubes,</b> etc.) are widely used to replace and/or restore the function of traumatized or degenerated tissues or organs, and thus {{improve the quality of life}} of the patients. The first and foremost requirement for the choice of the biomaterial is its acceptability by the human body. A biomaterial used for implant should possess some important properties in order to long-term usage in the body without rejection. The most common classes of materials used as biomedical materials are Metals, Polymers, Ceramics, and Composite. These four classes are used singly and in combination to form most of the implantation devices available today. This review should be of value to researchers who are interested in the state of the art of biomaterial evaluation and selection of biomaterials...|$|E

30|$|To {{minimize}} {{the degradation of}} RNA and changes in gene expression patterns, improved alternatives for collecting human blood specimens have been developed (Chai et al. 2005). For instance, PaxGene <b>Blood</b> RNA <b>tubes</b> (PAXgene, PreAanlytix, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) containing RNA stabilizing reagents are used to collect and store blood samples prior to RNA isolation.

40|$|Background: Patient {{and sample}} {{misidentification}} may cause significant harm or discomfort to the patients, especially when incorrect data {{is used for}} performing specific healthcare activities. It is hence obvious that efficient and quality care can only start from accurate patient identification. There are many opportunities for misidentification in healthcare and laboratory medicine, including homonymy, incorrect patient registration, reliance on wrong patient data, mistakes in order entry, collection of biological specimens from wrong patients, inappropriate sample labeling and inaccurate entry or erroneous transmission of test results through the laboratory information system. Many ongoing efforts are made to prevent this important healthcare problem, entailing streamlined strategies for identifying patients throughout the healthcare industry by means of traditional and innovative identifiers, as well as using technologic tools that may enhance both the quality and efficiency of <b>blood</b> <b>tubes</b> labeling.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a correct {{diagnosis}} of drug anaphylaxis using a radioimmunoassay devoid of interferences, we have studied factors leading to false positive or false negative values of plasma histamine. Different steps in sample collection were studied systematically in 30 normal volunteers.

There was no significant increase when a tourniquet or vacuum tubes were used, or when <b>blood</b> <b>tubes</b> were left at 4 °C overnight. In 12 patients who experienced an anaphylactic reaction, histamine disappeared from blood 10 times more slowly than expected. False negative values were found in two pregnant women and one heparinized patient.
