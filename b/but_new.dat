5|$|As the Game Boy Advance {{was able}} to handle newer, {{enhanced}} graphics, Ruby and Sapphire were the first games in the series that allowed up to four people to share information at one time, {{as opposed to the}} previous limit of two.

5|$|City's season {{opened with}} a 0–0 draw at home to Liverpool. City were awarded a penalty, <b>but</b> <b>new</b> captain Tony Book hit it wide. Two defeats followed, at Southampton and Stoke. The Stoke defeat led to a {{tactical}} switch. Mike Summerbee, who played wide on the right {{at the start of}} the season, was moved to centre-forward. The change reaped immediate dividends, with Summerbee playing a leading role in a 4–2 win against Southampton. This was the first in a run of five straight wins, after which Manchester City had caught up with the league leaders. During this run of wins young winger Stan Bowles made his league debut, scoring twice in a 5–2 win against Sheffield United.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, <b>but</b> <b>new</b> settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis, or the {{inability}} of humans to visually distinguish between two or more distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, <b>but</b> <b>new</b> genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, <b>but</b> <b>new</b> technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated threshing mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E

5|$|French naturalist Auguste Duméril {{erected a}} new genus in {{publishing}} the species as Aphanacanthe reticulatus in 1855 from a description authored by his countryman Gabriel Bibron, {{who had died}} suddenly, Later Latinised to Aphanacanthus, it was linked to a presumed type species Tetrodon reticulatus, from a manuscript by Bibron. In 1959, Yseult Le Danois equated this species name to Tetractenos hamiltoni, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> Zealand zoologist Graham Hardy later reviewed the specimens labelled as T.hamiltoni and found {{that they should be}} assigned to T.glaber. The genus name Aphanacanthe—not Aphanacanthus, as the original spelling takes priority—would have taken precedence over the current genus name Tetractenos. However, it is a nomen nudum as it does not provide enough detail or information to diagnose or properly describe the species, since Duméril had only written a (French) translation of the genus name—αφανης qui nе parait pas, ἃκανθα, épine ("with no thorns").|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} lightest element and {{is the second}} most {{abundant}} in the observable universe.

On Earth, helium is relatively rare and is created by the natural decay of some radioactive elements because the alpha particles that are emitted consist of helium nuclei. This radiogenic helium is trapped with natural gas in concentrations of up to seven percent by volume, from which it is extracted commercially by a low-temperature separation process called fractional distillation.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, O'Brien {{skipped the}} Australian Championships {{because he had}} no {{sponsorship}} and ran out of money, forcing him to seek full-time work. In 1968, despite Graham Edwards winning the National 200m breaststroke title, the Australian Swimming Union persuaded an overweight O'Brien to make a comeback in 1968 on the grounds that Australia did not have a quality breaststroker for the Olympics. Undergoing a crash diet and fitness program, O'Brien lost 12.7kg in twelve weeks of intense training. O'Brien was unable to reclaim either of his individual Australian titles, <b>but</b> <b>New</b> South Wales again won the medley relay. Nevertheless, he was selected for his second Olympics.|$|E

5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities.

5|$|New orders {{began to}} be {{introduced}} into England. As ties to Normandy waned, the French Cluniac order became fashionable and their houses were introduced in England. The Augustinians spread quickly {{from the beginning of}} the 12th century onwards, while later in the century the Cistercians reached England, creating houses with a more austere interpretation of the monastic rules and building the great abbeys of Rievaulx and Fountains. By 1215, there were over 600 monastic communities in England, <b>but</b> <b>new</b> endowments slowed during the 13th century, creating long-term financial problems for many institutions. The Dominican and Franciscan friars arrived in England during the 1220s, establishing 150 friaries by the end of the 13th century; these mendicant orders rapidly became popular, particularly in towns, and heavily influenced local preaching. The religious military orders that became popular across Europe from the 12th century onwards acquired possessions in England, including the Templars, Teutons and Hospitallers.|$|E
