Interlaminar shear stresses in composite beams and plates are produced as a result of free edges, ply drop-offs, three-dimensional stress fields, etc. Characterization of a composite material’s resistance to interlaminar shear is critical to their optimization. A composite beam, consisting of a coupon of unidirectional HERCULES AS 4 / 3501 - 6 graphite/epoxy material adhesively bonded between steel strips and subjected to four-point bending, can be used to characterize the interlaminar shear strength of the composite materials. Preliminary results indicate the beam’s overhang length affects the failure of the specimen. Three finite-element models were generated to determine the influence of the length of overhang on the stress state of a composite beam. The finite element models are incorporated into an analysis involving plane elements to study the state of stress.

The problem is posed on a unit cell with periodic boundary conditions such that the small-scale strain state averages to the large-scale conditions and the deformation energy is conserved between scales. The method can be implemented in standard finite-element packages and allows for local stress recovery and also for local (periodic) nonlinear effects such as skin wrinkling to be propagated to the large scale. Numerical examples are used to obtain the homogenised properties for several isotropic and composite beams, with and without transverse reinforcements or thickness variation, and for both linear and geometrically-nonlinear deformations. The periodicity in the local post-buckling response disappears {{in the presence of}} localisation in the solution and this is also illustrated by a numerical example.

Applications such as lidar also benefit from a low weight. A seed source, followed by a cascade of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, are an attractive means to this end, providing for a compact, reliable, and versatile system. So far, however, pulse energies achieved with such amplifier cascades have been significantly less than 1 mJ.
