5|$|In {{creating}} the game, Rohrer {{was influenced by}} his childhood fear of his house being robbed, numerous publicized shootings, and his own political views regarding gun rights and home invasions. During development and <b>beta</b> <b>testing,</b> the game went through several changes that increased its difficulty. It received mixed reviews from critics, with some praising the design and creativity and others finding it hard to empathize with the game's intended message.|$|E
5|$|The team {{developing}} the Linux client {{had been working}} for a year before the announcement to validate that such a port would be possible. As of the official announcement, a near-feature-complete Steam client for Linux had been developed and successfully run on Ubuntu. Internal <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> of the Linux client started in October 2012; external <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> occurred in early November the same year. Open beta clients for Linux were made available in late December 2012, and the client was officially released in mid-February 2013. At the time of announcement, Valve's Linux division assured that its first game on the OS, Left 4 Dead 2, wpuld run at an acceptable frame rate and with a degree of connectivity with the Windows and OS X versions. From there, it began working on porting other games to Ubuntu and expanding to other Linux distributions. Linux games are also eligible for SteamPlay availability. Versions of Steam working under Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux were released by October 2013. By June 2014, the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam had reached over 500, surpassing over 1,000 by March 2015. A year later, this number doubled to over 2,000.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, first-generation {{symmetric}} multiprocessing (SMP) clients were publicly released for open <b>beta</b> <b>testing,</b> {{referred to as}} SMP1. These clients used Message Passing Interface (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as {{at that time the}} GROMACS cores were not designed to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in Unix-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under Windows. On January24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable thread-based implementation.|$|E

Only people, who registered before for the <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> were allowed to download and <b>test</b> this <b>beta</b> version. This closed <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> was followed with another public <b>beta</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} tests that {{initially}} {{made up the}} intelligence tests for the military: Army Alpha and Army <b>Beta</b> <b>tests.</b> They were developed to evaluate vast numbers of military recruits that were both literate (Army Alpha tests) and illiterate (Army <b>Beta</b> <b>tests).</b> The Army <b>Beta</b> <b>test</b> were designed to “measure native intellectual capacity”. The Army <b>Beta</b> <b>test</b> also helped to test non-English speaking service members.|$|R

5|$|PokerTracker 4 is poker {{tracking}} {{software that}} designed for {{several types of}} online poker: No-Limit, Limit, or Pot-Limit cash games, Sit N’ Go’s and Multi-Table Tournaments for both Texas Holdem and Omaha players. It is compatible with almost all online poker websites' software and interfaces. PokerTracker 4 began public <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> in March 2012. In August 2012, the company commercially launched a Microsoft Windows version of PokerTracker 4. In January 2013 as PokerTracker version 4.05.10 was rolled out, the company began alpha testing an Apple OS X version of the software. PokerTracker 4 was produced from scratch rather than by refining PokerTracker 3 and other earlier versions.|$|E
5|$|Blizzard {{posted a}} release {{date for the}} game's first beta of Summer 2009, but failed to release a beta during that time. Since May 6, 2009, it was {{possible}} to sign up for the beta phase of the game. In November 2009, the game's producer Chris Sigaty confirmed there would be no public beta for the game taking place in 2009 but assured fans that it would happen next year. In February 2010, Blizzard CEO Mike Morhaime announced that a closed beta would open later that month. On February 17, 2010, StarCraft II began closed <b>beta</b> <b>testing,</b> as promised. The beta was expected to last for 3–5 months. Beta keys for the initial release were sold on eBay for prices as high as $400. Blizzard also released a map editor for the beta as part of Patch 9. According to the company, they had planned to release a major content patch towards the end of <b>beta</b> <b>testing.</b> As of July 23, 2010, eighteen patches had been released for the beta (only seventeen on European servers), including a patch which provided access to the Galaxy map editor. On May 12, 2010 Blizzard released the beta client for computers running Mac OS X, for the users who had signed up. On May 17, 2010, Blizzard announced that {{the first phase of the}} beta test would be coming to an end in all regions on May 31, but it was later extended to June 7. The second phase began on July 7, 2010, and ended on July 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Steam {{client was}} first made {{available}} for public <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, {{for which it was}} mandatory to install and use. At the time, Steam's primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period. The system and website choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the latest version of Counter-Strike. In 2004, the World Opponent Network was shut down and replaced by Steam. The online features of games which required World Opponent Network ceased to work unless they were converted to Steam.|$|E

Here we introduce a new, more robust, net <b>beta</b> <b>test</b> which shares a number of characteristics with conditional <b>beta</b> <b>tests.</b> The method is extended to the multi-factor case when there are mimicking portfolios of assets for the underlying factors, including the Fama-French three-factor model.

5|$|The first large StarCraft II tournaments {{occurred}} during the <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> phase, the most notable being the HDH Invitational and Day's King of the Beta. Currently the largest professional tournament is the GSL (GomTV Star League) which is a monthly tournament held in South Korea. The tournament enjoys major corporate sponsorships and prize pools of over $100,000. A new North American StarCraft League was announced on February 21, 2011 and is scheduled for an initial run of three seasons offering $400,000 in prize money. The first season of the North American Star League started on April 12, 2011, with 50 players divided into 5 divisions. It ended on July 10, 2011, and the total prize pool was US$100,000. The North American Star League has since run for an additional season, with a fifth starting in early 2013. On May 2, 2012, Ongamenet and KeSPA announced a formal switch in StarCraft competition from Brood War to StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty. Starleague will transition over to StarCraft II by late 2012.|$|E

25|$|Internal <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> of {{the game}} within Blizzard began in 2012. A closed beta was {{launched}} in August 2013, while the game was put into open beta in January 2014. These <b>beta</b> <b>testing</b> periods were {{used to evaluate the}} game's balance, adjusting cards they found to be too powerful or too weak, and making sure no single Hero or deck type dominated the game. As they approached the game's release in March 2014, Blizzard found that it was hard to generate interest in getting people to try the game, believing that once they tried it they would be drawn into the game; those they asked to try the game felt that Hearthstone wasn't the type of game they would be interested in playing. At this point, Blizzard opted to make Hearthstone free to play supported by microtransactions for less patient players. This helped to significantly boost the game's popularity on release.|$|E

25|$|Currently, RNA-Seq {{relies on}} copying of RNA {{molecules}} into cDNA molecules prior to sequencing, hence the subsequent platforms {{are the same}} for transcriptomic and genomic data.
