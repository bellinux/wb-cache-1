40|$|The Balanced Scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> <b>methodology</b> {{focuses on}} major {{critical}} issues of modern business organisations: the effective measurement of corporate {{performance and the}} evaluation of the successful implementation of corporate strategy. Despite the increased adoption of the <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology</b> by numerous business organisations during the last decade, limited case studies concern non-profit organisations (e. g. public sector, educational institutions, healthcare organisations, etc.). The main aim {{of this study is to}} present the development of a performance measurement system for public health care organisations, in the context of <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology.</b> The proposed approach considers the distinguished characteristics of the aforementioned sector (e. g. lack of competition, social character of organisations, etc.). The proposed measurement system contains the most important financial performance indicators, as well as non-financial performance indicators that are able to examine the quality of the provided services, the satisfaction of internal and external customers, the self-improvement system of the organisation and the ability of the organisation to adapt and change. These indicators play the role of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in the context of <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology.</b> The presented analysis is based on a MCDA approach, where the UTASTAR method is used in order to aggregate the marginal performance of KPIs. This approach is able to take into account the preferences of the management of the organisation regarding the achievement of the defined strategic objectives. The main results of the proposed approach refer to {{the evaluation of the}} overall scores for each one of the main dimensions of the <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology</b> (i. e. financial, customer, internal business process, and innovation-learning). These results are able to help the organisation to evaluate and revise its strategy, and generally to adopt modern management approaches in every day practise.

40|$|There is a {{wide body}} of {{evidence}} showing {{a significant increase in}} the adoption of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) worldwide. Moreover, research confirms that the integration and implementation stage (post-M&A) has a major impact on the success or failure of a merger or acquisition. Therefore it has become increasingly important to explore the post-M&A phase further in order to support the management teams of organizations pursuing a merger or acquisition in meeting all their desired objectives. This paper proposes a framework to help in the successful execution of M&A. The framework contains three main elements: the motives, success factors and key success indicators (KSI). A qualitative research approach using the multiple case study methodology was conducted to test the framework. Ten case studies were selected from the industrial sector in Egypt and used to validate the research. The final version of the M&A framework was provided after applying the research results. Considering the practical implications of the M&A framework, a tool was proposed for its application in light of the balanced scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> <b>methodology.</b> The proposed M&A scorecard tool should be used in the strategic planning and execution of M&A. Both the proposed M&A framework and the M&A scorecard tool should be used to guide the implementation of M&A in order to increase the success rate enjoyed by organizations...|$|E

40|$|Several {{organizations}} have implemented performance evaluation systems that use a balanced and structured set of financial and non-financial indicators, {{in order to}} evaluate both {{tangible and intangible assets}} of a firm in medium and long-term perspectives. In a previous work, we proposed a Balanced Scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> <b>methodology</b> for the definition the strategy of a firm and the performance indicators, in terms of the expectations of the customers and firm owners, the internal and external processes and the available and necessary resources. However, a relevant question is how to combine these measures to obtain, in a balanced way, a global evaluation of the firm and to compare it with other firms faced to the same economic and competitive environment. It is also necessary to evaluate the relative importance of these measures, to avoid giving an excessive weight to certain aspects {{at the expense of the}} others. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a tool that can be used to complement this methodology and calculate the global performance of a firm by means of a weighted sum of the set of performance indicators. Moreover, one can construct the performance frontier for a set of firms and the relative global performance that characterizes each firm. However, an important question is the determination of these weights. In this work, we propose an approach that relates the set of strategic objectives and the strategic map obtained b...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays the {{dissatisfaction with}} only fi nancial {{indicators}} {{has led to}} a focus on non-traditional areas of performance measurement as Balanced Scorecard, environment indicators and others. Moreover many recent studies has focused on the corporate sustainability concept and performance measurement interconnection. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the relationship between selected management tools and concepts of various development phases of strategic performance measurement systems to overall business performance measured by indicator ROE. Similarly the aim is to identify the relationship between the sustainability index and indicator ROE as a key aspect in terms of the current climate crisis. Our most important fi ndings bring new information and knowledge for the strategic transformation from traditional business performance measurement system to strategic and sustainable performance measurement system. Specifi cally we found out that the <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology</b> has a demonstrable impact on the business performance. Also KPI system and orientation on the environment affect the performance of enterprises. In the case that companies do not have the knowledge information system as a complex system and do not take into account its implementation they tended to have a lower level of performance. This means that the BI knowledge information system has a major impact on business performance. Regarding to the corporate sustainability concept we can confi rm that the direct moderate correlation is apparent between economic sub-index and also composite index of sustainable development and indicator of ROE. The connection of environmental and social sub-index separately to ROE had not been shown suffi ciently. Based on results we can conclude that the index of sustainable development is a challenge for enterprises refl ecting a growing need for change purely short-term oriented, consumerist patterns of production and consumption...|$|E

The results unfortunately have not been very good. The Office of Management and Budget and the General Accounting Office have found in their reviews that the federal government as a whole has not been {{doing a very good job}} aligning their programs with the goals and establishing effective performance measures.

40|$|The Balanced Scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> is a <b>methodology</b> {{that allows}} {{managers}} {{to define and}} implement a set of financial or nonfinancial indicators in a balanced way to assess an organization's performance from four viewpoints. Many companies are unsuccessful in their implementation of the BSC. This lack of success {{may be attributed to}} different factors, such as strategic problems, planning failures, and poorly defined targets and goals. However, the failed implementation may be attributed in part to the failure to institutionalize habits and routines. In this regard, this objective {{of this paper is to}} use institutional theory to determine whether the book Strategy in Action: Balanced Scorecard contains evidence that the BSC model proposed by the authors (Kaplan & Norton) includes elements that favor the model's institutionalization. For this purpose, a qualitative bibliographic survey was prepared. The survey revealed 404 clues that were rated according to Tolbert and Zucker's description of the processes inherent to institutionalization and to Scott's proposed framework of legitimation/legitimizing. These findings suggest that the book primarily legitimizes the BSC by examining organizations and describes it as an acknowledged management instrument. The aspects supporting the semi-institutional stage (26 % of the findings) and the total institutionalization stage (10 % of findings) suggest that the authors intended to propose a tool without focusing on the institutionalization process, which may partly explain the great difficulty faced by companies attempting to implement this methodology...|$|R
40|$|The SPIS {{methodology}} provides {{methods and}} techniques of developing an information system (IS) that would correspond {{with the requirements}} of an organization. The result of its application is the strategic plan of IS development that would meet the future needs. As is the case in the methodology of the strategic planning in general, the primary drawback to the strategic planning of the information system is the lack of efficient control of implementation of the strategic plan, and this is precisely what this research paper deals with. One of the procedures in the measuring of results of an organization, which is also recommended by the SPIS, is the Balanced Scorecard <b>methodology</b> (<b>BSC).</b> However, the BSC concept which the classic SPIS methodology recommends as suitable for the evaluation of performance of the information technology (IT) on the business system and the performance of that new business system, {{does not take into account}} the constraint that may lead to non-implementation of the planned activities. Furthermore, the BSC has been criticised for the oversimplified modelling of the cause-consequence relations that do not take into account the time delay and the feedback. This paper provides results of the research that resulted in identification of two types of constraints that need to be included when determining the optimal IS/IT strategy. Within the context of the system dynamics (SD) approach, the broadening of the problem with the analysis of the strategy implementation dynamics results in the new practical knowledge about the control over the time-dependant values and, consequently, with a proposal that would eliminate the reasons for the abovementioned criticism. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{attempts}} at carrying out terrorist attacks {{have become more}} prevalent. As a result, {{an increasing number of}} countries have become particularly vigilant against the means by which terrorists raise funds to finance their draconian acts against human life and property. Among the many counter-terrorism agencies in operation, governments have set up financial intelligence units (FIUs) within their borders for the purpose of tracking down terrorists’ funds. By investigating reported suspicious transactions, FIUs attempt to weed out financial criminals who use these illegal funds to finance terrorist activity. ^ The prominent role played by FIUs means that their performance is always under the spotlight. By interviewing experts and conducting surveys of those associated with the fight against financial crime, this study investigated perceptions of FIU performance on a comparative basis between American and non-American FIUs. The target group of experts included financial institution personnel, civilian agents, law enforcement personnel, academicians, and consultants. Questions for the interview and surveys were based on the Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> <b>methodology.</b> One of the objectives {{of this study was to}} help determine the suitability of the BSC to this arena. ^ While FIUs in this study have concentrated on performance by measuring outputs such as the number of suspicious transaction reports investigated, this study calls for a focus on outcomes involving all the parties responsible for financial criminal investigations. It is only through such an integrated approach that these various entities will be able to improve performance in solving financial crime. Experts in financial intelligence strongly believed that the quality and timeliness of intelligence was more important than keeping track of the number of suspicious transaction reports. Finally, this study concluded that the BSC could be appropriately applied to the arena of financial crime prevention even though the emphasis is markedly different from that in the private sector. While priority in the private sector is given to financial outcomes, in this arena employee growth and internal processes were perceived as most important in achieving a satisfactory outcome. ...|$|E

"nStrategic planning conveys the concept of drawing the future and developing a set of different probable scenarios along with defining a set of solutions in order to combat undesirable coming conditions for positioning the system or business. It helps organizations save themselves safe and maintain them successful. In other words, in strategic planning efforts we are seeking solutions fit for problems which will appear in the future for the conditions that will emerge in the future. Unfortunately, most of strategic plans which have been developed in the organizations lack this important and critical characteristic; I mean in most of them the developers had offered solutions in order to solve today's problems in the future! "nThe second issue which was considered by the scientists, was the task of ensuring the continuity of effectiveness of the planning, there was a managerial initiative needed for steering the activities of strategic planning, implementing the strategies, and strategic evaluation under one umbrella. This initiative was named strategic management. "nThere are numerous publications on the subject of strategic planning, which produces the strategies of the organizations. "nIn the field of execution of strategies, several methods and techniques have been suggested. The most recent popular approach is Kaplan and Norton's initiative "Balanced Scorecard" or <b>BSC.</b> "nIn this <b>methodology,</b> the strategies are translated into daily actions for all people working in the organization. There are hierarchies of indicators and objectives which enable the managers and employees to monitor their own daily jobs in accordance with the organizational strategies. It has been proved itself as a very strong managerial tool for modern leaders and managers. "nIn the field of evaluation of the strategies, which is vital for success, there are methods and techniques developed by scientists. "nThe concept of "strategic management" is introduced in order to facilitate the implementation process of strategic planning and its continuity and improvement...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This {{research}} aims {{to enrich}} the debate concerning Industry 4. 0 and its implementation. In particular, using a case study we want to explore the relationships with the strategic management system of a manufacturing company {{which is trying to}} implement Industry 4. 0. Indeed, the company has issued a strategic plan according to the Balanced Scorecard (<b>BSC)</b> <b>methodology</b> (Hoque, 2014) setting strategic objectives and action plans for Industry 4. 0. Methodology. The research process is based on a typical qualitative exploratory inquiry; data/information has been gathered mainly through a semi-structured interview (Barriball, While 1994; Leech 2002) to four senior managers who participated in the strategic process of a manufacturing company which is implementing Industry 4. 0 tools and principles. The company manufactures ceramic tiles and has around 800 employees with several plants in Italy and in other countries. Due to the sector, it can be considered a capital-intensive company with lines of machines dedicated to families of similar products and high volumes of production. Lines follow a process made up of blenders, driers, presses, furnaces and cutting machines. Internal logistics is mainly managed through Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) which can serve and connect machines without workers. The company is using the Balanced Scorecad methodology (BSC) for setting its objectives and deploying them towards the operations (Paci and Becagli, 2011). The semi-structured interview is based on three open questions which are: -	In your strategic plan, have you set new specific goals/objectives for implementing Industry 4. 0 ? -	Have you issued specific plans for deploying your objectives into operative actions? -	What kinds of management systems, processes and resources will you need for meeting your strategic goals? After having gathered information from the four senior managers, results have been analysed and coded using a grounded theory approach. According to Strauss and Corbin (1990) it is important to use coding to shape the concepts. In grounded theory there are three basic types of coding: ‘open’, ‘axial’ and ‘selective’. For the purpose of the research presented here, open coding and selective coding have been used to handle the data collected through the qualitative interviews...|$|E
40|$|Este artigo tem como objetivo propor um modelo para a gestão estratégica organizacional de Instituições de Ensino Superior, por meio da estruturação de um Balanced Scorecard (BSC) - ferramenta eficaz que traduz a visão e a estratégia organizacional em metas operacionais. Ressalta-se que embora as perspectivas originais sugeridas por Kaplan e Norton (1997) sejam as mais utilizadas, algumas IES geram perspectivas diferenciadas, como a perspectiva Sociedade no caso da Faculdade Alfa (nome fictício), particularmente aqui estudada. A abordagem da pesquisa é qualitativa e quanto aos objetivos se considera exploratória. As estratégias de pesquisa utilizadas foram bibliográfica, documental e estudo de caso. Os dados foram coletados por meio de estudo observacional, bem como de fontes secundárias. Os resultados da pesquisa indicam que: (i) as estratégias da instituição estão traduzidas em iniciativas e ações, por meio da ferramenta BSC; (ii) a instituição traduziu os objetivos estratégicos do Plano de Desenvolvimento Institucional em metas operacionais e (iii) o mapeamento da instituição desenvolvido por meio da metodologia BSC gerou uma visão holística e alinhada das estratégias desdobrando-as até seu nível operacional. This article aims at proposing an {{organizational}} strategic management model {{for higher education}} institutions - HEIs, through the structuring of a Balanced Scorecard (BSC) – an effective tool that translates the organizational vision and strategy into operational goals. It is noteworthy that although the unique perspectives suggested by Kaplan and Norton (1997) are the most commonly used, some HEIs generate differentiated perspectives like a society dimension, as for Faculdade Alfa (fictitious name) particularly studied here. The research approach is qualitative, and the objectives are considered exploratory. The research strategies used were bibliographic, documentary, and case study. Data were collected through observational study and secondary sources. The survey results show that: (i) the institution's strategies are based on initiatives and actions through the BSC tool, (ii) the institution translated the strategic objectives of the Institutional Development Plan into operational goals, and (iii) the mapping of the institution developed through the <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology</b> generated a holistic and aligned vision of the strategies deploying them up to their operational level...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of the}} Balanced Scorecard (BSC) based on a case organization; the King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH-RC). The study is an exploratory investigation. Understanding BSC perspectives is important for academic comprehension and is crucial for successful implementation. BSC at KFSH-RC includes five main perspectives: Quality of Care; Medical Care; Employees; Financial; and Education and Research (learning and growth). The thesis tackles two main anecdotal, practice-based arguments: BSC helps achieve business strategy, and the implementation of BSC has often fallen short of the assertions made about its potential for impact. A case study with a triangulation approach is justified and pursued. This study contributes to the literature in different ways. The application of the BSC has received limited attention in healthcare organisations in general, and in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in particular, and {{may be one of the}} first to explore such issues, across management and professional groups, to research BSC in the healthcare organisation in the KSA. It distinguishes between the understanding of financial and non-financial perspectives; and the researcher has developed a conceptual framework, which reflects the main elements of BSC implementation. Quantitative data analysis from the case study indicates that staff members at the KFSH possess only a shallow understanding of various BSC perspectives. The study revealed a consistent lack of understanding of BSC by the department employees, due to their lack of interest. The results show that performance measures following the implementation of BSC created no significant improvement. It also confirms that even some senior managers face difficulties understanding BSC perspectives. The qualitative-based findings indicate that the level of understanding of BSC for clinical services is not significantly different from that for non-clinical services; staff members of the KFSH resist the implementation of BSC in the early stages; and there is ¿autocratic¿ leadership style at the KFSH inhibited the flow of information. The power distance and autocratic leadership style, in combination with an inadequate launch of BSC, fail to follow the implementation steps recommended by both Kaplan and Norton (2001 a) and Kotter (1996). These organisational dynamics, it will be argued, are understated in the original <b>BSC</b> <b>methodology,</b> a view consistent with the findings of Woodley (2006) and may be especially so in environments with strong professional norms such as hospitals. The implications for the study and practice of non-profit organisations wishing to adopt methodology developed initially in a commercial context, is considered.
