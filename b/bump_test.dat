40|$|Since 2008, the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) {{has been}} {{developing}} a next-generation nuclear fuel performance code called BISON. BISON is built using INL’s Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment, or MOOSE. MOOSE is a massively parallel, finite element-based framework to solve systems of coupled non-linear partial differential equations using the Jacobian-FreeNewton Krylov (JFNK) method. MOOSE supports the use of complex two- and three-dimensional meshes and uses implicit time integration, which {{is important for the}} widely varied time scales in nuclear fuel simulation. MOOSE’s object-oriented architecture minimizes the programming required to add new physics models. BISON has been applied to various nuclear fuel problems to assess the accuracy of its 2 D and 3 D capabilities. The benchmark results used in this assessment range from simulation results from other fuel performance codes to measurements from well-known and documented reactor experiments. An example of a well-documented experiment used in this assessment is the Third Risø Fission Gas Project, referred to as “Bump Test GE 7 ”, which was performed on rod ZX 115. This experiment was chosen because it allows for an evaluation of several aspects of the code, including fully coupled thermo-mechanics, contact, and several nonlinear material models. <b>Bump</b> <b>Test</b> GE 7 consists of a base-irradiation period of a full-length rod in the Quad-Cities- 1 BWR for nearly 7 years to a burnup of 4. 17 % FIMA. The base irradiation test is followed by a “bump test” of a sub-section of the original rod. The <b>bump</b> <b>test</b> takes place in the test reactor DR 3 at Risø in a water-cooled HP 1 rig under BWR conditions where the power level is increased by about 50 % over base irradiation levels in the span of several hours. During base irradiation, the axial power profile is flat. During the <b>bump</b> <b>test,</b> the axial power profile changes so that {{the bottom half of the}} rod is at approximately 50 % higher power than at the base irradiation level, while the power at the top of the rod is at about 20 % of the base irradiation power level. 2 D BISON simulations of the <b>Bump</b> <b>Test</b> GE 7 were run using both discrete and smeared pellet geometry. Comparisons between these calculations and experimental measurements are presented for clad diameter and elongation after the base irradiation and clad profile along the length of the test section after the <b>bump</b> <b>test.</b> Preliminary comparisons between calculations and measurements are favorable, supporting the use of BISON as an accurate multiphysics fuel simulation tool...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA flux-difference {{splitting}} {{based on}} the polynomial character of the flux-vectors is introduced for steady Euler equations. This splitting is applied to finite volumes centered around the vertices of the computational grid. A discrete set of equations is obtained which is both conservative and positive. The flux-difference splitting is done in an algebraically exact way. As a consequence, shocks are represented as sharp discontinuities, without wiggles. Due to the positivity, the set of equations can be solved by collective relaxation methods. A full multigrid method based on symmetric successive relaxation, full weighting, bilinear interpolation and W-cycle is presented. Typical full multigrid efficiency is achieved for the GAMM transonic <b>bump</b> <b>test</b> case since after the starting cycle and one multigrid cycle, the solution cannot be distinguished anymore from the fully converged solution...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{physiological}} and psychological responses of cyclists riding on a hard tail bicycle and on a full suspension bicycle. Twenty males participated in two series of tests. A test rig held the front axle of the bicycle steady while the rear wheel rotated against a heavy roller with bumps (or no bumps) on its surface. In the first series of tests, eight participants (age 19 – 27 years, body mass 65 – 82 kg) were tested on both the full suspension and hard tail bicycles with and without bumps fitted to the roller. The second series of <b>test</b> repeated the <b>bump</b> <b>tests</b> with a further six participants (age 22 – 31 years, body mass 74 – 94 kg) and also involved an investigation of familiarization effects with the final six participants (age 21 – 30 years, body mass 64 – 80 kg). Heart rate, oxygen consumption (VO 2), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and comfort were recorded during 10 min sub-maximal tests. Combined data for the <b>bumps</b> <b>tests</b> show that the full suspension bicycle was significantly different (P &# 60; 0. 001) from the hard tail bicycle on all four measures. Oxygen consumption, heart rate and RPE were lower on average by 8. 7 (s &# 61; 3. 6) ml · kg - 1 · min - 1, 32. 1 (s &# 61; 12. 1) beats · min - 1 and 2. 6 (s &# 61; 2. 0) units, respectively.

40|$|LectureVertical motor/pump {{systems that}} run {{close to the}} motor reed {{frequency}} may experience significantly high vibration levels, which can damage the motor {{as well as the}} entire pump system. These damages can result in costly repairs of the motor/pump, therefore accurate prediction of motor reed frequency will enable a more cost- and performance-effective pump base design and will extend system life. A recent trend has shown that end users are requesting more accurate prediction of motor reed frequency (+/- 10 %), enabling better pump base design with less potential for base rework. This study describes the utilization of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) as a tool in the prediction of vertical motor reed frequency and its correlation with extensive <b>bump</b> <b>test</b> results. Preliminary analysis first identified parameters that affect motor reed frequency. It was then followed by sensitivity studies, which further examined the impact of each parameter. One of the critical parameters is the stator core modulus. Because of its laminated structure, the core modulus is not uniform, which has a significant effect on motor reed frequency. The critical parameters were calibrated against existing test data using design of experiments. Lastly, they were used to verify future motor performance.

40|$|CLINICAL PRESENTATION 2 ̆ 6 EXAM: A twenty-two {{year old}} collegiate triple jumper {{presents}} with tenderness over the tibial shaft along the medial border. During the evaluation the athlete cannot recall a specific incident {{that caused the}} pain, but notes {{that it has been}} ongoing for a few weeks. Initially achy pain was present during activity, but developed to a sharp and unusual pain while at rest. Percussion test, <b>bump</b> <b>test,</b> and squeeze test are used during the physical examination to detect possible fractures. ANATOMY 2 ̆ 6 PATHOLOGY: The tibia is located in the lower leg along with the fibula. The tibia is the larger of the two bones and responsible for absorbing majority of the forces when performing weight-bearing activities. Increase stress and overloading the tibia too quickly can cause micro-cracks in the bone. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 2 ̆ 6 CONSIDERATIONS: After the initial evaluations are performed, CT scans can be done to detect any cracks in the bone. It isn’t uncommon for the plain films to be negative {{in the case of a}} stress fracture, even if the athlete presents with signs of a fracture. An MRI was ordered and the results showed a tibial stress fracture with a DBL (dreaded black line). TREATMENT 2 ̆ 6 RETURN TO ACTIVITY: Conservative treatments did not prove to be a benefit, and the patient had to undergo two PRP injections. Tibial stress fractures that present with a DBL usually require surgery to be fixed. A rod would be implanted and used to absorb bodily stress. This method was not ideal seeing as the patient was a triple jumper and the rod would prevent her from performing at a high level.

40|$|Direct-reading gas {{monitors}} warn {{workers of}} the risk of potentially fatal hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) exposures that may arise during manure handling. Low-cost, low-maintenance H 2 S monitors are available from many manufacturers, but differences in their features and performance make selection challenging for farmers. Moreover, little information is available on the practical maintenance and performance of these devices in agricultural environments. The objective {{of this study was to}} provide information to agricultural workers to aid in the selection, maintenance, and use of low-cost H 2 S monitors. This laboratory study evaluated the performance of several low-cost monitors over a simulated period of use of one year in a swine barn. Four models were exposed to H 2 S concentrations of 1 to 10 ppm over 18 weeks to examine the drift in reported concentration and changes in the alarm reaction time. Over the simulated barn year, the performance of alarm-only monitors declined faster than that of monitors displaying the H 2 S concentration. Of concern was the high-level (20 ppm) alarm failures after an equivalent of 139 days (Altair) and 289 days (BW Clip) in a swine barn, well within the monitor's reported shelf-life. Models displaying concentration exhibited fewer failures but were inaccurate in the displayed concentration when challenged with 20 ppm of H 2 S. The T 40 Rattler provided consistently higher readings (+ 2. 3 ppm), and the Pac 3500 showed consistently lower readings (- 3. 4 ppm) when challenged with 20 ppm. This study confirms the need for routine bump tests for these low-cost monitors to ensure that the monitor reacts to the presence of H 2 S, even if the manufacturer does not recommend this procedure. Most importantly, agricultural workers should inspect and <b>bump</b> <b>test</b> these monitors prior to any potentially high-risk activity, such as manure agitation, pumping, or pressure washing, to ensure that the monitor appropriately detects and warns users.

Samples consist of <b>bumped</b> <b>test</b> chips mounted on fine pitch rigid and flexible substrates. The finest pitches are 150 mu m for rigid FR 4 substrates and 100 mu m for flex substrates. Isotropic conductive adhesives are promising candidates for adhesive joining. As they conduct electricity equally in all directions, the material must be applied precisely to the points to be connected, and not allowed to flow and short circuit between circuit lines.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the past}} few years, novel {{assembly}} schemes, such as Flip Chip, 3 D assemblies, and advanced low-k/ultralow-k dielectric materials have been introduced in the semiconductor industry. Aiming to develop and grant maturity milestones, standardized procedures are {{used to assess the}} assembly reliability. Among them, <b>bump</b> shear <b>test</b> provides a quantitative measure of the bonding strength between the Bump, UBM and pad structure. In this paper, some investigations on the failure mechanism induced by shear test are proposed. At first, it is shown experimentally that, for similar structures, the failure mode depends on the shear tool standoff. More precisely, high height values promote the cratering mode (i. e. fracture in the interconnect layers) whereas low ones induce a ductile mode (i. e. fracture in the bulk Aluminum layer). A numerical model is carried out to provide {{a better understanding of the}} mechanisms. Finite element simulations highlight a strong variation of the peeling stress according to the shear height, whereas the shear stress component remains quite stable. Based on these experimental and numerical findings, distinct scenarii and criterion are proposed to explain the fails. This approach is consolidated by extending the comparisons with additional experimental results. At last, the preliminary results of a time dependent study (effect of the shear tool speed and a non linear copper law) are discussed.

The results showed different EM features comparing with larger flip chip joints. Under various test temperatures from 100 to 140 °C, the increasing of electrical resistance under current stressing was mainly {{due to the}} formation of the high temperature intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The resistance increase-rate in solder bump interconnects was faster than that of Cu post with SnAg bump joints since there was more low temperature solder and under current stressing, more IMCs would be formed. When Cu post with SnAg <b>bumps</b> were <b>tested</b> at 140 °C with the current density of 4. 08 × 10 4 A/cm 2, after certain stressing time the resistances would reach a plateau region, where the diffusion between different materials, i. e., Cu, Ni and Sn reached equilibrium, and IMCs became stable. Large number of Kirkendall voids and a number of cracks were found in the Cu post interconnects which was caused by the electron wind since less voids and cracks were found in the adjacent bump interconnects.

2500|$|Metal pipe {{is often}} used for fences instead of wood and if {{properly}} installed, can be fairly safe in the right circumstances. [...] Pipe is often the most expensive fencing option, but is low maintenance and is very strong. [...] Pipe will generally not give or break if it is run into or if the horse puts a foot through it, which can itself be a potential injury risk; horse owners debate the relative merits and dangers of pipe versus wood for horse fencing. [...] Usually pipe is most suitable for very small areas such as pens where a horse may often <b>bump</b> or <b>test</b> the fence, but will not be at risk of colliding with the fence at full speed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of a study on the effect of {{aluminum}} pad surface morphology on the flip-chip solder bump reliability. The influence of the Al surface morphology on the electroless zinc/nickel/gold UBM is presented. The reliability of the solder bump as measured by ball shear force is reported. Al pad were produced using two RE sputtering systems: CVC- 601 and Varian- 3180. The Al targets used in CVC and Varian system were 99 %Al- 1 %Si and 98. 95 %Al- 1 %Si- 0. 05 %Ti respectively. The surface of the CVC sputtered Al samples were smooth while the surface of the Varian sputtered Al samples were rough. All the samples were subjected to the electroless zinc/nickel/gold plating. The results suggest that after plating, the smooth Al surface resulted in a fine nickel UBM surface while the rough Al surface formed a coarse nickel UBM surface. Ball shear test was conducted after the solder balls were bumped on the UBM. Result shows that the fine UBM surface samples have twice the shear strength compared to the samples with coarse UBM surface samples. The analysis of the results indicates that shear surface occurred at the UBM and the solder interface for samples with rough UBM surface leading to the lower shear strength. Nickel <b>bump</b> shear <b>test</b> result shows that pretreatment of Al pad surface by sodium hydroxide and nitric acid created more zinc seeds this led to better electroless nickel plating. Nickel <b>bump</b> shear <b>tests</b> also shows that double zincated bumps had higher shear strength than single zincated bumps. To obtain reliable flip-chip solder bumps, it is essential to maintain good Al pad surface morphology, pretreatment of the Al pad and undergo second zincation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effect of {{vibration}} and vehicle body movements acting on the vehicle’s wheel due to the different damping characteristics of suspension systems. Three different damping characteristics damper named Absorber A, Absorber B and Absorber C was installed on the suspension system of the Proton Persona which {{was used as a}} test car. This test car was equipped with accelerometers and wire potentiometer sensor on the front and rear suspensions, gyroscopic, Global Positioning System (GPS) and connect with DEWEsoft software as a data acquisition. To study {{the effect of}} three different damper characteristics on suspension system, the ride comfort analysis and car body movement analysis were used to analyze the result during experimental testing. There were 7 maneuver testing experiment were performed including acceleration, engine braking, steady-state braking, steady-state cornering, single-lane change, slalom and <b>bump</b> <b>testing</b> experiment. Based on the results, comparison between the suspension damper characteristics due to the driving maneuvers and car movement were made and their performance also were ranked. Absorber A was the hardest damper as compared to Absorber C and Absorber B according to the damping constant value. The result showed that the best performance for car movement made by Absorber A then followed by Absorber C and Absorber B, while the best performance for ride comfort analysis was made by Absorber B followed by Absorber C and A. Meanwhile Absorber A showed the lowest values of car body movement analysis and Absorber C showed the lowest values of suspension ride comfort analysis during acceleration, engine braking, steady-state braking and steady-state cornering tests. Absorber A was suitable for a flat road driving while Absorber C was suitable for a large road disturbance driving...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{aims for}} {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} electrospun Nylon 6, 6 nanofibrous mat {{on the behavior of}} composite laminates. The main idea is that nanofibrous interleaved into particular ply-to-ply interfaces of a laminate can lead to significant improvements of mechanical properties and delamination/damage resistance. Experimental campaigns were performed to investigate how nanofibers affect both the static and dynamic behavior of the laminate in which they are interleaved. Fracture mechanics tests were initially performed on virgin and 8 different configuration of nanomodified specimens. The purposes of this first step of the work are to understand which geometrical parameters of the nanointerleave influence the behavior of the laminate and, to find the optimal architecture of the nanofibrous mat in order to obtain the best reinforcement. In particular, 3 morphological parameters are investigated: nanofibers diameter, nanofibers orientation and thickness of the reinforce. Two different values for each parameter have been used, and it leads to 8 different configurations of nanoreinforce. Acoustic Emission technique is also used to monitor the tests. Once the optimum configuration has been found, attention is focused on the mechanism of reinforce played by the nanofibers during static and dynamic tests. Low velocity impacts and free decay tests are performed to attest the effect of nanointerlayers and the reinforce mechanism during the dynamic loads. <b>Bump</b> <b>tests</b> are performed before and after the impact on virgin and two different nanomodified laminates configurations. The authors focused their attention on: vibrational behavior, low velocity impact response and post-impact vibration behavior of the nano-interleaved laminates with respect to the response of non-nanomodified ones. Experiments attest that nanofibers significantly strength the delamination resistance of the laminates and increase some mechanical properties. It is demonstrated that the nanofibers are capable to continue to carry on the loads even when the matrix around them is broken...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{a number}} of bump metallurgies are used for flip chip and TAB technology. However, no {{conclusive}} characterisation of the processes used and reliability obtained is available up to now. For wafer bumping, alloys of electroplated PbSn 5, PbSn 63, AuSn 20 and metals like Au are used as well as electroless Ni(P) -Au deposition. Flexible bumping processes like Au stud bumping and mechanical bumping with PbSn solders on a solder wettable UBM are evaluated as alternatives, which are of essential importance for flip chip or TAB especially for small and medium volume applications. Reliability investigations on these used metallurgies are performed. The mechanical stability of the <b>bumps</b> is <b>tested</b> after thermal cycling, taking special care in {{the determination of the}} failure mode.
