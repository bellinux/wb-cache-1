An effi-cient method for {{the calculation of}} bearing dynamic coefficients proposed by Lund [4] has been extended to compliant bearings. Comparison with a rigid babbitted lemon <b>bore</b> <b>journal</b> bearing in terms of dynamic coeffi-cients and stability is given and discussed. It is shown {{that it is important}} to consider perturbations of both the oil film and the compliant lining to obtain realistic results. It is also shown that stability of compliant bearings is improved at some eccentricities compared with conventional babbitted bearings. ...|$|R

The bearing bore of isotropic roughness orientation is characterized by stochastic function and the film geometry is quantified to elliptic shape. There after the Reynolds equation and energy equation are descretized for pressure and temperature respectively. A finite difference model is developed to evaluate hydrodynamic pressure and oil temperature. Solution to this model is done using effective influence Newton-Raphson method. Performance parameters such as load bearing ability, friction, flow-in and side leakages are computed and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{comparative}} study of pressure distribution and load capacity of a cylindrical <b>bore</b> <b>journal</b> bearing is presented in this paper. In calculating the pressure distribution and load capacity of a journal bearing, isothermal analysis was carried out. Using both analytical method and finite element method, pressure distribution in the bearing was calculated. Moreover, the effects of variations in operating variables such as eccentricity ratio and shaft speed on the load capacity of the bearing were calculated. The analytical results and finite element results were compared. In order to check the validity, these results were also compared with the available published results. In comparison with the published results, generally finite element results showed better agreement than analytical results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present investigations related to the performance of fluid film journal bearings incorporating the synergistic effects of elliptic bore and non-Newtonian rheology of lubricant. The Rabinowitsch fluid model has been employed herein for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of lubricant and Reynolds equation is developed accordingly. The performance parameters (load carrying capacity, coefficient of friction, and stability) of bearing have been investigated and discussed herein in terms of ellipticity (of bearing bore) and non-linearity parameter (relating the non-Newtonian rheology). The combined effects of shear thinning of the lubricant and increase in the ellipticity of the bearing bore cause reduction in the load carrying capacity and increase in friction coefficient in comparison to plain circular <b>bore</b> <b>journal</b> bearing lubricated with Newtonian lubricant. However, increase in the ellipticity of bore alone enhances the stability of the rotor-bearing system...|$|R

40|$|This paper evaluates two {{different}} journal bearings: a cylindrical <b>bore</b> plain <b>journal</b> bearing and a tri-lobe taper land bearing. Each bearing {{has the same}} nominal diameter (89 mm) and aspect ratio (L/D = 0. 7). The shaft rotational speed ranged from 6 krpm to 14 krpm and the bearing specific load from 700 kPa to 2800 kPa. The bearings' steady-state performance is evaluated according to relative bearing and shaft displacement, bearing operating temperature and power loss. A frequency-domain analysis is used to determine bearing rotordynamic coefficients - it treats the bearing as a mass-spring-damper system. Excitation frequencies range between 20 Hz and 350 Hz. Ultimately, the tri-lobe taper land bearing offers better stability whereas the cylindrical <b>bore</b> plain <b>journal</b> bearing has a lower eccentricity and runs cooler for a given operating condition. The dynamic properties of the two bearings {{are found to be}} similar, although the higher stability of the tri-lobe taper land bearing is also reflected in the dynamic coefficients.

On these lines publications and websites providing articles took different approaches to present their publications on the Internet. Some websites attempted to offer references of articles, some published digital texts of articles, some others offered images taken from physical copies of journals instead of textual files and others, like Noor Specialized Magazines Website (Noormags) as the first website working with this method, presented journals in full text and full image.|$|R

A life analysis was performed on both a 45 - and a 120 -mm-bore, angular-contact ball bearing. The predicted lives with and without hoop stress were compared with experimental endurance results obtained at 12000 and 25000 rpm with the 120 -mm-bore ball bearing.

40|$|An article {{encouraging}} librarians to read {{newspapers to}} improve their reference service causes Ms. Whisner {{to think about the}} value of current awareness reading for law librarians. This leads to speculating about the proper use of the all-too-limited time available to today’s busy librarian. ¶ 1 Irecently had afew minutes to begin sorting the stacks of paper on my desk. When I saw a professional journal, I asked a basic triage question: can I cross my name off this routing list and move it along? (One of the most satisfying ways of dealing with a big pile of papers is to make part of the pile move onto someone else’s pile.) Sometimes I cross my name off after only seeing the title of the periodical. In fact, I have asked not to have some journals routed to me at all because I so seldom have the time to look at them, and my efforts when I do seldom seem justified. ¶ 2 This time I looked closer. The cover of the <b>journal</b> <b>bore</b> a list of five articles in the issue. One of them appealed to me: “Reference Work and the Value of Reading Newspapers. ” 1 I was intrigued enough to flip to the first page of the article and skim the abstract. The piece seemed interesting. Still, my pile of papers loomed before me. If I read the article right then, I would never sort the pile—let alone find the leave slip I was missing. So I slapped a Post-it Note on the first page of the article and shoved the journal into a tote bag that was filling with professional reading I hoped to get to. (I was the last person on the routing list of this journal, so hoarding it would not deprive a colleague.) ¶ 3 According to the article’s abstract, the authors suggest that reading newspapers is likely to improve the accuracy of reference service. Indeed, they recommend that libraries consider “policies that provide time for their reference staff to read newspapers and magazines. ” 2 As I went about my business in the next several days, I considered these points...|$|R
