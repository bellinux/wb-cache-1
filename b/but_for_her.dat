25|$|During {{this period}} Margaret and the Stanley family endowed the {{building}} of chapels in Wales. Like Edward IV and his court, she was also involved with the advances in printing of William Caxton and his successor Wynkyn de Worde, {{not only as a}} patroness <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> own acquisition. The first book she commissioned from Caxton in 1483 was the 13th-century French romance Blanchardin et Englantine, which mirrored fairly closely the match she was forging in secret between her son Henry and Elizabeth of York, with the aid of Elizabeth Woodville, then in sanctuary from Richard III in Westminster Abbey. Six years later, after Richard's defeat to Henry at Bosworth, she commissioned an English translation of the romance from Caxton: it heralded the beginning of a period of Tudor patronage. Apart from encouraging book production and building her own library, Margaret also involved herself as a translator, mostly of French religious texts.|$|E

500|$|In a storyline which Stenson found {{challenging}} to portray, Steph {{was diagnosed with}} epilepsy. Feeling a responsibility {{to members of the}} viewing public who have the disorder, the actress researched it extensively, assisted by Mersey Television. As well as reading about it, she visited several organisations, and spent a day on set with a teenage girl—close in age to Steph—who has the condition, and who shared insights on the experiences she had been through. The actress [...] felt trepidation about acting out seizures, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> first one was assisted by the episode's director, who had witnessed seizures first-hand, having once worked in a hospital. Stenson felt privileged to be chosen for the storyline, particularly as epilepsy is typically a taboo subject which had not featured prominently in a soap opera before.|$|E
500|$|Her first {{release of}} the year was Leisen's Swing High, Swing Low, a third pairing with MacMurray. The film focused on a romance between two cabaret performers, and was a {{critical}} and commercial success. It had been primarily a drama, with occasional moments of comedy, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> next project, Lombard returned to the screwball genre. Producer David O. Selznick was eager to make a comedy with the actress, impressed by her work in My Man Godfrey, and hired Ben Hecht to write an original screenplay for her. Nothing Sacred, directed by William Wellman and co-starring Fredric March, satirized the journalism industry and [...] "the gullible urban masses", with Lombard playing a small-town girl who pretends to be dying and finds her story exploited by a New York reporter. Marking her only appearance in Technicolor, the film was highly praised and was one of Lombard's personal favorites.|$|E
500|$|In {{her second}} RCM year Imogen {{concentrated}} on composition, producing several chamber works including a violin sonata, an oboe quintet, and a suite for woodwind.

In 1928 she went to Belgium with the EFDS, took an Italian holiday, and made an extended trip to Germany with a group known as [...] "The Travelling Morrice" [...] which promoted international understanding through music and dance. In October 1928 she won the RCM's Cobbett prize for an original chamber composition, [...] her Phantasy String Quartet, and shortly afterwards was awarded the Morley Scholarship for the [...] "best all-round student". The quartet was broadcast by the BBC on 20 March 1929, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> the achievement was overshadowed by the news that month of the premature death of her early mentor Jane Joseph.|$|E

500|$|In Angelou's {{favorite}} poem, [...] "Still I Rise", which shares {{its title}} with a play {{she wrote in}} 1976, she refers to the indomitable spirit of Black people, using repetition and the categorization of injustices against them. She quoted it during interviews and often included it in her public readings. Despite adversity and racism, Angelou expresses her faith that one will overcome and triumph. Hagen compares [...] "Still I Rise" [...] with spirituals that express hope. As she does in [...] "Phenomenal Woman" [...] and throughout her poetry and autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> entire gender and race. [...] Reviewer Ellen Lippmann calls [...] "Still I Rise" [...] a [...] "proud, even defiant statement of behalf of all Black people". [...] Angelou, during an interview in 1997, stated that she used the poem to help sustain her during hard times, and that many people, both Black and white, used {{it in the same}} way.|$|E
500|$|Angelou explores many of {{the same}} themes {{throughout}} all her writings, in both her autobiographies and poetry. [...] These themes include love, painful loss, music, discrimination and racism, and struggle. Her poetry cannot easily be placed in categories of themes or techniques. [...] It has been compared with music and musical forms, especially the blues, and like the blues singer, Angelou uses laughter or ridicule instead of tears to cope with minor irritations, sadness, and great suffering. [...] Many of her poems are about love, relationships, or overcoming hardships, as expressed in poems of hers such as [...] "Still I Rise", I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, and Million Man March Poem. [...] The metaphors in her poetry serve as [...] "coding", or litotes, for meanings understood by other Blacks, but her themes and topics apply universally to all races. [...] Angelou uses everyday language, the Black vernacular, Black music and forms, and rhetorical techniques such as shocking language, the occasional use of profanity, and traditionally unacceptable subjects. [...] As she does throughout her autobiographies, Angelou speaks not only for herself, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> entire gender and race. Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. [...] Tied with Angelou's theme of racism is her treatment of the struggle and hardships experienced by her race.|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{faced the}} {{challenge}} of her triple roles by playing each one as differently as possible. She used the script to identify unique characteristics of each—Aradhana is a Punjabi girl, Ruksar speaks with the manners of a popular Bollywood actress from Lucknow, and Radha displays a contemporary confidence. Of the three, Chopra found playing a girl from 1910 to be the toughest. She said, [...] "There was no reference point for it except some books," [...] and the few sketches Kohli was able to provide for costume design. Even with only written sources, she worked toward developing an accent {{that would have been}} typical for a Punjabi girl from Pakistan. In contrast, Chopra was able to consult Saira Banu, a leading Hindi film actress of the 1960s, to understand the way her character Ruksar lived. Like Kapoor, Chopra enjoyed the novelty of playing a character in 1910, [...] "a certain period which normally [...] would not get to play," [...] and she related best to her contemporary character Radha. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> Ruksar was the most interesting. [...] "I got to play a superstar actress of the 1960s," [...] she said. [...] "I got to wear the glamorous clothes of those days, don big hair-dos and speak the way actresses spoke then. I loved all those things." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{she does}} {{throughout}} her autobiographies, Angelou speaks {{not only for}} herself, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> entire gender and race. Her poems continue the themes of mild protest and survival also found in her autobiographies, and inject hope through humor. Many of Angelou's poems are personal in nature, especially those in Diiie and Oh Pray, but the theme of racism and connected to it, liberation, is present in her poems and autobiographies. According to DeGout, [...] "a particular gift of the Angelou muse is the translation of personal experience into political discourse". Scholar Kathy M. Essick calls most of the poems in Diiie Angelou's [...] "protest poems". The poems in the second section of Diiie, for example, are militant in tone; according to Hagen, the poems in this section have [...] "more bite" [...] than {{the ones in the}} first section and express the experience of being Black in a white-dominated world. DeGout states, however, that Angelou's poems have levels of meaning, and that poems in the volume's first section present the themes of racism, women's power, and liberation more subtly. DeGout views [...] "A Zorro Man" [...] as an example of Angelou's ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse and the textured liberation she places in all her poetry. Many of Angelou's poems, especially those in Diiie, focus on women's sexual and romantic experiences, but challenge the gender codes of poetry written in previous eras. She also challenges the male-centered and militaristic themes and messages found in the poetry of the Black Arts movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s, leading up to the publication of Diiie. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple", which appears in Oh Pray, as another example of Angelou's strategy of combining liberation ideology and poetic techniques.|$|E
500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sake." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E

2500|$|Biddick {{complained that}} [...] "The model of gender in Holy Feast and Holy Fast assumes that gender is an essence that appears prior to other {{categories}} and informs them, that the feminine mirrors, indeed reduces to, the female reproductive function, {{that the female}} body is the originary, foundational site of gender." [...] Furthermore (as mentioned above in the [...] "essentialism" [...] section) Biddick observes [...] "Bynum calls this sexual difference 'gender,' <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> gender carries the more restricted sense of [...] "woman," [...] and she argues that a true [...] "historical study of medieval gender interrupts this foundational category of Christianitas by asking how a historical construction of gender in medieval Christendom was simultaneously a construction of other differences." [...] Taking account of these other differences would, for example, include Jews (and the scandal of the Blood Libel), prostitutes, and homosexuals.|$|E
