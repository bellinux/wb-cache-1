500|$|Although Austen's novels {{had been}} {{published}} in the United States since 1832, albeit in <b>bowdlerised</b> <b>editions,</b> it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen. As Southam explains, [...] "for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic". Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes that had come to define American literature. By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and the writer and humourist Mark Twain. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature. In his book Following the Equator, Twain described the library on his ship: [...] "Jane Austen's [...] absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. John Foxe (1517 - 87) {{was one of the}} most influential writers of the English Reformation. In the forty years between 1547 and his death, he produced some forty works in English and Latin. However, both in his lifetime and since then, he has been principally known for only one of them, The Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs. John Foxe fled to the Continent during the reign of Mary I, and on his return, wrote a history of the English Protestant martyrs from the 14 th century to his own time. Usually known as The Book of Martyrs, it traces the triumph of Protestantism through the sufferings of English Protestants. Some four hundred copies of Foxes editions of 1563, 1570, 1576 and 1583 remain, but most are defective to some extent, and all bear their original imperfections. Although microfilms of all the four original editions were available, and were adequate for general use, they too had their imperfections. The copies selected for filming were damaged and incomplete and many running heads and marginalia were omitted during photography. Moreover, these images were devoid of any commentary or apparatus, and well over a hundred years of Reformation scholarship had elapsed since Pratt completed his work. Also a number of <b>bowdlerised</b> and abbreviated <b>editions</b> had been published in the twentieth century, particularly in the United States, and although there was little danger of these deceiving serious scholars, the proposal suggested that the time was ripe for the full text to reappear with a modern commentary. It had also been recognised for some time that the Acts and Monuments is a major work of sixteenth century scholarship and a significant influence upon the development of the national identity. A reliable scholarly edition was urgently required. In 1993 the British Academy established this project to produce a new edition. Originally, a paper copy was envisaged, however the scale of the project soon became too large to make this feasible. The 1583 edition alone is densely packed with information, including reference to hundreds of sources, some of them imperfectly identified. In scale it runs to nearly three million words. The Committee decided to switch its objective from a print edition to CD-ROM, which in turn would make a variorum edition feasible, embracing all the four original texts. Due to technical developments and innovations in 2002, the committee, with the approval of the British Academy, decided to transfer the publishing medium from CD-ROM to an online edition. Main Topics : This British Academy 'Category One Research Project' has produced a new, definitive edition of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs, based on a textual reconstruction of the four editions published in Foxe's lifetime. It also contains extensive editorial commentaries, information on people and places mentioned in the text, and bibliographical database and a corpus of scholarly essays. Data Contents This resource consists of four kinds of data, namely: 1) 158 *. html files which constitute a selection of all the original website constituents. 2) 12, 058 *. xml files containing information about different textual materials such as transcriptions, editorial comments, and summaries found in books 1 to 12 of all four editions (i. e. 1563, 1570, 1576 and 1583) of John Foxe's Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs 3) 2, 472 image *. png files featuring original index tables, pages and woodcuts shown primarily in John Foxe's 1583 edition of the book 4) Eight tabular files containing data on bibliographic scholarly works, publications and other materials related to the Acts and Monuments of the English Martyrs Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|R
