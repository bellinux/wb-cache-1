[...] He concluded by saying [...] "Overall, Spiritual Machines is a lovely album from start to finish, and even better, it is an album {{that will make you}} wonder." [...] Cheryl Hunter of the Hartford Courant [...] said that [...] "It may sound formulaic, yet Maida's intelligent songwriting and nasally, but forthright vocals make Our Lady Peace more than just another faceless modern rock band."

500|$|Michelle Forbes {{was asked}} {{to return to the}} series, after impressing the {{producers}} with her performance as Dara in the episode [...] "". The character was the daughter of Timicin, played by David Ogden Stiers, and supported the tradition that her father should commit ritual suicide upon reaching a certain age. The Bajoran make-up was created on her, with Michael Westmore seeking to make her look {{different from the rest of}} the crew <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that would not detract from her appearance. Westmore created an appliance over Forbes' nose, before adding a row of ridges on her face. It was designed to be light and flexible, as he wanted the piece to move with Forbes' facial expressions. Her version of the make-up had seven ridges, while other actors in [...] "Ensign Ro" [...] had different numbers, between five and nine, with the male actors wearing larger pieces.|$|E
500|$|Cast member Jonathan Frakes {{directed}} the episode, having {{prepared for it}} while shooting the episode [...] "". He {{said that he was}} not involved in the casting process, as they had offered the role of Captain Morgan Bateson to Kelsey Grammer, who'd accepted. Grammer was a Star Trek fan, and in his role as Frasier Crane on Cheers, he filmed on the Paramount lot near where The Next Generation was produced. Frakes found it a challenge to film the same scenes with the same dialogue over and over <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> which made them look different. Marvin V. Rush, the director of photography, worked with cameraman Waverly Smothers to develop an attachment for a camera using a bungee cord which allowed for a different style of shooting. Frakes also worked while at home planning out shots {{in order to ensure that}} there was a variety to each loop. Executive producer Rick Berman had made it clear that Frakes could not re-use footage and each loop needed to be filmed fresh, in order to prevent the episode from looking like a clip show.|$|E
500|$|Protein 3D {{structures}} are currently determined experimentally via X-ray crystallography or {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy. The process is slow (it can take weeks or even months {{to figure out how}} to crystallize a protein for the first time) and costly (around $100,000USD per protein). Unfortunately, the rate at which new sequences are discovered far exceeds the rate of structure determination – out of more than 7,400,000 protein sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nonredundant (nr) protein database, fewer than 52,000 proteins' 3D structures have been solved and deposited in the Protein Data Bank, the main repository for structural information on proteins. One of the main goals of Rosetta@home is to predict protein structures with the same accuracy as existing methods, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that requires significantly less time and money.

500|$|Speaking of the song's lyrical background, Cruz told Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul: [...] "Its about {{breaking}} a girl's heart, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that's kinda not on purpose. It's more that I'm {{just a single}} guy, trying to be single and trying to remain single. And sometimes, {{when you are in}} that place, you get girls who wanna be a part of what you're about – but, because you're not really ready for a relationship, those girls can end up being heartbroken. So what I'm basically saying is 'I might just break your heart. But I'm only gonna break your heart if you come through this way right now'." [...] Cruz also has called his song [...] "catchy" [...] with a [...] "good melody" [...] and [...] "fun topic", stating that [...] "both girls and guys can get into this character".

500|$|In a less {{enthusiastic}} review, Time Out Sydney {{felt that}} the album is unfortunately Brian Eno's new album rather than U2's: [...] "for all that's new, there's no way that you'll mistake it for another band." [...] Pitchfork Media reviewer Ryan Dombal gave a score of 4.2 out of 10, stating, [...] "the album's ballyhooed experimentation is either terribly misguided or hidden underneath a wash of shameless U2-isms." [...] Kaj Roth of Melodic magazine described it as [...] "more electronic and less rock" [...] and stating {{that part of the}} album [...] "reminds just too much of their early 90's records". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun gave a rating of three and a half stars, comparing it to the 1990s albums Zooropa, Pop, and Original Soundtracks 1 while stating [...] "This is no blockbuster... It's the least immediate U2 album in years, but one that diehard fans will enjoy living with". Madeleine Chong of MTV Asia wrote that, [...] "Although U2 should be lauded for their efforts at constant reinvention and pushing the envelope in the rock genre, [...] possesses neither the iconic qualities of The Joshua Tree or the radical yet relevant magnetism of Achtung Baby." [...] Toronto Star music critic Ben Rayner called the songs boring, adding that the ambience introduced by Eno and Lanois was [...] "often all these vague, hook-deficient songs have going for them." [...] Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice gave the album a mixed review and wrote that its songs [...] "will remind you of other, much better songs, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> that only makes you want to go and listen to those other songs instead." [...] Time magazine also gave it an unfavourable review, calling the effort [...] "unsatisfied" [...] and [...] "mostly restless, tentative and confused." ...|$|E
