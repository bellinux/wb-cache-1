40|$|Master of ScienceFood Science InstituteRandall K. PhebusFrancisella tularensis is a Gram-negative {{bacterium}} {{that can}} cause tularemia in humans. The disease can be acquired through several routes, {{one of which is}} the ingestion of contaminated food and water. The pathogen {{has the potential to be}} used as a biological weapon, and its intentional introduction in the food supply is a possible way to cause public harm. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth and/or survival of F. tularensis in food matrices under various storage conditions. Cystine Heart Agar enriched with 2 % hemoglobin and supplemented with antibiotics was used to aid the enumeration of the target organism by suppressing the levels of indigenous microflora in foods. During the first portion of the study, the growth/survival of highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis SCHU S 4 strain was investigated in prepared bagged iceberg lettuce stored at two temperatures. F. tularensis counts were significantly different (p≤ 0. 05) among temperature levels for days 1 - 3, but not day 4. After the first 24 h of incubation, the mean estimates of F. tularensis counts were 1. 00 log cfu g⁻¹ lower in lettuce stored at 23 ± 1 °C compared to lettuce stored at 6 ± 1 °C. Lower recovery rates at higher temperatures are likely due to the more rapid proliferation of naturally present bacteria which can inhibit the growth of F. tularensis. After 48 and 72 h, differences in F. tularensis counts between temperatures were 0. 55 log cfu g⁻¹ and 0. 3 log cfu g⁻¹, respectively. For the second portion of the experiment, the ability of F. tularensis to grow or survive was evaluated in nine food matrices with variable compositional content (red delicious apples, green bell pepper, shredded iceberg lettuce, strawberries, whole liquid eggs, <b>boneless</b> ham steak, <b>beef</b> hot dogs, 80 - 20 ground beef, and 2 % UHT milk) at 4, 21, and 37 °C.

40|$|Accounting for {{transportation}} {{is an important}} part of the life cycle analysis (LCA) of beef cattle production because it is associated with energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper describes the development and application of a model that estimates energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of transport in beef cattle production. The animal transport model is based on the weight and number of animals in each weight category, type of trailer, vehicle, and fuel used. The energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission estimates of animal feed transportation are based on the weight of a truckload and the number of truckloads of feed transported.

The results revealed four markets related to client demands with regard to the sanitation and traceability of beef products. Furthermore, extrinsic characteristics of the product are discussed, such as a productive system that aims to minimize environmental impacts and to value animal welfare and respect for social demands. The markets that pay highest prices require sanitary quality of suppliers, demanding traceable and process-certified products.

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the environmental footprint of the integrated France-Italy beef production system (extensive grassland-based suckler cow-calf farms in France with intensive cereal-based fattening farms in northeastern Italy) using a multi-indicator approach, which combines environmental impact categories computed with a cradle-to-farm gate Life Cycle Assessment, and food-related indicators based on the conversion of gross energy and protein of feedstuffs into raw <b>boneless</b> <b>beef.</b> The system boundaries were set from the calves' birth to their sale to the slaughterhouse, including the herd management, on- and off-farm feed production and materials used on the farms. One kilogram of body weight (BW) sold {{was used as the}} functional unit. The study involved 73 Charolais batches (i. e., a group of animals homogenous for age, finishing period and fattening farm), kept at 14 Italian farms. Data from 40 farms originating from the Charolais Network database (INRA) were used to characterize the French farm types, which were matched to the fattening batches according to the results of a cluster analysis. The impact categories assessed were as follows (mean +/- SD per kg BW) : global warming potential (GWP, 13. 0 +/- 0. 7 kg CO 2 -eq, reduced to 9. 9 +/- 0. 7 kg CO 2 -eq when considering the carbon sequestration due to French suckler cow-calf system permanent grassland), acidification potential (AP, 193 +/- 13 g SO 2 -eq), eutrophication potential (EP, 57 +/- 4 g PO 4 -eq), cumulative energy demand (CED, 36 +/- 5 MJ), and land occupation (LO, 18. 7 +/- 0. 8 m(2) /year). The on-farm impacts outweighed those of the off-farm activities, except in the case of CED. On average, 41 MJ and 16. 7 kg of dietary feed gross energy and protein were required to provide 1 MJ or 1 kg of protein of raw <b>boneless</b> <b>beef,</b> respectively, but nearly 85 % and 80 %, respectively, were derived from feedstuffs not suitable for human consumption. Emission-related (GWP, AP, EP) and resource utilization categories (CED, LO) were positively correlated. Food-related indicators showed positive correlations with emission-related indicators when the overall feedstuffs of the diet were considered but negative correlations when only the potentially human-edible portions of the beef diets were considered. In conclusion, the integration of the pasture-based France suckler cow-calf system with the cereal-based Italian fattening farms allows for the exploitation of the resources available, increasing the share of non-human-edible feedstuffs while maintaining good livestock productive efficiency. Combining indicators of impact categories with indicators of feed net supply may improve the assessment of the environmental footprint of livestock systems...|$|E

Data of the top beef exporters was collected from the United Nations Commodity Trade Database (UN Comtrade), including export operations volume and receipt with each of their trading partners, from 2000 to 2012. Four commodities were studied: Frozen and Fresh/Chilled bone-in and <b>boneless</b> <b>beef</b> cuts. The data was analyzed using ordinary least squares regression methods (a hedonic price equation). Five models were run, one for each commodity and lastly one with all four together. Results revealed that both FMD and BSE affect negatively to beef exports prices, as well as shipments from India, that has no official FMD status and any traceability system in place. Apart from sanitary status, epidemiological events also {{have a negative impact on}} beef prices. On the other hand, the implementation of traceability systems improves prices. In this scenario, Paraguay lags behind in the adoption of emerging markets standards for traceability systems, therefore does not access most competitive markets, which pay higher prices. As such, Paraguay faces challenges to maintain and expand beef exports, especially in regards to keeping the country’s FMD free status...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{methods for}} controlling Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella non-pathogenic bacterial surrogates during {{the production of}} marinated non-intact beef products. Hot (~ 30 degrees C) <b>boneless,</b> <b>beef</b> strip loins (n = 54, Institutional Meat Purchase Specification 180) were inoculated with one of two levels (approximately 5. 8 and 1. 9 log 10 CFU/cm 2, hereafter referred to as high- and low-inoculated, respectively) of non-pathogenic, rifampicin-resistant E. coli organisms used to simulate harvest floor contamination. The inoculated beef strip loins were chilled at 2 degrees C for 24 h, and then vacuum packaged and aged for 7 to 24 days at 2 degrees C. The beef strip loins were subjected to one of five treatments or control (no treatment). Spray treatments were: 2. 5 % L-lactic acid, 5. 0 % L-lactic acid, 1, 050 ppm acidified sodium chlorite, 205 ppm peroxyacetic acid, and tap water. Lactic acid treatments were applied at ~ 53 degrees C, whereas the other sprays were applied at room temperature (~ 25 degrees C). Treated and control pieces were tumble marinated using a commercial marinade. Sample counts were collected throughout the experiment to track reductions in inoculated microorganisms as impacted by antimicrobial treatment and processing. For the high-inoculated strip loins, the 5. 0 % L-lactic acid treatment was most effective (P < 0. 05) across treatments and control at reducing surrogate organisms on meat surfaces before marination, producing a 2. 6 log 10 CFU/cm 2 reduction. The water treatment accounted for the least (P < 0. 05) reductions across treatments and control of surrogate organisms on the meat surface before marination. Peroxyacetic acid produced the greatest reduction of surface surrogate organisms in the finished, marinated product. The water treatment resulted in greater internalization of surrogate microorganisms {{when compared to the}} control. Furthermore, certain less effective antimicrobial sprays such as water may facilitate internalization of surface bacteria, more so than non-treated subprimals. It is important that producers of non-intact beef products focus on using effective antimicrobial sprays that maximize reductions and minimize internalization of surface bacteria into the finished product...|$|E
40|$|In {{the world}} practice, the {{radiation}} technologies for food product processing are extensively used; with that, free radicals {{are found in}} products. Scientists have not made a final conclusion about the complete safety of the method of radiation sterilization, so {{it is very important}} to control irradiated food products to determine a fact of irradiation and residual effects. The experimental data obtained on the domestic spectrometer EPR series Labrador Expert X, which was developed by Spektr LLC with the assistance of the research team of the authors from the Institute of Natural Sciences of UrFU named after Yeltsin B. N., indicate the presence of free radicals in the samples of <b>boneless</b> <b>beef,</b> which is probably associated with °Ccurrence of ante-mortem technological and slaughter stress in animals. Irradiation of the chicken meat samples carried out in laboratory conditions allows a comparison of the spectra before and after irradiation. The dose of irradiation of poultry was 12 kGy. This dose was selected based on the practice of recognizing the radiation doses of 10 - 12 kGy as safe, which was established in many countries. It was found that in the range of the magnetic fields from 3272 to 3280 Gs, there was a weak EPR signal with an amplitude of 7. 28 e- 05 and D less than 1. Such a background signal can be explained by stress in the birds, peculiarities of feeding and other factors. After irradiation at a dose of 12 kGy, the ESR signal increased in the range of the magnetic fields from 3273 to 3286 Gs and D was higher than 1. This technology or, in other words, radappertization, is an industrial sterilization of food products for long storage at positive temperatures, which precludes re-contamination by microorganisms. After irradiation, the fivefold increase in the amplitude of the ESR signal was observed and two additional signals with small amplitude appeared. The fact of irradiation/absence of irradiation of the samples was also confirmed by calculation according to GOST R 52529 - 2006. The need for further research of meat and meat products by the EPR method is obvious: to determine a fact of sterilization or radurization, to determine a radiation dose, to accumulate reliably established information on radiation sensitivity and to develop a methodological base for the use of an EPR spectrometer...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify critical parameters of application for selected harvest and fabrication intervention strategies used to control Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 and Salmonella. Paired, <b>boneless,</b> <b>beef</b> strip loin (n= 120, IMPS 180) were selected at a commercial cow harvest facility, transported to the Food Microbiology Laboratory, Texas A&M University, and inoculated with nonpathogenic, rifampicin-resistant E. coli organisms (ATCC # 1427, 1428, 1430) to simulate harvest floor contamination. The beef strip loins were inoculated hot (~ 30 ?C) and then subjected to one of three chemical treatments (L-lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, and acidified sodium chlorite) including subset variations for concentration and pH. Lactic acid was applied warm (~ 53 ?C) and at room temperature (~ 25 ?C), whereas the peroxyacetic acid, and acidified sodium chlorite were applied at room temperature (~ 25 ?C). Lactic acid was applied at concentrations of 2. 5 % and 5 % using different water sources (tap and distilled), and at a common pH of ~ 2. 2 using different water sources (tap and distilled). Peroxyacetic acid was applied at concentrations of 210 ppm and 150 ppm, and acidified sodium chlorite was applied at concentrations of 500 ppm and 1200 ppm. Half of the strip loins received the chemical interventions prior to chilling or ?hot? (~ 25 ?C), whereas the other half received the interventions after a chilling for ~ 24 h at ~ 2 ?C. When applied to hot strip loins, only the 2. 5 % and 5 % lactic acid treatments resulted in a greater than 1 log reduction, but for chilled strip loins all treatments achieved greater than a 1 log reduction. When tap water was used to prepare the intervention, there was a difference between reductions for hot (0. 68 CFU/cm 2) and chilled (2. 02 CFU/cm 2) product, but there were no differences between hot and chilled for distilled water. Also, there were no differences in reductions between using tap and distilled water for hot products or for chilled products. The pH of the meat surface was lowest for the 5. 0 % lactic acid (3. 07) and highest for the 150 ppm peroxyacetic acid (6. 07). These data support the significance of conducting in-plant validation studies utilizing the specific parameters used in the plant...|$|E
