60|$|He was roused, however, {{from his}} {{pleasant}} reverie {{by the sound}} of voices, and two people emerged from the forest some little way to his right and moved across the field {{in the direction of the}} bridge. The one was a man with yellow flowing beard and very long hair of the same tint drooping over his shoulders; his dress of good Norwich cloth and his assured bearing marked him as a man of position, while the sombre hue of his clothes and the absence of all ornament contrasted with the flash and glitter which had marked the king's retinue. By his side walked a woman, tall and slight and dark, with lithe, graceful figure and clear-cut, composed features. Her jet-black hair was gathered back under a light pink coif, her head poised proudly upon her neck, and her step long and springy, like that of some wild, tireless woodland creature. She held her left hand in front of her, covered with a red velvet glove, and on the wrist a little <b>brown</b> <b>falcon,</b> very fluffy and bedraggled, which she smoothed and fondled as she walked. As she came out into the sunshine, Alleyne noticed that her light gown, slashed with pink, was all stained with earth and with moss upon one side from shoulder to hem. He stood in the shadow of an oak staring at her with parted lips, for this woman seemed to him to be the most beautiful and graceful creature that mind could conceive of. Such had he imagined the angels, and such he had tried to paint them in the Beaulieu missals; but here there was something human, were it only in the battered hawk and discolored dress, which sent a tingle and thrill through his nerves such as no dream of radiant and stainless spirit had ever yet been able to conjure up. Good, quiet, uncomplaining mother Nature, long slighted and miscalled, still bides her time and draws to her bosom the most errant of her children.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} call {{is similar to}} the 'cackle' of the {{peregrine}} falcon but is slower and deeper - ‘gaak-gaar-gaak’. The guttural call is shorter and more rapid when being attacked or when intruders are nearby - ‘gak-gak-gak-gak’. Some authors suggest the bird screams when attacking prey but this attribution could be a result of misidentifications of <b>brown</b> <b>falcons,</b> with other authors contesting that the birds are generally silent during attack. The male also makes a sharp, rather high-pitched ‘eeik..eeik..eeik’ or ‘ee-chip…ee-chip’ during courtship displays, and the female has a whine or wail when begging for food or copulating.|$|R
50|$|The black falcon {{belongs to}} the family Falconidae, as do the other three falcon species which are found in Australia, the <b>brown</b> <b>falcon,</b> grey falcon (Falco hypoleucos) and {{peregrine}} falcon (F. peregrinus).|$|E
50|$|Brown falcons (Falco berigora) are {{a common}} and {{widespread}} species in Australia, {{and they are the}} most likely {{to be confused with the}} black falcon (particularly <b>brown</b> <b>falcon</b> juveniles and black morphs). In fact, Debus & Olsen suggest many observations and behaviour of brown falcons have mistakenly been attributed to the black falcon, due to incorrect identification. The two species differ in the relative length of exposed tarsi (the lower, visible half of the bird’s leg) compared with thigh feathers, flight style, wing attitude, and bold underwing barring and tail barring (which appear on the <b>brown</b> <b>falcon</b> only).|$|E
50|$|Size is 45-60 cm long, with 110-135 cm wingspan. Males weigh 635 g, females 1100-1400 g. The female {{is similar}} in size to a little eagle, and the male to a female <b>brown</b> <b>falcon.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Park {{contains}} a wide assortment of bird species {{and up to}} 136 different species are listed. Significant species include eastern grass owl, sea eagles, various parrot species, goshawks, kites, the white-throated needle tail, egrets, herons, wedge-tailed eagles and wrens. The nutmeg mannikin, {{also known as the}} scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata), is an introduced finch species native to tropical Asia. It is able to tolerate disturbed environments and may pose a threat to native finches through competition. [...] The Park is recorded habitat for the ground parrot (Pezoporus wallicus wallicus) listed as vulnerable under the NC Act. It is confined to heathlands and sedgelands and has numerous predators including the eastern grass owl, feral cat, <b>brown</b> <b>falcons</b> (Falco berigora) and snakes.|$|R

50|$|Brown falcons breed from June to November, {{usually in}} an old nest of another hawk species; they {{occasionally}} nest in hollow limbs of trees. The <b>brown</b> <b>falcon</b> lays between two and five eggs that have red and brown spots and blotches.|$|E
50|$|Bird species found {{adjacent}} to the creek include the Australasian darter, little pied cormorant, <b>brown</b> <b>falcon,</b> peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, dusky moorhen, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, mallard, Australian wood duck, galah, rainbow lorikeet, white-faced heron, Australian white ibis, and wattlebird.|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} home to {{endangered}} flora such as Brachychiton incanus {{and a variety of}} birdlife such as rufous night heron, little eagle, <b>brown</b> <b>falcon,</b> whimbrel, tawny frogmouth, great bowerbird and rainbow bee-eater. The agile wallaby is commonly sighted on the island.|$|E
50|$|Like the Australian raven on {{mainland}} Australia, the Forest raven in Tasmania has {{a history}} of being shot or poisoned—generally by farmers as it is perceived to be a threat to livestock and orchard crops. It is not protected under Tasmania's Nature Conservation Act 2002 and no permit is required if landowners seek to kill them. Larger numbers of forest ravens (alongside swamp harriers and <b>brown</b> <b>falcons)</b> were killed in 1958 as rabbit populations dwindled due to myxomatosis and predatory birds were thought to have turned their attention to poultry and livestock. Studies on corvids elsewhere in Australia showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare, but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked, and hence their poor reputation was unjustified. Forest ravens may do more good than harm by preying on insects and removing carrion. Despite their fondness for roadkill, forest ravens are rarely hit by vehicles.|$|R

Beaks are light blue/grey; eyes are <b>brown.</b> The <b>falcons</b> make a loud cackle call uttered frequently.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brown</b> <b>falcon</b> eats small mammals, {{including}} house {{mice and}} young rabbits. It also eats small birds, lizards, snakes, {{and a variety}} of invertebrates, particularly caterpillars, grasshoppers, crickets, and beetles. Insects form the bulk of the animals' diets during winter and the falcons often chase the insects on the ground.|$|E
