5000|$|Copper <b>barium</b> {{ammonium}} <b>chromate</b> is {{the most}} commonly used substance for production of copper chromite. The resulting copper chromite mixture produced by this method can only be used in procedures that contain materials inert to barium, as barium {{is a product of the}} decomposition of copper <b>barium</b> ammonium <b>chromate,</b> and is thus present in the resulting mixture. The by-product copper oxide is removed using an acetic acid extraction, consisting of washing with the acid, decantation and then heat drying of the remaining solid to yield isolated copper chromite. Copper chromite is produced by the exposure of copper <b>barium</b> ammonium <b>chromate</b> to temperatures of 350-450 °C, generally by a muffle furnace: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactions}} of various chromate pigments and ascorbate were investigated by an ESR spin trapping technique. Production of Cr(V) was detected directly and productions of very electrophilic {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) was detected via the oxidation of formate. We demonstrated previously that both dissolved oxygen and Cr (V) were essential {{in the production of}} ROS in this system, and that ROS production was inhibited by catalase. We studied here the effect of solubility of different chromate pigments: sodium, calcium, strontium, basic zinc, basic lead supported on silica, and lead and <b>barium</b> <b>chromates</b> on the production of ROS in buffered medium and cell culture medium (Dublecco's Modified Eagle medium + fetal calf serum). Sodium, calcium, basic zinc, and basic lead chromates were active in the production of ROS in presence of cell culture medium, whereas lead and <b>barium</b> <b>chromates</b> were inactive. - Environ Health Perspect 1 02 (Suppl 3) : 243 - 245 (1994) ...|$|R

40|$|Precipitates of {{a series}} of {{alkaline}} earth metal (barium and strontium) carbonates, chromates, phosphates, and sulfates were formed at high supersaturation by diffusion through silica hydrogel, agarose hydrogel, and the freshly developed agarosesilica mixed gels. The reaction vessels could be a small test tube, a recently designed standard micro slide cassette and a enlarged supercassette. Homogeneous nucleation is thought to have taken place, and particle development {{led to the formation of}} an unusual category of materials, known as Induced Morphology Crystal Aggregates [IMCA], at high pH under far-from-equilibrium conditions. Standard procedures were developed in order to produce homogeneous gels. Particle development led to characteristic style of pattern formation, which I have called monster, spiral, and flake. Among these IMCA, <b>barium</b> carbonate, <b>chromate,</b> and sulfate were moderately easy to grow. Barium phosphate was very difficult to grow as IMCA due to formation of poorly crystalline spherulites. IMCA of strontium carbonate, chromate and sulfate could be developed at high basic pH in the presence of silicate. Strontium carbonate sheet morphology displays a unique property, double internal layer structure, which was identified by backscattering electron imaging (BEI). Selected electron diffraction (SAD) revealed a new crystal phase which was called "Dentonite". Precipitate particles were isolated using a non-destructive isolation technique. Optical microscopy was widely used to examine particles in situ and scanning electron microscopy and X-ray dispersive energy (EDX) spectroscopy were applied to particles ex situ, together with ESCA for surface analysis. Growth patterns were found to be strongly dependent on pH. Other related pattern formation processes were also investigated including normal and dendritic structures, spherulitic structures and periodic pattern formation. Some interpretations were proposed in terms of mechanism. Chemical additive effects were examined experimentally in the calcium phosphate system. The effect of external ionic strength was investigated, and it was found that a certain concentration of sodium chloride (0. 2 M) approximately equals a fraction of pH unit (- 0. 2) ...|$|R

50|$|Pyrotechnic heat {{sources are}} often used for {{activation}} of thermal batteries, where they serve to melt the electrolyte. There are two main types of design. One uses a fuze strip (containing <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper) {{along the edge of}} the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an electrical igniter or squib by application of electric current. The second design uses a center hole in the battery stack into which the high-energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and incandescent particles. The center-hole design allows much faster activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can also be accomplished by a percussion primer, similar to a shotgun shell. It is desired that the pyrotechnic source be gasless. The standard heat source typically consist of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of typically 88/12, 86/14, and 84/16. The higher the potassium perchorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 calories/gram, respectively). The size and thickness of the iron-perchlorate pellets has little influence on their burn rate, however the effect of density, composition, and particle size have significant effect on the burn rate and can be used for its adjusting for desired heat output profile. Another composition in use is zirconium with <b>barium</b> <b>chromate.</b> Another mixture is 46.67 wt.% of titanium, 23.33% of amorphous boron, and about 30% <b>barium</b> <b>chromate.</b> Yet another one is 45 wt.% tungsten, 40.5% <b>barium</b> <b>chromate,</b> 14.5% potassium perchlorate, and 1% vinyl alcohol acetate resin binder.|$|E

50|$|The hashemite {{crystals}} are not {{composed of}} pure <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> but instead contain some small sulfur content as well. The different crystals contain {{a range of}} sulfur impurities ranging from the more pure dark crystals, Ba1.00(Cr0.93, S0.07)1.00O4, to the less pure light crystals, Ba1.00(Cr0.64, S0.36)1.00O4.|$|E
50|$|Thoroughly dried barium ferrate is {{decomposed}} {{completely by}} hydrochloric acid, releasing chlorine. The irreversible reaction of digesting <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> {{with a solution}} of sodium ferrate forms barium ferrate, {{and the color of}} the solution is changed from red to yellow due to the sodium chromate that is also formed.|$|E
50|$|Barium {{has also}} been used to color paints. The pigment known as lemon yellow often {{contained}} <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> mixed with lead sulfate.

50|$|In 2010, a {{study was}} {{conducted}} on four hexavalent chromium compounds to test the carcinogenic effects of chromium. The chromium ions accumulate in the bronchial bifurcation sites, settling into the tissue and inducing tumors.

The cytotoxicity was determined to most likely be a result of the genotoxicity, but the cause of the genotoxicity is yet unknown.|$|E
50|$|The dry {{synthetic}} {{method is}} usually performed using a thermal technique. Primary experiments indicate {{an improvement in}} {{the purity of the}} synthesized barium ferrate by performing the reaction at low temperature in the absence of carbon dioxide and by rapidly filtering and drying the precipitate. Addition of a soluble sodium barium salt to an alkali metal ferrate solution produces a maroon precipitate of barium ferrate, a crystal which has the same structure as <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> and has approximately the same solubility.|$|E
50|$|Hashemite is a {{very rare}} <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> mineral with the formula Ba(Cr,S)O4. It is a {{representative}} of natural chromates - a relatively small and rare group of minerals. Hashemite is the barium-analogue of tarapacáite. It is also the chromium-analogue of baryte, and belongs to the baryte group of minerals. Hashemite is stoichiometrically similar to crocoite and chromatite. Hashemite is orthorhombic, with space group Pnma. I was found together with chromium-bearing ettringite and an apatite group mineral in the Hatrurim Formation, known for the occurrence of rocks formed due to natural pyrometamorphism. Hashemite is named after the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.|$|E
30|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>chromate</b> (BaCrO 4), first {{synthesised}} and analysed by Vauquelin, {{resulted from}} adding {{a solution of}} barium nitrate to a chromate or dichromate (e.g. sodium or potassium) solution [1]. Barium chloride may {{also be used as}} an alternative source of barium [2, 13].

30|$|It is also {{uncertain}} who synthesised {{strontium chromate}} (SrCrO 4) {{for the first}} time [2, 14].

40|$|Barium {{addition}} to chromite ore processing residue COPR {{was investigated in}} order to address a the pronounced heaving phenomena that are associated with mainly the presence of ettringite and b hexavalent chromium leaching. Sulfate was added to representative samples of grey-black GB and hard-brown HB COPR to simulate worst-case conditions of sulfate influx and ettringite formation. Both the X-ray powder diffraction XRPD and the modeling results showed that ettringite is a thermodynamically favored reaction in COPR. The subsequent addition of barium lead to the formation of both barite and <b>barium</b> <b>chromate,</b> observed as solid solution between the two phases. Modeling results confirmed that barium sulfate is the more stable species that will dissolve ettringite and that <b>barium</b> <b>chromate</b> will also dissolve COPR chromate phases when sulfate is depleted. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure TCLP test on GB samples showed that the optimal stoichiometry to maintain Cr and Ba TCLP concentrations below the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory limit of 5 and 100 ppm, respectively, lies between 1 : 1 Ba to sulfate plus chromate ratio and 1. 5 : 1. The respective optimal stoichiometry for the HB COPR was found to be higher, between 2 : 1 and 5 : 1. Considering that COPR is actually a Crcontaminated cement form, a further area of research is the identification of barium-containing wastes i. e., heavy-metal sludges, contaminated soils, etc. that would be suitable for combination with COPR; in this way, an environmentally sustainable yet cost-effective treatment application can be realized.
