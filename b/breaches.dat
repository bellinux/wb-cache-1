5|$|However, the city's levee {{and flood}} walls {{designed}} and built by the US Army Corps of Engineers breached in over fifty locations. Storm surge breached the levees of the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal ("MR-GO") in approximately 20 places and flooded all of Saint Bernard Parish, the east bank of Plaquemines Parish and the historic Lower Ninth Ward. The major levee <b>breaches</b> in the city included <b>breaches</b> at the 17th Street Canal levee, the London Avenue Canal, and the wide, navigable Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, which left approximately 80% of New Orleans flooded. There were three major <b>breaches</b> at the Industrial Canal; one on the upper side near the junction with MR-GO, and two on the lower side along the Lower Ninth Ward, between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. The 17th Street Canal levee was breached on the lower (New Orleans West End) side inland from the Old Hammond Highway Bridge, and the London Avenue Canal breached in two places, on the upper side just back from Robert E.

40|$|<b>Breaching</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} form of embankment failure in the world. Due to overtopping, an embankment starts to <b>breach</b> when part of the embankment actually breaks away, leaving an opening for water to flood the land protected by the embankment. A <b>breach</b> can be a sudden or gradual failure that is caused by surface erosion and/or headcut erosion in the embankment. The magnitude and extent of the losses depend highly on the rate of <b>breaching</b> of the embankment, which determines the discharge through the <b>breach</b> and the speed and rate of inundation of the valley or polder. Therefore, modelling of the <b>breach</b> evolution in embankments is of significant interest for damage assessment and risk analysis. It is also important {{for the development of}} early warning systems for dike and dam failures and of evacuation plans for people at risk. The <b>breach</b> flow {{plays an important role in}} the embankment <b>breaching</b> process, coupling the hydraulic process and the sediment transport process. During the <b>breaching</b> process, the flow overtops the entire embankment crest and generates the <b>breach</b> channel in the initial phase of the <b>breach</b> development. As the <b>breach</b> further develops, the <b>breach</b> flow goes only through the <b>breach</b> channel due to the decrease of the upstream water level. The <b>breach</b> flow can thus be classified as compound weir flow and weir flow, each having own special characteristics. In a <b>breach,</b> the helicoidal flow accelerates the sediment undermining at the toe of the <b>breach</b> slopes and widens the <b>breach</b> in the lateral direction of the embankment. A triangular hydraulic jump happens when the <b>breach</b> flow changes from supercritical flow into subcritical flow, with a triangular critical area at the toe of the <b>breach.</b> The triangular hydraulic jump works as a driving force to the headcut erosion in the <b>breaching</b> process and the scour hole development at the toe of embankment. According to the hydraulic energy loss in the <b>breach,</b> the discharge coefficients are deducted for both weir flow condition and compound weir flow condition. The resulting discharge coefficients can be used in the calculation of the <b>breach</b> discharge in a <b>breach</b> model. In the present study, five runs of <b>breach</b> experiments were conducted in a relative large laboratory flume. The experimental results clearly expose the hydrodynamic process and the erosion process in the <b>breaching</b> of the cohesive embankment. The <b>breaching</b> starts with the initial erosion of the embankment surface washing away the embankment surface. Due to the surface erosion at the toe of the embankment, the headcut erosion is stimulated on the embankment slope. While headcut migration stimulates the <b>breach</b> to develop in longitudinal direction, the lateral erosion triggers the <b>breach</b> to widen in lateral direction. Three types of erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion) contribute to the <b>breach</b> erosion process in the embankment, however, the <b>breach</b> flow is the driving force for the erosion. Sediment deposition in the <b>breaching</b> process, generally ignored in the embankment <b>breaching</b> studies, is also of importance. A mathematical model has been developed that couples weir flow and erosion (surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion). The <b>breaching</b> process is simplified into initial development, deepening development and widening development, corresponding with surface erosion, headcut erosion and lateral erosion, respectively. As the link between flow and embankment material, erosion plays a key role in the embankment <b>breach</b> model. Mathematical descriptions of the headcut migration and the lateral migration rate have been developed to simulate the <b>breaching</b> process in cohesive embankments. The headcut erosion and the lateral erosion are considered to occur in the form of clay blocks instead of in the form of individual clay particles.

Even though a contract is well-established, sometimes there is a condition which makes the contract undesirable anymore, such as increasing in price material, changes in environment regulation or a better offer from other company. Therefore, conducting efficient <b>breach</b> is one of the solutions to obtain a higher surplus or even to prevent from a further loss. To perform efficient <b>breach,</b> the <b>breaching</b> party may <b>breach</b> the original contract only if the victim of the <b>breach</b> receive full compensation, thus there is no party which become worse off.

40|$|The {{failure of}} fluvial dikes (levees) {{often leads to}} devastating floods that cause loss of life and damages to public infrastructure. Overtopping flows have been {{recognized}} as one of the most frequent cause of dike erosion and <b>breaching.</b> Fluvial dike <b>breaching</b> is different from frontal dike (embankments) <b>breaching,</b> because of specific geometry and boundary conditions. The current knowledge on the physical processes underpinning fluvial dike failure due to overtopping remains limited. In addition, there is a lack of a continuous monitoring of the 3 D <b>breach</b> formation, limiting the analysis of the key mechanisms governing the <b>breach</b> development and the validation of conceptual or physically-based models. Laboratory tests on <b>breach</b> growth in homogeneous, non-cohesive sandy fluvial dikes due to flow overtopping have been performed. Two experimental setups have been constructed, permitting the investigation of various hydraulic and geometric parameters. Each experimental setup includes a main channel, separated from a floodplain by a dike. A rectangular initial notch is cut in the crest to initiate dike <b>breaching.</b> The <b>breach</b> development is monitored continuously using a specific developed laser profilometry technique. The observations have shown that the <b>breach</b> develops in two stages: first the <b>breach</b> deepens and widens with the <b>breach</b> centerline being gradually shifted toward the downstream side of the main channel. This behavior underlines the influence of the flow momentum component parallel to the dike crest. Second, the dike geometry upstream of the <b>breach</b> stops evolving and the <b>breach</b> widening continues only toward the downstream side of the main channel. The <b>breach</b> evolution has been found strongly affected by the flow conditions (i. e. inflow discharge in the main channel, downstream boundary condition) and floodplain confinement. The findings of this work shed light on key mechanisms of fluvial dike <b>breaching,</b> which differ substantially from those of dam <b>breaching.</b> These specific features need to be incorporated in flood risk analyses involving fluvial dike <b>breach</b> and failure.
