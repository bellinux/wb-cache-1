5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
500|$|Barlow's manager, Simon Fuller, chose Stephen Lipson {{to produce}} the song, seeing his success with 1980s artists like Grace Jones and Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Although the song did not sound like what Barlow would usually record, he {{nevertheless}} explained in an interview: [...] "It {{took me a while}} to get my interpretation right because Madonna had written from a female point of view. It's not the kind of song I would write myself. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> heard it, I thought 'This is a hit'." [...] A dance-pop song, [...] "Love Won't Wait" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Barlow's voice spans between the nodes of Cm and A3 and has a basic chord progression of C–A–B–Cm in the pre-chorus and E–B–D–A–C–E–A–Cm in the chorus.|$|E

For example, in the New York Times bestseller The Bitch in the House, a woman describes her marriage: [...] "I'm fine all day at work, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> get home, I'm a horror....I'm the bitch in the house."

She commented: [...] "I missed playing Kat," [...] she said. [...] "Now it feels like I've come home. I was nervous at first because I thought I might have forgotten how to play her, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stepped back onto the Square {{she came back to}} me. Even when I was out of the show, people called me Kat every day in the street. I was flattered and now I'm having a great time. The recent scripts have been brilliant." ...|$|E

From today, it is only 18 days until the carnaval starts. How it torments me to think that there are still so many days to go; I wish it were tomorrow;... I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E
