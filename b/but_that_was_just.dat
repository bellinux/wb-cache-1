25|$|The {{first win}} {{of the season}} came against the Tulsa Roughnecks at Wrigley Field on May 1 <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a brief respite as the Sting slumped to a further four defeats to end the month with a 1–7 record. Then remarkably Frantz Mathieu– a firm fan favourite– {{was traded to the}} Montreal Manic, with Gordon Hill coming the other way, making his return to Chicago after a seven-year absence.|$|E
500|$|In April 1970 Mercury joined guitarist Brian May {{and drummer}} Roger Taylor who had {{previously}} been in a band called Smile. In 1971 {{they were joined by}} bassist John Deacon. Despite reservations of the other members and Trident Studios, the band's initial management, Mercury chose the name [...] "Queen" [...] for the new band. He later said, [...] "It's very regal obviously, and it sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> one facet of it." [...] At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury. Mercury designed Queen's logo, called the Queen crest, shortly before the release of the band's first album. The logo combines the zodiac signs of all four members: two lions for Leo (Deacon and Taylor), a crab for Cancer (May), and two fairies for Virgo (Mercury). The lions embrace a stylised letter Q, the crab rests atop the letter with flames rising directly above it, and the fairies are each sheltering below a lion. There is also a crown inside the Q and the whole logo is over-shadowed by an enormous phoenix. The whole symbol bears a passing resemblance to the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom, particularly with the lion supporters.|$|E

Martin remembers that McCartney {{suggested}} this change to make his voice sound younger. McCartney says, [...] "I wanted to appear younger, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> to make it more rooty-tooty; just lift the key because it was starting to sound turgid." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 2013, it was {{announced}} that Turner would return to the soap to reprise her role as Stacey, and would begin filming in January 2014. Turner was quoted as saying: [...] "I may have left EastEnders over three years ago but the show has always been in my heart, as has Stacey, and she has never really left my side. I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's been a while since I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl. It was confirmed that Stacey will return to EastEnders once filming has finished.|$|E

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the trouble--they wouldn't. And so in {{course of}} time Mr. Spillikins was compelled, for {{academic}} reasons, to abandon his life work.

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{what they}} had not done! Even at Magellan's Straits, the Fuegians picked up from a casual Spanish sea-captain and adored an image of Cristo. Name and effigy they accepted. The Tshi people took neither effigy nor name of a deity from the Portuguese settled among them. They neither imitated Catholic rites nor adapted their own; they prayed not, nor sacrificed to the 'new' Nyankupon. Only his name {{and the idea of}} his nature are universally {{diffused}} in West African belief. He lives in no definite home, or hill, but 'in Nyankupon's country.' Nyankupon, at the present day, is 'ignored rather than worshipped,' while Bobowissi has priests and offerings.|$|E
6000|$|Seeing {{the plight}} of the turtle, several young seals came laughingly wabbling to the spot, and as they {{approached}} the helpless creature drew in his legs and head and closed his two shells tightly together. The seals bumped against the turtle and gave it a push that sent it sliding down the beach like a toboggan, and a minute later it splashed into the water and sank out of sight. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what the creature wanted. On shore the upset turtle was quite helpless; but the mischievous seals saved him. For as soon as he touched the water, he was able to turn and right himself, which he promptly did. Then he raised his head above the water and asked: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose it}} is time I {{explained}} who Dick and Aunt Tommy are. Dick is our minister. He hasn't been it very long. He only came a year ago. I shall never forget how surprised Jill and I were that first Sunday we went to church and saw him. We had always thought that ministers had to be old. All the ministers we knew were. Mr. Grinnell, the one before Dick came, must have been as old as Methuselah. But Dick was young--and good-looking. Jill said she thought it a positive sin for a minister to be so good-looking, it didn't seem Christian; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> because all the ministers we knew happened to be homely so that it didn't appear natural.|$|E
50|$|I {{guess the}} hardest thing is having so much love for you and it somehow not being returned.

"Ah! my dear lady, pardon me, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> what {{we cannot}} very well do," [...] said Chauvelin, whilst once again his eyes, keen {{as those of}} a fox on the alert, darted {{a quick glance at}} Marguerite.

60|$|It was no {{ordinary}} meeting this, for him or for her. Had she been able to look him steadily in the face, she might have seen something of her own nervousness reflected there. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> what at first {{she was unable to}} do. One rapid glance into his pale features, which suffering and intellectual labor seemed in some measure to have etherealized, was sufficient. She had all the poignant sense of a culprit before an injured but merciful judge, and at that moment the memory of those dying words was faint within her. And so, though it is not usually the case, it was he who appeared the least disturbed, and he it was who broke that strange silence which had lasted several moments after she had come to a standstill before him.|$|E
60|$|Lastly {{there was}} that Taduki business. Well, there at any rate I was clear and decided. No earthly power would induce me to have {{anything}} {{more to do with}} Taduki smoke. Of course I remembered that Lady Ragnall once told me kindly but firmly that I would if she wished. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> where she made a mistake. For the rest it seemed unkind to refuse her invitation now when she was in trouble, especially as I had once promised that if ever I could be of help, she had only to command me. No, I must go. But if that word--Taduki--were so much as mentioned I would leave again in a hurry. Moreover it would not be, for doubtless she had forgotten all about the stuff by now, even if it were not lost.|$|E
60|$|There {{was no real}} {{sleep for}} Ursula that short summer night. She saw the early dawn, listened to the distant roll of market-carts, and {{wondered}} {{when it would be}} reasonable to be afoot, and ready to hear, if aught there was to hear. At any hour after seven, surely the finders would have mercy and bring the welcome news. And just before seven she fell asleep, deeply, soundly, and never woke till past eight, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> enough to revive the power of hope, and give the sense of a new day. But there was nothing to hear--no news. She found Mr. Dutton in the dining-room. He had had to administer another draught to her father, and had left him in a sleep which would probably last for some time. If she would go and sit in the outer room, after her breakfast, he would go out to obtain intelligence.|$|E
