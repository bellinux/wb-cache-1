ABSTRACT: The very great volume of information and data in a digital image can cause practical problems. Transmitting an image from one computer to another and/or archiving are very expensive due to the abundance of data representing the image {{in the form of}} bits. We present in this article a compression method, which takes in account the coding hybrid of huffman and shanon Fano, which has been applied to imagery and data. We've determined the method limit by considering different forms of images histogram. The results showed that the method is efficient when the number of <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>pixel</b> is of the same order of magnitude as entropy...|$|E

Since, there would be need that the data may be image, text, video and so on transferred via internet to be more secure and helps to hide something within the data. To make them secure and extract the hidden information {{as much as possible}} the watermarking is used. General watermarking only authenticates and extracts the data but not recognize the data similar to original for that purpose Reversible Watermarking is used it not only authenticates the data but also Checks the extracted data similar to the real/original data <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>bit</b> and <b>pixel</b> <b>by</b> <b>pixel.</b> This paper gives the analysis of different watermarking methods used in various fields.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>bit</b> level <b>pixel</b> <b>by</b> <b>pixel</b> chaotic image encryption scheme with a permutation–diffusion structure. In this scheme, a Neural Network Like Structure (NNLS) is proposed {{to do the}} diffusion efficiently. The plain image, split into 16 blocks is permuted by the keys from the key generator. Each key will produce different permutation order (PO) generated using a chaotic map. After permutation, the pixels of the permuted image is converted into bits and given to the proposed NNLS, where the diffusion takes place. The <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>bit</b> diffusion performed <b>by</b> NNLS on the pixels will give more randomness to the cipher image. The performance of the NNLS is contingent upon sensitivity of the keys from the key generator. The test results and analyses performed using several security standards shows that the proposed scheme is more secure, reliable {{and can be used}} for real time image encryption...|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the simple}} depth planes created by simple {{wallpaper}} autostereograms, subtle changes in spacing {{specified by the}} depth map can {{create the illusion of}} smooth gradients in distance. This is possible because the grayscale depth map allows individual pixels to be placed on one of 2n depth planes, where n is the number of <b>bits</b> used <b>by</b> each <b>pixel</b> in the depth map. In practice, the total number of depth planes is determined by the number of pixels used for the width of the pattern image. Each grayscale value must be translated into pixel space in order to shift pixels in the final autostereogram. As a result, the number of depth planes must be smaller than the pattern width.|$|R

The most well-known data hiding scheme is the least significant bits (LSBs) substitution method. This method embeds fixed-length secret bits into the least significant <b>bits</b> of <b>pixels</b> <b>by</b> directly replacing the LSBs of cover image with the secret message bits.

From each pixel, the index of the pixel's colour in its cluster is taken as the secret data <b>bits</b> carried <b>by</b> the <b>pixel.</b> <b>By</b> concatenating those colour indices, the complete secret message can be formed if the stego-image is not manipulated. Although high embedding capacity of this scheme has been reported, high distortion due to the low density of the colour clusters makes this scheme unacceptable. Based on [16], Brisbane et al. proposed another scheme [15], aiming at trading embedding capacity for embedding distortion. Although the objective of reducing embedding distortion is achieved, the same requirement of communicating the extrapalette to the receiving side stands as the main limitation on the feasibility of the scheme.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an astronomical {{increase}} in the usage of computers for a variety of tasks. With the advent of digital cameras, {{one of the most common}} uses has been the storage, manipulation, and transfer of digital images. The files that comprise these images, however, can be quite large and can quickly take up precious memory space on the computer’s hard drive. In multimedia application, most of the images are in color. And color images contain lot of data redundancy and require a large amount of storage space. In this work, we are presenting the performance of different wavelets using SPIHT[1] algorithm for compressing color image. In this R, G and B component of color image are converted to YCbCr before wavelet transform is applied. Y is luminance component; Cb and Cr are chrominance components of the image. Lena color image is taken for analysis purpose. Image is compressed for different <b>bits</b> per <b>pixel</b> <b>by</b> changing level of wavelet decomposition.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare {{a variety of}} modern image {{compression}} methods on a large sample of astronomical images. We begin by demonstrating from first principles how the amount of noise in the image pixel values sets a theoretical upper limit on the lossless compression ratio of the image. We derive simple procedures for measuring the amount of noise in an image and for quantitatively predicting how much compression will be possible. We then compare the traditional technique of using the GZIP utility to externally compress the image, with a newer technique of dividing the image into tiles, and then compressing and storing each tile in a FITS binary table structure. This tiled-image compression technique offers a choice of other compression algorithms besides GZIP, {{some of which are}} much better suited to compressing astronomical images. Our tests on a large sample of images show that the Rice algorithm provides the best combination of speed and compression efficiency. In particular, Rice typically produces 1. 5 times greater compression and provides much faster compression speed than GZIP. Floating point images generally contain too much noise to be effectively compressed with any lossless algorithm. We have developed a compression technique which discards some of the useless noise <b>bits</b> <b>by</b> quantizing the <b>pixel</b> values as scaled integers. The integer images can then be compressed by a factor of 4 or more. Our image compression and uncompression utilities (called fpack and funpack) that were used in this study are publicly available from the HEASARC web site. Users may run these stand-alone programs to compress and uncompress their own images...|$|R

However, the "speckle" - i. e. a coherent noise that is linked with the nature of the instrument - make them uneasy to interpret. We cannot solely rely on the intensity of a given pixel in order to identify its nature. In order to make a good interpretation, one must also consider a "texture", that is a peculiar arrangement of many close pixels of different intensities. Our study is a comparison between the interpretations made on two images, one produced by the SAR of the European satellite ERS- 1 and the other by the SAR of the Japanese satellite JERS- 1. The images are first reduced from 16 to 8 <b>bits</b> <b>by</b> <b>pixel</b> and then treated with a speckle removal filter. These processings were made by using various softwares. After some testing, we decided that speckle removal filter for our purpose was an adaptative median. We then introduce the images in a Geographical Information System (namely Mapinfo). We use the coordinates given in the header of the ERS- 1 SAR image in order to geoprocess this image. We then rectify the JERS- 1 SAR image by taking Control Points on the ERS- 1 SAR image. Thus, even if the absolute precision of the different covers is not perfect, the two images are completely compatible (However field studies lead us to think that the accuracy of these header coordinates is about 200 m for ERS- 1). The images are then interpreted by mere photointerpretation and several layers are produced, each containing a kind of geographical objects : mangrove areas, forest areas, dune areas, etc. The map obtained from the ERS- 1 SAR image shows that this instrument is especially good in the cartography of coastal geomorphological forms like dunes, sand beaches or ripplemarks zones. It does also give {{a clear view of the}} importance and localization of the mangrove areas which are present on the main part of the coast. The JERS- 1 SAR shows the human activities better, like clearings in the forest remnants or the small villages, which could not be detected in the other image. The mangrove areas, a critical topic in this context, are well detected in this image also, despite some differences in the evaluation of the area covered. On this topic, the comparison with an HRV XS image of SPOT enhanced by field studies proves that the evaluation given by the ERS- 1 SAR is closer to reality than JERS- 1 SAR's. The map produced from each image is not as precise and complete as a topographic map, but it is a good instrument to study the different vegetative areas and the coastline. Thus this study tends to demonstrate that it is possible to produce maps at the scale of 1 : 100 000 of this kind of zones, which could be of great help for land planning and environment monitoring in Brazil. Nous comparons ici les interprétations que l'on peut faire d'images des RSO des satellites ERS- 1 et JERS- 1 de l'île d'Algodoal au Brésil. Ces images ont été préalablement converties de 16 bits en 8 bits, et traitées de manière à atténuer le chatoiement. On remarque que le capteur RSO de ERS- 1 est particulièrement performant pour la discrimination des milieux naturels littoraux, et qu'il nous donne de nombreux éléments pour la compréhension de la dynamique littorale. Le capteur RSO de JERS- 1 est plus sensible aux activités humaines, il nous permet de cartographier les défrichements et les villages. Malgré ces différences, les secteurs de mangrove, le milieu le plus significatif de l'île, sont bien repérés dans les deux images, même si la surface totale reconnue varie significativement. Les résultats obtenus permettent d'envisager une cartographie au 1 : 100 000 à partir d'interprétations visuelles d'images de ces deux capteurs...|$|R

40|$|The {{field of}} data hiding in digital image {{processing}} becomes important {{as the use of}} public networks such as the Internet becomes popular and activities of spam increases. Various methods have been proposed and implemented in data hiding. Steganography is one such way to increase the security of messages over the internet. The least significant is one of the methods used in steganography. While most methods work <b>bit</b> <b>by</b> <b>bit</b> value or <b>pixel</b> <b>by</b> <b>pixel</b> value to hide the data. The one disadvantage of such methods is that there is low percentage of data that can be hidden. In this paper, a new algorithm has been proposed that works on blocks of images that are found same or similar in other image. As in today era, the size of digital images are quite large as compared to images used in early years of digital processing and the images contain randomized pixel having blocks of different sizes and variations in colors. This leads to similarity of block of one image with part of other image of same domain and the same approach is used to hide an image inside another image. In this regard, blocks of hiding image are matched up to maximum size m*n with parts of cover image...|$|R
