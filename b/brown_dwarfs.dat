5|$|Another way of {{estimating}} {{the age of}} the cluster is by looking at the lowest-mass objects. In normal main-sequence stars, lithium is rapidly destroyed in nuclear fusion reactions. <b>Brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> can retain their lithium, however. Due to lithium's very low ignition temperature of 2.5 × 106 K, the highest-mass <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> will burn it eventually, and so determining the highest mass of <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> still containing lithium in the cluster can give an idea of its age. Applying this technique to the Pleiades gives an age of about 115 million years.|$|E
5|$|The cluster {{contains}} many <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs,</b> which are objects {{with less than}} about 8% of the Sun's mass, not heavy enough for nuclear fusion reactions to start in their cores and become proper stars. They may constitute up to 25% {{of the total population}} of the cluster, although they contribute less than 2% of the total mass. Astronomers have made great efforts to find and analyse <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in the Pleiades and other young clusters, because they are still relatively bright and observable, while <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> in older clusters have faded and are much more difficult to study.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets {{led to another}} ambiguity in defining a planet: {{the point at which}} a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs.</b> <b>Brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most <b>brown</b> <b>dwarfs</b> would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E
