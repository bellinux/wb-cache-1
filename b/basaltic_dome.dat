40|$|The volcanoes of Mars {{have been}} {{divided into three}} groups based on morphology: <b>basaltic</b> shields, <b>domes</b> and {{composite}} cones, and highland patera. A fourth group {{can be added to}} include the volcano-tectonic depressions. Using crater counts and the absolute chronology of Soderblom, an attempt is made to estimate the history of the volcanoes. Early in the martian history, about 2. 5 b. y. ago, all three styles of volcanoes were active at various locations on the surface. At approximately 1. 7 - 1. 8 b. y. ago a transition occurred in the style and loci of volcanic construction. Volcanoes of younger age appear to be only of the basaltic shield group and are restricted to the Tharsis region. This same transition was noted by a change {{in the style of the}} basaltic shield group. Older shields were small low features, while the younger shields are significantly broader and taller...|$|R
50|$|In volcanology, a lava dome or {{volcanic}} dome is a roughly circular mound-shaped protrusion {{resulting from the}} slow extrusion of viscous lava from a volcano. The geochemistry of lava domes can vary from basalt to rhyolite although most preserved domes tend to have high silica content. The characteristic dome shape is attributed to high viscosity that prevents the lava from flowing very far. This high viscosity can be obtained in two ways: by high levels of silica in the magma, or by degassing of fluid magma. Since viscous <b>basaltic</b> and andesitic <b>domes</b> weather fast and easily break apart by further input of fluid lava, most of the preserved domes have high silica content and consist of rhyolite or dacite.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Meter-scale DSL- 120 {{sonar mapping}} and coregistered Argo II {{photographic}} observations reveal changes in eruptive style that closely follow the third-order structural segmentation {{of the ridge}} axis on the southern East Pacific Rise, 17 ° 11 ’- 18 ° 37 ’S. Near segment ends we observe abundant <b>basaltic</b> lava <b>domes</b> which average 20 m in height and 200 m in basal diameter and have pillow lava as the dominant lava morphology. The ubiquity of pillow lava suggests low effusion rate eruptions. The abundance of lava domes suggests that the fissure eruptions were of sufficient duration to focus and produce a line of volcanic edifices. Near segment centers we observe fewer but larger lava domes, voluminous drained and collapsed lava lakes, and smooth lobate and sheet lava flows with very little pillow lava. The abundance of sheet flows suggests that high effusion rate eruptions are common. Fewer lava domes and large lava lakes suggest that fissure eruptions do not focus to point sources. This pattern was observed on eight third-order ridge segments suggesting that a fundamental volcanic segmentation of the ridge occurs on this scale. The third-order segment boundaries also correlate with local maxima in the seismic axial magma chamber reflector depth throughout the study area and decreased across-axis width of the region of seismic layer 2 A thickening along the one segment where sufficient cross-axis seismic lines exist. The geochemically defined magmatic segment boundaries {{in the study area}} match the locations of our volcanic segment boundaries, although rock sampling density is not adequate to constrain the variation across all the third-order volcanic segments that we identify. These observations suggest that variation in the processes of crustal accretion along axis occurs at a length scale of tens of kilometers on superfast spreading (> 140 km/Myr full rate) mid-ocean ridges. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{island of}} Milos Island, Greece, {{is a relatively}} small (- 151 km') but {{significant portion of the}} active Southern Aegean Volcanic Arc, Milos comprises an Upper Pliocene-Pleistocene, thick (up to 700 m), and compositionally and texturally diverse succession of calc-alkaline, volcanic and sedimentary rocks that record a transition from a relatively shallow but dominandy below-wave-base submarine setting to a subaerial one. The shallow marine part of the succession hosts several significant epithermal gold deposits. Twenty-two main submarine and twelve subaerial volcanic, sedimentary and intrusive facies have been identified, and arranged into eleven compositionally and texturally distinct facies associations. The principal volcanic facies are (1) coherent rhyolite, dacite, andesite, <b>basaltic</b> andesite Oavas, <b>domes,</b> cryptodomes, dykes and sills), and associated autedastic facies (autobreccia, hyalodastite and intrusive hyalodastite); (2) submarine and subaerial pyrodastic deposits; and (3) volcanogenic sedimentary facies. The volcanic and intrusive facies are interbedded with a sedimentary facies association comprising sandstone and/or fossiliferous mudstone mainly derived from erosion of preexisting volcanic deposits. The main facies associations are interpreted to have conformable, disconformable, and interfingering contacts, and there are no mappable angular unconformities or disconformities whhin the volcanic succession. The facies architecture indicates depositional environments evolved from below to above the wave base to subaerial in most areas, except at the southeastern sector of the island where more uniform subaerial environments dominated. The architecture of the dominantly felsic-intermediate volcanic succession reflects contrasts in eruption style) proximity to source, depositional environment and emplacement processes. The volcanic facies architecrure comprises interfingering proximal (near vent), medial (volcano flanks), and distal (volcano margin) facies associations related mainly to submarine and subaerial felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcanoes, dacitic to <b>basaltic</b> andesite lava <b>domes</b> and pyroclastic cones. Submarine felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcanoes are the most voluminous and common type of volcano identified. Submarine explosive eruptions from these centres generated pumiceous gravity-current deposits and thick beds of very coarse, water-settled pumice. In proximal sections, thick felsic pumice breccia intervals were intruded by compositionally similar, porphyritic, rhyolitic and New SHRIMP V-Pb data from four major volcanic facies, in combination with detailed mapping and facies analysis, have enabled construction of an enhanced, internally consistent time-stratigraphic framework for the evolution of Milos. The volcanic activity began at 2. 66 ± 0. 07 Ma and has been more or less continuous since then. Subaerial emergence probably occurred at 1. 44 ± 0. 08 Ma, in response to a combination of volcanic constructional processes and fault-controlled volcano-tectonic uplift. Recent phreatic craters are the youngest (200 Be- 200 AD) expressions of volcanism, and are spatially associated with an active, high-enthalpy geothermal field. The succession contains several significant epithermal, precious and base metal deposits that display a range of textural, mineralogical, and compositional characteristics. The majority of these epithermal ores occur within and at the top a single, submarine felsic cryptodome-pumice cone volcano near the stratigraphic base of the succession. The palaeogeography during mineralisation probably comprised scattered islands (volcanic domes) flanked by shallow-marine areas. A modern analogue for rhe setting of the epithermal- style mineralisation is the shallow submarine to subaerial volcanic complex of the island of Panarea, in the active Aeolian volcanic arc (Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy) ...|$|R
40|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Merapi (VEI 4) was the volcano’s largest since 1872. In {{contrast to the}} prolonged and effusive dome-forming eruptions typical of Merapi’s recent activity, the 2010 eruption began explosively, before a new dome was rapidly emplaced. This new dome was subsequently destroyed by explosions, generating pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), predominantly consisting of dark coloured, dense blocks of <b>basaltic</b> andesite <b>dome</b> lava. A shift towards open-vent conditions in the later stages of the eruption culminated in multiple explosions and the generation of PDCs with conspicuous grey scoria and white pumice clasts resulting from sub-plinian convective column collapse. This paper presents geochemical data for melt inclusions and their clinopyroxene hosts extracted from dense dome lava, grey scoria and white pumice generated during {{the peak of the}} 2010 eruption. These are compared with clinopyroxene-hosted melt inclusions from scoriaceous dome fragments from the prolonged dome-forming 2006 eruption, to elucidate any relationship between pre-eruptive degassing and crystallisation processes and eruptive style. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis of volatiles (H 2 O, CO 2) and light lithophile elements (Li, B, Be) is augmented by electron microprobe analysis of major elements and volatiles (Cl, S, F) in melt inclusions and groundmass glass. Geobarometric analysis shows that the clinopyroxene phenocrysts crystallised at depths of up to 20 km, with the greatest calculated depths associated with phenocrysts from the white pumice. Based on their volatile contents, melt inclusions have re-equilibrated during shallower storage and/or ascent, at depths of ~ 0. 6 – 9. 7 km, where the Merapi magma system is interpreted to be highly interconnected and not formed of discrete magma reservoirs. Melt inclusions enriched in Li show uniform “buffered” Cl concentrations, indicating the presence of an exsolved brine phase. Boron-enriched inclusions also support the presence of a brine phase, which helped to stabilise B in the melt. Calculations based on S concentrations in melt inclusions and groundmass glass require a degassing melt volume of 0. 36 km 3 in order to produce the mass of SO 2 emitted during the 2010 eruption. This volume is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the erupted magma (DRE) volume. The transition between the contrasting eruptive styles in 2010 and 2006 is linked to changes in magmatic flux and changes in degassing style, with the explosive activity in 2010 driven by an influx of deep magma, which overwhelmed the shallower magma system and ascended rapidly, accompanied by closed-system degassing...|$|R
40|$|Socorro Island is {{the summit}} of a large {{volcanic}} mountain located on the Clarion Fracture Zone in the east Pacific. Two major periods of volcanic activity can be recognized on the island. The first (pre-caldera) period was characterized by eruptions of olivine-poor alkali basalt, followed by quiet effusion of soda rhyolite including varieties transitional to pantellerite. This period of activity terminated {{with the formation of}} a caldera by collapse. A relatively prolonged period of quiescence ended with rifting and down-faulting of the western side of the island along a north-south fracture system, accompanied by violently explosive eruptions of soda rhyolite which built a large tephra cone over the position of the old caldera. The locus of eruptive activity moved outward and downward along tension fractures and old tectonic rifts as the central vents became blocked by domes of dense obsidian. Low level eruptions of viscous soda rhyolite including pantellerite commenced without preliminary explosive eruptions and built numerous endogenous and exogenous <b>domes.</b> <b>Basaltic</b> eruptions were rare and confined to low-level vents. During the growth of the volcano the direction of active rifting appears to have changed from east-west to northwest-southeast to north-south. Little is known of the submarine portion of the volcano, but the topography seems to reflect the three directions of rifting. The oldest submarine lavas are assumed to be basaltic and are probably of late Tertiary age. The eruptive history of Socorro suggests that the underlying magma column became stratified {{toward the end of the}} active period...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe telluric {{planets and}} the {{asteroid}} belt display the same internal structure with a metallic inner core and a silicate outer shell. Experimental data and petrological evidence in silicate systems show that granite can be produced by extreme igneous differentiation through various types of igneous processes. On Moon, 4. 4 - 3. 9 Ga granite clasts display dry mineral assemblages. They correspond to at least 8 discrete intrusive events. Large K/Ca enrichment and low REE abundances in granite relative to KREEP are consistent with silicate liquid immiscibility, a process observed in melt inclusions within olivine of lunar basalts and in lunar meteorites. Steep-sided domes identified by remote sensing can represent intrusive or extrusive felsic formations. On Mars, black-and-white rhythmic layers observed on the Tharsis rise along the flanks of the peripheral scarps of the Tharsis Montes giant volcanoes suggest the possible eruption of felsic pyroclastites. Though no true granites were found {{so far in the}} Martian SNC meteorites, felsic glasses and mesostases were identified and a component close to terrestrial continental (granitic) crust is inferred from trace element and isotope systematics. Venus has suffered extensive volcanic resurfacing, whereas folded and faulted areas resemble terrestrial continents. Near large shield volcanoes, with dominant <b>basaltic</b> compositions, steep-sided <b>domes</b> have been interpreted as non-degassed silicic extrusions. The hypothesis of a granitic component is "tantalising". Extra-terrestrial granite is frequently found as clasts and mesostases in asteroidal meteorites. Porphyritic textures, with alkali feldspar crystals up to several centimetres in size, were observed in silicate enclaves within iron meteorites. In the chondrite clan, polymict breccias can contain granitic clasts, whose provenance is debated. One clast from the Adzhi-Bogdo meteorite yields a 4. 53 ± 0. 03 Ga Pb-Pb age, making it the oldest known granite in the solar system. The vast majority of granitic materials recognised so far in the extra-terrestrial record are characterised by ferroan A-type compositions, characterised by high to very high K 2 O and medium CaO contents, sodic varieties being exceedingly rare. Textural evidence of graphic quartz-alkali feldspar intergrowths within crystallised products suggests that they are igneous in origin and crystallised quickly from a liquid. In water-depleted to water-free environments, fluorine and chlorine can play significant roles, as their effects on liquidus temperatures and crystallising assemblages are nearly identical to those of water. The distribution of alkalis and alkaline earths cannot be related only to extensive crystal fractionation, but is likely induced by supplementary silicate liquid immiscibility. Medium-temperature silicate liquid immiscibility is well known as a mode of differentiation in experimental petrology studies at very low pressures on systems dominated by Fe, Ti, K, and P as major elements. The ultimate question is, therefore, not whether granite (s. l.) occurs in any given planetary body, but if sufficient volumes of granitic materials could have been produced to constitute stable continental nuclei...|$|R
40|$|Volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) {{deposits}} {{provide a}} significant contribution to world zinc, copper, lead, silver, and gold and continue to be a target for significant base metal exploration. The Middle to Late Cambrian Mount Read Volcanics in western Tasmania are altered, deformed and metamorphosed submarine volcanic facies interfingered with sedimentary rocks, comprising one of the richest VHMS provinces worldwide. The Mount Read Volcanics host six world-class VHMS deposits ranging from polymetallic Zn-Pb-Cu-rich (Hellyer, Que River, Rosebery and Hercules) to Cu-rich (Mount Lyell) and Au-rich (Henty). Previous studies and recent high-precision dating conducted in the Mount Read Volcanics have led to the hypothesis that ore formation occurred during a single chronostratigraphic interval. However, the Hellyer, Que River, Rosebery and Hercules VHMS deposits in the northern Mount Read Volcanics occur in a range of local geological settings and within very different host volcanic successions, hampering stratigraphic correlations both on regional and local scales. These major deposits occur at two stratigraphic levels; the stratigraphically higher level (Hellyer and Que River) is associated with polymictic, basaltic to dacitic, volcanic breccia and coarse-grained sandstone of the mixed sequence of the Que-Hellyer Volcanics (Mount Charter Group), and the lower level (Rosebery and Hercules) is associated with feldspar-phyric fiamme breccias and interbedded pumice-rich sandstone and siltstone of the Hercules Pumice Formation (upper Central Volcanic Complex). Furthermore, the Hellyer and Que River VHMS deposits are accepted to have formed dominantly by seafloor massive sulfide deposition whereas several different genetic models have been proposed for the formation of the Rosebery and Hercules VHMS deposits, both by syn-volcanic sub-seafloor replacement and seafloor massive sulfide accumulation. In this study, the integration of diamond drill core logging, geological mapping, facies analysis, thin-section petrography and whole-rock compositional data of the upper Central Volcanic Complex and overlying western volcano-sedimentary sequences (Mount Charter and Dundas Groups) is used to establish local and regional lithostratigraphic correlations in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area with the adjacent VHMShosting areas to the NE (Hellyer-Mount Charter) and SSW (Rosebery-Howards Road). These techniques are combined with the examination of the different genetic models, local geological settings and host volcanic successions of the Hellyer, Que River, Rosebery and Hercules VHMS deposits in order to constrain the most prospective stratigraphic position in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area. The Sock Creek-Burns Peak area of the northern Mount Read Volcanics comprises the upper Central Volcanic Complex and the Mount Charter Group. The stratigraphy of the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area can be considered in terms of seven regional stratigraphic units (USB), one of which (USB 4 b, polymictic volcanic breccia and sandstone) has been correlated with the mixed sequence of the Que-Hellyer Volcanics. This unit overlies dacitic facies that are possible equivalents of lithologies occurring in the footwall succession of the Hellyer and Que River VHMS deposits, and underlies black mudstone (USB 5) and polymictic quartz-bearing, mass flow-type volcaniclastic units that are likely equivalents of lithologies occurring above the Hellyer, Que River, Rosebery and Hercules VHMS deposits. Assuming that a syn-volcanic, sub-seafloor replacement model best accounts for the formation of the Rosebery and Hercules VHMS deposits, this study proposes that the emplacement of USB 4 b in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak North area occurred immediately before, to {{at the same time as}}, the formation of the Hellyer and Que River seafloor and the Rosebery and Hercules sub-seafloor VHMS deposits in the northern Mount Read Volcanics. This major VHMS-forming event coincided with a period of quiescence in volcanic activity during which deposition of black mudstone (USB 5 and possible correlates) occurred in the northern Mount Read Volcanics. Prior to the formation of the VHMS deposits, at approximately 503 Ma, major explosive eruptions generated the rhyolitic pumice breccia of the Footwall Member of the Hercules Pumice Formation in the Rosebery-Hercules area (SSW of Sock Creek-Burns Peak), and feldspar-phyric rhyolitic to dacitic and minor feldspar-quartz-phyric rhyolitic lavas, domes and minor cryptodomes were emplaced in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak (USB 1) and White Spur-Howards Road area (correlated with the Central Volcanic Complex), and presumably also in the Hellyer-Mount Charter area (NE of Sock Creek-Burns Peak). Dacitic-andesitic volcanic centres in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area and basaltic-andesitic-dacitic volcanic centres in the Hellyer-Mount Charter area developed probably at the same time as the Host-rock Member of the Hercules Pumice Formation and back mudstone accumulated slowly over an approximately 3 -million-year period in the Rosebery-Hercules area. The VHMS deposits mark the only chronostratigraphic horizon at approximately 500 Ma. The mixed sequence of the Que-Hellyer Volcanics accumulated in the Hellyer-Mount Charter area and its correlate (USB 4 b, polymictic volcanic breccia and sandstone) was deposited in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak North area while black mudstone continued accumulating in the Rosebery-Howards Road area. Regional, basinwide deposition of black mudstone followed in the Hellyer-Mount Charter (Que River Shale) and Sock Creek-Burns Peak (USB 5) areas at the same time as black mudstone was still accumulating in the Rosebery-Howards Road area. Following the major phase of massive sulfide formation, explosive eruptions produced the volcanic quartz-bearing units of the Hangingwall Volcaniclastics in the Rosebery-Hercules area and the White Spur Formation in the White Spur-Howards Road area. Similar volcanic quartz-bearing lithofacies were deposited at approximately the same time in the Sock Creek and Burns Peak areas (USB 7) while the Que River Shale continued accumulating in the Hellyer-Mount Charter area. Despite the lack of evidence for the presence of economically significant mineral deposits in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area, USB 4 b represents the lithostratigraphic unit in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area favorable for the formation of Hellyer-Que River-like seafloor VHMS deposits, and the volcano-sedimentary succession in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area below the top of USB 4 b is potentially prospective for Rosebery-Herculeslike sub-seafloor VHMS deposits. This stratigraphic interval includes dominantly coherent feldspar-quartzphyric rhyolite and feldspar-phyric dacite, and monomictic rhyolite and dacite breccia facies of USB 1 (upper Central Volcanic Complex) that are equivalent to the stratigraphic level at which the Rosebery and Hercules sub-seafloor VHMS deposits occur. Tracing USB 4 b to the SW and further investigating the volcanosedimentary succession below the top of USB 4 b in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area may assist in future VHMS exploration. The volcanic footwall and host successions to the VHMS deposits at Hellyer and Que River (feldspar-phyric andesites and basalts, and polymictic volcanic breccia, sandstone and mudstone) and at Rosebery and Hercules (feldspar-phyric fiamme breccia, and pumice-rich sandstone and siltstone) are very different in character and do not constitute good exploration guides to other VHMS deposits elsewhere in the northern MRV. They were deposited synchronously with the emplacement of partly extrusive rhyolite and dacite cryptodomes, domes and lavas, and andesitic to <b>basaltic</b> lavas and <b>domes</b> in the Sock Creek-Burns Peak area. However, the hanging wall successions at all deposits comprise black mudstone and mass flow-type, volcanic quartz-bearing volcaniclastic units that are excellent stratigraphic markers for VHMS exploration...|$|R
