5|$|It is {{typically}} thought {{to affect the}} <b>big</b> <b>toe,</b> but it affects {{other parts of the}} feet as well, including the bottom of the foot (plantar surface). The occurrence of purple toe syndrome may require discontinuation of warfarin.|$|E
5|$|After missing {{only two}} games out of 246 {{in his first}} three years of NBA play, Yao endured an {{extended}} period on the inactive list in his fourth season after developing osteomyelitis in the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> on his left foot, and surgery was performed on the toe on December 18, 2005. Despite missing 21 games while recovering, Yao again had the most fan votes to start the 2006 NBA All-Star Game.|$|E

5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and swollen joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{can present}} in {{multiple}} ways, although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis (a red, tender, hot, swollen joint). The metatarsal-phalangeal joint {{at the base}} of the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> is affected most often, accounting for half of cases. Other joints, such as the heels, knees, wrists and fingers, may also be affected. Joint pain usually begins over 2–4hours and during the night. This is mainly due to lower body temperature. Other symptoms may rarely occur along with the joint pain, including fatigue and a high fever.|$|E
5|$|Their feet {{have four}} long toes and an opposable <b>big</b> <b>toe.</b> Orangutans can grasp things with both {{their hands and}} their feet. Their fingers and toes are curved, {{allowing}} them {{to get a better}} grip on branches. Since their hip joints have the same flexibility as their shoulder and arm joints, orangutans have less restriction in the movements of their legs than humans have. Unlike gorillas and chimpanzees, orangutans are not true knuckle-walkers, and are instead fist-walkers.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is similar to}} several syndromes that share its features. Brachydactyly of the distal phalanges, sensorineural deafness and pulmonary stenosis are common with Keutel syndrome. In Muenke syndrome, developmental delay, distal brachydactyly and sensorineural hearing loss are reported; features of Teunissen-Cremers syndrome include nasal aberrations and broadness of the thumbs and <b>big</b> <b>toes,</b> also with brachydactyly. Broad thumbs and <b>big</b> <b>toes</b> are primary characteristics of Rubinstein syndrome.|$|R

5|$|After the World Cup England {{lost the}} annual Home Championship to Scotland after a 3–2 defeat in April 1967, Charlton scored {{for the second}} {{successive}} international game running after also finding the net against Wales the previous November. He injured his foot during the game as he broke two sesamoid bones in his <b>big</b> <b>toe.</b> As his career went on he began to miss England games with niggling injuries {{so as to avoid}} friendly games in favour of playing important matches for Leeds; Brian Labone would take his place in the England team during Charlton's absences. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not feature in either of England's games. He won five caps in 1969, helping England to a memorable 5–0 win over France and scoring in a 1–0 win over Portugal from a corner taken by his brother Bobby.|$|E
5|$|Milt Joyce, {{a county}} {{supervisor}} {{and owner of}} the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from the Oriental Saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday. Joyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the <b>big</b> <b>toe.</b> Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2014–15 season, Durant was {{diagnosed}} with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors, returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points. He then sprained his left <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> in late January. On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot, and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery. In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anomalies}} {{affecting the}} digits (fingers and toes) {{have been observed}} with the syndrome. A broadening of the thumbs and <b>big</b> <b>toes</b> (halluces) was reported in two brothers. The broadening was apparent in all distal phalanges of the fingers, although the pinkies were unaffected yet appeared to be clinodactylic (warped, or bent toward the other fingers). Additional eports described this broadness of the thumbs and <b>big</b> <b>toes,</b> with brachydactyly (shortness) in the distal phalanges of the other digits except the pinkies in affected individuals. On X-rays of a two-year-old boy with the disorder, the brachydactyly was shown {{to be caused by}} shortening of epiphyses (joint-ends) of the distal phalanges. The broadness and brachydactyly of the <b>big</b> <b>toes</b> in particular may give them a stunted, rounded and stub-like appearance.|$|R

5|$|The 1948 Cleveland Indians {{season began}} with Black {{maintaining}} {{a spot in}} the starting rotation. He had spent the off-season selling tickets for the Indians in Hot Springs, Arkansas. After signing a new contract, Black earned his first victory of 1948 on May 23 in a doubleheader against the New York Yankees, winning 51 in the second game. Early on in the season, due to the Indians' pitching depth, Black, along with Al Gettel and Bob Muncrief, lost their starting jobs and were moved to the bullpen, though there were plans to still use Black occasionally as a starter. He missed some playing time in June {{as the result of a}} bone chip in his left <b>big</b> <b>toe,</b> suffered during batting practice. He pitched for the Indians for most of the rest of the season, making ten starts in 18 total appearances, finishing the season with two wins and losses, a 5.37 ERA, and 52 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|In a {{symbolic}} act, the first rivet placed into the skin, fixing a copper plate onto the statue's <b>big</b> <b>toe,</b> {{was driven by}} United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton. The skin was not, however, crafted in exact sequence from low to high; work proceeded {{on a number of}} segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors. Some work was performed by contractors—one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban. By 1882, the statue was complete up to the waist, an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue. Laboulaye died in 1883. He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the Suez Canal. The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4, 1884, and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York. The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal; by January 1885, this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (<b>big</b> <b>toe)</b> ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E

25|$|The feet of H.nbsp&floresiensis were unusually {{flat and}} unusually long in {{relation}} {{with the rest of}} the body. As a result, when walking, it would have had to bend its knees further back than modern people do. This forced the gait to be high stepped and walking speed to be low. The toes had an unusual shape and the <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> was very short.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{technique}} {{is also evident}} from a dancer's body alignment, by visualizing a straight line that extends {{from the center of}} the hip through the toes. When a properly aligned dancer is viewed from the side, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> joints. When viewed from the front, the line passes through the knee, ankle joint, and the joints of the second toe or middle toe or the area between those toe joints. In cases of unusually high instep or metatarsal joint flexibility, it is sometimes necessary to flex the toes to achieve proper alignment.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{study of}} the CT scan of the mummy of Ramesses III's body by Sahar Saleem revealed that the left <b>big</b> <b>toe</b> was likely chopped by a heavy sharp object like an ax. There were no signs of bone healing so this injury must have happened shortly before death. The embalmers placed a prosthesis-like object made of linen {{in place of the}} amputated toe. The embalmers placed six amulets around both feet and ankles for magical healing of the wound for the life after. This additional injury of the foot supports the assassination of the Pharaoh, likely by the hands of multiple assailants using different weapons.|$|E
