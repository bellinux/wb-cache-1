Contradictorily, those compressed by punch set with <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> required less binder and formed thinner tablets (5.7  mm, 1.73  g) {{and passed the}} friability test. The effervescent tablets that were compressed with the punches without <b>bevel</b> <b>edge</b> (Notoli Descriptions of Goods, 2017) lost more than 1 % weight thus failed the friability test (Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, General Chapters, 2017). The breakage was mainly due to simple tensile failure with slightly shear failure at one platen edge (Aulton & Taylor, 2013; Bubb, 2011).|$|R

Edge effects influence {{the result of}} the digital image correlation technique since some part of the analysed area extends outside the speckled surface. This <b>bevel</b> on the <b>edges</b> causes additional wasted information and can also locally affect the strains in the speckled surface since there is no contact between the tools and the <b>bevelled</b> <b>edges.</b> The purpose of the hole in the samples was to decrease the forces to similar levels as previously obtained during shearing in the experimental set-up (Gustafsson et al. 2016 b; Gustafsson et al. 2016 a) with a maintained image area and visibility of the imaged surface.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bevelled</b> <b>edge</b> (UK) or beveled edge (US) {{refers to}} an edge of a {{structure}} that is not perpendicular to {{the faces of the}} piece. The words bevel and chamfer overlap in usage; in general usage they are often interchanged, while in technical usage they may sometimes be differentiated as shown in the image at right. A bevel is typically used to soften the edge of a piece for the sake of safety, wear resistance, or aesthetics; or to facilitate mating with another piece.|$|R
