40|$|This paper {{presents}} comprehensive {{data and}} their interpretation {{on the plate}} bonding repair technique in terms of effects of plate thickness and end anchorage on ductility, ultimate load, and mode of failure. Reinforced concrete (RC) beams were preloaded to 85 percent of their ultimate capacity and subsequently repaired by bonding steel plates of different thicknesses with and without end anchorages. Anchor bolts were used for end anchorages. The repaired beams showed higher strength than the original beams, provided the plates did not exceed a certain limiting thickness. Increasing the plate thickness changed the mode of failure of the repaired beams from flexural to premature failure, developed due to shear and/or tearing of the plate, causing a reduction in ductility. End anchorages to the bonded plates could not prevent the premature failure of the beams but improved ductility with decreasing significance as the plate thickness increased, and yielded a marginal improvement in ultimate strength. A procedure for designing the <b>bonding</b> <b>plate</b> to avoid premature failure is suggested...|$|E

40|$|A {{convenient}} and efficient method for strengthening and stiffening existing reinforced concrete beams is to adhesively <b>bond</b> steel <b>plates</b> to their surfaces. However, tests {{have shown that}} adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>plates</b> tend to peel away prematurely due to flexure and shear.

40|$|The {{technique}} of adhesively bonding steel or fiber-reinforced plastic plates to {{the surfaces of}} reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements is being adopted worldwide to strengthen or repair reinforced concrete buildings and bridges. However, the prevention of premature debonding or peeling of externally <b>bonded</b> <b>plates</b> is a most critical aspect of design. One of the major modes of debonding in plated RC beams is shear peeling induced by the formation of critical diagonal cracks caused by the applied vertical shear forces. In this paper, mathematical models are developed for quantifying the shear peeling resistance of RC beams <b>bonded</b> with <b>plates</b> of different configurations. These models {{are based on the}} simplified theory of plasticity concepts for shear in reinforced concrete beams and also on procedures to compute the bond strength between an adhesively <b>bonded</b> <b>plate</b> and a concrete element. The models are validated against 32 test results from reinforced concrete beams adhesively bonded with either steel plates or steel angles attached to the tension faces, or tension face <b>plated</b> beams additionally <b>bonded</b> with side <b>plates</b> to improve their shear peeling resistance.

40|$|In this paper, an {{intensity}} of singular stress field for a bonded cylinder is {{compared with the}} one for a <b>bonded</b> <b>plate,</b> which was obtained in the previous studies accurately. The analytical method focuses on the stress values at the interface corner edge obtained by performing FE analyses on the unknown and reference models which are subdivided by the same mesh pattern. It is found that this analytical method which is useful for analyzing the <b>bonded</b> <b>plate</b> cannot be directly applied to the bonded cylinder because the strain in the circumferential direction causes non-singular stress component affecting singular stress evaluation. In order to eliminate the non-singular terms, they are expressed explicitly from the interfacial continuity conditions and the stress-free boundary conditions at the interface corner edge. Since the intensity of singular stress field for the bonded cylinder cannot be controlled by Dundurs 2 ̆ 7 parameter uniquely, the maximum and minimum values of the intensities of singular stress field are shown in {{the table and the}} chart according to Dundurs 2 ̆ 7 parameter.

This paper presents {{the details of a}} partial interaction model that is capable of analysing such bond failure in FRP-to-concrete joints.

40|$|Abstract Retrofitting {{by plating}} {{structures}} {{has been found}} to be very efficient. However, tests have shown that externally <b>bonded</b> longitudinal <b>plates</b> are prone to premature debonding. Furthermore, a comprehensive study of published research has also shown that there can be large discrepancies between debonding mathematical models and tests. To overcome this problem and to allow structural engineers to adhesively <b>bond</b> <b>plates</b> with safety and efficiently, a structural engineering approach is suggested whereby many of the debonding mechanisms can be prevented by judicious detailing; this approach can be applied to tension face plates, compression face plates, side plates, U-sectioned plates, and angle-sectioned plates.
