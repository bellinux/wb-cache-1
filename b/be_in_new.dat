5|$|Following {{seven months}} in Mexico, Middleton's return to Galveston brought a special anticipation. He had {{proposed}} to Jerusha Collins {{at an earlier}} time, and renewed the proposal upon his return. The couple was married on 6 January 1915, and this allowed them to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans two days later {{with other members of}} Middleton's unit for the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in which the 7th Regiment had served a century earlier. After a week in New Orleans, the couple returned to Galveston, and were invited to move into the Hagemann's house, where they were given a large upstairs room.|$|E
25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortexâ€”neighboring place cells are as likely to have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>new</b> places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E
25|$|AGU holds annual {{meetings}} in San Francisco every December (known as the Fall meeting) and every Spring (April through May) in {{locations around the}} world. The latter grew out of AGU's annual Spring meeting, which had been held {{for many years in}} Baltimore, until declining interest caused AGU to move the meeting to different locations, starting with Boston in 1998. With the 2003 meeting in Nice, France, it became known as the Joint Assembly because AGU co-sponsors it with other societies such as the Geochemical Society, the Mineralogical Society of America (MSA), the Canadian Geophysical Union (CGU), and the European Geosciences Union (EGU). The Fall Meeting had more than 20,000 attendees in 2012. Because of renovations at the San Francisco venue, the 2017 meeting will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans and the 2018 in Washington, DC.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan will be an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>new</b> appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|Scooter's uncle J.P. Grosse {{owns the}} theatre, and rents {{it to the}} Muppets, as Scooter is {{only too happy to}} remind Kermit. In a deleted scene from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, Kermit reveals that J.P. has died and left the theatre to the Muppets in his will. This would have taken place some time after 1996, as J.P. can be seen (and {{referred}} to as such by the head of the KMUP network) in episode 107 of Muppets Tonight, the 1990s reworking of The Muppet Show. The Muppet Theater is shown to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City as Rachel Bitterman plots to tear down the Muppet Theater and build a club. She is thwarted when Pepe the King Prawn manages to get the Muppet Theater to be made into a national landmark.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, [...] "Sheena Is a Punk Rocker" [...] was {{released}} as a single, being an outtake from the band's previous release, Leave Home. This period was extremely significant to the punk rock genre, {{as it was the}} initial wave of New York City's underground punk bands receiving recording contracts. New York-based clubs CBGB and Max's Kansas City began to see bigger audiences crowd in to hear these bands. Punk fans commonly believed that this musical style would soon top the market, to which author Tom Carson explains: [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York that summer was to have some sense of what it might have been like to live in San Francisco in 1966 or '67, or in London when the Beatles and the [...] Stones first hit." ...|$|E
500|$|The Allied command {{structure}} was soon put under strain by Australian reverses in the Kokoda Track campaign. MacArthur was {{highly critical of}} the Australian performance, and confided to the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General George Marshall, that [...] "the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking." [...] MacArthur told Curtin that Blamey should be sent up to New Guinea to take personal command of the situation. Curtin later confessed that [...] "in my ignorance (of military matters) I thought that the Commander in Chief should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Guinea." [...] Jack Beasley suggested that Blamey would make a convenient scapegoat: [...] "Moresby is going to fall. Send Blamey up there and let him fall with it!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what pain I must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know my own mind, and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could never think otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E

500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like. As she felt the song was different for the band, Lee knew that they didn't want to [...] "go the classic, sort of fantastic, epic [...]" [...] Lee asked her sister Carrie to help her around {{the concept of the}} video. Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York. You guys need to do something different, this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I {{was trying to get}} that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, [...] "Originally {{we were supposed to be}} in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque." [...] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man3 and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee creditâ€”placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads [...] "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" [...] though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.|$|E

500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musiciansâ€”including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manningâ€”whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichÃ©s and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams {{had played}} over 100 dates with Journey during 1983, {{serving as the}} opening act on their Frontiers Tour. During that time, he and Jim Vallance co-wrote [...] "Heaven", which was {{inspired}} by Journey's hit [...] "Faithfully". It was recorded at the Power Station in New York City on June 6 and 7, 1983. Halfway through the recording session, drummer Mickey Curry â€“ who had warned Adams about his limited availability that day â€“ {{announced that he had}} to leave since he had committed in advance to a Hall & Oates session. Since the recording session for [...] "Heaven" [...] was running behind schedule, Adams called Journey drummer Steve Smith, who happened to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City at the time and he filled Curry's drumming position. The song first appeared on the soundtrack to the 1983 film, A Night in Heaven, although it was not released as a single at that time.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the draft}} {{was put to}} {{referendum}} in New South Wales in 1899, Reid (Free Trade Premier from 1894 to 1899), adopted an equivocal position, earning him the nickname [...] "Yes-No Reid." [...] The draft was rejected, mainly because New South Wales voters thought it gave the proposed Senate, which would be dominated by the smaller states, too much power. Reid was able to bargain with the other Premiers to modify the draft so that it suited New South Wales interests, and the draft was then approved. On 1 January 1901, following a proclamation by Queen Victoria, New South Wales {{ceased to be a}} self-governing colony and became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. Although the new Governor-General and Prime Minister were sworn in in Sydney, Melbourne was to be the temporary seat of government until the permanent seat of government was established. This was to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> South Wales, but at least 100 miles (160km) from Sydney. The first Prime Minister (Barton) the first Opposition Leader (Reid) and the first Labor leader (Chris Watson) were all from New South Wales.|$|E
2500|$|Nilsson's next album, Harry (1969), was {{his first}} to hit the charts, and also {{provided}} a Top 40 single with [...] "I Guess the Lord Must <b>Be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City" [...] (written as a contender for the theme to Midnight Cowboy), used in the Sophia Loren movie La Mortadella (1971) (US title: Lady Liberty). While the album still presented Nilsson as primarily a songwriter, his astute choice of cover material included, this time, a song by then-little-known composer Randy Newman, [...] "Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear". Nilsson {{was so impressed with}} Newman's talent that he devoted his entire next album to Newman compositions, with Newman himself playing piano behind Nilsson's multi-tracked vocals. The result, Nilsson Sings Newman (1970), was commercially disappointing but was named Record of the Year by Stereo Review magazine and provided momentum to Newman's career. The self-produced Nilsson Sings Newman also marked the end of his collaboration with RCA staff producer Rick Jarrard, who recounted in the Nilsson documentary that the partnership was terminated by a telegram from Nilsson, who abruptly informed Jarrard that he wanted to work with other producers, and the two never met or spoke again.|$|E
