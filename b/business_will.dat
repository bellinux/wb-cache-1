Based on the Littlest Pet Shop and Blythe toys owned by Hasbro, the show follows Blythe Baxter, {{a teenage girl}} who, after moving into an apartment in a metropolitan area, gains {{the ability to communicate}} with animals. Located below her apartment is the eponymous pet store where Blythe works and talks to a group of pets who regularly reside at a day care in the shop.

5|$|While Ike Clanton {{later said}} he was {{planning}} to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some <b>business.</b> <b>Will</b> McLaury, Tom and Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth. Will McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline, in Iowa. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.|$|E

25|$|Any {{event that}} could {{negatively}} impact operations {{is included in}} the plan, such as supply chain interruption, loss of or damage to critical infrastructure (major machinery or computing /network resource). As such, BCP is a subset of risk management. In the US, government entities refer to the process as continuity of operations planning (COOP). A Business Continuity Plan outlines a range of disaster scenarios and the steps the <b>business</b> <b>will</b> take in any particular scenario to return to regular trade. BCP's are written ahead of time and can also include precautions to be put in place. Usually created with the input of key staff as well as stakeholders, a BCP is a set of contingencies to minimize potential harm to businesses during adverse scenarios.|$|E
25|$|Select The Preferred Policy – The authors {{suggest that}} the overall best biofuel comes from the {{sugarcane}} in Brazil after comparing the economic & the environmental costs. The current cost of subsidising the price difference between European biofuels and fossil fuels per tonne of CO2 emissions saved is calculated to be €229–2000. If the production of European biofuels for transport is to be encouraged, exemption from excise duties is the instrument that incurs the least transactions costs, as no separate administrative or collection system needs to be established. A number of entrepreneurs are producing biofuels at the lower margin of the costs specified here profitably, once an excise duty rebate is given. It is likely that growth in {{the volume of the}} <b>business</b> <b>will</b> engender both economies of scale and innovation that will reduce costs substantially.|$|E

[...] The Observer commented that [...] "the acting, {{as well as the}} <b>business,</b> <b>will</b> want working up before it can be fairly criticized... the opera... was not ready".

50|$|However, {{the risks}} of private {{businesses}} do {{differ from those of}} traded securities. Therefore, a portfolio of traded assets that best hedges the risk of typical private <b>businesses</b> <b>will</b> enjoy excess demand from private <b>business</b> owners. This <b>will</b> cause the price of the assets in this portfolio to be bid up relative to the price predicted by the CAPM ,causing a lower expected return in relation to systematic risk. Conversely, securities with risks highly correlated to {{the risks of}} private <b>businesses</b> <b>will</b> have high equilibrium risk premiums, causing a higher expected return in relation to systematic risk; or positive alphas. This has been confirmed by empirical tests by Heaton and Lucas (2000). Thus, private businesses can only be imperfectly hedged using traded securities and therefore still cause deviations from the CAPM.|$|R
