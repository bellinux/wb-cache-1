25|$|Assessment of the NVA/PAVN fighter. Compared {{to their}} VC {{counterparts}} most NVA {{had a higher}} standard of literacy. While his preparation was not especially impressive by Western standards, the typical NVA soldier proved more than adequate for the task at hand. NVA training was surprisingly conventional, with little special emphasis on jungle warfare. Most of the troops' learning occurred on the job. Service and indoctrination under the communist system prior to army recruitment made the typical NVA fighter a <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and more seasoned than his American or ARVN opponent. Throughout the conflict, NVA defections and surrenders were extremely low, especially compared to that of the VC, a testimony to their motivation and organization.|$|E

500|$|As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the {{recurring}} character of Commander Norman, chief of {{air traffic control}} at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen. Shane Rimmer, the voice of Scott, was cast {{on the strength of}} his performance on the BBC soap opera Compact. Meanwhile, fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process. The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: [...] "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother.

500|$|The album {{title is}} rooted in the idea of [...] "yielding to nature," [...] a theme central to Daniel Quinn's novel Ishmael. The band members read the book while working on the album. Regarding the title, McCready said, [...] "I think the title Yield has to do with maybe being more {{comfortable}} within ourselves, with this band....we're all a little <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and a little more relaxed and maybe just kind of yielding to those anxieties and not trying to fight it so much...That's what it kind of feels to me– yielding, letting something else happen and going with it." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Let's say that hypothetically speaking, the title does mean something...You can fight so much, {{and then you have to}} think, 'What are the real battles?'

500|$|The most {{important}} thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie [...] "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it [...] "made more sense" [...] to make the characters older.|$|E

Walt Disney introduced Aurora to Costa as [...] "a very layered character", describing her as [...] "different. She's calm, yet she's playful. She {{has a sense}} of humor, and she has an imagination." [...] Despite popular opinion that Aurora is a very passive character, Costa believes that the princess is actually [...] "very strong", citing her urge to defy her guardians as an example of her strength, while referring to the character as [...] "a beautiful personification of femininity." [...] Raised exclusively by three women in a very sheltered environment, Aurora had never been exposed to a man prior to meeting Phillip. Costa believes that, because of this, Aurora is [...] "innately romantic" [...] as opposed to simply lonely, explaining, there [...] "was a certain part of her that maybe she didn’t realize that was just so romantic and maybe expecting something that she didn’t even know what", and credits {{the fact that she was}} raised by three older women as opposed to her parents with making her [...] "a little <b>bit</b> <b>older,</b> and yet, she ... had this young outreaching spirit." [...] A very loving character, Aurora enjoyed her lonely life as much as she did because she had never experienced anything else. Additionally, the character's close companionship with woodland creatures is used to demonstrate that she is a loving individual.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the actress}} playing Ian's mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) was fair-haired, they also {{wanted him to}} be fair, and because of Taylforth's age he also had to look very young. Ian was meant to be 14 years old when the {{programme}} first aired, but because of licensing regulations, the actor cast was required to be a 16-year-old who could [...] "play down". Adam Woodyatt, born in East London, had worked as an actor in his youth, but had given it up and relocated with his family to Wales. He was recruited from his old agency and it was decided that he was perfect for the part and he was subsequently cast as Ian Beale. In 1990 Ian's age was increased and he celebrated his twenty-first birthday two years after his eighteenth. The producers felt Ian needed to be a <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and more mature for storylines planned for him later that year.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{fears of}} {{instability}} {{that might be}} caused, the cabinet of ministers decided not to publicly proclaim the death of Menelik II. As a result, Iyasu was never officially proclaimed as Emperor Iyasu V. However, both Menelik's death and Iyasu's de facto accession were widely known and accepted. The Church authorities, the Lord Regent Ras Tessema, and the ministers agreed that Iyasu's coronation should be postponed until he was a <b>bit</b> <b>older</b> and had taken Holy Communion with his wife, which would make his marriage insoluble {{in the eyes of}} the Orthodox Church. However, Iyasu quickly encountered problems with his rule and he was never crowned. He was widely disliked by the nobility for his unstable behavior, and the church held him in suspicion for his alleged Muslim sympathies. After a troubled few years, Iyasu was removed from power. Zewditu was summoned to the capital, and on 27 September 1916, the Council of State and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church officially announced the death of Emperor Menelik II and deposed Iyasu in favour of Zewditu.

2500|$|Palmeiro re-signed {{with the}} Baltimore Orioles in 2004, on a 1-year, $4,000,000 contract.

[...] He also said he didn't want to retire until he rejoined the Orioles {{and if he was}} {{inducted}} to the Hall of Fame, he would do so as an Oriole. His power fell significantly his first season back with the Orioles, having 142 hits, along with 23 home runs, 88 RBIs and a [...]258 batting average, all drops from the previous season. Despite this, he became one of only four players (the other three being Ken Griffey Jr, Mark McGwire, and Manny Ramírez) in history to hit at least 200 home runs for two different clubs, doing so on September 13, 2004 off Justin Miller. Entering 2005, he was just 78 hits shy of 3,000. He hit his 563rd home run that season, passing Reggie Jackson on the all-time list. Just a few weeks later, on July 15, Palmeiro joined Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Alex Rodriguez, and Eddie Murray as the only players in major league history to get 3,000 hits and 500 home runs. Not long after his achievement, Palmeiro was suspended 10 days for testing positive for steroids. [...] He claimed he received a tainted vitamin b12 shot from Miguel Tejada. Upon returning, he only played a few more games. [...] He was booed by the home fans. [...] He was sent home due to a nagging injury, but was told to stay home – largely because of his attempt to implicate his teammate. [...] As of April 2016, he has yet to return to Baltimore. In his final season, he had 98 hits, 18 home runs, 60 RBIs and a [...]266 batting average in 110 total games played.|$|E
