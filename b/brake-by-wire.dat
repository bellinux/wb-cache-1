5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that {{it would not have been}} possible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's <b>brake-by-wire</b> system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|The top ten contested {{the third}} part of qualifying. Romain Grosjean was unable to post a lap time after having problem with his <b>brake-by-wire</b> system. At the {{beginning}} of the session, both Mercedes drivers set two fast laps. After the first time around, Rosberg was ahead of Hamilton, but the World Champion improved on his second lap, being two-tenths of a second faster than his teammate. During their final flying laps {{at the end of the}} session, both drivers spun on different parts of the track, Hamilton in turn one and Rosberg in the final corner, meaning the order remained, with Hamilton taking the 45th pole position of his career, drawing level with Sebastian Vettel, who qualified third. Last year's pole sitter Felipe Massa followed in fourth, while Le Mans winner Nico Hülkenberg finished fifth, ahead of the second Williams of Valtteri Bottas.|$|E
25|$|New to the GS {{line was}} an {{electric}} power steering (EPS) system, and both the V8 and hybrid models featured a variable gear ratio steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of <b>brake-by-wire</b> system. V8 and hybrid models also featured an adaptive suspension system that individually altered suspension damper firmness. Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) was standard on the GS 430, 460, and 450h models and coupled to VGRS, with which it could alter steering gear ratios.|$|E
25|$|Also {{new to the}} GS {{line was}} an Electric Power Steering (EPS) system {{replacing}} the previous model's hydraulic steering pump, while the V8 model featured a Variable Gear Ratio Steering (VGRS) system and Electronically Controlled Brake (ECB) a type of <b>brake-by-wire</b> system. In August 2005, the GS 430 was the first car by Toyota with Adaptive Variable Suspension (AVS). AVS monitors and adjusts the shock-absorber settings at each wheel, depending on the conditions. On rough roads, for example, damping is reduced for a more comfortable ride. And, while cornering, the suspension is tightened to help reduce body lean and provide even greater responsiveness. Using the EPS system the GS can automatically compensate for crosswinds.|$|E
500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were dazzled by lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due to aquaplaning, spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his <b>brake-by-wire</b> system were incompatible.|$|E
2500|$|The SLR {{features}} Sensotronic Brake Control, {{a type of}} <b>brake-by-wire</b> system.

5000|$|A <b>brake-by-wire</b> system, by nature, is {{a safety}} {{critical}} system and therefore fault tolerance is a vitally important characteristic of this system. As a result, a <b>brake-by-wire</b> system is designed in such way that many of its essential information would be derived {{from a variety of}} sources (sensors) and be handled by more than the bare necessity hardware. Three main types of redundancy usually exist in a <b>brake-by-wire</b> system: ...|$|E
50|$|Examples include {{electronic}} throttle control and <b>brake-by-wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} utilize the {{existing}} redundancy, voting algorithms need to be evaluated, modified and adopted to meet the stringent requirements of a <b>brake-by-wire</b> system. Reliability, fault tolerance and accuracy are the main targeted outcomes of the voting techniques that should be developed especially for redundancy resolution inside a <b>brake-by-wire</b> system.|$|E

50|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, <b>brake-by-wire</b> {{technology is the}} ability to control brakes through electrical means. It can be designed to supplement ordinary service brakes or it can be a standalone brake system.|$|E
50|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} on all hybrid and battery electric vehicles, including the Toyota Prius. <b>Brake-by-wire</b> is also common {{in the form of}} the electric park brake which is now widely used on mainstream vehicles.|$|E
50|$|In {{the current}} <b>brake-by-wire</b> systems used in {{passenger}} and light truck vehicles, {{the system is}} designed to use existing sensors that have been proven to be dependable in brake system components and systems including ABS and VSC systems.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2016 the NTSB has not {{directly}} investigated passenger car and light truck <b>brake-by-wire</b> vehicle accidents, and the manufacturers {{have taken the}} position that their vehicles are completely safe, and that all reported accidents {{are the result of}} [...] "driver error".|$|E
50|$|Regenerative and {{friction}} braking must both be used, creating {{the need to}} control them to produce the required total braking. The GM EV-1 was the first commercial car to do this. In 1997 and 1998 engineers Abraham Farag and Loren Majersik were issued two patents for this <b>brake-by-wire</b> technology.|$|E
50|$|Wheel speed {{data are}} also vital in a <b>brake-by-wire</b> system to avoid skidding. The {{design of a}} <b>brake-by-wire</b> car should provide {{safeguards}} against missing some of the data samples provided by the safety-critical sensors. Popular solutions are to provide redundant sensors and to apply a fail-safe mechanism. In addition to a complete sensor loss, the electronic control unit may also suffer an intermittent (temporary) data loss. For example, sensor data can sometimes fail to reach the electronic control unit. This may happen due to a temporary problem with the sensor itself or with the data transmission path. It may also result from an instantaneous short circuit or disconnection, a communication network fault, or a sudden increase in noise. In such cases, for a safe operation, the system has to be compensated for missing data samples.|$|E
50|$|A {{lithium-ion}} battery placed between the floor holds 24 kWh of usable charge. An electric motor is transversely mounted {{at the front}} of the vehicle, the electric motor delivers through the front wheels and uses a single-speed transmission. The vehicle will also incorporate shift-by-wire, <b>brake-by-wire</b> and steer-by-wire contactless technology, and LED matrix technology for the headlights and tail lights.|$|E
50|$|In a <b>brake-by-wire</b> car, some sensors are safety-critical components, {{and their}} failure will disrupt the vehicle {{function}} and endanger human lives. Two examples are the brake pedal sensors and the wheel speed sensors. The {{electronic control unit}} must always be informed of the driver’s intentions to brake or to stop the vehicle. Therefore, missing the pedal sensor data {{is a serious problem}} for functionality of the vehicle control system.|$|E
5000|$|The caliper {{controller}} {{controls the}} position and speed of the brake actuator (besides its main task which is tracking of its reference brake command). Thus, position and speed sensors are vitally required in each e-caliper and an efficient design of a measurement mechanism to sense {{the position and}} speed of the actuator is required. Recent designs for <b>brake-by-wire</b> systems use resolvers to provide accurate and continuous measurements for both absolute position and speed of the [...] of the actuators. Incremental encoders are relative position sensors and their additive error needs to be calibrated or compensated for by different methods. Unlike the encoders, resolvers provide two output signals that always allow the detection of absolute angular position. In addition, they suppress common mode noise and are especially useful in a noisy environment. Because of these reasons, resolvers are usually applied {{for the purpose of}} position and speed measurement in <b>brake-by-wire</b> systems. However, nonlinear and robust observers are required to extract accurate position and speed estimates from the sinusoidal signals provided by resolvers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake-by-wire</b> {{exists on}} heavy duty {{commercial}} vehicles {{under the name}} Electronic Braking System (EBS). This system provides electronic activation of all braking system components including retarder and engine brake. EBS also supports trailers and communicates between the towing vehicle and trailer using the ISO 11992 protocol. The communication between trailer and towing vehicle shall be done through a specific connector dedicated to ABS/EBS following either ISO 7638-1 for 24V systems or ISO 7638-2 for 12V systems.|$|E

50|$|Some {{x-by-wire}} {{technologies have}} been already installed on commercial vehicles such as steer-by-wire, and throttle-by-wire. <b>Brake-by-wire</b> {{technology has been}} widely commercialized {{with the introduction of}} Battery Electric Vehicles and Hybrid Vehicles. The most widely used application by Toyota in the high volume Prius was preceded by the GM EV1, the Rav4 EV, and other EVs where the technology is required for regenerative braking. Ford, General Motors, and most other manufacturers use the same general design, with the exception of Honda, who designed a notably different design.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brake-by-wire</b> {{is used in}} all common hybrid and {{electric}} vehicles produced since 1998 including all Toyota, Ford, and General Motors Electric and hybrid models. The Toyota Synergy Drive and the Rav4 EV use a system where a modified ABS (antilock brake system) actuator is coupled with a special hydraulic brake master cylinder to create a hydraulic system, coupled with the brake control unit (computer).Ford's system is almost identical to the Toyota system, and the General Motors system uses different nomenclature for components while the operation is virtually identical.|$|E
50|$|For the 2014 season, {{the power}} {{output of the}} MGU-K (The {{replacement}} of the KERS {{and part of the}} ERS system that also includes a turbocharger waste heat recovery system) increased from 60 kW to 120 kW and it is allowed to recover 2 mega-joules per lap. This was to balance the sport's move from 2.4 litre V8 engines to 1.6 litre V6 engines. The fail-safe settings of the <b>brake-by-wire</b> system that now supplements KERS came under examination as a contributing factor in the crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|On June 9, 2008, Honda {{revealed}} a CBR600RR prototype {{that had an}} all new braking system branded as Combined ABS which integrated combined braking, anti-lock braking, and <b>brake-by-wire</b> systems. Combined ABS used a computer control unit to ensure the correct balance of front and rear brake use and also controlled when the ABS should engage. The system {{was designed to be}} as unobtrusive as possible by delaying the engagement of the ABS until the last possible moment. Combined ABS was not made available on the production 2008 CBR600RR.|$|E
5000|$|Electric park brakes (EPB) {{are used}} on {{passenger}} vehicles {{to hold the}} vehicle stationary on grades and flat roads. This was accomplished traditionally using a manual parking brake. With electric park brakes, the driver activates the holding mechanism with a button and the brake pads are then electrically applied onto the rear brakes. This is accomplished by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an actuator mechanism. There are two mechanisms that are currently in production: 1. Cable puller systems and 2. Caliper integrated systems. [...] EPB systems {{can be considered a}} subset of <b>Brake-by-wire</b> technology.|$|E

The session was interrupted 8 minutes in by yellow flags when Esteban Ocon of Force India crashed in the swimming pool section, mimicking an incident Max Verstappen had during the 2016 qualifying session. Free practice eventually resumed with 4 minutes remaining. Daniel Ricciardo had a <b>brake-by-wire</b> failure and ended up retiring from the session, leaving him sixth with 1:13.392.

40|$|Title and {{subtitle}} Distributed <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> {{based on}} TTP/C. (Distribuerat <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> system baserat på TTP/C). <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> {{means that the}} hydraulic-mechanical brake system in a car is partly or completely replaced with an electronic/electromechanical brake system. <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> systems are safety critical. A <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> system must also be fault tolerant and have a dependable real-time performance. One communication protocol that is developed to meet these requirements is called TTP/C (Time Triggered Protocol, class C). It is a protocol where all operations are initiated and scheduled in advance. In this Master’s thesis, I have put a TTP/C system into operation and developed a simple, fault tolerant <b>Brake-By-Wire</b> system. The work is concentrating on the fault tolerant and the fault detection aspects. Also the TTP/C concept with its software development environment has been evaluated. Using TTP/C as effectively as possible requires that the developer has planned {{the implementation of the}} system carefully. The work with the TTP/C software development tools will be made easier the more that is known in advance about the system. A more detailed documentation than presently available of how to use the TTP/C tools would also facilitate the work.
