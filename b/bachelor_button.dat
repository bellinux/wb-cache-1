40|$|Ceratapion basicorne (Coleoptera: Apionidae) is a weevil {{native to}} Europe and western Asia {{that is being}} {{evaluated}} as a prospective classical biological control agent of Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle) in the United States. Host plant specificity of the insect was evaluated in no-choice oviposition experiments. Feeding on leaf tissue by adult females was highly correlated to oviposition rate, both of which occurred primarily on plants in the tribe Cardueae, and {{especially those in the}} monophyletic subtribe Centaureinae. The highest rates of larval development occurred on Ce. solstitialis and Centaurea cyanus (<b>bachelor’s</b> <b>button,</b> garden cornflower), and there was significant development on Centaurea melitensis (Napa starthistle, tocalote), Cnicus benedictus (blessed thistle), Carthamus tinctorius (safflower), and Crupina vulgaris (common crupina). All the plants that supported some larval development are within a monophyletic clade within the Centaureinae. No native North American plants appear to be at risk of significant damage by this insect. Additional testing of safflower and <b>bachelor’s</b> <b>button</b> under choice conditions should complement these results to help determine the degree to which these plants are at risk...|$|R

50|$|Centaurea montana (perennial cornflower, {{mountain}} cornflower, <b>bachelor's</b> <b>button,</b> montane knapweed or mountain bluet) is {{a species}} of Centaurea endemic to Europe. It is widespread and common in the more southerly mountain ranges of Europe, but is rarer in the north. It escapes from gardens readily, and has thereby become established in the British Isles, Scandinavia and North America.C. montana grows in meadows and open woodland in the upper montane and sub-alpine zones, in basic areas. It grows to 30 - 70 cm tall, and flowers mainly from May to August.|$|R

5000|$|Centaurea cyanus, {{commonly}} known as cornflower or <b>bachelor's</b> <b>button,</b> [...] is an annual flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to Europe. In the past it often grew as a weed in cornfields (in the broad {{sense of the word}} [...] "corn", referring to grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, or oats), hence its name. It is now endangered in its native habitat by agricultural intensification, particularly over-use of herbicides, destroying its habitat. It is also, however, through introduction as an ornamental plant in gardens and a seed contaminant in crop seeds, now naturalised in many other parts of the world, including North America and parts of Australia.|$|R
50|$|The dam of Bachelor's Double, Lady Bawn, {{was born}} at Oatlands in 1902 and was a twin to the mare Lady Black, being 20 minutes older than her sister. Twinning is a rare {{occurrence}} in horses and it was unusual for both twins to live to adulthood and rarer still for both to be successful broodmares. Lady Bawn was a half sister to the Ascot Gold Cup winner <b>Bachelor's</b> <b>Buttons.</b> Lady Bawn and Lady Black were unraced as was their sire Le Noir. Bachelor's Double was Lady Bawn's first foal and she also produced the good racers Bachelor's Hope, Bachelor's Image and Bachelor's Wedding. Lady Black produced six stakes winners, including the colts Bachelor's Charm and Melesigenes, who ran with success in India.|$|R
50|$|The school flower is {{the blue}} {{cornflower}} or <b>bachelor’s</b> <b>button,</b> Centaurea cyanus, {{was chosen by}} Miss Livingston. Graduating seniors during her era wore white dresses and carried arm bouquets of the simple blossoms. The tradition has continued with each graduating senior carrying a bouquet of the blue flowers wrapped in flowing blue ribbons, which the school called “Ragged Robins.” Actually, the Ragged Robin, Lychnis flos-cuculi, is not a cornflower at all, though like the cornflower, is naturalized as a wildflower in the Northeast. Regardless of any understandable confusion between common names for plants, Garrison Forest’s Ragged Robin is much beloved. At Garrison Forest, the term “Ragged Robins” applies to three longstanding traditions—the school flower, the yearbook, and the student a cappella group.|$|R

50|$|For many years, Shanidar 4 {{was thought}} to provide strong {{evidence}} for a Neanderthal burial ritual. Routine soil samples from around the body, gathered for pollen analysis {{in an attempt to}} reconstruct the palaeoclimate and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire flowering plants (or at least heads of plants) had entered the grave deposit. Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. Yarrow, Cornflower, <b>Bachelor's</b> <b>Button,</b> St. Barnaby's Thistle, Ragwort or Groundsel, Grape Hyacinth, Joint Pine or Woody Horsetail and Hollyhock were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have long-known curative powers as diuretics, stimulants, astringents as well as anti-inflammatory properties. This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had shamanic powers, perhaps acting as medicine man to the Shanidar Neandertals.|$|R
40|$|Centaurea solstitialis (yellow starthistle, Asteraceae) is an {{invasive}} annual weed in {{the western}} USA that is native to the Mediterranean Region and is a target for classical biological control. Aceria solstitialis is an eriophyid mite that has been found exclusively in association with Ce. solstitialis in Italy, Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria. The mite feeds on leaf tissue and damages bolting plants, causing stunting, witch’s broom and incomplete flower development. Field experiments and laboratory no-choice and two-way choice experiments were conducted to assess host plant specificity of the mite in Bulgaria. Mites showed the highest degree of host specificity {{in the field and}} lowest in the no-choice experiments. In the field, highest densities of mites occurred on Ce. solstitialis and Ce. cyanus (<b>bachelor’s</b> <b>button),</b> and either no mites or trace numbers occurred on the other test plants: Ce. diffusa (diffuse knapweed), Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) and Cynara scolymus (artichoke). In no-choice experiments, mites persisted for 60 days on Ce. diffusa, Ce. cyanus, Ce. solstitialis, Ca. tinctorius and Cy. scolymus, whereas in two-way choice experiments mites persisted on 25...|$|R

The filly won the race easily at 2/5 with St. Amant tailed off last of the six runners.

He finished a poor seventh of the nine runners behind Rock Sand in the Jockey Club Stakes, third to Lochryan in the Great Foal Stakes, third to Henry The First in the Gatwick Stakes, second to Sansovino in the Surrey Stakes and third to <b>Bachelor's</b> <b>Button</b> in the Champion Stakes.
