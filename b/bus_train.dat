5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of alcohol on a <b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the population in the USSR owned cars. Because of the widespread lack of any mode of private transport, most Soviet citizens travelled via public transport. Due to a relative shortage of cars and good-quality roads, the Soviet people travelled twice as much by <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and rapid transit as people in the First World. Soviet bus-transport, throughout most {{of the history of the}} Soviet Union, was controlled either by the regional or the republican branches of the Ministry of Transport. Since rail transit systems were more environmental and consumed little fuel, Soviet planners concentrated their efforts in constructing electricity-driven, rather than fuel-consuming transport. In the mid-1980s the government initiated a programme for compressed-gas energy for buses. By 1988 only 1.2 percent of buses used gas energy, while 30 percent used diesel. Soviet bus-enterprises ran a deficit for the first time in their history by the mid-to-late 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Public {{transport}} in Auckland, {{the largest}} metropolitan area of New Zealand, {{consists of three}} modes – <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and ferry. Services are coordinated by Auckland Transport under the AT Metro brand. Britomart Transport Centre is the main transport hub.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Auckland Transport {{simplified}} fares {{by changing}} {{to a system}} based on 13 fare zones. The fare is no longer based on the distance travelled (number of stages), but {{on the number of}} zones passed through, so that a journey in a zone that involves multiple rides or even a mode mix (<b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> ferry) will be charged only one fare.|$|E

25|$|In July 1983, the Metropolitan Transit Authority {{was formed}} to {{integrate}} Melbourne's tram, train, and bus services. The Metropolitan Transit Authority also integrated <b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> and tram ticketing using punch tickets and scratch tickets. Under the arrangements, the Government of Victoria collected all revenue {{from the sale of}} multi-modal tickets, which was then allocated to the various operators on the basis of an agreed formula.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of the system is the {{individual}} cards issued to passengers using the system. The cards are a MIFARE-based card and have a unique individual identification number allocated to each card. These cards communicate specific information as they interact with the relevant processing equipment at the points of boarding and disembarking from the various transport modes that the card operates across (<b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> ferry).|$|E
25|$|The reforms {{included}} {{the integration of}} <b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> and tram tickets. From 1983 onwards, the State Government began collecting all revenue from the multi-modal tickets, with private bus operators receiving money for costs one month in advance. Unfortunately, the State Government had trouble increasing the fixed-ticket subsidies in line with inflation. The State Government would introduce a moratorium on new bus purchases, as well as make attempts at forcing the consolidation of the numbers of private bus operators, in attempt to overcome the subsidy problem.|$|E

25|$|All {{suburban}} {{public transport}} services (<b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and ferry) run on timetabled routes coordinated by Auckland Transport. Bus and ferry services are privately owned and are contracted to AT, with livery either displaying the AT Metro brand or being converted (as of mid-2017) to it. Many buses for example, still appear on the roads in the livery of their respective companies. AT has owned Auckland's suburban electric trains from their introduction, and all appear in AT Metro livery. The MAXX brand was used for Auckland public transport from 2001 until 2012.|$|E
25|$|Private {{vehicles}} {{are the main}} form of transportation within Auckland, with around 7 per cent of journeys in the Auckland region undertaken by bus in 2006, and 2 per cent undertaken by train and ferry. For trips to the city centre at peak times {{the use of public}} transport is much higher, with more than half of trips undertaken by <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> or ferry. Auckland still ranks quite low in its use of public transport, having only 46 public transport trips per capita per year, while Wellington has almost twice this number at 91, and Sydney has 114 trips. This strong roading focus results in substantial traffic congestion during peak times.|$|E
25|$|National Express West Midlands {{is part of}} the Safer Travel Partnership, {{created in}} 2005 its members also include Centro (responsible for <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and tram {{transport}} in the West Midlands) and West Midlands Police. The partnership is committed to reducing crime and anti-social behaviour across the West Midlands bus network whilst providing reassurance to the travelling public. The partnership achieves this through a variety of tactics including Gateway Operations. These operations are intelligence led and are based on the established link between those who evade paying their fare and those responsible for crime, disorder and anti social behaviour. The operation involves partners including NX Revenue Inspectors and Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers from the dedicated Safer Travel Police Team. The activities of the partnership have resulted in very significant reductions in recorded crime across the West Midlands bus network.|$|E

25|$|Brazil {{witnessed}} minor protests {{associated with}} the Occupy Movement during 2011 and 2012, but then endogenous social events and discourses led to massive and widespread protest during June 2013. While not directly sparked by {{the events in the}} Arab world, a new generation of Brazilians saw themselves in a similar situation as the Arab youth: alienated and marginalized from government and other public institutions, suffering increasingly high costs of living and inaccessible social services, and finding fewer employment and other social opportunities. Most significantly, the media exposure of popular protests taking over streets and overthrowing governments provided a new generation of Brazilians with the idea that popular uprisings can indeed be highly successful. The 2013 protests in Brazil are ongoing public demonstrations in several Brazilian cities, initiated mainly by the Movimento Passe Livre (Free Fare Movement), a local entity that advocates for free public transportation. The demonstrations were initially organized to protest against increases in <b>bus,</b> <b>train,</b> and metro ticket prices in some Brazilian cities, but grew to include other issues such as the high corruption in the government and police brutality used against some demonstrators. By the end of June 2013, the movement had grown to become Brazil's largest since the 1980s movement against the military dictatorship and for direct elections, called Diretas_Já. It is notable that popular and working class organizations established during the 1980s - such as the ruling Workers' Party (PT), the Unified Workers Central (CUT), and the Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST) - did not play any role leading these protests, and in fact most street protesters do not find themselves represented by the Workers' Party government.|$|E

500|$|There was a {{scramble}} to arrange travel to Spain {{for what was}} described {{by a member of}} the Madrid Celtic Supporters Club as [...] "one of the biggest events in sporting history". Celtic fans travelled by plane, car, <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and ferry in order to get to Seville on time. A lot of fans travelled to Seville on day trips and returned to Scotland early the next morning after the match. The first charter flights to Spain left Scotland well before dawn on the same day of the match. About 33 charter planes departed before midday with over 9,000 Celtic fans on board. 2,000 more decided to travel on scheduled flights. At Glasgow Prestwick Airport, 9 charter flights departed before 9 a.m. BST with 3,500 additional fans.|$|E

500|$|In the 1971 New Year Honours, Hannah {{was raised}} to Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). His tour as CAS coincided with the RAAF's Golden Jubilee, celebrated in March and April that year. He {{personally}} organised a fly-past of two US Air Force F-111s at air shows marking the occasion, generating favourable coverage to counteract the poor publicity surrounding the type's long-delayed entry into Australian service. He was also involved in two controversial decisions the same year. Firstly, {{he was a member}} of the committee to choose an Air Force memorial to be located on Anzac Parade, Canberra. The selected design was an abstract sculpture that, according to official RAAF historian Alan Stephens, reflected [...] "the selection panel's comprehensive failure to understand the nature of air force service". Secondly, Hannah commissioned a replacement for the Air Force's winter uniform, traditionally a shade [...] "somewhere between royal and navy blue" [...] that had been personally chosen by the RAAF's first CAS, Wing Commander (later Air Marshal Sir) Richard Williams, to distinguish it from the lighter Royal Air Force colour. Hannah publicly debuted the uniform that he approved, an all-purpose middle-blue suit, at a Point Cook graduation parade on 8December 1971. It was the object of much adverse comment in the ensuing years; personnel complained of being mistaken for <b>bus,</b> <b>train</b> and postal employees. One of Hannah's successors as CAS, Air Marshal Errol McCormack, ordered that the uniform revert to Williams' original colour and style commencing in 2000.|$|E
