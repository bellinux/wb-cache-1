5|$|Bavaro married Susan Downes in 1987. The {{couple have}} three children. His wife {{attended}} Seton Hall Law School for one year, but later transferred to Harvard Law School, where she achieved {{a degree in}} Law, and is currently a teacher of European History at St. John's Preparatory School. After his retirement they lived in Naples, Florida for three years. They currently reside in Boxford, Massachusetts, near Bavaro's hometown of Danvers. After his playing career, Bavaro worked as a sales trader for an equity <b>block-trading</b> firm, where he traded large blocks of stocks for institutions and hedge funds. He pursued a career in this field {{at the suggestion of}} his former Giants teammate Phil McConkey, who worked for the same company as Bavaro. In 2007, Bavaro was appointed Vice President of DesignCentrix, a premiere Chicago exhibit house. Bavaro is also an avid golfer who considers the sport his favorite pastime.|$|E
40|$|Size {{discovery}} {{refers to}} the use of trade mechanisms by which large quantities of an asset can be exchanged at a price that does not respond to price pressure. Primary examples of size discovery include “workup, ” a trade protocol used in the markets for U. S. Treasuries and swaps, and <b>block-trading</b> “dark pools, ” used in equity markets. By freezing the execution price, a size-discovery mechanism does not clear the market, but overcomes large investors ’ concerns over their price impacts. Price-discovery mechanisms, which determine a market-clearing price by matching supply and demand, cause investors to internalize their price impacts, inducing costly delays in the reduction of position imbalances. We show that augmenting a price-discovery mechanism with a size-discovery mechanism such as workup or dark pools improves allocative efficiency. Because of adverse selection regarding the order imbalances of other investors, size discovery is used only by investors with large position imbalances...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} simple model pioneered by Barclay and Holderness (1989, Journal of Financial Economics 25 : 371 – 395) and {{recently}} reproposed by Dyck and Zingales (2004 a, Journal of Finance 2, 537 – 600; 2004 b Journal of Applied Corporate Finance 16, 51 – 72) {{in order to}} measure the value of control in countries, like Italy, where transfer of control is regulated by law. We demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} broaden the application of B&H approach to block trades followed by mandatory tender offers and we show the conditions under which we may obtain significant measures of private benefits also when voluntary tender offers are considered. In order to test for our theoretical predictions, we analyse the pricing of 27 control transactions involving the common stock of Italian listed corporations between 1993 and 2003. We find that block-transaction (tender) premium equals on average 8 % of the firm’s equity value in the case of pure <b>block-trades,</b> 9 % in the case of block trades followed by a mandatory tender offer, while it increases to 18 % in the case of voluntary tender offers. The results suggest that, in the case of block trades followed by a mandatory tender offer, the acquirer does not transfer a larger portion of its surplus. This doesn’t take place in the case of voluntary tender offers, in which the raider’s bargaining power collapses. Our estimate of the control premium is sensibly lower than that presented in previous studies based on similar methodologies, providing up-to-date evidence for control stake valuation purposes and for comparison with cross country studies aiming at assessing the quality of rules devoted to minority shareholders’ protection. We also perform a cross-sectional regression analysis of private benefits of control and confirm some of the findings presented in the previous literature: particularly, we find evidence of a positive relation between the magnitude of private benefits of control and the target’s degree of stock-pyramiding. We also find that foreign acquirers and financial investors seem likely to face greater difficulties in extracting private benefits of control.
