60|$|Jack Herring and Somerville the <b>Briefless</b> went {{that night}} with Johnny and his sister to the theatre--and on other nights. Miss Bulstrode thought Jack Herring very nice, and told her brother so. But she thought Somerville the <b>Briefless</b> even nicer, and later, under cross-examination, when Somerville was no longer <b>briefless,</b> told Somerville so himself.|$|E
6000|$|What, I {{asked in}} my own mind, can cause this obsequiousness {{on the part of}} Miss Toady; has <b>Briefless</b> got a county court, or has his wife had a fortune left her? Miss Toady {{explained}} presently, with that simplicity which distinguishes all her conduct. [...] "You know," [...] she said, [...] "Mrs <b>Briefless</b> is granddaughter of Sir John Redhand, who is so ill at Cheltenham that he can't last six months. Mrs. Briefless's papa succeeds; so you see she will be a baronet's daughter." [...] And Toady asked <b>Briefless</b> and his wife to dinner the very next week.|$|E
60|$|IN A LETTER TO EDWARD <b>BRIEFLESS,</b> ESQUIRE, OF PUMP COURT, TEMPLE.|$|E
60|$|Somerville, the <b>briefless,</b> {{held that}} {{in the absence of}} all data such {{conclusion}} was unjustifiable.|$|E
60|$|The <b>Briefless</b> one, muttering {{that the}} worst of mixing with journalists was {{that if you did}} not watch yourself, you fell into their ways, drank his whisky in silence. Later, the Babe swore on a copy of Sell's Advertising Guide that, {{crossing}} the Park, he had seen the <b>Briefless</b> one leaning over the railings of Rotten Row, clad in a pair of new kid gloves, swinging a silver-headed cane.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{following}} Monday, the <b>Briefless</b> one {{announced to the}} Club that he had received an invitation to dine at the Loveredges' on {{the following}} Wednesday. On Tuesday, the <b>Briefless</b> one entered the Club with a slow and stately step. Halting opposite old Goslin the porter, who had emerged from his box {{with the idea of}} discussing the Oxford and Cambridge boat race, Somerville, removing his hat with a sweep of the arm, held it out in silence. Old Goslin, much astonished, took it mechanically, whereupon the <b>Briefless</b> one, shaking himself free from his Inverness cape, flung it lightly after the hat, and strolled on, not noticing that old Goslin, unaccustomed to coats lightly and elegantly thrown at him, dropping the hat, had caught it on his head, and had been, {{in the language of the}} prompt-book, [...] "left struggling." [...] The <b>Briefless</b> one, entering the smoking-room, lifted a chair and let it fall again with a crash, and sitting down upon it, crossed his legs and rang the bell.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{none of our}} set, or {{we should}} have heard {{something}} from her side before now," [...] argued acutely Somerville the <b>Briefless.</b>|$|E
60|$|Somerville the <b>Briefless</b> {{called at}} {{the offices of}} Good Humour, in Crane Court, the {{following}} morning, and he also borrowed Miss Ramsbotham's Debrett.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe it," [...] said Somerville the <b>Briefless.</b> [...] "He's been {{cracking}} his jokes, {{and some}} silly woman has taken him seriously." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{remember}} me, Lady Mary," [...] {{said the}} <b>Briefless</b> one. [...] "I met you some years ago; {{we had a}} most interesting conversation--Sir Francis Baldwin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A <b>briefless</b> barrister!" [...] muttered Seal to Grab. [...] "I {{dare say}} a timely guinea would have silenced the fellow. What is {{now to be}} done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I shall {{go round}} {{to the office}} to-morrow morning," [...] said Somerville the <b>Briefless,</b> [...] "and force my way in if necessary. This is getting mysterious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does the}} woman take us for?" [...] demanded Somerville the <b>Briefless.</b> [...] "Doesn't she {{know that we}} lunch with real actors and actresses, that once a year we are invited to dine at the Mansion House?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We don't have meat every day, Mr. Goldmore,' he continued, 'and it's a {{treat to}} {{me to get a}} dinner like this. You little know, you gentlemen of England, who live at home at ease, what hardships <b>briefless</b> barristers endure.' ...|$|E
60|$|Then he related his {{interview}} with Colby, to the amusement of his nieces, all three of whom approved the course he had taken and were already prepared to vouch for the <b>briefless</b> barrister's ability, {{on the grounds that}} eccentricity meant talent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Peace, thou timid {{partner of}} the <b>briefless</b> one. Goldmore's dinner shall be suited to our narrow means. Only do thou in all things my commands.' And seeing by the {{peculiar}} expression of the rogue's countenance, that some mad waggery was in preparation, I awaited the morrow with anxiety.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, an Englishman," [...] replied Hammond; [...] "a <b>briefless</b> barrister, [Endnote: 5] in fact, of Lincoln's Inn, who, {{having little}} or nothing to detain him at home, has come to spend a few idle months in seeing the new {{republic}} which has been made out of English substance." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} one night {{being in the}} Fair myself, at an evening party. I observed old Miss Toady there also present, single out for her special attentions and flattery little Mrs. <b>Briefless,</b> the barrister's wife, who is of a good family certainly, but, as we all know, is as poor as poor can be.|$|E
6000|$|Now, my dear <b>Briefless,</b> {{ought not}} Monsieur Procureur, in common justice to Peytel, {{after he had}} so eloquently proclaimed, not the facts, but the suspicions, which weighed against that worthy, to have given a similar florid account of the prisoner's case? Instead of this, you will remark, {{that it is the}} advocate's {{endeavor}} to make Peytel's statements as uninteresting in style as possible; and then he demolishes them in the following way:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We didn't cast a doubt," [...] {{explained}} Somerville the <b>Briefless.</b> [...] "We merely {{said that}} we personally did not believe you. We didn't say we couldn't believe you; it is a case for individual effort. If you give us particulars bearing the impress of reality, supported by details that do not unduly contradict each other, {{we are prepared to}} put aside our natural suspicions and face the possibility of your statement being correct." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I can {{understand}} it," [...] said the <b>Briefless</b> one. [...] "What {{has happened is}} this. He's dressed up thinking to {{have a bit of}} fun with us, and has come out, forgetting to put any money or his latchkey in his pocket. His landlady may have gone to Romford or may not. In any case, he would have to knock at the door and enter into explanations. What does he suggest--the loan of a sovereign?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We don't {{want your}} feeble efforts at {{psychological}} romance," [...] told him Somerville the <b>Briefless.</b> [...] "We {{want to know}} what you talked about. Dead or married, the man who can drink whisky-and-soda must be held responsible for his actions. What's the little beggar mean by cutting us all in this way? Did he ask after any of us? Did he leave any message for any of us? Did he invite any of us to come an see him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Of course I am {{much too}} good-natured {{a friend of}} both parties not to tell Gray of Goldmore's opinion in him, and the nabob's astonishment at the of the <b>briefless</b> {{barrister}} having any dinner at all. Indeed, Goldmore's saying became a joke against Gray amongst us wags at the Club, {{and we used to}} ask him when he tasted meat last? whether we should bring him home something from dinner? and cut a thousand other mad pranks with him in our facetious way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I will {{whisper to}} you confidentially {{that my sister}} was engaged to Serjeant Shirker--a fellow whose talents one cannot deny, and be hanged to them, but whom I have always known to be mean, selfish, and a prig. However, women don't see these faults in the men whom Love throws in their way. Shirker, who has about as much warmth as an eel, made up to Polly years and years ago, and was no bad match for a <b>briefless</b> barrister, as he was then.|$|E
6000|$|They {{brought her}} presents--nothing very expensive, more as tokens of regard: dainty packets of sweets, nosegays of simple flowers, bottles of scent. To Somerville [...] "Miss Bulstrode" [...] hinted {{that if he}} really did desire to please her, and wasn't merely talking through his hat--Miss Bulstrode apologised for the slang, which, she feared, she must have picked up from her brother--he might give her a box of Messani's cigarettes, size No. 2. The {{suggestion}} pained him. Somerville the <b>Briefless</b> was perhaps old-fashioned. Miss Bulstrode cut him short by agreeing that he was, and seemed disinclined for further conversation.|$|E
6000|$|When, my dear <b>Briefless,</b> {{you are a}} judge (as I make {{no doubt}} you will be, when you have left off the club all night, cigar-smoking of mornings, and reading novels in bed), will you ever find it in your heart to order a fellow-sinner's head off upon such {{evidence}} as this? Because a romantic Substitut du Procureur de Roi chooses to compose and recite a little drama, and draw tears from juries, let us hope that severe Rhadamanthine judges {{are not to be}} melted by such trumpery. One wants but the description of the characters to render the piece complete, as thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|We sat {{and talked}} together, we four, for some time. I found {{the young man}} with the lugubrious countenance {{improved}} immensely on closer acquaintance. His talk was clever. He {{turned out to be}} the son of a politician high in office in the Canadian Government, and he had been educated at Oxford. The father, I gathered, was rich, but he himself was making an income of nothing a year just then as a <b>briefless</b> barrister, and he was hesitating whether to accept a post of secretary that had been offered him in the colony, or to continue his negative career at the Inner Temple, for the honour and glory of it.|$|E
6000|$|It is bitter {{to leave}} our fathers hearth for the first time; bitter is the eve of our return, when a {{thousand}} fears rise in our haunted souls. Bitter are hope deferred, and self-reproach, and power unrecognised. Bitter is poverty; bitterer still is debt. It is bitter to be neglected; it is more bitter to be misunderstood. It is bitter to lose an only child. It is bitter to look upon the land which once was ours. Bitter is a sister's woe, a brother's scrape; bitter a mother's tear, and bitterer still a father's curse. Bitter are a <b>briefless</b> bag, a curate's bread, a diploma that brings no fee. Bitter is half-pay! ...|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing this}} magnanimous resolution, the widow's heart was greatly cheered; for, in fact, she might {{probably}} {{have considered the}} Doctor's perseverance in the plan, of which she had expressed such high disapprobation, as little less than a symptom of absolute defection from his allegiance. By an accommodation, therefore, which suited both parties, it was settled that the Doctor should attend his loving widow to Shaws-Castle, without mask or mantle; and that the painted screen should be transferred from Quackleben's back to the broad shoulders of a <b>briefless</b> barrister, well qualified for the part of Wall, since the composition of his skull might have rivalled in solidity the mortar and stone of the most approved builder.|$|E
6000|$|... "In your spare time!" [...] Mrs. Cosham echoed. [...] "That is a {{proof of}} devotion, indeed." [...] She half closed her eyes, and indulged {{herself in a}} {{fascinating}} picture of a <b>briefless</b> barrister lodged in a garret, writing immortal novels {{by the light of}} a farthing dip. But the romance which fell upon the figures of great writers and illumined their pages was no false radiance in her case. She carried her pocket Shakespeare about with her, and met life fortified by the words of the poets. How far she saw Denham, and how far she confused him with some hero of fiction, {{it would be hard to}} say. Literature had taken possession even of her memories. She was matching him, presumably, with certain characters in the old novels, for she came out, after a pause, with: ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{then not}} one novelist in a {{thousand}} ever does tell us {{the real story of}} their hero. They linger for a dozen pages over a tea-party, but sum up a life's history with [...] "he had become one of our merchant princes," [...] or [...] "he was now a great artist, with the world at his feet." [...] Why, there is more real life in one of Gilbert's patter-songs than in half the biographical novels ever written. He relates to us all the various steps by which his office-boy rose to be the [...] "ruler of the queen's navee," [...] and explains to us how the <b>briefless</b> barrister managed to become a great and good judge, [...] "ready to try this breach of promise of marriage." [...] It is in the petty details, not in the great results, that the interest of existence lies.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. E. O. Pleydell-Bouverie has endowed the novel-writing {{fraternity}} {{with a new}} {{formula for}} the composition of titles. After J. S.; or, Trivialities {{there is no reason}} why we should not have A. B.; or, Platitudes, M.N.; or, Sentimentalisms, Y.Z.; or, Inanities. There are many books which these simple titles would characterise much more aptly than any high-flown phrases--as aptly, in fact, as Mr. Bouverie's title characterises the volume before us. It sets forth the uninteresting fortunes of an insignificant person, one John Stiles, a <b>briefless</b> barrister. The said John falls in love with a young lady, inherits a competence, omits to tell his love, and is killed by the bursting of a fowling-piece--that is all. The only point of interest presented by the book is the problem as to how it ever came to be written. We can scarcely find the solution in Mr. Bouverie's elaborately smart style which cannot be said to transmute his 'trivialities' into 'flies in amber.' ...|$|E
60|$|Of {{course it}} was a great catch for a landless and <b>briefless</b> {{barrister}} like myself--dependent on a small fortune in South American securities, and my precarious earnings as a writer of burlesque--to secure such a valuable prospective property as Editha Fitz-Simkins. To be sure, the girl was undeniably plain; but I have known plainer girls than she was, whom forty thousand pounds converted into My Ladies: and if Editha hadn't really fallen over head and ears in love with me, I suppose old Fitz-Simkins would never have consented to such a match. As it was, however, we had flirted so openly and so desperately during the Scarborough season, {{that it would have been}} difficult for Sir Peter to break it off: and so I had come to Egypt on a tour of insurance to secure my prize, following in the wake of my future mother-in-law, whose lungs were supposed to require a genial climate--though in my private opinion they were really as creditable a pair of pulmonary appendages as ever drew breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Profession, talents, {{offices of}} the State! Are you mad, John Perkins, that you come to me with such insufferable twaddle as this? Why, {{do you think if}} you HAD been capable of rising at the bar, I would have taken so much trouble about getting you a place? No, sir; you are too fond of pleasure, and bed, and tea-parties, and small-talk, and reading novels, and playing the flute, and writing sonnets. You would no more rise at the bar than my messenger, sir. It was because I knew your disposition--that hopeless, careless, irresolute good-humour of yours--that I had {{determined}} to keep you out of danger, by placing you in a snug shelter, where the storms of the world would not come near you. You must have principles forsooth! and you must marry Miss Gorgon, of course: and by the time you have gone ten circuits, and had six children, you will have eaten up every shilling of your wife's fortune, and be as <b>briefless</b> as you are now. Who the deuce has put all this nonsense into your head? I think I know." ...|$|E
60|$|At the {{windlass}} {{are standing}} two men, whom {{we may have}} seen in past years, self-satisfied in countenance, and spotless in array, sauntering down Piccadilly any July afternoon, or lounging in Haggis's stable-yard at Cambridge any autumn morning. Alas! how changed from the fast young undergraduates, with powers of enjoyment only equalled by their powers of running into debt, are those two black-bearded and mud-bespattered ruffians, who once were Smith and Brown of Trinity. Yet who need pity them, {{as long as they}} have stouter limbs, healthier stomachs, and clearer consciences, than they have had since they left Eton at seventeen? Would Smith have been a happier man as a <b>briefless</b> barrister in a dingy Inn of Law, peeping now and then into third-rate London society, and scribbling for the daily press! Would Brown have been a happier man had he been forced into those holy orders for which he never felt the least vocation, to pay off his college debts out of his curate's income, and settle down on his lees, at last, in the family living of Nomansland-cum-Clayhole, and support a wife and five children on five hundred a-year, exclusive of rates and taxes? Let them dig, and be men.|$|E
60|$|However, I haven't yet {{told you}} how I came to find myself on the farm at Les Pentes at all. This, then, is how it all came about. I was sick of the Temple; I had spent four or five <b>briefless</b> years in {{lounging}} about Brick Court and dropping in casually at important cases, just to let the world see I was the proud possessor of a well-curled wig; but even a wig (which suits my complexion admirably) palls after five years, and I said to myself that I would really cut London altogether, and live upon my means somewhere on the Continent. Very small means, to be sure, but still enough to pull through upon in Switzerland or the Black Forest. So, just by way of experiment as to how I liked it, I packed up my fishing-rod and my portmanteau (the first the most important), took the 7.18 express from the Gare de Lyon for Geneva, and found myself next afternoon comfortably seated on the verandah of my favourite hotel at Vevay. The lake is delightful, that we all know; but I wanted to get somewhere {{where there was a}} little fishing; so I struck back at once into the mountain country round Château d'Oex and Les Avants, and came soon upon the exact thing I wanted at Les Pentes.|$|E
