Later in the afternoon a runner from D Company reported that A Company was in a desperate battle against tanks and infantry with D Company in support. The battalion adjutant, Captain A.E. Charlton, went forward across a wooded bridge over the Kampong To stream and with the runner he turned the sharp <b>bend</b> a hundred <b>meters</b> ahead. On rounding the bend Charlton discovered a Japanese tank a short distance ahead and the mortar section of A Company in a heavy firefight. Charlton hurried back to the wooden bridge and brought forward the battalion's anti-tank platoon. Major Dinwiddie's Sappers took the bridge apart by hand. When the tank rounded the bend it received a hot reception from the battalion's Boys Anti-Tank Rifles and retreated. But Japanese infantry had now occupied the road ahead.

40|$|In {{some of the}} ducts of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), {{the maximum}} liquid oxygen flow {{velocities}} approach 10 times those at which liquid flow measurements are normally made. The hydrogen gas flow velocities in other ducts exceed the maximum for gas flow measurement {{by more than a}} factor of 3. The results presented here show from water flow tests that vortex shedding flow meters of the appropriate design can measure water flow to velocities in excess of 55 m/s, which is a Reynolds number of about 2 million. Air flow tests have shown that the same meter can measure flow to a Reynolds number of at least 22 million. Vortex shedding meters were installed in two of the SSME ducts and tested with water flow. Narrow spectrum lines were obtained and the meter output frequencies were proportional to flow to + or - 0. 5 % or better over the test range with no flow conditioning, even though the ducts had multiple <b>bends</b> preceeding the <b>meter</b> location.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{approaches}} one can take to modeling the dynamics of a flexible body. While one can attempt to capture the full dynamical behavior subject to disturbances from actuators and environmental torques, such a detailed description often is unnecessary. Simplification is possible either by limiting the amplitude of motion to permit linearization of the dynamics equations or by restricting the types of allowed motion. In this work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of bending deformations of wire booms on spinning spacecraft. The theory allows for large amplitude excursions from equilibrium while enforcing constraints on the dynamics to prohibit those modes that are physically less relevant or are expected to damp out fast. These constraints explicitly remove the acoustic modes (i. e., longitudinal sound waves and shear waves) while allowing for arbitrary bending and twisting, motions which typically are of lower frequency. As a test case, a spin axis reorientation maneuver by the Polar Plasma Laboratory (POLAR) spacecraft has been simulated. POLAR was chosen as a representative spacecraft because it has flexible wire antennas that extend to a length of 65 <b>meters.</b> <b>Bending</b> deformations in these antennas could be quite large and {{have a significant effect on}} the attitude dynamics of the spacecraft body.

40|$|Teak (Tectona grandis) {{is one of}} {{the highly}} demanded timber species in Sri Lanka. When buying teak logs, {{customers}} assess their quality by visual appraisal of surface characteristics such as visible defects. Hence, the buyers’ preference for logs with desired attributes is reflected by the price achieved in the market. In this study, we examined the influence of visually observable quality attributes of plantation grown teak logs on their market price. A set of 650 randomly selected teak logs were assessed for dimensions, shape defects, surface defects and end-defects. Length of the log, mid-circumference (under bark), diameter at top-end and butt-end, number of knots per meter, average diameter of the knots, bend fraction, percentage of heartwood, shape of the log, presence of buttress, position of the hollows, presence of felling damages, splits and heart rot were recorded using standard methods. Selling prices of logs were obtained from the records of log storing facilities. By using the multiple linear regressions, a price-quality model was developed to explain the impact of quality attributes on selling price. The regression model achieved a strong coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 87. Accordingly, the length, mid-circumference, number of knots per <b>meter,</b> <b>bend</b> fraction, hollow position, presence of buttresses and presence of heart rot were found to have a significant influence on the price.  The relative price reduction due to presence of a specific log defect was further examined using the derived price-quality model. The presence of high number of knots had the highest detrimental impact on price, followed by the higher bend fraction, presence of hollows at top end and/or middle of the log, presence of heart rot and presence of buttresses respectively. These findings have implications in the improved management of teak plantations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Well-designed and {{implemented}} selection {{is one of}} the important prerequisites for achieving the expected results in the modern competitive sport at all levels. The aim of this work was to determine how the selection was made for Serbian League players, {{on the basis of their}} certain motor parameters and the positions in the team. A sample of 25 senior players of a football team competing in the Serbian League is divided into four sub-samples, based on team positions. For assessment of motor characteristics following tests were used: long jump (LJ), Abalac test (AT); 10 seconds push-ups (PU), 30 seconds trunk <b>bends</b> (TB), 20 <b>meter</b> flying start running (20 FSR), 20 meter high start running (20 HSR), 50 meter high start running (50 HSR) and Cooper test (CT). Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that there are significant differences for variable 20 FSR and variable CT (F = 3754, 9835, p =. 027,. 000, respectively). Three canonical discriminant functions were singled out, where the first explained even 84. 6 %, the second 14. 5 % and the third only 1 % of the total variance, or in summary first two functions explained 99. 0 % of the variance. It can be concluded that the selected players, in terms of the position in the team, distinguished first by performing on the Cooper test, followed by the result of 20 meter flying start running, 20 meter high start running, 50 meter high start running, trunk bends, and finally by Abalac test, push-ups and long jump. Observed as a function of certain motor characteristics, it could be concluded that in the selection of players in terms of the playing position confidence level was 72. 0 % in general level, with the most reliable for goalkeepers (100 %), midfielders (71. 4 %) and defensive players (70. 0 %), while the smallest was at strikers (50 %) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany mega-tidal {{estuaries}} in the north-western part of France {{are currently}} trapping sediment {{leading to a}} rapid extension of salt marshes. Due to ecological and economical issues, {{it is critical to}} moderate accumulation of sediment in these estuaries. In the Mont-Saint-Michel bay, salt marshes development is even threatening the marine character of this UNESCO world heritage site. Large remediation works are currently undertaken to drive salt marsh regression and to remove the accumulated sediment. Since mid- 2009, a new dam over the main river (Couesnon) stores large amounts of water during the flood at high tide, and releases it at low tide to flush out sediment towards the sea. This controlled change in hydraulic forcing offers an opportunity to better understand bank erosion and the resulting tidal channel lateral mobility which is the dominant mechanism by which existing salt marshes are eroded and transformed back into inter-tidal flats. Given the very large range of hydraulic forcings in mega-tidal estuaries, it is particularly important to quantify the contribution of events of variable frequency and magnitude which requires measurements at almost daily frequency. To cover the pre and post dam phases, we have assembled a large dataset of terrestrial laser scans (TLS), GPS and aerial photographs covering a period from 1986 to 2011 with 40 frequent TLS surveys after 2009. Our study compares 5 salt marsh banks in the Mont-Saint-Michel bay with different channel curvature and exposure to incoming tide. For active and steep bank, retreat is calculated along the <b>bend</b> every 2 <b>meters.</b> Amongst the 5 banks, maximum recorded bank retreat varies between 17 m and 110 m over a period of respectively 2 and 20 years. Retreat rates exhibits significant temporal variability, especially during a single tide when rates of bank retreat for the same point vary from no detectable change to 2. 5 m during spring tide. For each bank, there is a factor 5 change in retreat rates between high and low curvature parts of the bank which highlights the control of channel curvature. To better understand the retreat mechanisms, we introduce the normalized bank retreat to factor in geometrical effect and emphasize the hydraulic controls. Couesnon's bank shows non-homothetic bank retreat along the largest bend suggesting a more complex mechanism than a simple combination of bank geometry and tidal forcing. Precise measurements show that the impact of the dam is not as immediate as expected. Rates of bank retreat in the Couesnon sinuous zones increased drastically only during the 2010 spring tides compared to the pre- 2009 rates. Preliminary results suggest that during the ebb, the dominant role of the dam release is to redistribute the meander inner bar sediment during neap tides rather than directly driving salt marsh bank erosion. This redistribution tends to enhance the transverse gradient in meander bends. During subsequent spring tide floods, outer bank retreat is then more effective than before dam operation. This highlights the primary role of inner bend sedimentation in driving outer bend bank erosion in sinuous sections, rather than the opposite...|$|R
