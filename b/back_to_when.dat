5|$|Although Jerry Lawler and Doink the Clown had a storyline rivalry that dated <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>when</b> Doink {{turned on}} Lawler by dumping {{a bucket of}} water on him after SummerSlam 1993, the feud had rarely been {{mentioned}} since then.

5|$|Paleontology lies on {{the border}} between biology and geology, but differs from {{archaeology}} in that it excludes the study of anatomically modern humans. It now uses techniques drawn {{from a wide range of}} sciences, including biochemistry, mathematics, and engineering. Use of all these techniques has enabled paleontologists to discover much of the evolutionary history of life, almost all the way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>when</b> Earth became capable of supporting life, about 3.8 billion years ago. As knowledge has increased, paleontology has developed specialised sub-divisions, some of which focus on different types of fossil organisms while others study ecology and environmental history, such as ancient climates.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{arts and}} crafts are {{produced}} throughout the country, although most originated as functional items rather than purely for decoration. Woven baskets and bowls are especially common. Imigongo, a unique cow dung art, is produced in the southeast of Rwanda, with a history dating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>when</b> the region {{was part of the}} independent Gisaka kingdom.

Xenogears appears and Fei uses it to defeat Urobolus. Krelian releases Elly and reveals to Fei that he had planned to become one with God along with Elly. During her time with Krelian, Elly had seen inside his heart and realized it was full of sadness and despair for all the atrocities he had committed.
