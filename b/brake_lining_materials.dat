40|$|Braking of road {{vehicles}} {{can be characterized}} as an active – either wanted or unwanted reduction of the force necessary for maintaining the required speed, decreasing the speed, stopping or keeping the vehicle at a standstill. During braking the vehicle loses the acquired motion energy which is most frequently transformed (in case of wanted braking) in the brake system of the vehicle into useless heat released to the environment. Brake force can be defined as the force acting against the motion of a vehicle which is, in case of wanted braking, produced by the vehicle braking system. In case of wanted braking we usually begin with the equilibrium equation of vehicle forces. The paper deals with objective findings and assessment of possible causes leading to the braking system failure paying special attention to the brake lining. The user can approach the brake lining failure from two points of view: being aware or unaware of it. Laboratory tests can be used to objectively assess characteristics of brake linings.

This was with a view to exploiting the characteristics of cow hooves, which are largely discarded as waste materials to replace asbestos which {{has been found to be}} carcinogenic. Samples of brake linings were produced using compressive moulding in which the physical and mechanical properties of the samples were studied. The results obtained showed that proper bonding was achieved as the percentage by weight of epoxy resin increased and percentage by weight of pulverized cow hooves decreased. The hardness, compressive strength, coefficient of friction, water and oil absorption, relative density and wear rate of the brake linings were determined and compared with existing <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> properties.

For this purpose, a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping and spectrum were used to identify and analyze different constituents. The mechanical properties were determined using compression test. Relevant physical properties (density and porosity) were determined using standard test methods. The friction coefficient and wear behavior of the friction material on contact with the grey cast iron disc were established using a pad-on disc tribometer.

The investigated material exhibited excellent mechanical properties in the normal solicitation direction. The average friction coefficient was about 0. 65, whereas the friction coefficient was stable. The different actions of various ingredients in terms of their effects on the friction and wear behavior of the BLM could be related to their different bonding strengths with the resin matrix and their different abilities to form friction films (third-body layer) on the surfaces of the material and transfer films on the counterpart cast iron surface in relation to the surface temperature evolution and mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons of {{measured}} and model-predicted atmospheric copper concentrations show a severe underestimation {{of the observed}} concentrations by the models. This underestimation may be (partly) due to underestimated emissions of copper to air. Since the phase out of asbestos <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>material,</b> the composition of <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>material</b> has changed and may contain up to ∼ 15 % copper. This makes brake wear from vehicles potentially {{an important source of}} atmospheric (particulate) copper concentrations. In this paper, we reassess the copper emissions due to exhaust emissions and brake wear from road transport. Overall, our reassessments result in an estimate of total copper emission to air in UNECE-Europe of 4. 0 - 5. 5 ktonnes yr- 1, which is substantially higher than the previous estimate of 2. 8 ktonnes yr- 1. Copper concentrations over Europe are calculated with the LOTOS-EUROS model using the revised emission data as model input. The results show that the revised emission estimates are a major step towards gap closure of predicted versus observed copper concentrations in ambient air. Brake wear emissions may be responsible for 50 - 75 % of the total copper emissions to air for most of Western Europe. The hypothesis that road transport is an important source of copper emissions is tested and confirmed by (1) reviewing available literature data of chemically speciated PM data from road tunnel studies and (2) the gradient observed in copper concentrations from ambient PM monitoring going from rural sites to street stations. The literature review and observational data suggest {{that the majority of the}} emitted PM 10 brake wear particles is in the PM 2. 5 - 10 size range.

The mechanical properties were analysed with regard to the heterogeneity of the microstructure to determine the scale at which these properties could be considered to be associated with a homogenised behaviour.

Model brake linings fabricated on-site with known constituents were run through an AO 4 D performance dynamometer test to collect airborne and non-airborne wear debris that is comparable to wear debris produced by an average passenger vehicle. Based on previous experience with analysis of brake linings, this wear debris will be analyzed with scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDX), transmission electron microscopy with EDX (TEM-EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), polarized light microscopy (PLM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer (LSPSDA). Research presented in this report indicates clearly that the previous work published by several groups is lacking sufficient information and the findings should be corrected.

40|$|Automotive <b>brake</b> <b>lining</b> <b>materials</b> {{are complex}} {{composites}} consisting of numerous ingredients allowing for their optimal performance. Different types of carbons {{have been used}} in all types of brake pad formulations for more than century. The role of carbon, however, {{does not seem to be}} completely understood, since carbon materials possess a wide variety of characteristics and properties and they interact with other ingredients present in the friction process. Carbons/graphites are commonly considered to be solid lubricants but this role is only available at relatively low temperatures and at a sufficient humidity. Since regulations are increasingly limiting Cu content in brake pads and Cu exhibits extremely high thermal conductivity, graphites, being excellent heat conducting materials themselves, are often considered for use when potential Cu replacement options in the low-metallic, non-asbestos organic, hybrid, and ceramic pads are explored. This paper surveys the role of two types of graphites with high thermal conductivity but different mechanical properties and morphology: the so-called i) purified flake graphite (PFG) and the ii) resilient graphitic carbon (RGC). A successful “high-end” commercial low-metallic brake pad was re-formulated (SIU Carbondale) by removing of over 20 wt. % of Cu and replacing it with a cocktail of ingredients including 15 wt. % of these two graphite types. OEM Crown Victoria 1999 mold was used to prepare the pads and they were subjected to the SAE J 2430 test and BEEP evaluation using the full-scale automotive brake dynamometer (Link Engineering) and original hardware (rotor and caliper). After friction tests, the surfaces of pads were explored using scanning electron microscopy equipped with the energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (FEG 450 and Inca System) and X-ray diffraction (Rigaku Max-Flash-B). Although the brake pad formulations were otherwise identical and were prepared at the same conditions, the performance of two different low-metallic pads was different. The effectiveness of PFG sample reached value 0. 5 and wear of pad was 5. 3 g, while the effectiveness was 0. 4 and wear detected was 5. 9 g in the case of RGC containing sample. Both formulations exhibited extremely good stability of friction during fade section and only low sensitivity to speed variations between 50 and 160 km/h. Surfaces of both pads were covered by a discontinuous (patchy) friction layer which was formed as a consequence of a gentle abrasive mechanisms involved. The different friction levels and different wear of samples were related to the specific character/differences in detected different friction layers. Importantly, the capacity of the PFG to reduce surface oxides is considerably higher when compared to the RGC. It was concluded that the proper understanding of role of individual graphitic forms in particular formulations can be very beneficial when optimizing the performance of brake pads...|$|E

Sample TY exhibited the highest hardness value (29.09) and sample SN the lowest (10.05). The determined coefficients of friction ranged between 0.3 – 0.36, with sample AU exhibiting the lowest value and sample SM the highest. Sample SN showed the lowest wear rate of 3.53 × 109 g/min, while the wear rates of samples TY, AU, and SM were 5.64 × 108, 8.19 × 109, and 2.10 × 108 g/min, respectively. The relative service life of samples SN, TY, and AU were similar, with average values of 2778.09, 2725.41, and 2717.34 min, respectively, and SM had a relatively low service life (2017.82 min).
