5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the <b>bronchiole</b> is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed <b>bronchiole</b> often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed <b>bronchiole.</b> Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory <b>bronchiole,</b> which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|DPB and bronchiolitis obliterans are {{two forms}} of primary bronchiolitis. Specific {{overlapping}} features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the <b>bronchiole,</b> that divides from the tertiary bronchus) up to the secondary bronchus. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as bronchiectasia, COPD, IPF, phthisis miliaris, sarcoidosis or alveolar cell carcinoma.|$|E

The <b>bronchioles,</b> terminal <b>bronchioles,</b> and respiratory <b>bronchioles</b> of 16 smokers and four non-smokers were studied by both light and electron microscopy in surgically resected specimens. A very significantly (p less than 0. 001) {{greater number of}} goblet cells {{were found in the}} <b>bronchioles</b> of smokers compared than in those of non-smokers but no such difference was evident in terminal/respiratory <b>bronchioles.</b> Clara cell numbers in contrast were lower in the <b>bronchioles</b> (p less than 0. 01) and terminal and respiratory <b>bronchioles</b> of smokers (p less than 0. 01).

2500|$|Complications are {{not common}} but include infection, {{pulmonary}} abscess, and bronchopleural fistula (a fistula between the pleural {{space and the}} bronchial tree). [...] A bronchopleural fistula results {{when there is a}} communication between the laceration, a <b>bronchiole,</b> and the pleura; it can cause air to leak into the pleural space despite the placement of a chest tube. [...] The laceration can also enlarge, as may occur when the injury creates a valve that allows air to enter the laceration, progressively expanding it. [...] One complication, air embolism, in which air enters the bloodstream, is potentially fatal, especially when it occurs {{on the left side of}} the heart. [...] Air can enter the circulatory system through a damaged vein in the injured chest and can travel to any organ; it is especially deadly in the heart or brain. Positive pressure ventilation can cause pulmonary embolism by forcing air out of injured lungs and into blood vessels.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bronchioles</b> or bronchioli are the passageways {{by which}} air {{passes through the}} nose or mouth to the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs, in which {{branches}} no longer contain cartilage or glands in their submucosa. They are branches of the bronchi, and {{are part of the}} conducting zone of the respiratory system. The <b>bronchioles</b> divide further into smaller terminal <b>bronchioles</b> which are still in the conducting zone and these then divide into the smaller respiratory <b>bronchioles</b> which mark the beginning of the respiratory region.|$|R
5000|$|The primary bronchi, in each lung, {{which are}} {{the left and right}} bronchus, give rise to {{secondary}} bronchi. These in turn give rise to tertiary bronchi (tertiary meaning [...] "third"). The tertiary bronchi subdivide into the <b>bronchioles.</b> They are histologically distinct from the tertiary bronchi in that their walls do not have hyaline cartilage and they have club cells in their epithelial lining. The epithelium starts as a simple ciliated columnar epithelium and changes to simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium as the <b>bronchioles</b> decreases in size. The diameter of the <b>bronchioles</b> is often said to be less than 1 mm, though this value can range from 5 mm to 0.3 mm. As stated, these <b>bronchioles</b> do not have hyaline cartilage to maintain their patency. Instead, they rely on elastic fibers attached to the surrounding lung tissue for support. The inner lining (lamina propria) of these <b>bronchioles</b> is thin with no glands present, and is surrounded by a layer of smooth muscle. As the <b>bronchioles</b> get smaller they divide into terminal <b>bronchioles.</b> These <b>bronchioles</b> mark the end of the conducting zone, which covers the first division through the sixteenth division of the respiratory tract. Alveoli only become present when the conducting zone changes to the respiratory zone, from the sixteenth through the twenty-third division of the tract.|$|R

40|$|In an {{endeavour}} {{to elucidate}} the anatomical {{basis for the}} increased resistance to airflow which characterises the most peripheral conducting air passages in pulmonary emphysema, lumina of nonrespiratory <b>bronchioles</b> of lungs with mainly centrilobular disease were assessed for two- and three-dimensional features by: (1) determination of percentage conformity of the lumina of individual <b>bronchioles</b> in histological sections to hypothetical planes through cylinders (ie, ellipses with the same areas and circumferences), and (2) comparison of luminal areas at regular intervals along bronchiolar longitudinal axes. The lumina of most nonrespiratory <b>bronchioles</b> from normal lungs conformed closely to their respective ellipses, thus corroborating previous observations that they are normally cylindroid. In contrast, there was a substantial excess of plane section deformities in the lumina of nonrespiratory <b>bronchioles</b> from the emphysematous specimens. The incidence of stenotic <b>bronchioles</b> (by both diameter and area determinations) was also greatly increased in emphysema. Since {{there was a strong}} positive association between such stenotic lesions and bronchiolar deformity, the latter was concluded to be a major factor in bronchiolar restriction. Furthermore, these characteristics seemed to have three-dimensional expression, for the lumina of stenotic <b>bronchioles</b> in emphysema were irregular in a longitudinal fashion...|$|R

5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} <b>bronchioles</b> (small air passages in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory <b>bronchioles</b> (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal <b>bronchioles,</b> chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|R

50|$|Generally, {{arterial}} {{smooth muscle}} responds to carbon dioxide by producing vasodilation, and responds to oxygen by producing vasoconstriction. Pulmonary blood vessels within the lung are unique as they vasodilate to high oxygen tension and vasoconstrict when it falls. <b>Bronchiole,</b> smooth muscle {{that line the}} airways of the lung, respond to high carbon dioxide producing vasodilation and vasoconstrict when carbon dioxide is low. These responses to carbon dioxide and oxygen by pulmonary blood vessels and <b>bronchiole</b> airway smooth muscle aid in matching perfusion and ventilation within the lungs. Further different smooth muscle tissues display extremes of abundant to little sarcoplasmic reticulum so excitation-contraction coupling varies with its dependence on intracellular or extracellular calcium.|$|E
50|$|When PHMG is aerosolized and inhaled, it harms the lungs, causing {{death of}} the cells lining the bronchioles and {{widespread}} damage to alveoli, along with bronchiolitis obliterans, an often fatal form of non-reversible obstructive lung disease in which the <b>bronchiole</b> are compressed and narrowed by fibrosis (scar tissue) and/or inflammation.|$|E

50|$|The trachea is {{the largest}} tube in the {{respiratory}} tract and consists of tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage. It branches off into two bronchial tubes, a left and a right main bronchus. The bronchi branch off into smaller sections inside the lungs, called <b>bronchioles.</b> These <b>bronchioles</b> give rise to the air sacs in the lungs called the alveoli.|$|R
50|$|Upon the {{disruption}} of GATA-6 in an embryo, the distal lung epithelial development is stunted in transgenic mice models The progenitor cells, or stem cells, for alveolar epithelial tissues develop and are specified appropriately, however further differentiation does not occur. Also the distal-proximal <b>bronchiole</b> development is affected, resulting in a reduced quantity of airway exchange sites.|$|E
50|$|This {{branching}} deficit, {{which will}} cause bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia after birth, has been locally associated with areas lacking differentiated alveolar epithelium, implicating this phenotype as inherent to endodermal function, and thus may be indirectly linked to improper GATA-6 expression. That is, {{a deficit of}} <b>bronchiole</b> branching {{may not be a}} result of direct transcriptional error in GATA-6, but rather a side effect of such an error.|$|E
50|$|At each {{division}} {{point or}} generation, one airway branches into {{two or more}} smaller airways. The human respiratory tree may consist on average of 23 generations, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 generations. Proximal divisions (those closest {{to the top of}} the tree, such as the bronchi) mainly function to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions including the respiratory <b>bronchiole,</b> alveolar ducts and alveoli, are specialized for gas exchange.|$|E
