5000|$|In 1940, Wall decided her {{priority}} {{was a new}} Blinky <b>Bill</b> <b>book</b> with Angus & Robertson. In a letter to her publisher, she wrote: [...] "I'll have to do my utmost {{to get a new}} Blinky book out for next Christmas. I could do a good story with Blinky on National Service, providing the war continues - but I am not that wicked to wish such a thing". In February 1940 she sent her publisher the completed text for Blinky Bill Joins the Army. The publisher was unimpressed by her story of Blinky as an enlisted soldier, calling it 'heavy going' and a too obvious exploitation of 'patriotic fervour'. Wall apparently tore up the manuscript and wrote an entirely new version where Blinky remains in his familiar bush setting until the final pages then goes off to join the army - as a mascot. The new version was finished by the end of April 1940, {{less than a month after}} the first had been rejected; it was published for Christmas 1940.|$|E
