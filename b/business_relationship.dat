The model is investigated in a sample of 136 international <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> The analysis shows that relationship profitability is directly affected by relationship commitment and, indirectly through commitment, by business network connections. © 1996 JIBS.

40|$|Studying <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> in {{different}} contexts {{has been one}} of the major themes in the industrial marketing and purchasing literature for several years. Much emphasis has been given especially on interpreting and making sense of the development of the complex <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> One of the recent key areas of interest, arriving from the research on industrial <b>business</b> <b>relationships,</b> is the theoretical discussion on value creation. The underlying idea of this discussion is that the supplier can, by examining the customer’s value creation processes, achieve a thorough understanding of the goals and concerns of the customer organizations. In this way, the supplier can provide actions enabling the customer to strengthen its processes. This can lead to joint value creating processes in the <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> Since the research done on industrial <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> has been rather descriptive, less focus has been given on creating practical tools for developing <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> The purpose of this paper is to propose a conceptual tool for managing <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> towards joint value creation.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and explore how <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> impact humanitarian logistics. We will achieve this by looking at general theories on humanitarian logistics and <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> and applying them to a particular international humanitarian assistance network. We wish to explore the relationships between a facilitator (Norwegian Emergency Preparedness System, NOREPS), a customer (Norwegian Church Aid, NCA) and a supplier (Lunner Produkter, LUPRO) and find the key success factors and drivers for <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> and their exploitation for providing the best possible product for humanitarian purposes. Design/methodology/approach: We will use theory from humanitarian logistics to highlight the challenges in the industry overall. We will then apply theory on <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> from the industrial networks approach, {{as well as new}} product development and supply chain literature to develop a conceptual framework. We will apply a qualitative approach with an exploratory design of a case study, conducting a focus group and an interview analysis. Subject: <b>Business</b> <b>relationships</b> in humanitarian logistics, with focus on a particular network, namely the network of supplying WASH-kits to disaster areas. Exploring the key success factors and drivers of <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> Originality/value: The study contributes to increased awareness of the <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> that occur in humanitarian logistics.

40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Purpose: Companies {{engage in}} <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> {{for a variety}} of reasons, {{including}} specialization, product development, and building competitive networks. Research has demonstrated that mergers and acquisitions (M&As) may challenge ongoing <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to investigate whether and how competition authorities consider <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> when evaluating M&As. Methodology: The article uses the documentation from 450 M&As reported to the Swedish competition authority to capture the way in which an authority evaluates M&As. The Swedish competition authority evaluation corresponds to other national and international evaluation procedures. Findings: The findings indicate that the competition authorities neglect an important aspect of business life, namely companies forming <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> The competition authorities evaluate M&As on the basis of risk for price increases, and consequently disregard such issues as heterogeneity in demand and offerings, and values built into existing <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> Originality/Value/Contribution: The article contributes to research on <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> through exploring how a public authority deals with such relationships. It also contributes to research on mergers and acquisitions through examining how these activities are evaluated by competition authorities. Furthermore, the article contributes to competition research by reflecting on competition law concerning M&A regulations in relation to <b>business</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

40|$|Critical incidents, such as {{horizontal}} {{mergers and}} acquisitions (M&A), force companies to re-think their business models and ‘reframe’ the way they develop and manage their <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> Through M&A companies enter into a set of new <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> with other firms; thus companies re-conceptualise or ‘reframe’ each relationship to create shared understandings of how the relationship might work in practice. Previous {{research has shown that}} the way actors frame problems affects the decisions they make. Similarly, the way firms conceptualise their <b>business</b> <b>relationships,</b> affects their decisions regarding the design of their business model. It can be argued that the way companies reframe <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> is, primarily manifestation of new business models and this affects both the decisions and actions that companies take regarding their <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> The challenge faced by companies attempting the reframing of <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> is vividly illustrated by the impact of horizontal M&A.

40|$|Purpose - To {{identify}} the criteria that operations managers believe {{make a difference}} to their <b>business</b> <b>relationships</b> and also to identify where the largest gaps are in terms of their current and required performance. Design/methodology/approach - This empirical research is based on the findings from six organisations in three different sectors, which formed three pairs of <b>business</b> <b>relationships.</b> It involved inter-viewing 42 individuals who between them generated over 500 characteristics that they believed made a difference to their relationships.
