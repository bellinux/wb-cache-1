25|$|In 1924, General William L. Mitchell {{produced}} a 324-page report warning that future wars (including with Japan) {{would include a}} new role for aircraft against existing ships and facilities. He even discussed {{the possibility of an}} air attack on Pearl Harbor, but his warnings were ignored. Navy Secretary Knox had also appreciated the possibility of an attack at Pearl Harbor in a written analysis shortly after taking office. American commanders had been warned that tests had demonstrated shallow-water aerial torpedo attacks were possible, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> charge in Hawaii fully appreciated this. And in a 1932 fleet problem, a surprise airstrike led by Admiral Harry E. Yarnell had been judged a success and to have caused considerable damage, a finding corroborated in a 1938 exercise by Admiral Ernest King.|$|E
2500|$|The name 'Tālūt' has {{uncertain}} etymology. Unlike {{some other}} Qur'anic figures, the Arabic {{name is not}} similar to the Hebrew name (Sha'ul). According to Muslim exegetes, the name 'Tālūt' means 'Tall' (from the Arabic [...] "tūl") and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which {{would be consistent with}} the Biblical account. In explanation of the name, exegetes such as Tha'labi hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Israel reached its height except Tālūt (Saul).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hospitals}} such as Hospital Juárez claim {{she appears}} {{there in her}} old 1930s/60s nurse uniform, which is perfectly ironed (hence the name [...] "La Planchada") and heals patients in the emergency sections. Just as there are claims about how she {{was turned into a}} ghost, there are many others in which eyewitnesses claim she appears. Some say she emits a sort of glow. Others say she looks like a normal nurse. Others say she floats, while others say she walks normally, but her steps are never heard. This happens at night and the next morning patients feel better and are taken to another room for further recovery. When asked why they feel better, patients say that [...] "a nurse came in and healed me", <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the hospital was either guarding the room or no nurse came at the time the incident happened.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1994, former Johnson {{administration}} {{attorney general}} Ramsey Clark met with Stewart {{and asked her}} to take Rahman on as a client after Rahman dismissed his court-appointed lawyer and his other lawyers, William Kunstler and Ron Kuby, were taken off the case for conflict of interest. Stewart was reluctant at first, but Clark convinced her to take the case, arguing that otherwise [...] "the Arab world would feel betrayed by their friends on the American left." [...] Interviewed by the Washington Post about her embrace of Rahman's case, she said, [...] "my own political sense tells me that the only hope for change in Egypt is the fundamentalist movement." [...] Kuby, who had represented Rahman earlier, disagreed with Stewart's characterization, stating, [...] "I love Lynne, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the world could fairly posit the sheikh as a progressive or liberal on any issue." [...] Stewart contended that she understood fundamentalists because attorney general [...] "John Ashcroft is one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1738, she {{was granted}} the unusual {{privilege}} of {{a license to}} run Punch's Theatre at St. James's. [...] This was a puppet theatre, and she used her wooden cast to perform a number of satirical plays. Many of the stringed figures were caricatured after current politicians and actors, including, of course, her father Colley. Her puppet shows were popular; nor could the government shut them down, as, technically, no human actors appeared onstage at Punch's. [...] She decided to take her theatre on tour {{throughout the rest of}} the nation, but, while travelling, she fell seriously ill, likely with nervous exhaustion. [...] Medical bills, according to her autobiography, cost her the theatre, and she was obliged to sell her puppets at a serious loss. [...] She sent young Catherine off with begging notes to her friends and relatives, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> her family was willing or able to help her monetarily. [...] Her father in particular was furious with her for the actors' rebellion at Drury Lane and her unflattering impression of him in Pasquin under his old enemy Fielding.|$|E

60|$|Of course, {{after such}} a {{revolution}} as this, a great deal was required {{to be done to}} settle the affairs of the government on their new footing, and to make the kingdom secure {{in the hands of the}} conqueror; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the least degree acquainted with the character and tendencies of Pyrrhus's mind could expect that he would be at all disposed to attend to these duties. He had neither the sagacity to plan nor the steadiness of purpose to execute such measures. He could conquer, but that was all.

It was neither genial nor infectious; it did not communicate itself to the other persons exposed to it--the caught spy who had provoked it and the armed guard who had brought him into the tent and now stood a little apart, watching his prisoner in the yellow candle-light. It was no part of that warrior's duty to smile; he had been detailed for another purpose. The conversation was resumed; it was in character a trial for a capital offense.|$|E

Carnival week was over, polo and the races had come and gone, and the celebration of Fourth of July was ripening, ere Abel Ah Yo beat down by brutal psychology the citadel of her reluctance. It was then that he gave his famous exhortation which might be summed up as Abel Ah Yo's definition of eternity. Of course, like Billy Sunday on certain occasions, Abel Ah Yo had cribbed the definition. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Islands knew it, and his rating as a revivalist uprose a hundred per cent.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{these things}} be true or false, {{it seemed to}} the ancient worthies who gave us our Catechism that {{children}} had no business with them. They had their own opinions on these matters, and spoke their opinions moderately and wisely, and the sum of their opinions {{we have in the}} Thirty-nine Articles, which are not meant for children, not even for grown persons, excepting scholars and clergymen. Of course every grown person is at liberty to study them; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Church of England is required to agree to them, and to swear that they are true, except scholars at our old Universities, and clergymen, who are bound to have studied such questions. But for the rest of Englishmen all the necessary articles of belief (so the old divines considered) were contained in the simple old Apostles' Creed.|$|E
60|$|The Grand is the Semi or Cottage Grand really, but you {{had better}} go there unless a friend tells you of a better. A long course of good luck has spoiled me for even average hotels.

None the less there are points about the Grand not to be despised. It is modelled on the American fashion, and is but an open door through which you may catch the first gust from the Pacific slope. Officially, there are twice as many English as Americans in the port. Actually, you hear no languages but French, German, or American in the street. My experience is sadly limited, but the American I have heard up to the present, is a tongue as distinct from English as Patagonian.|$|E

60|$|The three {{horsemen}} {{crossed the}} wash and again halted, leisurely, as if time was no object. They were all young, under thirty. The two {{who had not}} spoken were rough-garbed, coarse-featured, and resembled in general a dozen men Joan saw every day. Kells was of a different stamp. Until {{he looked at her}} he reminded her of someone she had known back in Missouri; after he looked at her she was aware, in a curious, sickening way, that no such person as he had ever before seen her. He was pale, gray-eyed, intelligent, amiable. He appeared to be {{a man who had been}} a gentleman. But there was something strange, intangible, immense about him. Was that the effect of his presence or of his name? Kells! It was only a word to Joan. But it carried a nameless and terrible suggestion. During the last year many dark tales had gone from camp to camp in Idaho--some too strange, too horrible for credence--and with every rumor the fame of Kells had grown, and also a fearful certainty of the rapid growth of a legion of evil men out on the border. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the village or from any of the camps ever admitted having seen this Kells. Had fear kept them silent? Joan was amazed that Roberts evidently knew this man.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house is}} very old--{{probably}} the first house {{of some sort}} that stood there was {{in the time of}} the Romans. This was probably renewed--perhaps several times at later periods. The house stands, or, rather, used to stand here when Mercia was a kingdom--I do not suppose that the basement can be later than the Norman Conquest. Some years ago, when I was President of the Mercian Archaeological Society, I went all over it very carefully. This was when it was purchased by Captain March. The house had then been done up, so as to be suitable for the bride. The basement is very strong,--almost as strong and as heavy {{as if it had been}} intended as a fortress. There are a whole series of rooms deep underground. One of them in particular struck me. The room itself is of considerable size, but the masonry is more than massive. In the middle of the room is a sunk well, built up to floor level and evidently going deep underground. There is no windlass nor any trace of there ever having been any--no rope--nothing. Now, we know that the Romans had wells of immense depth, from which the water was lifted by the 'old rag rope'; that at Woodhull used to be nearly a thousand feet. Here, then, we have simply an enormously deep well-hole. The door of the room was massive, and was fastened with a lock nearly a foot square. It was evidently intended for some kind of protection to someone or something; <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> those days had ever heard of anyone having been allowed even to see the room. All this is a propos of a suggestion on my part that the well-hole was a way by which the White Worm (whatever it was) went and came. At that time I would have had a search made--even excavation if necessary--at my own expense, but all suggestions were met with a prompt and explicit negative. So, of course, I took no further step in the matter. Then it died out of recollection--even of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Two {{of these}} gentlemen are {{to a certain}} extent old friends, having been {{passengers}} on the steamer which carried us so far from you. One of them, still young, is typical of the American character, but a respectable person and a lawyer considerably launched. Every one in this country follows a profession, but it must be admitted that the professions are more highly remunerated than chez vous. Mr. Cockerel, even while I write you, is in not undisputed, but temporarily triumphant, possession of my child. He called for her an hour ago in a “boghey”—a strange unsafe rickety vehicle, mounted on enormous wheels, which holds two persons very near together; and I watched her from the window take her place at his side. Then he whirled her away behind two little horses with terribly thin legs; the whole equipage—and most of all her being in it—was in the most questionable taste. But she’ll return—return positively very much as she went. It’s the same when she goes down to Mr. Louis Leverett, who has no vehicle and who merely comes and sits with her in the front salon. He has lived a great deal in Europe and is very fond of the arts, and though I’m not sure I agree with him in his views of the relation of art to life and life to art, and in his interpretation of some of the great works that Aurora and I have studied together, he seems to me a sufficiently serious and intelligent young man. I don’t regard him as intrinsically dangerous, {{but on the other hand}} he offers absolutely no guarantees. I’ve no means whatever of ascertaining his pecuniary situation. There’s a vagueness on these points which is extremely embarrassing, and it never occurs to young men to offer you a reference. In Geneva I shouldn’t be at a loss; I should come to you, chère Madame, with my little inquiry, and what you shouldn’t be able to tell me wouldn’t be worth my knowing. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> New York can give me the smallest information about the état de fortune of Mr. Louis Leverett. It’s true that he’s a native of Boston, where most of his friends reside; I can’t, however, go to the expense of a journey to Boston simply to learn perhaps that Mr. Leverett (the young Louis) has an income of five thousand francs. As I say indeed, he doesn’t strike me as dangerous. When Aurora comes back to me after having passed an hour with him she says he has described to her his emotions on visiting the home of Shelley or discussed some of the differences between the Boston temperament and that of the Italians of the Renaissance. You’ll not enter into these rapprochements, and I can’t blame you. But you won’t betray me, chère Madame? ...|$|E
