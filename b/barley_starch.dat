The effects of acid hydrolysis on the molecular weight of amylopectin and amylose were studied by high -performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with post-column iodine staining. Microstructural studies of 8 % hydrolyzed <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> dispersions heated to 90 0 C showed {{that even a}} short acid treatment induced considerable changes in the granule structure. The molecular weight of amylopectin decreased substantially. As the hydrolysis progressed, the gel network composed of both amylose and amylopectin and separation into amylopectin-rich and amyloserich domains took place. The gel formation of amylose weakened with increased hydrolysis time if heating was to 90 °C, mainly because the amount of amylopectin in the continuous phase increased. Increasing the temperature from 90 to 98 °C induced {{dramatic changes in the}} structure of hydrolyzed starch pastes: most of the granules disintegrated.

Material solubilised {{from the}} waxy starches {{was estimated to}} be 70. 7 % of their amylopectin (AP) plus 3. 7 % of their L. AM and F. AM, and material solubilised from the non-waxy starches {{was estimated to be}} 70. 7 % of their AP plus 28. 9 % of their L. AM and F. AM. The polysaccharide components of the insoluble residue were characterised by HPLC, GPC, and lambda(max) of the polyiodide complex. It was concluded that short chain-length (CL 16) material was from external chains of AP, intermediate material (modal CL 46) was from retrograded F. AM, and longer chain residues (CL 77, 120 - 130) were from lipid-complexed segments of L - AM. The starch lysophospholipids were completely hydrolysed to free fatty acids which remained complexed with L. AM residues. This was shown by the C- 13 Cp/MAS-NMR spectrum which had a clear resonance at 31 ppm from mid-chain methylene carbons of fatty acids in complexes. The C- 1 signal of the L. AM residues also included a feature at 104 ppm indicative of single V 6 AM helices. The wide-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of the residues of non-waxy starches were Cc-type (= mixed A + B types), whereas the spectra of the original starches were A-type. It is suggested that, during the early stages of lintnerisation, amorphous F-AM was partially hydrolysed into material (CL < 120) that retrograded into double helices (with B-type crystallinity) that were resistant to hydrolysis. Evidence for some B-crystalline polymorph was also obtained from the C- 13 Cp/MAS-NMR spectra, which were consistent with a mixture of double helices and V-type glycosidic conformations, with only a small proportion of non-ordered regions. Broad DSC endotherms were found for both waxy (50 - 110 -degrees-C) and non-waxy (50 - 110 -degrees-C) lintner residues, which were assigned to disordering of double helices from short chains (modal CL 16) for waxy residues, together with disordering of longer chains (modal CL 46) in double-helix residues of F.

Amylose (AM) and lysophospholipid (LPL) {{contents}} {{were directly}} correlated in <b>barley</b> <b>starches,</b> but the linear regressions that described the relationships in waxy and nonwaxy starches were quite different. The {{data indicated that}} AM exists partially as lipid-complexed amylose (L. AM), with an LPL-to-L. AM ratio of 1 : 7 and partially as lipid-free amylose (F. AM). The [13]C-cross polarization/magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (CP/MAS-NMR) spectra of the nonwaxy starches had a broad resonance with a chemical shift of 31. 2 +/- 0. 4 ppm, which is characteristic of midchain methylene carbons of fatty acids in the solid state or in V-amylose (V-AM) complexes. The extracted lipid was a viscous liquid that, when mixed with seven parts AM, did not give a discernible peak under the conditions used to acquire the solid- state spectra. However, when the lipid was complexed with AM, it gave a typical V-AM spectrum and a broad resonance at 31. 8 ppm. This proves lipid complexed with L. AM existed in the native starches and was not an artifact formed subsequently from free LPL and F. AM. The intensity of the resonance {{was consistent with the}} LPL content of the starches. Independent supporting evidence was obtained by differential scanning calorimetry that showed a constant enthalpy for disordering of amylopectin, DeltaH(AP), for all waxy and nonwaxy starches, regardless of L. AM content and, hence, no exothermic formation of L. AM during starch gelatinization. Twelve waxy <b>barley</b> <b>starches</b> used in this study contained 0. 8 - 4. 0 % L. AM and 0. 9 - 6. 4 % F. AM; six nonwaxy starches contained 6. 1 - 7. 2 % L. AM and 23. 1 - 25. 0 % F. AM. All starches had essentially identical AP structures, as show by the chain lengths of debranched starches fractionated by gel-permeation chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. L. AM and F. AM appeared to have quite different effects on starch gelatinization behavior. Peak gelatinization temperature (Tp) of the waxy starches was p ositively correlated with L. AM content; because the Tp of the nonwaxy starches was much lower than predicted from the regression equation for the waxy starches, we concluded that F. AM lowered Tp. Swelling of starches at 80 C is essentially a property of AP content that is inhibited by LPL, but the relationship is not strictly linear.

In this work, {{the roles of}} two universal features of starch biosynthesis were investigated to better understand their impact on starch molecular structure. To investigate the impact of diurnal photosynthetic activity on starch fine structure, normal and waxy barley were cultivated in a greenhouse under normal diurnal, or constant light photosynthetic conditions. The impact of starch branching enzymes on starch structure was investigated by studying the lintners of <b>barley</b> <b>starch,</b> which had all known genes coding for starch branching enzymes (SBE I, SBE IIa, SBE IIb) suppressed in the grain resulting in a novel amylose-only starch (AOS). The structure of AOS lintners was compared to lintners from normal <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> (NBS) and waxy <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> (WBS). Unexpectedly, NBS and WBS displayed growth rings regardless of lighting regimes. It was observed that the molecular structure and composition of (NBS) {{was influenced by the}} diurnal lighting regime, as NBS contained lower quantities of amylose, and a lower ratio of long chain amylose:short chain amylose (determined by gel permeation chromatography) when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime compared to the constant light regime. While the composition of WBS remained constant, higher relative crystallinity values (determined by X-ray diffraction), and greater crystalline quality (determined by differential scanning calorimetry) were observed when cultivated under the diurnal lighting regime. When considering the fine structure of amylopectin from NBS and WBS, differences in structure were observed when cultivated under the different lighting regimes. The structure of clusters and building blocks of amylopectin were investigated following their isolation by partial and complete hydrolysis with α-amylase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Clusters of amylopectin from NBS and WBS cultivated under diurnal photosynthetic conditions were larger, and contained a greater number of building blocks compared to their counterparts cultivated in constant light conditions. AOS exhibited irregular morphological features and contained multi-lobed granules with a rough surface texture. When viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), acid hydrolyzed components of AOS displayed strong textured aggregates with an organization not previous seen in other specimens, whereas NBS and WBS displayed expected stacks of elongated elements with a width of 5 - 7 nm, believed to represent crystalline amylopectin side chains viewed longitudinally. High performance anion-exchange chromatography of lintners at equivalent levels of acid hydrolysis (45 wt%) revealed that the average degree of polymerization of the AOS lintner was 21, substantially smaller than that of NBS and WBS (42). While NBS and WBS lintners displayed size distribution and chain length profiles expected of those from <b>barley</b> <b>starch,</b> the AOS lintner displayed a unique size distribution profile wherein a repeat-size of the molecules corresponding to 5 - 6 glucose residue was observed, which corresponds to the approximate number of residues required per turn of the helical structure of amylose.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of acetylation and oxidation on the structural, morphological, physical–chemical, thermal and pasting properties of <b>barley</b> <b>starch.</b> Barley starches were acetylated at different catalyst levels (11 %, 17 %, and 23 % of NaOH solution) and oxidized at different sodium hypochlorite concentrations (1. 0 %, 1. 5 %, and 2. 0 % of active chlorine). Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffractograms, thermal, morphological, and pasting properties, swelling power and solubility of starches were evaluated. The degree of substitution (DS) of the acetylated starches increased with the rise in catalyst concentration. The percentage of carbonyl (CO) and carboxyl (COOH) groups in oxidized starches also increased with the rise of active chlorine level. The presence of hydrophobic acetyl groups, carbonyl and carboxyl groups caused a partial disorganization and depolymerization of starch granules. The structural, morphological and functional changes in acetylated and oxidized starches varied according to reaction conditions.

Current literature pretreatments for debranching prior to CLD determination involve varying protocols, which might yield artifactual results. This paper examines the two widely used starch dissolution treatments with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing 0. 5 % (w/w) lithium bromide (DMSO-LiBr) at 80 °C and with aqueous alkaline (i. e.

In {{this thesis}} {{the effect of}} different ways of thermal processing (pelleting, expanding, toasting) of barley and maize on the degradative behaviour of their starch and protein in the rumen of lactating dairy cows are described. In situ studies showed that all thermal processing methods increased the ruminal starch and protein availability of maize, while all thermal processing methods decreased ruminal starch availability but only pelleting increased ruminal protein availability of barley. Based on in vivo experiments compared to untreated grains, expander treatment increased the apparent rumen and total tract digestibility of maize starch but {{did not affect the}} digestibility of <b>barley</b> <b>starch.</b> Supplementing grazing dairy cows with pelleted and pressure toasted maize and barley slightly (not significantly) decreased the dry matter intake of grass in the first grazing event in the morning after milking, and it decreased ruminal clearence of nitrogen. Supplementing pasture grass with pelleted and pressure toasted cereal grains decreased the pH, the NH 3 -N level in the rumen, the ammonia to total VFA (TVFA) ratio, the isobutyrate proportion, the acetate to propionate ratio and the non-glucogenic to glucogenic ratio in the rumen. Simultaneously it increased TVFA concentrations, propionate, butyrate and valerate proportions {{as a percentage of the}} TVFA. All processed grains did affect production responses in dairy cows, by elevating milk protein and decreasing milk fat production, and milk urea nitrogen but no significant differences between these two heat treatments were found. It is concluded that the need of synchrony is specially important with diets based on fresh grass, in which markedly asynchronous rates of release of energy and nitrogen occur in the rumen. It appears that to generate a better ruminal N and organic matter synchrony to improve microbial N yield and N utilization feeding different types of cereal grain that differ by nature in rate and extent of ruminal degradation has more effect than using one of this processing methods on the same type of grain. Responses obtained from cereal grain supplementation are very dependent on the quality and degradation characteristics of the pasture consumed, which changes through the grazing season. </TR...|$|E

The feeding experiment comprised 20 Finnish Ayrshire bulls and 12 Holstein-Friesian bulls, and four treatments (8 bulls per treatment). There were four diets with two offered at stage 1 (from the initiation of the study to 450 kg live weight) and four at stage 2 (from 450 kg live weight to slaughter). The control diet (BF 0) included grass silage (460 g kg 1 dry matter) and barley grain (540), BF 25 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (405) and BF (135), BF 50 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (270) and BF (270), and BF 75 diet included grass silage (460), barley grain (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF 0 and BF 50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing barley grain with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P < 0. 05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg 1 live weight gain) (P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P < 0. 001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) with partial replacement of barley grain with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P < 0. 05) quadratic effect: the BF 25 and BF 50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50 % of <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> is replaced with BF. At 75 % replacement, feed intake was reduced, which resulted in a lower energy intake and reduced level of performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Correlations among <b>barley</b> protein, <b>starch</b> {{molecular}} structure and grain size were determined using 30 barley samples with variable protein contents. Starch {{molecular structure}} {{was characterized by}} fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis and by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC, also termed GPC). The chain-length distributions of amylopectin were fitted using a mathematical model reflecting the relative activities of starch branching enzymes and starch synthase enzymes. Increased protein content significantly and negatively correlated with higher amounts of amylose with longer chains (degree of polymerization, DP 1600 – 40000) while barley grain sizes positively associated with starch contents. Protein content also positively correlated with the proportion of longer chains of amylopectin (DP 34 – 100). These {{results showed that the}} enzyme activities of starch synthases change with protein content, leading to altered starch contents, structures and grain sizes. From this perspective, selecting for large grain size (or low protein content) does not necessarily relate to starch structure, although may suggest long chains of amylopectin. Measuring starch structure could give a good indication of process performance in human food, animal feed and brewing, as all these structural features contribute to significant functional properties...|$|R

Chicken surimi gels were prepared from mechanically deboned chicken meat, mixed with trehalose (w = 8 %), maltose (w = 8 %), tapioca modified starch (MTS) (w = 8 %) and <b>barley</b> modified <b>starch</b> (MBS) (w = 8 %), quickly frozen and stored for 90 days s on - 30 oC. Instrumental colour parameters (Lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*) and whiteness (L* − 3 b*) of chicken surimi gels were significantly (P < 0, 05) affected by addition of trehalose, maltose and modified starches. Highest values of lightness (L*) and whiteness showed sample mixed with MBS. Textural {{profile analysis}} (TPA) parameters, hardness and chewiness increased significantly (P < 0, 05) by addition of trehalose, maltose, MBS and MTS. Cohesiveness and springiness of chicken surimi gels were also significantly (P < 0, 05) affected by addition of trehalose, maltose MBS and MTS.

40|$|Functionalities of starch {{for food}} and non-food {{applications}} are dependent on the starch structures and properties, which are affected by both the genetics and the growing conditions of the crop. Objectives of this dissertation research were to 1) Understand the unique properties of Tibetan hull-less <b>barley</b> <b>starches,</b> their structures, and the impacts of growing conditions; and 2) Understand dosage effects of waxy gene on the contents and structures of amylose and amylopectin and properties of corn starch; and 3) Understand the starch physicochemical properties of Apios mother and child tuber and the mechanism of starch development. Tibetan hull-less barley varieties, BQ and KQ, were grown at two locations with different growing temperatures and rainfall. The BQ starches displayed significantly lower onset-gelatinization temperature, larger gelatinization-temperature range, and higher peak viscosities than the KQ starches. The differences in starch thermal and pasting properties between BQ and KQ starches were attributed to the annealing of starch and enhanced amylose-lipid complex formation, resulting from higher growing temperature and more rainfall during {{the development of the}} KQ starches. Reciprocal crossing of isogenic normal and waxy corn lines was conducted to develop hybrids with different dosages of waxy gene (3, 2, 1, 0) in the endosperm. The amylose content of starch and proportion of extra-long branch-chains negatively correlated with dosages of the waxy gene. The proportion of short chains (DP 3 ̆c 17) positively correlated, whereas that of intermediate chains (DP 17 - 30) negatively correlated with dosages of the waxy gene. The conclusion gelatinization-temperature and gelatinization temperature-range of the starch were positively correlated with the waxy-gene dosage, indicating that amylose facilitates gelatinization of the surrounding crystallites of amylopectin. Apios americanais a wild legume bearing edible tubers. Domestication of Apios is in process because of the superior nutritional value of the tuber. The harvested Apios tuber can be planted in the following year as the mother tuber to further grow and produce child tubers. The Apios mother-tuber starch displayed higher degree of crystallinity, greater gelatinization enthalpy-change, longer branch-chain length of amylopectin, and lower pasting viscosity than the counterpart child-tuber starch. The mother-tuber starch of Apios 2127 showed two peaks of gelatinization, which was attributed to two groups of starch granules having different structures and gelatinization temperatures. The group of starch granules with a higher gelatinization-temperature was carried over from the previous year and went through a longer annealing process during the two-year growing of the tuber. These results of this dissertation research demonstrated significant effects of both genetics and the growing conditions on starch structures and properties...|$|R
40|$|Real {{degree of}} {{fermentation}} (RDF) {{is an important}} measure of brewhouse performance {{in the production of}} beer. In this work, the relationship of RDF with malted <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> properties was investigated. Starches were isolated from 25 malted barley samples and analyzed for molecular size distribution (by HPSEC), AP structural features (by high-performance size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle laser light scattering and RI detectors), and thermal properties (by DSC). Cluster analysis, analysis of variance, principal component analysis, bivariate correlation, and multiple linear regression analysis were used in establish-ing correlations. RDF, AM, and AP content were 74. 0 – 80. 1 %, 25. 2 – 34. 4 %, and 65. 6 – 74. 9 %, respectively. Starch gelatinization enthalpy was 6. 4 – 8. 1 J/g, and onset gelatinization temperature was 58. 5 – 64. 38 C. AP and AM content had a positive and negative impact on RDF, respectively. The effect of thermal properties (starch gelatinization and AM-lipid com-plex melting) on RDF was not clear. Starch properties explained up to 86 % of RDF variance to indicate that other malted barley constituents and/or properties also contribute to cultivar variations in RDF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{structural}} {{characteristics and}} physicochemical properties of <b>barley</b> <b>starch</b> differ with granule size, which {{are important in}} final product applications of barley flours. A barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar, Yangsimai 3, was used to investigate the development of small starch granule in endosperm under electron microscope to provide references to barley breeding. Large starch granules were formed and developed at the early stage of endosperm development. Large amyloplasts with large starch granules were divided and increased in number through binary fission. One large amyloplast had only 1 large starch granule. Small starch granules could be formed and develop at the middle and late stage of endosperm development. Endosperm cells had large amyloplasts that exhibited protrusion, {{and some of the}} protrusions contained small starch granules. Small amyloplasts with small starch granules formed new small amyloplasts to produce small starch granules by the way of protruding their envelopes. Many small starch granules were formed and developed in 1 small amyloplast. The amyloplast envelope began to degrade and release starch granules into cell matrix when amyloplast was full of starch granules. These results showed that small amyloplasts came from the protrusion of amyloplast envelopes. Many small starc...|$|E
40|$|Microstructural and {{rheological}} {{changes during}} gelatinisation are important indicators of starch functionality. A combined rheometer and optical microscope system (Rheoscope 1, Thermo Haake) {{was used to}} monitor the gelatinisation of different starches (maize starch containing 0 %, 24 %, 55 % and 85 % amylose; wheat starch and <b>barley</b> <b>starch)</b> suspended in a 0. 1 % guar solution (to minimise settling during {{the initial stages of}} gelatinisation). The 0. 1 % guar solution was selected after Rapid Visco Analyser, Modulated DSC and settling studies indicated that it minimised any effect on starch gelatinisation compared to carboxy methyl cellulose and xanthan. The Rheoscope study demonstrated that the viscosity of the starch during gelatinisation is related to changes in starch granules as a result of swelling. There was a two to threefold increase in starch granule size during the gelatinisation for all starches except for high amylose maize starches. Viscosity development during the gelatinisation was affected by the presence of B-type granules, whose presence tended to reduce the overall viscosity increase, indicating the importance of starch granules size and their distribution in determining the rheological responses of starch during gelatinisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of different}} starches and their mixtures was investigated using several analysis techniques, i. e. small-deformation oscillatory measurements (rheological measurements), differential scanning calo-rimetry (DSC), light microscopy, and UV spectrophotometry (turbidi-metry). Potato, waxy maize and <b>barley</b> <b>starches</b> were mixed {{two and two}} in different ratios and at different water contents (Paper I). In the DSC gelatinisation thermograms of the starch mixtures, thermogram characteristics of the individual starches were detected. The waxy maize-barley and potato-barley mixtures had the lowest retrogradation enthalpy values. The retrogradation enthalpy measured for most starch mixtures was equal to the calculated value assuming that each starch contributed to the enthalpy according to its proportion in the mixture. A simple, less time-consuming and non-chemical method for preparing starch samples was established (Paper II). Using light microscopy, no granules were observed after temperature treatments between 130 - 160 °C, thereby preventing the influence of granules or granule rem-nants on the rheological behaviour of starch samples could be avoided. The influence of granule remnants on the rheological properties of starch samples treated at 90 °C was observed, when compared to sam-ples treated at 140 °C (Paper III). Native potato starch gave higher moduli values than high amylopectin potato starch (HAPP), after both 90 and 140 °C treatments. A mixture of commercial amylose and HAPP gave lower storage modulus (G’) compared to native potato starch. The contribution of amylopectin to the rheological behaviour of blends with commercial amylose was investigated (Paper IV). In amy-lose-HAPP mixtures, higher amounts of amylose produced higher G’ values, and gave rheological behaviour similar to pure amylose sam-ples. The rheological behaviour of hydrophobically modified potato starch (HMPot) with two levels of substitution was studied, {{as well as its}} mixtures with HAPP or sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) (Paper V). At higher concentrations, the moduli for HMPot starch were higher than for native potato starch and HAPP. Increasing the octenyl succi-nate anhydride (OSA) substitution degree decreased the moduli values. HMPot showed slower gel formation than native potato starch and HAPP. Decreasing proportions of HMPot in mixtures of HMPot and HAPP reduced the moduli values, and produced a rheological behav-iour resembling that of HAPP. Amylose or OSA seemed not to con-tribute to the network properties in the HMPot-HAPP mixtures at HMPot proportions lower than 50 %. Adding of SDS to HMPot re-duced the moduli at the lower concentrations (1 %) investigated. An increase in SDS concentration to 2 % increased the moduli. Adding of SDS to native potato starch and HAPP led to an increase in the moduli. With increasing SDS concentration, the G’ values for native potato starch and HAPP became increasingly similar...|$|R
40|$|<b>Barley</b> grain <b>starch</b> {{is formed}} by amylose and {{amylopectin}} in a 1 : 3 ratio, and is packed into granules of different dimensions. The distribution of granule dimension is bimodal, {{with a majority}} of small spherical B-granules and a smaller amount of large discoidal A-granules containing {{the majority of the}} starch. Starch granules are semi-crystalline structures with characteristic X-ray diffraction patterns. Distinct features of starch granules are controlled by different enzymes and are relevant for nutritional value or industrial applications. Here, the Targeting-Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) approach was applied on the barley TILLMore TILLING population to identify 29 new alleles in five genes related to starch metabolism known to be expressed in the endosperm during grain filling: BMY 1 (Beta-amylase 1), GBSSI (Granule Bound Starch Synthase I), LDA 1 (Limit Dextrinase 1), SSI (Starch Synthase I), SSIIa (Starch Synthase IIa). Reserve starch of nine M 3 mutant lines carrying missense or nonsense mutations was analysed for granule size, crystallinity and amylose/amylopectin content. Seven mutant lines presented starches with different features in respect to the wild-type: (i) a mutant line with a missense mutation in GBSSI showed a 4 -fold reduced amylose/amylopectin ratio; (ii) a missense mutations in SSI resulted in 2 -fold increase in A:B granule ratio; (iii) a nonsense mutation in SSIIa was associated with shrunken seeds with a 2 -fold increased amylose/amylopectin ratio and different type of crystal packing in the granule; (iv) the remaining four missense mutations suggested a role of LDA 1 in granule initiation, and of SSIIa in determining the size of A-granules.

40|$|Starch is of {{fundamental}} importance for plant development and reproduction and its optimized molecular assembly is potentially necessary for correct starch metabolism. Re-structuring of starch granules in-planta can therefore potentially affect plant metabolism. Modulation of granule micro-structure {{was achieved by}} decreasing starch branching and increasing starch-bound phosphate content in the <b>barley</b> caryopsis <b>starch</b> by RNAi suppression of all three Starch Branching Enzyme (SBE) isoforms or overexpression of potato Glucan Water Dikinase (GWD). The resulting lines displayed Amylose-Only (AO) and Hyper-Phosphorylated (HP) starch chemotypes, respectively. We studied the influence of these alterations on primary metabolism, grain composition, starch structural features and starch granule morphology over caryopsis development at 10, 20 and 30 days after pollination (DAP) and at grain maturity. While HP showed relatively little effect, AO showed significant reduction in starch accumulation with re-direction to protein and β-glucan (BG) accumulation. Metabolite profiling indicated significantly higher sugar accumulation in AO, with re-partitioning of carbon to accumulate amino acids, and interestingly it also had high levels of some important stress-related metabolites and potentially protective metabolites, possibly to elude deleterious effects. Investigations on starch molecular structure revealed significant increase in starch phosphate and amylose content in HP and AO respectively with obvious differences in starch granule morphology at maturity. The results demonstrate that decreasing the storage starch branching resulted in metabolic adjustments and re-directions, tuning to evade deleterious effects on caryopsis physiology and plant performance while only little effect was evident by increasing starch-bound phosphate {{as a result of}} overexpressing GWD...|$|R
