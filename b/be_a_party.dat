25|$|British Prime Ministers {{have never}} been elected {{directly}} by the public. A Prime Minister need not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> leader; David Lloyd George was not a party leader during his service as prime Minister during World War I, and neither was Ramsay MacDonald from 1931 to 1935. Prime Ministers have taken office because they were members of either the Commons or Lords, and either inherited {{a majority in the}} Commons or won more seats than the opposition in a general election.|$|E
25|$|The {{fast-track}} trial {{opened on}} 6 April and was adjourned until 31 May. El Mahroug's lawyer said that Mahroug {{would not be}} attaching herself to the case as a civil complainant and denies that she ever made herself available for money. Another alleged victim, Giorgia Iafrate, also decided not to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the case. In January 2013, judges rejected an application from Berlusconi's lawyers to have the trial adjourned {{so that it would}} not interfere with Italy's 2013 general election in which Berlusconi participated.|$|E

Chabbra said she would not proceed with her attempt to force a new nomination meeting due to the tight time frame before the election.|$|E
25|$|In July 2002, Ashcroft {{proposed}} {{the creation of}} Operation TIPS, a domestic program in which workers and government employees would inform law enforcement agencies about suspicious behavior they encounter while performing their duties. The program was widely criticized from the beginning, with critics deriding the program as essentially a Domestic Informant Network {{along the lines of}} the East German Stasi or the Soviet KGB, and an encroachment upon the First and Fourth amendments. The United States Postal Service refused to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to it. Ashcroft defended the program as a necessary component of the ongoing War on Terrorism, but the proposal was eventually abandoned.|$|E

Le Challeux and six others of the company decided to {{make their way to the}} coast in the hope of being rescued by the ships which had {{remained}} below in the river. They passed the night in a grove of trees in view of the sea, and the following morning, as they were struggling through a large swamp, they observed some men half hidden by the vegetation, whom they took to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> of Spaniards come down to cut them off. But closer observation showed that they were naked, and terrified like themselves, and when they recognized their leader, Laudonnière, and others of their companions, they joined them.

25|$|The first Europeans {{to follow}} {{the course of the}} river are thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> led by Walter Mitchell in early 1839, who were guided by Aborigines along a route from the north through the Tongio Gap south of Omeo, down the valley to Bruthen and the Gippsland Lakes, and then back along the same route. An {{agricultural}} station was set up around the same time at Tongio by the Buckleys. Late in 1839 Angus McMillan established a station further south near present-day Ensay, and also used Aboriginal guides on his explorations further south along the valley and into other parts of Gippsland soon thereafter. The early explorers of Australia noted that the routes along the river and valley were well used Aboriginal trails, although in places such as the section between Tambo Crossing and Bruthen, where the river is less accessible, the trails diverted through the mountains in a similar way to the current main road through this area.|$|E
25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different people who are still currently trying to tread their own path. It can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E
25|$|From 1937 to 1998, the Irish {{constitution}} {{included a}} claim on Northern Ireland {{as a part}} of the national territory. However, the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups – principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army – who tried to unite Ireland by force. This occurred in the 1950s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale. Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as The Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s. The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. In 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they wish to have it.|$|E

The conference motion was reversed the following year, but he continued to pursue the matter in parliament. On 29 May 1962 he urged that Britain not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the renewal of nuclear tests, and in a speech on 23 July he said: [...] "The unilateral abandonment of testing—or, better still, a test ban agreement—would be the most valuable first step towards general and complete disarmament." ...|$|E
500|$|Design work on {{the ship}} {{that came to be}} {{designated}} H-39 began in 1937. The design staff was instructed to improve upon the design for the preceding Bismarck class; one of the requirements was a larger-caliber main battery to match any battleship built by a potential adversary. It appeared that Japan would not ratify the Second London Naval Treaty, which would bring an escalator clause that permitted signatories to arm battleships with guns of up to [...] caliber. By virtue of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, signed in 1935, Germany was considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to the other international naval arms limitation treaties. In April, Japan refused to sign the treaty; shortly thereafter, the United States Navy announced it would arm the new s with 40.6cm guns.|$|E
500|$|When {{the party}} {{returned}} to Tranby Croft that evening Lycett Green, Stanley Wilson and both Somersets met Coventry; Levett refused to attend. After Lycett Green had told Coventry {{what he had}} seen, the latter summoned Williams, who was a mutual friend of both the prince and Gordon-Cumming. Lycett Green repeated the allegation once again. Williams later recounted that he was [...] "shocked and overwhelmed {{with a sense of}} calamity", and said that Edward must be informed immediately. There was some disagreement between the courtiers on whether to tell the prince; Coventry and Wilson both thought it the right move, but Arthur Somerset felt that the matter could and should be dealt with by those present. [...] Later he was [...] persuaded that informing the prince was the right course of action. Lycett Green grew more pugnacious throughout the discussions, and threatened to accuse Gordon-Cumming in public at the races the following day; he also stated that [...] "I will not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to letting Gordon-Cumming prey on society in future". The men decided that Gordon-Cumming should sign a document admitting his guilt in exchange for their silence, and Williams and Coventry went to Edward to inform him of what had been happening. The two men told the prince that [...] "the evidence they had heard was absolutely conclusive and they did not believe Sir William Gordon-Cumming had a leg to stand on".|$|E

2500|$|Bujor unsuccessfully {{fought against}} the 1923 constitution, {{proposed}} by a PNL-dominated Assembly.

He also accused the formerly progressive Brătianu of [...] "cowardice" [...] for having gone back on promises for proportional representation. With the Bessarabian Vasile Stroescu, and with many other activists and socialists, he founded in August the League for Human Rights. In October 1924, speaking both in parliament and at university, Bujor condemned Cuza's disciple, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, for the assassination of Constantin Manciu—described by him as an [...] "odious" [...] deed, one ultimately inspired by Cuza and the National-Christian Defense League.|$|E

2500|$|However, what Huxley {{proposed}} was {{to create}} an edited version of the Bible, shorn of [...] "shortcomings and errors... statements to which men of science absolutely and entirely demur... These tender children [...] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe". The Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money {{should be used to}} support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were minuted in detail. Huxley said [...] "I will never <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to enabling the State to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools permitted the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any denominational doctrine to be taught.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{atmosphere}} of growing conflict, Mussolini persuaded Hitler {{to put the}} dispute to a four-power conference and on 29 September 1938, Hitler, Chamberlain, Édouard Daladier (the French Prime Minister) and Mussolini met in Munich. Czechoslovakia was not to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>party</b> to these talks, nor was the Soviet Union. The four powers agreed that Germany would complete its occupation of the Sudetenland but that an international commission would consider other disputed areas. Czechoslovakia was told that {{if it did not}} submit, it would stand alone. At Chamberlain's request, Hitler readily signed a peace treaty between the United Kingdom and Germany. Chamberlain returned to Britain promising [...] "peace for our time". Before Munich, President Roosevelt sent a telegram to Chamberlain saying [...] "Good man", and afterwards told the American ambassador in Rome, [...] "I am not a bit upset over the final result." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discomfort in the British Army with {{possible}} military action within Ireland was {{to some extent}} mirrored in the Royal Navy.
