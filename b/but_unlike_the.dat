5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1967, the North Vietnamese instigated a series of actions in the border regions of South Vietnam. All of these attacks were {{conducted}} by regimental-size NVA/NLF units, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> usual hit-and-run tactics used by the People's Army forces, these were sustained and bloody affairs.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} ethnic groups prefer to {{communicate}} in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by {{a small minority of}} the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the 3 main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{the more}} famous Stanley Cup, members of the winning teams are allowed time to {{celebrate}} with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada. The board of directors for the Canadian Football Hall of Fame act as the Grey Cup's trustees and control its rental for events. The trophy {{is accompanied by a}} designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all times. Like the Stanley Cup, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Vince Lombardi Trophy, a new trophy is not made every year.|$|E

5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The six-boat {{group that}} {{included}} UB-43 and UB-47 was ordered in July 1915, and both boats {{had been laid}} down in early September. This group was selected by the German Admiralstab for deployment to the Mediterranean, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> smaller UB I boats, they could not as easily be transported overland by rail. Weser prepared the boats for rail shipment by cutting the boat sections longitudinally, and sent all the materials, along with German shipyard workers, to Pola, where the boats were reassembled. UB-43 was launched in early April 1916, while UB-47 followed in June.|$|E

5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (<b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was {{a decline in the}} number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands in each direction during every off-peak hour. By 1960, it had dropped to two trains in each direction.|$|E
5|$|Crunch owner, Howard Dolgon, {{pursued the}} ideal of having his team in an outdoor game, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> National Hockey League's (NHL) Winter Classic the Crunch were {{responsible}} for funding the entire event. In order to afford the cost of hosting an outdoor game sponsorship deals with several independent organizations were made including Mirabito Energy Products, which lent {{its name to the}} title of the event. In part because of his success in putting on the event, Dolgon was awarded the James C. Hendy Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding executive. Following the success of the Mirabito Outdoor Classic other AHL Outdoor Classics were held by other AHL teams.|$|E
5|$|In Buah Rindu, Amir {{shows an}} {{affinity}} for using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> highly fixed traditional forms, he mixes the rhyming patterns. The text is dominated by terms related to love and searching, and according to Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw the collection is united by a theme of longing. Johns states that the imagery in Buah Rindu is dependent on traditional Malay literature, and that Amir's terminology is heavily influenced by classical Malay poetry. The author's use of language is also notably coloured by Javanese terms and ideas, and another source of influence appears to be Indian literature, with references to Hindu gods and goddesses.|$|E
50|$|A {{half-way house}} between {{standard}} Blackwood and RKCB is Keycard Blackwood. Again {{there are five}} key cards, including <b>the</b> trump king, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> RKCB, <b>the</b> queen of trumps is not considered.|$|R

50|$|The Péreire {{brothers}} were prominent 19th-century financiers in Paris, France, who were rivals of the Rothschilds. Like the Rothschilds, they were Jews, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> them <b>the</b> Péreire {{brothers were}} Sephardi Jews of Portuguese origin.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the food}} eaten by station crews was frozen, {{refrigerated}} or canned. Menus were prepared by the cosmonauts, {{with the help of}} a dietitian, before their flight to the station. The diet was designed to provide around 100g of protein, 130g of fat and 330g of carbohydrates per day, in addition to appropriate mineral and vitamin supplements. Meals were spaced out through the day to aid assimilation. Canned food such as jellied beef tongue was placed into a niche in the core module's table, where it could be warmed in 5–10 minutes. Usually, crews drank tea, coffee and fruit juices, <b>but,</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> ISS, the station also had a supply of cognac and vodka for special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, {{as was the case}} in both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still have the opportunity to make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 1891, University Hall, the school's first brick {{building}}, {{caught on}} fire. As {{a result of}} the fire the top two floors of the building as well as the roof were destroyed. The building was then re-built after the 1891 fire, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> original plans it was constructed with a Mansard style roof. Additionally, a square tower was also built on top in lieu of the original cupola which included a school bell. From its construction until 1987, Waller Hall was used as an academic hall and hosted classes along with housing the school's chapel and as offices for the faculty.|$|E
50|$|These {{sandgrouse}} have small, pigeon-like {{heads and}} necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails. Their legs are feathered down to <b>the</b> toes, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Syrrhaptes <b>the</b> toes are not feathered.|$|R

50|$|Four add-on {{utilities}} were included: LocoSpell (a spell checker), LocoMail (a {{mail merge}} program), LocoFile (a database program), and a Printer Support Pack, <b>but</b> (<b>unlike</b> in <b>the</b> earlier Locoscript versions) these utilities {{were no longer}} sold separately.|$|R
5|$|The brain-like surface folds {{and mature}} olive-brown gleba are {{characteristic}} of Calvatia craniiformis, but younger puffballs {{that have not yet}} developed these characteristics may be difficult to identify to species. Another edible puffball, C.cyathiformis (lilac puffball) grows to similar dimensions but has gleba that is purple-brown when mature. Calvatia fragilis is smaller and pink or purple mature gleba. C.bicolor is a smaller, rounder puffball that could be confused with younger specimens of C.craniiformis, but the former species has more coarsely ornamented spores, and lacks a distinct subgleba. Handkea utriformis is roughly similar in appearance to C.craniiformis, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> latter it develops a cavernous opening to reveal an olive-brown gleba, and has distinct slits in its capillitial threads.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of 4 consists of mid-tempo pieces, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> filler {{that might have}} occupied this pacing on previous albums, many of this album’s greatest strengths lie in this realm. Perhaps best exemplifying this spirit is the André 3000 and Kanye West assisted, 'Party' in which Beyoncé relaxes into a beat that, while {{not be easy to}} grind to, still works perfectly as a party anthem. Beyoncé reminds us that a party is not only meant for dancing. It is a place where you go to enjoy the company of others and oftentimes, that involves real human conversation and interaction. Echoing this sentiment, André’s verse is tranquilized from his customarily rapid-fire delivery to a drawl more reminiscent of Lil’ Wayne than his traditional work with Outkast. 'Party' like much of 4, is a conversation, and André 3000 wants to be heard.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among {{the best known of}} these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E

5|$|In May 2012, Böcker {{announced}} that he was working on a concert of music solely from the Final Fantasy series, to be titled Final Symphony. The idea for the concert was first proposed by Uematsu in 2009 after Symphonic Fantasies; the concert had featured Final Fantasy music as one of its four components, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> other three the music had been a straightforward medley rather than a more complicated arrangement. While Uematsu had asked the team to keep the arrangements similar to those in other Final Fantasy concerts, after the concert he felt that an opportunity had been missed to create something unique like the other three arrangements, especially the Secret of Mana section. He encouraged Böcker to take more liberties with the source material if the opportunity arose, and hoped that another concert could be created in the future. Böcker proposed Final Symphony later that year to Uematsu, and got approval from Square Enix while coordinating a Tokyo concert of Symphonic Fantasies. Final Symphony is the first concert consisting entirely of new Final Fantasy arrangements in over ten years, since 20020220 - Music from Final Fantasy.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E
5|$|The telenovela {{features}} Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro, {{who both}} {{appeared in the}} successful telenovela Muñeca Brava, as lead actors. The {{relationship between the two}} was more than professional; Facundo Arana had spontaneously been offered a guest appearance on the Russian series A ritmo de tango starring Oreiro. Both actors agreed to appear in You Are the One on the condition that they worked together. As a result, the program design was decided only after both were confirmed in the leading roles. Oreiro delayed filming proposals in Israel, Spain, and Uruguay, and the recording of her fourth music album to join the project. As in Muñeca Brava, the narrative of You Are the One revolves around a wealthy suitor and a poor woman, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> former program it does not concentrate all the characters on a single narrative context. You Are the One organizes two contexts for both the rich and the poor, each one with its own characteristic locations and supporting characters.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the city}} are other {{universities}} like FEMA which was created by Assis's city hall (in other words, is a state university), <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> Unesp <b>the</b> courses are not free and their {{students are required to}} pay tuition in all courses.|$|R
50|$|Super Bikes {{is similar}} in some ways to The Fast and <b>the</b> Furious, <b>but</b> <b>unlike</b> in <b>the</b> first game, players ride on bikes and compete on nine {{different}} tracks.
