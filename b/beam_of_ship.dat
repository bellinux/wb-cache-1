5000|$|Ancient Egyptian {{technology}} describes {{devices and}} technologies invented or used in Ancient Egypt. The Egyptians invented and used many simple machines, {{such as the}} ramp and the lever, to aid construction processes. They used rope trusses to stiffen the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships.</b> Egyptian paper, made from papyrus, and pottery were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The wheel was used {{for a number of}} purposes, but chariots only came into use after the Second Intermediate period. The Egyptians also {{played an important role in}} developing Mediterranean maritime technology including ships and lighthouses.|$|R
50|$|Dianas {{standard}} displacement was 3,610 tons. Length and <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> are 390 ft and 43 ft respectively, she {{was capable}} of steaming at over 30 kn. The normal peacetime complement of Diana was 297 officers and men.|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, {{the wider}} the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> (or boat), the more initial {{stability}} it has, at expense of reserve {{stability in the}} event of a capsize, where more energy is required to right the vessel from its inverted position.|$|R
50|$|The <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> is its width at {{the widest}} point as {{measured}} at the ship's nominal waterline. The beam is a bearing projected at right-angles from the fore and aft line, outwards from the widest part <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> <b>Beam</b> may {{also be used to}} define the maximum width <b>of</b> a <b>ship's</b> hull, or maximum width plus superstructure overhangs.|$|R
5000|$|The Crosstree {{serves as}} a fresh base to spread {{the next level of}} {{supporting}} [...] guy ropes, thereby providing a stable height extension to the masts. Without the crosstree, the ship's mast would have been severely limited in height, in relation to the width [...] (<b>beam)</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b>|$|R

60|$|The <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> are massive wooden timbers, which extend {{across from}} side to side in a series of tiers. They serve the purpose of binding the sides together, of {{preventing}} them from collapsing, and of supporting the decks, as well as of giving compactness and great strength to the whole structure.|$|R
50|$|The main {{protection}} was a belt of armour {{along the side}} <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> 260 ft long and 7 ft deep, which was 7 in thick around the ship's machinery, reducing to 6 in fore and aft. An armoured deck protected the whole length and <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship,</b> with between 3 in and 1.5 in thick armour. The ship's hull was clad in copper and wood to reduce fouling.|$|R

50|$|Since {{one must}} sail against the narrow gulfs of western India, special large boats were used and ship {{development}} was demanded. At {{the entrance of}} the gulf, large ships called trappaga and cotymba helped guide foreign vessels safely to the harbor. These <b>ships</b> were capable <b>of</b> relatively long coastal cruises, and several seals have depicted this type <b>of</b> <b>ship.</b> In each seal, parallel bands were suggested to represent the <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> In the center of the vessel is a single mast with a tripod base.|$|R

500|$|The Mayflower {{departed}} Plymouth, England on September 6, 1620 with 102 {{passengers and}} about 30 crew {{members in the}} small, 106 foot-long ship. [...] The seas were not severe during the first month in the Atlantic but, by the second month, the ship was being hit by strong north-Atlantic winter gales, causing it to be badly shaken with water leaks from structural damage. There were many obstacles throughout the trip, including multiple cases of seasickness and the bending and cracking <b>of</b> a main <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> One death occurred, that of William Button.|$|R
5000|$|The wreck now lies in 10 to 20 ft {{of water}} near the Fowey Rocks.The lower hull and irons <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> are still visible, encrusted with coral, {{and there are}} some remains of other parts of the ship.There are many fish, and with shallow water the {{location}} provides an excellent site for snorkeling or diving.However, the shallow waters near the reef may create strong surges that could damage a boat.The Arratoon Apcar is one of five historic wrecks in the Biscayne National Park [...] "Shipwreck Trail".|$|R
5000|$|Although Yakutat {{received}} a dispatch on 21 June 1945 {{to the effect}} that all [...] "organized resistance on Okinawa has ceased," [...] her routine remained busy. On 28 June 1945, for example, a Consolidated PB2Y Coronado flying boat crashed on take-off and sank approximately 500 yards (457 m) off the starboard <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> Yakutat dispatched two boats to the scene and rescued eight men, while boats from another ship rescued the remaining three survivors from the Coronado. All eleven men were brought on board Yakutat, where they were examined and returned to their squadron, Patrol Bomber Squadron 13 (VPB-13).|$|R
5000|$|During {{admiralty}} {{surveys of}} the north-west coast in 1840, crew from HMS Beagle discovered a brass gun of about three pounds calibre and an iron swivel on which paint was still adhered. Captain Stokes with Commander John Clements Wickham named the place Gun Island. [...] They also discovered several coins, including one dated about 1707 and another dated 1720. Also seen was {{what appeared to be}} the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship</b> with an iron bolt through it, and glass bottles and clay pipes. The material was presumed to have been left there by the Zeewyk castaways, 112 years earlier.|$|R
60|$|The {{glimmer of}} the lantern, as a trap opened, shone in like the heaven's sunlight: {{and though it}} only showed me the strong, dark <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> that was my prison I could have cried aloud for gladness. The man with the green eyes {{was the first to}} descend the ladder, and I noticed that he came {{somewhat}} unsteadily. He was followed by the captain. Neither said a word; but the first set to and examined me, and dressed my wound as before, while Hoseason looked me in my face with an odd, black look.|$|R
5000|$|Work {{to refine}} the hull shape was {{conducted}} in the Admiralty experimental tank at Haslar, Gosport. As a result <b>of</b> experiments, the <b>beam</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> was increased by 10 ft over that initially intended to improve stability. The hull immediately {{in front of the}} rudder and the balanced rudder itself followed naval design practice to improve the vessel's turning response. The Admiralty contract required that all machinery be below the waterline, where it was considered to be better protected from gunfire, and the aft third <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> below water was used to house the turbines, the steering motors and four [...] steam driven turbo-generators. The central half contained four boiler rooms, with the remaining space at the forward end <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> being reserved for cargo and other storage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} main harbour at Longis Bay {{was built}} in 1736 by Henry Le Mesurier, Governor of Alderney, at his own cost. The old harbour was not safe even for <b>ships</b> <b>of</b> 40 to 60 tons capacity, as the current entering the bay during storms endangered the <b>beams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> that supported the deck. In 1807, twenty ships moored at this harbour were lost or damaged and the stone protection works were swept away by the sea. Building a new harbour became inescapable, as {{it was felt that}} the bay would provide a [...] "safe and capacious harbour" [...] for use by on line ships. Trade and commerce first developed with building of a jetty at Braye Harbour.|$|R
50|$|The {{length overall}} <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> is 110 ft, length on deck 82 ft, and length at the {{waterline}} 72 ft. The <b>beam</b> width <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> is 24.6 ft. The mast height is 80 ft carrying approximately 4500 sq ft of sail. Her hull is constructed of a steel frame {{with a thick}} fiber glass overlay. She draws 5.5 ft, or 12 ft with the centreboard down, which allows her access to shallow docks.|$|R
5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead {{of one or two}} large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or <b>beam,</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing from side to side could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach <b>of</b> dividing the <b>ship's</b> storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|R

The ships' hulls were constructed from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, over which the steel hull plates were riveted. The vessels contained fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull.|$|R
