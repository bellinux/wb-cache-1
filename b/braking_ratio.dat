40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and emergency brake valve portions into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty <b>braking</b> <b>ratio.</b> If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage. Wheel changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing.

The electro-mechanic brake system has different working principles then hydraulic brake system. Hydraulic force or air pressure is used to obtain the braking force on the wheels in the hydraulic braking systems, whereas a solenoid valve push force is used to stop the car in electro-mechanic systems. A censor controlled the RPM of the wheel and the data was passed to a micro controller and micro controller produced PWM signals according to obtained signal. Thus, push force of the solenoid valve was controlled by micro controlled according to the <b>braking</b> <b>ratio.</b> If the wheel slows down the turning speed, then micro controller stops to sending PWM signals and solenoid is relaxed until wheels turns again.

40|$|In the past, brake {{testing of}} rubber-tyred {{vehicles}} operating in quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a brake testing method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable brake performance testing regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a <b>brake</b> <b>ratio</b> to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or fail criteria, organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ brake test result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some brake testing regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding brake testing of rubber-tyred vehicles, this guide explains the <b>brake</b> <b>ratio</b> method of <b>brake</b> testing. A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable brake test regime is preceded by several discussion chapters.

40|$|In HEV and EV, higher {{fuel economy}} is {{achieved}} by operating the ICE and electric motor in the most efficient region and by using regenerative braking. Such a braking system converts, transfers, stores and reuses kinetic energy which would otherwise be dissipated as heat through friction brakes to the environment. This research investigates the control of braking for a mixed-mode braking system in a these vehicles based on the proportion of braking energy that can be stored. Achieving mixed-mode braking requires the ‘blending’ of the two systems (regenerative and friction), and in brake blending, the electric motor/generator (M/G) and the hydraulic actuation pressure are controlled together to meet the driver’s braking demand. The research presented here has established a new robust dynamic modelling procedure {{for the design of}} combined regenerative and hydraulic braking systems. Direct torque control and pressure control were selected as the control criteria in both brakes. Two simulation models have been developed in Matlab/Simulink to generate analysis the performance of the control strategy in the blended braking system. Integration of the regenerative braking system with ABS has also been completed, based on two conditions, with and without the deactivation of the regenerative braking. Verification of the models is presented, based on experimental work on two EVs manufactured by TATA Motors; the ACE light commercial vehicle and the VISTA small passenger car.

40|$|Current {{microprocessor}} controlled prostheses for transfemoral amputees {{consist of}} two main functional components: a knee joint and an ankle-foot joint. These normally function as isolated joints without any feedback {{about the state}} of the other joint. In this research an approach investigating the system integration of the whole transfemoral limb has been undertaken. An integrated limb system was built based on two already existing but ‘stand-alone’ prosthetic joints by creating an appropriate control system and communication architecture. Two additional functionalities that require inter-joint communication were implemented: standing mode and ramp descent mode to support those challenging situations for transfemoral amputees. The development and biomechanical assessment of the ramp descent mode were undertaken to establish if integrated inter-joint control has the potential to change gait characteristics compared to non-integrated isolated single-joint control. Four different conditions (no braking, braking of foot, braking of knee and braking of the whole limb) were assessed trying to replicate non-integrated and integrated control in a systematic manner. The biomechanical assessment from the two amputee studies conducted revealed that braking of the whole limb showed the largest differences compared to the different conditions with some reaching statistical significance however the findings of the gait studies were inconsistent. There were some indications of increase of <b>braking</b> <b>ratio,</b> reduction in propulsive impulse and decrease of self-selected speed however not all results could be replicated. Overall this could indicate a more controlled ramp descent. Overall the research showed the potential of integrated coordinated transfemoral limb control and its benefits in one particular gait situation. For future work it is proposed to refine the ramp descent mode and focus on additional functionalities such as ramp ascent using the integrated approach. Integrating the socket and residual stump control into the integrated control system might provide a completely new approach of intuitive control...|$|E
40|$|The {{sustainable}} development of vehicle propulsion {{systems that have}} mainly focused on reduction of fuel consumption (i. e. CO 2 emission) has led, {{not only to the}} development of systems connected with combustion processes but also to legislation and testing procedures. In recent years, the low carbon policy has made hybrid vehicles and fully electric vehicles (H/EVs) popular. The main virtue of these propulsion systems is their ability to restore some of the expended energy from kinetic movement, e. g. the braking process. Consequently new research and testing methods for H/EVs are currently being developed. This especially concerns the critical ‘use-cases’ for functionality tests within dynamic events for both virtual simulations, as well as real-time road tests. The use-case for conventional vehicles for numerical simulations and road tests are well established. However, the wide variety of tests and their great number (close to a thousand) creates a need for selection, in the first place, and the creation of critical use-cases suitable for testing H/EVs in both virtual and real-world environments. It is known that a marginal improvement in the regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>ratio</b> can significantly improve the vehicle range and, therefore, the economic cost of its operation. In modern vehicles, vehicle dynamics control systems play the principal role in safety, comfort and economic operation. Unfortunately, however, the existing standard road test scenarios are insufficient for H/EVs. Sector knowledge suggests that there are currently no agreed tests scenarios to fully investigate the effects of brake blending between conventional and regenerative braking as well as the regenerative braking interaction with active driving safety systems (ADSS). The paper presents seven manoeuvres, which are considered to be suitable and highly informative for the development and examination of H/EVs with regenerative braking capability. The critical manoeuvres presented are considered to be appropriate for examination of the regenerative braking mode according to ADSS. The manoeuvres are also important for investigation of regenerative braking system properties/functionalities that are specified by the legal requirements concerning H/EVs braking systems. The last part of this paper shows simulation results for one of the proposed manoeuvres that explicitly shows the usefulness of the manoeuvre...|$|E
