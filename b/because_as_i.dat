I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{widespread}} rumors, Usher stated, [...] "People assume things, <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, I pull from {{my personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music." [...] He added that he loved Chilli, however, [...] "...it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash..." [...] Although [...] "Burn" [...] is a reference to his dying relationship with Chilli—hence the title—Usher answered the press that the impregnating issue was not taken from a specific situation in his life. He also revealed that his friends who went through similar situations inspired him to write those songs: [...] "...it's just something that I collectively got energy from everybody around me that had been through it." [...] In early 2006, Dupri revealed that {{the story behind the}} album is his: [...] "...me cheating on my steady girlfriend, having a baby with that other woman and having to confess to everything that happened to my main girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|Antonioni {{wrote that}} the film was [...] "expressed through images in which I hope to show not the birth of an {{erroneous}} sentiment, but rather {{the way in which}} we go astray in our sentiments. <b>Because</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have said, our moral values are old. Our myths and conventions are old. And everyone knows that they are indeed old and outmoded. Yet we respect them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Grey {{began by}} expressing {{surprise}} at seeing Captain Scarborough in town. [...] "Oh yes, I have come up. It {{does not matter}} why, <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> usual, <b>I</b> have put my foot in it. It was at my father's bidding; {{but that does not}} matter." ...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with TheWrap, Freeman {{was asked if}} he considered himself atheist or agnostic. [...] He replied, [...] "It's a hard question <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said at the start, I think we invented God. So if I believe in God, and I do, it's because I think I'm God." [...] Freeman later said that his experience working on The Story of God with Morgan Freeman did not change his views on religion.|$|E
2500|$|Savage {{stated in}} a column that he favors outing in some cases, {{specifically}} mentioning anti-gay activist Tyler Whitney. However, in the same column he noted that [...] "I recently talked someone out of outing a public figure. A Savage Love reader was contemplating outing an innocuous celebrity back in April. I advised him against it <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> wrote to him privately, outing is brutal {{and it should be}} reserved for brutes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georgian state {{minister}} for reintegration told the BBC that, {{although most of}} the facts in the report were accurate, he disagreed with some parts of it. [...] "I disagree with the notion that Georgia used excessive force in the attack on Tskhinvali <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> mentioned, there are ample evidences of Russian deployment and these were not just peacekeepers, so one can hardly judge what is proportionate," [...] said Temur Iakobashvili. [...] "One can hardly judge what is proportionate or disproportionate in this case." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2015, radio {{broadcaster}} Alan Jones {{commented on}} the push to legalise same-sex marriage saying, [...] "my view is that when people find love, {{they should be able}} to celebrate it. And they shouldn't be discriminated against according to the nature of that love. To deny people the recognition for a relationship which is based on love is to deny, in my opinion, one of humankind's most basic, but as I said elusive, qualities. Let the Parliament vote. It makes the laws of the land... we shouldn't be frightened about celebrating the love of one person for another." [...] Prime Minister Abbott said [...] "I deeply respect his views and I’m confident that he would respect mine, he would respect my sister’s, he would respect Bill Shorten’s and Tanya Plibersek’s and Warren Entsch’s, and that’s what we need – we need to see mutual respect of all the different views on this debate <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, decent people can differ on this subject." ...|$|E

At this time, Callery said he started [...] "fooling around" [...] with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a [...] "sneaky and fun" [...] quality, adding, Jessica Jones [...] "has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something." [...] After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a [...] "fun" [...] rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got [...] "bigger there <b>because</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, Sean Callery {{revealed}} he was composing {{the music}} for the series.

60|$|I scolded heartily at Amy {{for letting}} the girl ever know her, {{that is to}} say, know her in this affair; for that she knew her could not be hid, <b>because</b> she, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> might say, served Amy, or rather under Amy, in my family, as is said before; but she (Amy) talked with her at first by another person, and not by herself; and that secret came out by an accident, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have said above.|$|R

60|$|But I {{move the}} creditor, {{on account of}} his own interest, always to take the first offer, if he sees no palpable fraud in it, or sees no reason to suspect such fraud; and my reason is good, namely, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> believe, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said before, it is {{generally}} the best.|$|R

6000|$|When Dr. Inge {{was called}} [...] "the Gloomy Dean" [...] a great {{injustice}} was done him. He had appeared as {{the champion of}} our capitalist community {{against the forces of}} revolt; and any one who does that exceeds in optimism rather than pessimism. A man who really thinks that strikers have suffered no wrong, or that employers have done no wrong&mdash;such a man is not a Gloomy Dean, but a quite wildly and dangerously happy Dean. A man who can feel satisfied with modern industrialism must be a man with a mysterious fountain of high spirits. And the actual occasion is not less curious; <b>because,</b> <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can make out, his title to gloom reposes on his having said that our worker's demand high wages, while the placid people of the Far East will quite cheerfully work for less.|$|R
