40|$|Laboratory in 1980. His {{experience}} spans component {{and system}} design and plant analysis {{for training and}} operating power plants. Beginning in 2004 he developed the transient model for the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) Brayton power plant. Since 2007 {{he has been working}} on supercritical CO 2 Brayton power systems. For the last two years he has been an advanced plant projects advisor as well as a supercritical CO 2 contributor. The efficiency of the Supercritical CO 2 (S-CO 2) Brayton cycle is increased by adding a second compressor (or recompressor) to the simple cycle. The additional compressor works on fluid before heat is removed by the precooler. Although the two parallel compressors have quite different inlet conditions, they must operate at nearly the same pressure ratio to avoid impacting the performance of the other compressor. A relatively small difference in pressure ratio can surge one of the compressors and shutdown the system. While maintaining adequate surge margin is required for any Brayton loop design, the recompression cycle adds the new challenge of <b>balancing</b> <b>main</b> compressor and recompressor performance. New control methods must address starting both compressors and maneuvering the Brayton loop through system heatup, power output changes and plant transients. This paper presents the transient modeling analysis of the design and control features needed to safely operate the "recompression cycle". For this study a full plant TRACE model provided an ideal platform to develop and verify recompression loop control features. Results indicate that isolation valves and recirculation flow paths are needed for independent main compressor and recompressor startup. Once both compressors are operating, isolation valves are opened and the recompressor speed is controlled to maintain an optimum pressure ratio balance with the measured performance of the main compressor...|$|E
