40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified. The paper concludes by discussing the implications <b>of</b> restricted <b>quota</b> trade, especially in the context <b>of</b> eventual <b>quota</b> removal...|$|R

The use <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> in the production process leads to their destruction and also leads to reduce the stock of resource; the non-use <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> allows their owner to resell them in the second time period on the financial market. We show that the resource management with a market <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> is possible only for some initial resource level.

Some evidence from Canadian quota programmes is presented to illustrate the economic effects <b>of</b> restrictive <b>quota</b> transfer policies. An econometric analysis of economic factors affecting the supply of and demand for transferable output quotas is presented. The results of a single-equation model of the derived demand for quotas are compared to the results of a simultaneous equation model of demand and supply for <b>quotas.</b> Econometric analysis <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> price and transaction data provides useful insights into the behavioor of the marlcet for quotas...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{more than}} 100 {{countries}} have implemented some type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> {{for women in}} their national legislatures, leading {{to one of the}} most significant developments in the global composition of legislative bodies in the past twenty-five years. One remaining puzzle in understanding the global diffusion <b>of</b> electoral gender <b>quotas</b> is the strong clustering <b>of</b> shared domestic <b>quota</b> policies by region. In this project, I examine the importance of dyadic relationships between countries, including shared membership in inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), regional organizations (ROs), and women’s international non-governmental organizations(WINGOs) in explaining the timing and type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> adoption. To do this, I employ a social network approach to quantitatively model global and temporal trends in gender quota adoption. Controlling for other possible domestic and transnational determinants, my results indicate that the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> policy adoption and design is the existence of similar policies in neighboring countries. These results suggest that, in the case <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> adoption, domestic policymakers see surrounding states as their most salient reference group when deciding both whether and how to implement new policy...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Kyoto Protocol, future {{commitments}} are likely to be framed in terms <b>of</b> tradable <b>quotas.</b> The discussions on the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> among countries will be based - at least partly - on rules corresponding to a certain conception of equity. For instance, allocating quotas in direct proportion to population, in relation to GDP or according to past emissions has been advocated. Taking a long term perspective, we compute such allocations <b>of</b> tradable <b>quotas</b> with a dynamic (closed-loop) model. The total amount <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> to be distributed at each period corresponds to the world optimal amount of emissions to be realized at each period. We observe that most "equitable" allocation rules do not make the agreement individually rational for every country along the entire time path. We then propose a mechanism which determines allocations <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> that are {{as close as possible to}} any "equitable" allocation while satisfying individual rationality...|$|R
