40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, we analyze the Inter-territorial Compensation Fund (ICF) as a {{regional}} policy instrument contemplated in the 1978 Spanish Constitution. Attention is focused on the period 1990 - 2013. Both the drivers of the ICF and its impact on regional public investment are analyzed. Second, a reform proposal is discussed, involving changes in ICF total amount in order to compensate the decline of the flow of European funds to Spain. The criteria to become a <b>beneficiary</b> <b>region</b> and the distribution of grants are also discussed. Finally, we stress the need to improve planning, efficiency, and transparency in using ICF resources. ...|$|E

While {{in the past the}} interest of equalization policy was focussed primarily on the regions which benefit from interregional equalization policy (<b>beneficiary</b> <b>regions)</b> and the effects obtained there, recently the view is directed also toward the regions which bear the fiscal burden of the equalisation policy (donor regions). Concerning the donor regions, a fear of growth-absorbing withdrawal effects exists, which gives reason in view of declining economic growth rates on the national level to think about the future of interregional equalization policy. The IWH contributed to this debate together with two project partners by an investigation, which was accomplished on behalf of the Federal Office for Building and Regional Planning. The following findings will show the economic performance of the donor regions (exclusively West German regions) and of the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>regions</b> (all East German regions and a few West German regions) and their changing economic growth patterns. Concerning the level of economic performance, measured by means {{of the gross domestic product}} (GDP) per capita, as expected, the donor regions, consisting of West German regions, in the period 1992 - 2003 altogether show an above average GDP per capita. In contrast, the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>regions,</b> both the East German and (less strongly) the West German show a GDP per capita below average. Concerning the development of the economic performance, which was measured on the basis of the relative GDP per capita (GDP per capita of the region concerned in relation to the national average), the East German <b>beneficiary</b> <b>regions</b> could catch up in the first period (1992 - 1998) strongly. This catching up process, however, clearly slowed down in the second period 1998 - 2003. Like a mirror-image the lead of the donor regions regarding GDP per capita in relation to the national average became smaller. But after 1998 many West German donor regions regained their growth dynamics. Additionally the contributions of the regions to the absolute increase of the GDP in the period 1998 - 2003 were investigated: 30 of 271 regions have a share of around 50 % in the overall GDP increase, 28 of them located in West Germany, and 21 of them donor regions. This in mind, the policy should further provide and secure favourable development conditions for those regions, which contribute at most to the increase of the overall economic performance and thus create the economic base for the interregional equalization policy. ...|$|R

Our core results suggest an elevated role for two key policy-design factors in maximising the achievements of Cohesion Policy: planning consistency (confluence between planned and realised expenditures), and alignment between regional needs and programme objectives. Although derived from a ‘selected’ sample, we claim that the obtained results may generalise well beyond the 15 regions studied here...|$|R

40|$|Article {{determine}} {{the essence of}} the definition of "region", defined types of regions. In general, we can distinguish four types of regions, formed to implement the tasks under different direction: a) homogeneous regions (formed on the basis of common characteristics – mountain region, economically developed / underdeveloped region and so on.). b) functional regions (formed by determining the basic type of economic activity – touristic region, agricultural region, etc.). c) administrative regions (formed by pre-defined criteria for performing administrative functions in a particular area – district, local council, etc.). d) personal perception regions (based on personal values – Homeland and so on.). The focus of this publication focuses on the study of rural regions. As a result of studies is found that the population of Ukraine decreased by about 7 million Inhabitants. In 1993 there was 52. 2 million of people, and in 2016 dropped to 42. 7 million (temporary occupied territories excluded). Determined that the most influential factors are the degradation of rural region’s economic and demographic crisis (can be both a cause and consequence of each other). In this regard, the worsening of demographic situation is the biggest problem, because without human resources economic growth can’t be achieved. For more profound understanding of the problem we used the spiral of negative developed of communities/regions proposed by Austrian scientists G. Weber and T. Fisher. It indicates the relationship between adverse events and their sequence. This choice is not accidental, because the spiral indicates that this is a progressive movement that eventually accelerated and the difficulty of stopping the negative processes increases not arithmetically but geometrically. Therefore, developing regional programs of rural development moderators (selected and trained specialists who work in the region) cooperate with the heads of communities and local residents. Thus, they try to form a regional identity, create the region’s brand, develop a regional strategy, promote regional products both within the region and outside, try to make the region attractive for tourist. It is determined that monopolized agricultural production is a significant constraint for the development of rural areas in Ukraine. It is difficult to rely {{on the development of the}} community in which most of agricultural lands are used by huge agricultural holdings, which displace locals from the region. Moreover, the government policy in the agricultural sector contributes fully to them and that is disastrous for the state in the long term. For comparison, the average area of agricultural enterprise in Austria is approximately 43 hectares and added value in the region is much higher than in Ukraine. For more effective rural development it is proposed to develop a long-term national development strategy for depressive territories, because preservation of the existing state monopolization strategy will provoke even greater demographic crisis. It is as well necessary to eliminate the corruption risks that are present in all programs financed by public funds. In this regard, it is important that those who make decisions about the allocation of funds were not linked with the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>regions</b> and specific applicants...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the spatial-temporal {{variability}} in ecosystem services (ES) demand can help anticipate externalities {{of land use}} change. This study presents new operational approaches to quantify and map demand for three non-commodity ES on a global scale: animal pollination, wild medicinal plants and outdoor recreation. We show how the demand for these ES differs between <b>beneficiaries</b> and world <b>regions.</b> While the demand for animal pollination is accounted for via the consumption preferences for pollinator-dependent crop products, the demand for wild medicinal plants is quantified by the direct reliance on wild medicinal plants for basic healthcare needs. The demand for outdoor recreation {{is represented by the}} possibility and interest to participate in related activities. For animal pollination and outdoor recreation, demand is highest in industrial countries; demand for wild medicinal plants is highest in least developed countries, given their direct reliance on this ES for healthcare. Spatial demand-supply mismatches can cause trade-offs between ES in distant provisioning areas and can lead to unintended impacts on human well-being. The study reveals that quantifying and mapping spatial patterns of ES demand on a global scale requires clear conceptualization and operationalization of specific ES to select the most appropriate methods and arrive at meaningful results...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{assess the}} impact of the Bolsa Família Program on the energy and {{nutrient}} intakes of beneficiaries from the Brazilian Northeast and Southeast regions. Methods: The study used data from the 2008 - 2009 Pesquisa de Orçamento Famíliar, which assessed individual food intake on two nonconsecutive days of individuals aged more than 10 years. Based the personal information booklet, food intake values were transformed into nutritional values (energy and nutrients). Analysis of the impact measure was preceded by propensity score matching, a technique that matches some socioeconomic characteristics of beneficiaries and nonbeneficiaries. Once the score was calculated, the impact of the Bolsa Família Program was estimated by nearest neighbor matching. Results: The program increased energy and macronutrient intakes and decreased calcium and vitamin A, D, E, and C intakes of adolescent <b>beneficiaries</b> in both <b>regions.</b> Adult <b>beneficiaries</b> from the Southeast region increased their fiber, iron, and selenium intakes, and those from the Northeast region decreased their energy, lipid, added sugar, sodium, zinc, vitamin E, and pyridoxine intakes. Conclusion: The results show a positive impact of the program on the energy and macronutrient intakes, and a negative impact on the intakes of most study micronutrients, especially in adolescents, which reinforce the importance of implementing intersectoral actions to improve the nutritional quality of the Bolsa Família Program beneficiaries' diet...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{provide the}} first {{comparable}} national prevalence estimates {{on use of}} propoxyphene, a potentially inappropriate drug, by elderly Medicare beneficiaries living {{in the community and}} institutions and to determine whether institutionalized beneficiaries are at a greater risk for receiving propoxyphene than community-dwelling beneficiaries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: U. S. representative sample of elderly using Medicare database. PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative sample of community-dwelling (n = 9, 851, weighted n = 32. 5 million) and institutionalized (n = 1, 099, weighted n = 2. 3 million) Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older. MEASUREMENTS: National estimates on prevalence of propoxyphene use and the odds of receiving propoxyphene were the two main outcome measures. RESULTS: Annual prevalence of propoxyphene use in 1998 was 6. 8 % by all community-dwelling elderly beneficiaries and 15. 5 % by institutionalized elderly beneficiaries. Beneficiaries in long-term care facilities had almost 40 % higher odds of receiving propoxyphene (odds ratio = 1. 38, 95 % confidence interval = 1. 1 - 1. 8) than beneficiaries in the community even after controlling for other factors in a logistic regression. Other risk factors include female, rural residence, poor health, and history of osteoporosis or hip fracture. <b>Beneficiaries</b> residing in <b>regions</b> in the midwest and south were {{more than twice as likely}} to receive propoxyphene as those in the mid-Atlantic area. CONCLUSION: These results show that propoxyphene use by U. S. community-dwelling seniors is high but is much higher in the institutionalized population. These findings suggest that prescribing for older adults with pain could be improved, especially for vulnerable long-term care residents...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposition}} that regional devolution {{in and of}} itself will lead to economic success has become deeply embedded in beliefs and policy discourses about the determinants of regional prosperity, and in turn has led to political demands for such devolution. In this paper I seek critically to examine such claims, using the case of the north-east of England as the setting for this examination. The paper begins with some introductory comments on concepts of power, regions, the reorganization of the state and of multi-level governance, and governmentality, which help in understanding the issues surrounding regional devolution. I then examine the ways in which north-east England was politically and socially constructed as a particular type of region, with specific problems, in the 1930 s — a move that has had lasting significance up until the present day. Moving on some six decades, I then examine contemporary claims about the relationship between regional devolution and regional economic success, which find fertile ground in the north-east precisely due to its long history of representation as a region with a unified regional interest. I then reflect on the processes of regional planning, regional strategies and regional devolution, and their relationship to regional economic regeneration. A brief conclusion follows, emphasizing that questions remain about the efficacy of the new governmentality and about who would be its main <b>beneficiaries</b> in the <b>region.</b> The extent to which devolution would actually involve transferring power to the region and the capacity of networked forms of power within the region to counter the structural power of capital and shape central state policies remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses a large natural field {{experiment}} {{to identify the}} effects of formal savings on interhousehold transfers in villages, and the spillover impacts of service-expansion on de facto ineligibles residing in the same community. Despite widespread interest in microfinance, spillover effects on the very poor of expanding formal financial services remain largely unexplored. This study helps fill this gap by examining evidence from an experiment which uses an information intervention that mimics naturally-occurring institutions to increase formal service adoption. It also contributes to an emerging literature on the indirect impacts of policy interventions in developing countries, often evaluated {{solely on the basis}} of how they impact direct participants and <b>beneficiaries.</b> In developing <b>regions,</b> households vulnerable to extreme poverty often rely on local safety nets based on transfers from relatives and friends, which help them smooth consumption across food-deficits and household shocks. To date, little is known about how these pre-existing practices are affected as community members begin adopting newly available formal financial services. Using a panel dataset of over 2, 000 households collected during a rapid expansion of formal savings services in Central Malawi, this paper shows that experimentally boosting use of formal savings in rural areas sharply increases inter-household transfers during peak periods of hunger. The impact on transfer receipts is strongest among the poorest households, a de facto financial services-ineligible group, among whom the effects are also linked to significant changes in welfare. The strong impacts of formal savings expansion on non service-users suggests that formal finance can have much greater immediate-term effects than would be suggested by focusing exclusively on impacts experienced by service-users. The findings also highlight the sensitivity of traditional safety nets and welfare outcomes among the highly vulnerable in villages to expansion of formal financial markets. microfinance, formal savings, indirect effects, safety nets, poverty, food security...|$|R
40|$|In {{a region}} in the {{northern}} part of Iceland, Skagafjörður, a local organization is preparing to harness the flow of the river Jökulsá to produce electricity. But the hydroelectric power project, Villinganesvirkjun, will put an end to the rafting tours offered, as part of the tourist attraction, down the river canyons. In the recent years, Skagafjörður has had some economic problems that resulted in migration out from the area. This is a great general concern of the local government and projects have been established in order to resist this development. One of them was to analyze the possibilities of establishing power intensive industries in Skagafjörður. It was from there that the idea of a hydro electric power plant emerged. If the power plant will be built it means that the rafting tourism in the rivers will come to an end. The rafting tourism has grown rapidly or up to 29 % a year. The purpose of this project is to highlight the economic consequences of the two mutually exclusive alternatives: Villinganesvirkjun, hydroelectric power plant and rafting tourism in the Skagafjörður region. Our research and calculations have implied that river rafting tourism is a more preferable alternative for the Skagafjörður region and is that conclusion based on the man power needed for the operation, the marginal effect and the financial value of the rafting tourism which all were more <b>beneficiary</b> for the <b>region</b> than the Villinganesvirkjun project. However, it is important for readers to understand that the financial calculations are based on criteria that might change and the results can’t give a final conclusion of the different economic consequences of the two alternatives. It is though possible to view the results as indicators. The fact that there are enough unused power resources in the region and Iceland as whole, but at the same time there are no rivers that provide the same rafting quality as Jökulsá, is a factor that we thought should be kept in mind...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine labour market seasonality in Canada over the past three decades in order to shed light on what policies might be best suited to address seasonal economies. The main findings are as follows. The seasonality of the Canadian economy has declined since 1976 according to a wide range of output and labour market variables. However, since 1996 unemployment rate seasonality has increased. Seasonality ?both in employment and the unemployment rate ?is much higher for the young than for older workers and much higher for men than for women. Canada’s level of employment seasonality was more than three times higher than that in the United States in 2003. However, unemployment rate seasonality was perhaps surprisingly the same in the two countries. Relative to OECD countries, Canada has average unemployment rate seasonality, but very high employment seasonality. Atlantic Canada has higher levels of employment and unemployment rate seasonality than the other provinces reflecting a greater importance of primary industries and greater propensity of employers to hire part-year workers. Seasonal unemployment represents a much more important public policy issue than seasonal employment. The basic problem is an underlying lack of employment opportunities in rural and remote areas where seasonal unemployment is concentrated, not seasonal unemployment itself. An economic development strategy that ensures that all persons who want full year work can obtain it must be the most important element in any attempt to reduce seasonal unemployment. But such a strategy might need to be supplemented, at least in the short-to-medium term, by out-migration, particularly in very high unemployment regions, and incentives for firms to transform seasonal work into full-year work, or at least into near full-year work. Since unrestricted benefits for seasonal EI repeaters will not reduce seasonal unemployment, a strong case can be made that long-term income support for the seasonally unemployed is not in the long-run in the best interest of the <b>beneficiaries,</b> high unemployment <b>regions,</b> and the country, although reducing such benefits is politically difficult. seasonality, seasonal employment, seasonal unemployment, unemployment, Atlantic Canada, Canada...|$|R

Inter-state and intrastate sub-transmission system and the distribution system within NER states shall be developed by Power Grid Corporation as the Central Transmission Utility (CTU)The Transmission Project was initially envisaged to be domiciled in a separate SPV, North-East Power Transmission Company Limited ("NEPTC") and developed through a BOOT operator. However given the criticality of timely completion of the Transmission System to the operations of the Generation Plant, a decision was taken to develop the transmission system as a component of the composite Project within OTPC. Subsequently, the process of merging NEPTC with OTPC was initiated; The petition for amalgamation of NEPTC with OTPC was approved by the Hon'ble Guwahati High Court in Sept 2007.Subsequently, in late 2007, in consultation with the Ministry of Power (MoP), it was decided that the integrated project be developed as a regional project. The power allocation from the project was revised and about 640 MW was allocated to the NER beneficiary states and the balance 100 MW was to be retained by OTPC for merchant/short-term sale (based on assumed capacity of 740 MW). Pursuant to this development, the Transmission project was again carved out for development through a separate SPV. Accordingly, the Transmission JV was again incorporate as “North East Transmission Company Ltd”(NETC). The transmission project is progressing smoothly with the process of award of transmission tower construction packages for completion in tandem with the commissioning of the Generation Project.|$|R
