25|$|The {{only way}} California can support its {{extensive}} population and agriculture is to store water in numerous reservoirs and use pipes, tunnels, pumps and canals to distribute {{it where it}} is needed when it is needed. Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> store and move water where it is needed. California water comes primarily from snowfall in the Sierra Nevada {{in the northern part}} of the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended droughts that can last several years. During an average rainfall year, about 14% of the power used in California is generated by hydroelectricity.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tropically-adapted Brahman stock revolutionized the beef cattle industry in northern Australia. It transformed struggling enterprises into efficient and profitable ones and contributed <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> domestic and export income. In 2000 a Meat and Livestock Australia project assessed the {{contribution to the}} Australian economy by Brahman genetics. Analysis of the economic return on investment for the Australian beef industry from 1970 to 2000 found that Brahman and Bos indicus infusion delivered an additional individual on-farm benefit of $9170 per annum. About 40,000 Australian cattle producers gained from this additional profit {{in each of those}} 30 years. Brahman and Brahman-infused cattle accounted for 90 per cent of the genetic improvement in the Australian industry. The cumulative on-farm return since 1970 from investment in Bos indicus genetics amounted to $10.2 billion of a total on-farm return to the national beef industry from all forms of technology of $11 billion. In 2013 ABBA comprises over 1200 members and is the largest beef cattle breed association, by membership, in Australia. Currently, a little over 50% of the Australian beef cattle herd has Brahman blood, while about 11 per cent of the herd is pure-bred. There are about 110,000 Brahman bulls above the Tropic of Capricorn, that is, about 70% of bulls in that region.|$|E
