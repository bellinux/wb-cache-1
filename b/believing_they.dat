5|$|The Phengaris rebeli is a brood parasite, an {{organism}} that manipulates another organism (the host) {{to raise its}} offspring; in this case, the P. rebeli parasitizes a particular species of ant, the Myrmica schencki. The P. rebeli was first discovered to be a brood parasite when a researcher observed M. schencki ants bringing the P. rebeli larvae back to their own nest. One of the proposed hypotheses for this parasitism was that P. rebeli larvae released chemicals to confuse the ants into <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> were ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari's {{vice-president}} of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell Home Pong, but were rejected. Retailers felt {{the product was}} too expensive and would not interest consumers. Atari contacted the Sears Sporting Goods department after noticing a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff discussed {{the game with a}} representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. <b>Believing</b> <b>they</b> could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari's executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a Home Pong booth at a toy trade fair in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders {{due to the fact that}} they did not know that they needed a private showing.|$|E
5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and they continue to flee.|$|E

Jenna and Tracy are plagued by erotic dreams involving Kenneth, and to stop having them, they decide to stay awake.

Witnessing this, Pete tells them they are wide awake, and that it is morning, which prompts Jenna and Tracy to realize that they slept through the night without having any dreams of Kenneth. They apologize to Kenneth for attacking him, and he accepts their apology.|$|E

However, as Sora ascends the castle, he meets Naminé and learns the truth from her. Sora still wishes to protect Naminé and stop the Organization members in the castle. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps the three restore their memories to their state prior to entering Castle Oblivion, {{at the cost of}} their memories of the events in the castle. This requires them to sleep in the castle for the restoration of memories to be completed.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Bernd Eichinger of Constantin Film {{acquired}} the film {{rights of the}} Fantastic Four from Marvel Comics. In 1992, Eichinger hired Roger Corman to produce a low-budget film {{in order to keep}} the rights. In 1994, the adaptation, titled The Fantastic Four, had its trailer released to theaters, and its cast and director went on a promotional tour, however the film was not officially released. The film was accused of being an ashcan copy, meaning it was only made to keep the license. Stan Lee and Eichinger stated that the actors had no idea of the situation, instead <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> were creating a proper release. Marvel Comics paid in exchange for the film's negative, so 20th Century Fox could go ahead with the big-budget adaptation. While the film was never released to theaters and home-video, it was released by bootleg video distributors.|$|E

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police of The Wire are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone and the leftists became {{embroiled in}} {{factional}} in-fighting within Labour, vying for powerful positions with centrist members. Although never adopting Marxism, Livingstone {{became involved with}} a number of Trotskyist groups active within Labour; viewing them as potential allies, he became friends with Chris Knight, Graham Bash and Keith Veness, members of the Socialist Charter, a Trotskyist cell affiliated with the Revolutionary Communist League that had infiltrated the Labour party. In his struggle against Labour centrists, Livingstone was influenced by Trotskyist Ted Knight, who convinced him to oppose the use of British troops in Northern Ireland, <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> would simply be used to quash nationalist protests against British rule. Livingstone stood as the leftist candidate for the Chair of the Lambeth Housing Committee in April 1973, but was defeated by David Stimpson, who undid many of Livingston and Carr's reforms.|$|E
5|$|Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot {{coined the}} {{binomial}} Dromaiusater in 1817. In 1906, Walter Baldwin Spencer coined the name Dromaiusminor {{based on some}} Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island the same year, <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> were the first physical evidence of an emu from there. William Vincent Legge also coined a name for these remains, Dromaiusbassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D.ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaiusperoni, named after the French naturalist François Péron, who is {{the main source of}} information about the bird in life.|$|E

5|$|Officially {{having no}} role in the {{provisional}} government, Castro exercised a great deal of influence, largely because of his popularity and control of the rebel army. Ensuring the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy, he did not initially force through any radical proposals. Attempting to rid Cuba's government of Batistanos, the Congress elected under Batista was abolished, and all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 were banned from politics. The government now ruling by decree, Castro pushed the president to issue a temporary ban on all political parties, but repeatedly stated that they would get around to organizing multiparty elections; this never occurred. He began meeting members of the Popular Socialist Party, <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> had the intellectual capacity to form a socialist government, but repeatedly denied being a communist himself.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{between the}} members of The Legacy began {{building}} in 2010, when Orton attacked DiBiase and Rhodes for accidentally costing {{him a chance to}} win the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble pay-per-view. In February 2010, DiBiase defeated Mark Henry in an Elimination Chamber qualifying match, earning a chance to win the WWE Championship. At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, he eliminated Orton from the Elimination Chamber match, but was eliminated by Kofi Kingston soon after. On the February 22 episode of Raw, Orton turned on The Legacy, <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> had a plan to turn on him, and in retaliation, they attacked Orton the following week. As a result, the three competed in a triple threat match at WrestleMania XXVI in which Orton defeated Rhodes and DiBiase.|$|E

Morrissey is also incorrect in identifying some of the American units. He identifies William Gregg as having a separate command; Gregg apparently led several companies in Nichols' regiment. Morrissey also failed to include the Massachusetts militia, and misidentified Langdon's company, erroneously <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> may have been from Worcester, Massachusetts. (Militia companies from the Worcester area marched on Bennington, with some companies arriving the day after the battle.) Langdon originally raised his company in 1776, but it did not become a cavalry unit until 1778.|$|E

The Fund was to be dissolved, and gifts accepted since Nixon's nomination were to be accounted for as campaign contributions. Despite the reports, Eisenhower had second thoughts about relying on the success of the speech. He told an aide to call Governor Dewey, who was to call Nixon and instruct him to close his speech with his resignation from the ticket. <b>Believing</b> <b>they</b> had resolved the situation at last, Eisenhower and his staff had a relaxed dinner and began to prepare for his own speech that evening, before 15,000 Republican supporters in Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|Nick flees at high speed, {{setting off}} a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their {{reservations}} about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. <b>Believing</b> <b>they</b> have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint.

Following an airmobile assault into an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, A Company 6 RAR was subsequently surprised by a strong, well-sited and dug-in Viet Cong force, which, rather than withdrawing, had likely remained in location as part of an attempt to ambush any reaction force sent to the area. The Australians were soon contacted by heavy small arms fire, with a third of the lead platoon falling wounded in the initial volleys. A Company subsequently broke contact and withdrew under heavy fire from {{what appeared to be a}} Viet Cong base area. Initially <b>believing</b> <b>they</b> were opposed by only a company, 6 RAR subsequently launched a quick attack by two companies.
