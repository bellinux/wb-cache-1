5|$|Army Wing {{aircraft}} {{were assigned}} to carry out strategic reconnaissances, to report on Ottoman reserves well <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> lines, to carry out daily photography, and to conduct air raids. Fighter and bombing squadrons were established for these purposes while the Corps Squadrons were attached to the two infantry corps carried out artillery and contact patrols, along with tactical reconnaissance.|$|E
5|$|As a {{means of}} {{rallying}} supporters to get <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> cause, awareness campaigns against the takeover were launched. Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September. Football fans across the United Kingdom also lent support by lobbying their local MPs into passing a legislation, preventing further sport takeovers in the future.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, his men brought Hayes back <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> lines, and he {{was taken}} to hospital. The {{regiment}} continued on to Antietam, but Hayes was out of action {{for the rest of the}} campaign. In October, he was promoted to colonel and assigned to command of the first brigade of the Kanawha Division as a brevet brigadier general.|$|E

5|$|The {{sport is}} {{classified}} as a B1 event, meaning that it is for blind athletes, however vision-impaired athletes are also able to take part as all competitors wear eyeshades to ensure they are equally disadvantaged. Goalkeepers may be sighted {{as long as they}} have not been registered with FIFA since 2003. Each team may also have a guide <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> opponents' goal to direct players.|$|E
5|$|After the Lancastrians {{had ceased}} loosing their arrows, Fauconberg ordered his archers {{to step forward}} again to shoot. When they had {{exhausted}} their ammunition, the Yorkists plucked arrows off {{the ground in front}} of them—arrows loosed by their foes—and continued loosing. Coming under attack without any effective response of its own, the Lancastrian army moved from its position to engage the Yorkists in close combat. Seeing the advancing mass of men, the Yorkist archers shot a few more volleys before retreating <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> ranks of men-at-arms, leaving thousands of arrows in the ground to hinder the Lancastrian attack.|$|E
5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of one another in the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> reproductive capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the year}} 1602 in the Marvel Universe, for an unknown reason, superheroes have {{appeared}} about 400 years early. They {{were born and}} bred in this era and some hold important positions in high places.

5|$|On September 15, {{exhausted}} North Korean {{troops were}} caught unaware by the landings at Inchon, far <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> lines. Those forces that remained after 15 days of fighting {{were forced to}} retreat in a total rout or risk being completely cut off. Isolated North Korean resistance continued until September 18, but on that date UN troops were mounting a full-scale breakout offensive and pursuing retreating North Korean units to the north, ending the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Rebounding {{from their}} 2008 campaign, the 2009 Sounds {{achieved}} a 75–69 record under new manager Don Money. Despite {{a winning record}} and spending {{the majority of the}} season in first place, the Sounds finished the season two games <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> cross-state rivals, and eventual league champions, the Memphis Redbirds. The 2010 season proved to be reminiscent of the previous campaign. Though Nashville finished the year with a winning 77–67 record under Money, it was only good enough to place fourth (last) in the division.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent to the {{expansion}} draft, the Raptors landed the seventh pick in the NBA draft lottery, <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> fellow 1995 expansion club, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Thomas selected Damon Stoudamire, a point guard out of Arizona, around whom the franchise would seek to construct its near future. Yet, the selection of Stoudamire was met with boos from fans at the 1995 NBA draft at SkyDome in Toronto, many of whom wanted Ed O'Bannon of UCLA, an NCAA Final Four Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|The 2000 CECAFA Cup was the 24th {{edition of}} the {{football}} tournament, which involves teams from Southern and Central Africa. The matches were played in Uganda, a decision which Tanzania protested, but to no avail. Tanzania were also banned from international football by FIFA, the world football governing body. The matches were played from 18 November to 2 December 2000. Prior to the tournament, Djibouti withdrew due to monetary difficulties, but re-entered. Sudan and Zanzibar also withdrew, but stayed out. The reasoning <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> withdrawal was unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Bonfire Memorial Commission {{collected}} {{the hundreds of}} thousands of items that were left by grieving visitors at the site of the collapse. At the Systems Building, Texas A leaders erected pictures of the deceased students. There, over a dozen seniors left <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> Aggie rings, permanently donating them to the students who did not live long enough to earn their own. Various organizations also established funds in memory of the victims and to help with expenses incurred because of the accident. In total, the funds received exceeded US$250,000.|$|E

5|$|The French {{forces were}} now {{east of the}} Prussians, <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> lines. Theoretically the Prussians could have marched {{straight}} towards Paris unopposed, but this course was never seriously considered: the threat to their lines of supply and communication was too great to be ignored. The unfavorable situation was compounded by bad weather and an alarming increase in sickness among the troops. With few other options available, Brunswick turned back and prepared to do battle.|$|E
5|$|The Russians had a {{numerical}} advantage {{but soon the}} tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for {{about a quarter of}} a mile. The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} twelve playable characters {{originating from}} popular Nintendo franchises. Characters have a symbol appearing <b>behind</b> <b>their</b> damage meter {{corresponding to the}} series to which they belong, such as a Triforce behind Link's and a Poké Ball emblem behind Pikachu's. Furthermore, characters have recognizable moves derived from their original series, such as Samus's charged blasters and Link's arsenal of weapons. Eight characters are initially playable, and four additional characters can be unlocked by meeting specific criteria within the game.|$|E
