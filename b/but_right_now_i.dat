500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years <b>but</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|During his campaign, Biden {{focused on}} the war in Iraq and his support for the {{implementation}} of the Biden-Gelb plan to achieve political success. He touted his record in the Senate as the head of major congressional committees and his experience on foreign policy. Despite speculation to the contrary, Biden rejected the notion of accepting the position of Secretary of State, focusing only on the presidency. At a 2007 campaign event, Biden said, [...] "I know a lot of my opponents out there say I'd be a great Secretary of State. Seriously, every one of them. Do you watch any of the debates? 'Joe's right, Joe's right, Joe's right.'" [...] Other candidates' comments that [...] "Joe is right" [...] in the Democratic debates were converted into a Biden campaign theme and ad. In mid-2007, Biden stressed his foreign policy expertise compared to Obama's, saying of the latter, [...] "I think he can be ready, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't believe he is. The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training." [...] Biden also said that Obama was copying some of his foreign policy ideas. Biden was noted for his one-liners on the campaign trail, saying of Republican then-frontrunner Rudy Giuliani at the debate on October 30, 2007, in Philadelphia, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] Overall, Biden's debate performances were an effective mixture of humor, and sharp and surprisingly disciplined comments.|$|E

500|$|Woolfolk {{was named}} the Most Valuable Player in both of Michigan's two bowl game {{appearances}} in 1981. [...] During the January 1981 Rose Bowl, he gained 182 yards against Washington, and during the December 1981 Bluebonnet Bowl, in which he gained 186 yards against UCLA. The hotel where the Wolverines team was staying was evacuated {{the night before the}} 1981 Rose Bowl game when a fire alarm was triggered at 2:30a.m., and Woolfolk only had three hours of sleep that night. [...] He won the MVP award despite the lack of sleep, and after the game Woolfolk called the game his [...] "greatest thrill in football." [...] Commenting on the MVP trophy, Woolfolk said: [...] "If I could, I'd break this trophy into 95 pieces and hand it out to all the guys on the squad." [...] After winning his second MVP trophy in 1981's Bluebonnet Bowl, Woolfolk said: [...] "I might look back in later years and notice that, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> all <b>I</b> can think about is that I've worn a Michigan uniform for the last time." ...|$|R

[...] In November 2012, {{she was diagnosed with}} plantar fasciitis in her right foot and had decided then that the 2013 World Championships would be her last professional race. [...] When asked to reflect back on her past career as a runner, she said, [...] "Once I'm a granny I might think, 'Man that was hard,' <b>but</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have nothing but good memories" [...] and that her favorite memory was winning the National High School Ekiden Championships while attending Kōjōkan High School. [...] When asked about her future away from the sport, she said, [...] "It's a complete blank. [...] I can't imagine what I'll be doing. [...] I can't do anything useful for society, but I will completely cut off connection with the world of athletics." [...] She cried with her mother and left these final words for future athletes: [...] "Always do what you think is the right thing no matter what anybody tells you." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jeff {{was born}} in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital city and largest municipality. Since his early childhood, he has shown {{interests}} in art and music in general. Spending most of his upbringing in a global city, Jeff had an early exposure in the diversity of culture, religion and ethnicity, which helped to form his views of seeing the music and art in a liberal way. He once tried to become a painter but later found out that music suits him better, as he explained on the 2007 interview with Ultimate Metal webzine: [...] "I cannot express with other media such as painting or poetry. My father is a painter and he expresses himself through this. I once tried it, but it didn’t work for me - I can make technically proficient sketches and illustrations, but felt distant from them. It’s like a cold relationship. So when I found music and started to write songs, it just {{came up to me}} and I said to myself 'that's it, this is the most suitable medium for me'. <b>But</b> for <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> don't rely on music as my career, I work another job to pay the bills." [...] In 2000, Jeff graduated from Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology, and according to another interview with Ultimate Metal, he taught himself graphic design through books and internet.|$|R
6000|$|A Postscript is a {{very useful}} invention: {{but it is not}} meant (as so many ladies suppose) to contain the real gist of the letter: it serves rather to throw into the shade any little matter we do not wish to make a fuss about. For example, your friend had promised to execute a {{commission}} for you in town, but forgot it, thereby putting you to great inconvenience: and he now writes to apologize for his negligence. It would be cruel, and needlessly crushing, to make it the main subject of your reply. How much more gracefully it comes in thus! [...] "P.S. Don't distress yourself any more about having omitted that little matter in town. I won't deny that it did put my plans out a little, at the time: <b>but</b> it's all <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> often forget things, myself: and 'those who live in glass-houses, mustn't throw stones', you know!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012, {{directors}} Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor discussed {{producing a}} potential Ghost Rider 3, and having someone else direct it. Neveldine told The Playlist that Cage had {{expressed interest in}} appearing in another Ghost Rider film, hinting that the film could move forward provided that Spirit of Vengeance was a success, saying, [...] "I know Nic wants to do it, he's very pumped about it.... We'll {{just have to see}} how well this does." [...] In March, 2013, when Cage was asked about a possible third installment, he said, [...] "It's possible, but it won't be with me.... Anything's possible. But I doubt, highly, that I would be in a third installment of that." [...] According to MTV reporting, Cage believes that another Ghost Rider film might happen [...] "down the road," [...] saying, [...] "It would be interesting if they did it with a female Ghost Rider," [...] but he insisted that his days as Johnny Blaze were behind him. Cage also said, [...] "Personally, I'm done. I've done what I had to do with that part. You never say never, <b>but</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> today, <b>I</b> would say that I'm done." [...] Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige announced on May 2, 2013 that the film rights to Ghost Rider had reverted to Marvel Studios, though he also stated that the studio had no immediate plans to make another Ghost Rider film. Nonetheless, the Robbie Reyes version of the character made his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe through the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., portrayed by Gabriel Luna.|$|R

"If {{you would}} have my free opinion, my lord," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Oldbuck, [...] "and will not catch too rapidly at it as matter of hope, I {{would say that it}} is very possible the child yet lives. For thus much I ascertained, by my former inquiries concerning the event of that deplorable evening, that a child and woman were carried that night from the cottage at the Craigburnfoot in a carriage and four by your brother Edward Geraldin Neville, whose journey towards England with these companions I traced for several stages. I believed then it {{was a part of the}} family compact to carry a child whom you meant to stigmatize with illegitimacy, out of that country where chance might have raised protectors and proofs of its <b>rights.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> think that your brother, having reason, like yourself, to believe the child stained with shame yet more indelible, had nevertheless withdrawn it, partly from regard to the honour of his house, partly from the risk to which it might have been exposed in the neighbourhood of the Lady Glenallan." ...|$|R

I suffered agony of mind that was terrible, and began {{to feel as if}} iron bars tightened around me. The remorse which comes over me is terrible and my nerves give out until I have not slept until days at a time. I used to say to condemned persons as I beckoned with my hand, [...] "Come with me." [...] Now at night when I lie down, I start up with a roar as victim after victim comes up before me. I can see them on the trap, waiting a second before they face their Maker. They haunt me and taunt me until am nearly crazy with uneartly fear. I am two hundred times a murderer, but I won't kill another man.

60|$|I {{acknowledge}} that I was for manning out {{the boat and}} going to them, but William would by no means allow me.

I opposed him a great while, and told him I thought he used to be always <b>right,</b> <b>but</b> that <b>now</b> <b>I</b> thought he was not; that I was no more for running needless risks than he or any one else; but I thought all nations in the world, even the most savage people, when they held out a flag of peace, kept the offer of peace made by that signal very sacredly; and I gave him several examples of it in the history of my African travels, which I have here gone through in the beginning of this work, and that I could not think these people worse than some of them. And, besides, I told him our case seemed to be such that we must fall into somebody's hands or other, and that we had better fall into their hands by a friendly treaty than by a forced submission, nay, though they had indeed a treacherous design; and therefore I was for a parley with them.|$|R
