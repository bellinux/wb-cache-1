40|$|The current EU energy {{efficiency}} directive 2012 / 27 /EU defines the existing building stocks {{as one of}} the most promising potential sector for achieving energy saving. Robust methodologies aimed to quantify the potential reduction of energy consumption for large building stocks need to be developed. To this purpose, a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis</b> is necessary in order to support public planners in determining how well a building is performing, in setting credible targets for improving performance or in detecting abnormal energy consumption. In the present work, a novel methodology is proposed to perform a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis</b> particularly suitable for heterogeneous samples of buildings. The methodology is based on the estimation of a statistical model for energy consumption - the Linear Mixed Effects Model -, so as to account for both the fixed effects shared by all individuals within a dataset and the random effects related to particular groups/classes of individuals in the population. The groups of individuals within the population have been classified by resorting to a supervised learning technique. Under this backdrop, a Monte Carlo simulation is worked out to compute the frequency distribution of annual energy consumption and identify a reference value for each group/class of buildings. The <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis</b> was tested for a case study of 100 out-patient Healthcare Centres in Northern Italy, finally resulting in 12 different frequency distributions for space and Domestic Hot Water heating energy consumption, one for each class of homogeneous class of buildings. From the median value of each frequency distribution, reference values were extracted to be used in a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis.</b> Beyond being flexible, open and upgradeable over time, a <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis</b> relying on both a sound statistical basis and on stochastic simulation is indeed able to overcome the limitations of the more common deterministic or one-dimensional benchmarking approac...|$|E

This study attempts to introduce awareness on potential energy savings in supermarkets. A supermarket in Latvia is analysed as a case study. The largest consumption of energy in supermarket was determined to derive from operation of refrigeration systems, HVAC systems and lighting. The methodology used in this study is based on <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis.</b> Using <b>benchmarking</b> <b>analysis,</b> the specific energy amount in function of the amount of customer in supermarket is studied in this work. The specific energy consumption shows wide dispersion: from 1. 06 kWh per customer up to 1. 73 kWh per customer. This leads to a variance of 48 % of consumed electricity for one customer. The variance can be explained by various technological and climate factors, but even more importantly - behavioural factors...|$|E
