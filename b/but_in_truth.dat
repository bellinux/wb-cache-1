5|$|Taking an {{advantage}} of Mathabar's absence in Kathmandu, the military battalions {{under his command}} were distributed to other courtiers during the annual muster {{at the beginning of}} 1837. Nevertheless, Bhimsen managed to secure his and his family members' positions in the civil and military offices. An investigation was also started to check Bhimsen's expenditures in establishing various battalions. Such events led the courtiers to feel that Bhimsen's mukhtiyari would not last very long; thus Ranbir Singh Thapa, in the hopes of becoming the next mukhtiyar, {{wrote a letter to the}} King asking him to be recalled to Kathmandu from Palpa. His wish was granted; and Bhimsen, pleased to see his brother after many years, made Ranbir Singh the acting Mukhtiyar and decided to go to his ancestral home in Borlang Gorkha for the sake of pilgrimage. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth,</b> Bhimsen had gone to Gorkha to placate his nephew and bring him back to Kathmandu.|$|E
5|$|Royal marriages of the 19th {{century were}} {{arranged}} to secure alliances {{and to maintain}} blood ties among the European nations. As early as 1851, Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her German-born husband, Prince Albert, were making plans to marry their eldest daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, to Frederick. The royal dynasty in Britain was predominantly German; there was little British blood in Queen Victoria, and none in her husband. The monarchs desired to maintain their family's blood ties to Germany, and Prince Albert further hoped that the marriage {{would lead to the}} liberalization and modernization of Prussia. King Leopold I of Belgium, uncle of the British monarch and consort, also favoured this pairing; he had long treasured Baron Stockmar's idea of a marriage alliance between Britain and Prussia. Frederick's father, Prince William, had no interest in the arrangement, hoping instead for a Russian Grand Duchess as his daughter-in-law. However, Princess Augusta was greatly in favour of a match for her son that would bring closer connections with Britain. In 1851, his mother sent Frederick to England, ostensibly to visit the Great Exhibition <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth</b> she hoped that the cradle of liberalism and home of the industrial revolution would have a positive influence on her son. Prince Albert took Frederick under his wing during his stay but it was Albert's daughter, only eleven at the time, who guided the German prince around the Exhibition. Frederick only knew a few words of English, while Victoria could converse fluently in German. He was impressed by her mix of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity, and their meeting proved to be a success. A regular exchange of letters between Victoria and Frederick followed.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously.

Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul is not in the humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1786, Charles III of Spain {{provided}} a library and laboratory to Pierre-François Chabaneau {{to aid in}} his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him {{to believe he was}} working with a single metal, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth</b> the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum-group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, it would be much more brittle. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while white-hot. Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaquín Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started {{what is known as the}} [...] "platinum age" [...] in Spain.|$|E

She became an ordained minister within Scientology, and in this role trained new recruits to the organization, including Travolta.

500|$|The Warrior-class ships {{have been}} {{described}} as revolutionary, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth</b> they were more evolutionary than not as everything except their wrought iron armour had been in use by ocean-going ships for years.

[...] They were designed in response to Gloire, which started an invasion scare in Britain, but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line. They were designed by Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate [...] Warrior and her sister Black Prince were not intended to stand in the line of battle as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three-deck ships of the line. Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage.|$|E

500|$|Fun Home {{has several}} themes {{recurring}} throughout the book. The biggest theme, arguably, is sexual orientation. Bechdel tells {{the readers of}} her journey of discovering her own sexuality through books. [...] "My realization at nineteen that I was a lesbian came about {{in a manner consistent}} with my bookish upbringing." [...] Her exposure (from reading literal definitions in dictionaries, reading interviews of others like her, etc.) helped her come to terms with her sexuality, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth,</b> the hints of it plagued her childhood: her desire [...] "for the right to exchange [...] tank suit for a pair of shorts" [...] in Cannes" [...] or her desire for her brothers to call her Albert instead of Alison on one camping trip. [...] However, Bechdel also reveals that she wasn't alone in her choice of partners; her father also exhibited some homosexual behaviors, but in a different way than Alison. [...] "I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy" [...] when her mother reveals Bechdel's father's secret. Though both, father and daughter, had similar situations (Bechdel was a lesbian while her father was gay or bisexual), the two handled their issues differently. Bechdel chose to accept the fact and not hide from the issue, taking a female partner and going to [...] "gay union" [...] meetings when she was a student at Oberlin College. Bechdel was open about her sexuality before she'd even been in a same-sex relationship (of any sort). Her father, on the other hand, had had countless affairs with men but wasn't open about it. [...] This may be due to homophobia (his and/or others'), or because he was married with a family. In any case, it is clear that he is afraid of coming out, as illustrated by [...] "the fear in his eyes" [...] when the conversation topic is dangerously close to homosexuality.|$|E

2500|$|In Act I Scene 2 of Shakespeare's Othello, Iago {{invokes the}} name of Janus after the failure of his premiere plot to undo the titular character.

Iago guides (if not forces) the story through inception, climax, and finale. Furthermore, Janus' common two-faced depiction is the perfect visual metaphor for Iago's character.

2500|$|During 1926, a plot {{to assassinate}} Mustafa Kemal was {{uncovered}} in İzmir. It originated with a former deputy who had opposed {{the abolition of the}} Caliphate. Investigation shifted from an inquiry into the planners to an investigation ostensibly to uncover subversive activities <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>truth</b> used to undermine those disagreeing with Mustafa Kemal's cultural revolution. The sweeping investigation brought a number of political activists before the tribunal, including Karabekir, the leader of PRP. A number of surviving leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, who were at best second-rank in the Turkish movement, including Cavid, Ahmed Şükrü, and Ismail Canbulat, were found guilty of treason and hanged. The investigations found a link between the members of the PRP and the Sheikh Said Rebellion. The PRP was dissolved following the outcomes of the trial. The pattern of organized opposition, however, was broken. This action was the only broad political purge during Atatürk's presidency.
