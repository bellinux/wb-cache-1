5|$|The {{breeding}} male mallard is unmistakable, with {{a glossy}} bottle-green {{head and a}} white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, {{with that of the}} female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe.|$|E
5|$|Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced {{necks and}} round ears. Of the living, non-hybrid felids, the lion {{is second only}} to the tiger in length and weight. Its skull is very {{similar to that of the}} tiger, {{although}} the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with dark spots on their body. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.|$|E

5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (revolute) and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
25|$|Kangaroo rats are four-toed heteromyid rodents {{with big}} hind legs, small front legs and {{relatively}} large heads. Adults typically weigh between 70 and 170 g. The tails of kangaroo rats are longer than both {{their bodies and}} their heads. Another notable feature of kangaroo rats are their fur-lined cheek pouches, which are used for storing food. The coloration of kangaroo rats varies from cinnamon <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> dark gray, depending on the species. There is also some variation in length {{with one of the}} largest species, the banner-tailed kangaroo rat being six inches in body length and a tail length of eight inches. Sexual dimorphism exists in all species, with males being larger than females.|$|E
25|$|The {{rufous-naped lark}} {{is a fairly}} large and robust lark species, with rather heavy flight. The sexes are similar, but males average larger and heavier. Adults are {{individually}} and geographically variable. It measures 15–18cm from bill tip to tail tip and weighs 40-44g. The streaked upper parts, short erectile crest, creamy-buff eyebrow that merges with the lore, and the rufous flight feathers are easily discernible features. The hindcrown and nape are streaked along the feather centers while the margins vary from chestnut, rufous or pinkish <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> greyish brown. The wings appear conspicuously rufous in flight, while the outer edges of the primaries show up as a rufous panel on the closed wing. The underwing coverts are rufous, and upper coverts are broadly edged tawny or buff (or grey in race grisescens). The tail is dark brown, but the outer webs of the outer tail feathers vary from buff (cf. africana and sharpii) to tawny or bright rufous. The mantle is lighter brown than the back, and the rump still darker brown. The flanks are a shade darker than the rufous-buff belly, but regionally the plumage may also be stained red by soil. The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown. Juveniles have bold black spotting on the crown, mantle and wing coverts, all edged with buff, while the breast spotting is more blotchy or diffuse.|$|E

If the egg does not survive {{the first few days}} in the nest, the female will usually lay a replacement egg.

The cap surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age.

500|$|The cap is [...] wide, and {{initially}} convex to broadly convex before flattening {{out with a}} depressed center. The cap margin is curved inward, and often remains that way into maturity. The cap surface is covered with fine soft hairs when young, but later becomes smooth; it is slimy and sticky when wet. The color of the cap ranges from lilac-brown when young, fading to lilac-tan or pale lilac-gray and eventually to pale tan or pinkish-buff at the center. The gills are attached to slightly decurrent (extending somewhat {{down the length of}} the stem), broad, and packed together closely. They are cream-colored when young, and later develop pinkish tones near the margin. In maturity, they become flushed with brownish-orange. The color stains <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> olive-brown to dark brown when bruised.|$|E
500|$|The Moupin pika (Ochotona thibetana), {{also known}} as Ribetischer Pika, Moupin-Pika, Pika del Tibet, [...] and Manipuri pika, is a species of mammal in the pika family, Ochotonidae. It has many subspecies, {{some of which may}} be {{distinct}} species. Its summer pelage is dark russet-brown with some light spots on the dorsal side, and ochraceous buff tinged on the belly. In winter it is lighter, with <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> dull brown dorsal pelage. A generalist herbivore, it is found in the mountains of the eastern Tibetan Plateau in China (Gansu, southern Qinghai, Yunnan, and Sichuan), Bhutan, India (Sikkim), and northern Myanmar. Both the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red Listof Endangered Species and the Red List of China's Vertebrates classify it as a species of least concern; although one subspecies may be endangered.|$|E

There are roughly two circular pores per millimeter, and the tubes that comprise the pores are [...] deep, but depressed around the top of the stem.

500|$|The fruit bodies {{produced}} by the fungus are [...] wide and [...] tall. They are fleshy cauliflower-like masses with a stout central stem that splits into a few lower primary branches before branching densely above. The stem is short and thick—between [...] in diameter—and tapers downward. Initially white, in age both the stem and branches turn pale yellow to <b>buff</b> <b>to</b> tan. Old fruit bodies can fade to become almost white, or may be ochre due to fallen spores. The branching pattern is irregular, with the primary branches few and thick—typically —and the final branches slender (2–3mm), and usually terminated with five to seven branchlets. The branchlet tips are pink to purplish-red. The flesh is solid and white, and has an odor described variously as indistinct or pleasant. A drop of Melzer's reagent applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak amyloid staining reaction that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop. This reaction {{can be used to}} help distinguish R.botrytis from other similar fungi.|$|E
