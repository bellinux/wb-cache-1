50|$|None of the {{makeshift}} {{homes in the}} slums have plumbing, running water taps, bathtubs or toilets. Without a <b>built-in</b> <b>bathtub,</b> people of the slums often {{have to look for}} a place to defecate and often end up publicly defecating somewhere in the slum. Among the mountains of garbage and the public defecation, the slum smells of human waste and the garbage dumped into the slum.|$|E
50|$|The Kohler Company grew {{rapidly in}} the early twentieth century, {{developing}} new products such as the industry's first one-piece <b>built-in</b> <b>bathtub.</b> By 1914, the Company employed 950 people and had sales offices in four major American cities and in London. In the First World War, the Company shifted to production of war materials. But in the 1920s it expanded its products and sales, building, among other things, a motor powered dishwasher, an electric clothes washer, and a gasoline powered generator. Kohler created the world's largest pottery plant in order to mass-produce toilets and sinks.|$|E
2500|$|The target {{customers}} for the Queensboro Corporation were middle class residents of New York {{who could afford}} {{to live in the}} suburbs. In 1914 the Queensboro Corporation directors inspected new housing developments in several European cities. These probably included the garden apartment projects at Charlottenburg, Berlin, built between 1904 and 1909, that Erich Kohn and Paul Mebes had designed for the Berlin Civil Servants Dwelling Association. The housing developments at Jackson Heights closely resemble the Charlottenberg developments. In contrast to traditional suburbs of single-family houses, [...] the Queensboro corporation decided to build upscale apartment buildings distinguished by shared garden spaces. The apartments were of high quality with ornate exteriors and features such as fireplaces, parquet floors, sun rooms and <b>built-in</b> <b>bathtubs</b> with showers. The apartments, or [...] "homes", were sold rather than rented under what was first called a [...] "collective ownership plan". This was later changed to [...] "cooperative ownership", probably because the first name had connotations of socialism.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{house was}} probably built for Frank and Lovinnia Farnsworth. The house passed through several owners, ending with Lewis and Vinnie Farnsworth Jepson in 1904. Vinnie {{was the daughter}} of Frank and Lovinnia Farnsworth. The Jepsons finished the upstairs of the 1Â½ story house, installing a wooden bathtub that was stated to be one of only two <b>built-in</b> <b>bathtubs</b> in Kanab at the time. The Jepsons probably added {{to the rear of the}} property at the same time. They sold the house in 1925 to the Hiway Tourist Park and Company, a local tour bus operation owned by brothers Gronway Parry, Caleb Parry and Chauncey Parry. The Parrys worked with William W. Wylie, a pioneer of tourism in Yellowstone National Park, to provide tour services in Grand Canyon's north rim, Zion, Bryce and Cedar Breaks National Monument. The Parrys converted the Jepson house for use as the Parry Cafeteria in 1925. The Parry brothers later established the Parry Lodge, which is still in operation today, at the corner of Center Street and 100 East, where they remodeled a frame house, and built several cottage-type motel units.|$|R
2500|$|Jackson Heights was {{a planned}} {{development}} {{laid out by}} the Queensboro Corporation beginning in about 1916, and residents came after {{the arrival of the}} Flushing Line into Jackson Heights in 1917. The community was initially planned as a place for middle- to upper-middle income workers from Manhattan to raise their families. The Queensboro Corporation coined the name [...] "garden apartment" [...] to convey the concept of apartments surrounded by a green environment. The apartments, built around private parks during this time, contributed to Jackson Heights' being the first garden city community built in the United States, as part of the international garden city movement {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Most of the buildings in Jackson Heights are the Queensboro Corporation apartments, built within a few blocks of the Flushing Line, which are typically five or six stories tall and are located between Northern Boulevard and 37th Avenue as part of that planned community. Targeted toward the middle class, the Queensboro Corporation-based the new apartments off of similar ones in Berlin. These new apartments were to share garden spaces, have ornate exteriors and features such as fireplaces, parquet floors, sun rooms, and <b>built-in</b> <b>bathtubs</b> with showers; and be cooperatively owned. In addition, the corporation divided the land into blocks and building lots, as well as installed streets, sidewalks, and power, water, and sewage lines. Although land for churches was provided, the apartments themselves were limited to white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, while excluding Jews, Blacks, and perhaps Greeks and Italians.|$|R
