5|$|The French {{carried out}} seven assaults against the flèches {{and each time}} were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> in fierce close combat. Bagration in some {{instances}} was personally leading counterattacks, and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11:00 hours. He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka's decisive cavalry attack.|$|E
5|$|German paratroops {{attacked}} Crete on 20 May. Many paratroopers landed {{near the}} Div Cav positions and were <b>beaten</b> <b>back.</b> Cut {{off from the}} 10th Brigade headquarters, Russell followed Kippenberger's orders and withdrew to Galatas in Chania, to reinforce a Greek unit south of the village. At dusk, the regiment dug in near a stone wall. B Squadron held the right flank and C Squadron the centre; A Squadron and the 19th Battalion held the left, with the Greek unit in reserve.|$|E

5|$|On 11 September, OG North paused {{offensive}} operations {{while the}} 4th and 7th Guards Brigades moved into reserve. They were {{replaced with the}} 1st and the 2nd Guards Brigades of the HVO, which became the spearhead of OG North. A probing attack by the 2nd Guards Brigade achieved some gains towards Jajce along {{the rim of the}} Kupres Plateau. OGs South and West made another effort to capture Drvar, but were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> by VRS infantry supported by artillery and M-87 Orkan rockets.|$|E
5|$|Opposing Force {{returns to}} the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the {{perspective}} of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> by a second alien race and black operations units.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} that the Prussian army {{was able to}} support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment, across the Brussels road. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians. In the evening Napoleon committed his last reserves to a desperate final attack, which was narrowly <b>beaten</b> <b>back.</b> With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked in the centre, and the French army was routed.|$|E

5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or <b>beaten</b> <b>back.</b> As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|At {{the road}} bridge, German {{forces of the}} 9th SS had quickly {{surrounded}} Frost's battalion, cutting them {{off from the rest}} of the division. At around 09:00, the 9th SS Reconnaissance Battalion headed back toward Arnhem from south of the river, having concluded that it was not needed at Nijmegen. Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge for the rest of the day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road to deal with them. Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E
60|$|We {{who called}} {{ourselves}} {{part of the}} American army were much like a handful of rats surrounded by a pack of dogs, save that there was in our hearts the satisfaction of knowing we had twice bested these same soldiers who were fighting for money alone, and would have <b>beaten</b> them <b>back</b> the third time but for the misfortune of not having the wherewithal to deal out death as we had done before.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{entering}} the camp, detainees {{were exposed to}} special forms of torture. They were ordered to lie on their stomachs, and they would then be brutally <b>beaten</b> on their <b>backs</b> and heads. Some had their fingers broken by clamps.|$|R

Besides, now we can both go to sleep. Let us get well up the tree, so that if anything that can climb should come, it will fall to at the deer to begin with. That will be certain to wake us." ...|$|R
5|$|However the Eleans, Messenians and Spartans {{remained}} passive throughout 210 BC, and Philip {{continued to}} make advances. He invested and took Echinus, using extensive siegeworks, having <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> an attempt to relieve the town by the Aetolian strategos Dorimachus and the Roman fleet, now commanded by the proconsul Publius Sulpicius Galba. Moving west Philip probably also took Phalara {{the port city of}} Lamia, in the Maliac Gulf. Sulpicius and Dorimachus took Aegina, an island in the Saronic Gulf, which the Aetolians sold to Attalus, the Pergamene king, for thirty talents, and which he was to use as his base of operations against Macedon in the Aegean Sea.|$|E
5|$|In the Vistula-Oder Offensive in January, 1945, the 3rd Belorussian Front was {{tasked with}} driving into East Prussia from the east. The 31st Army {{was not on}} an assault sector, {{and in the first}} stages it was ordered to hold its {{positions}} stubbornly. By January 23–24, the 331st had joined in pursuit of the retreating German forces, and along with its corps helped capture the important road junction of Blenkheim, and the strongpoint of Treuburg on the approaches to Lötzen. However, {{in the first week of}} February, the German command had regrouped their 129th and 558th Infantry Divisions as well as units of the 24th Panzer Division, which counterattacked in an attempt to encircle units of the 71st Rifle Corps; after several days fighting the attacks were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> and the advance resumed towards Kanditten.|$|E
5|$|Later in the evening, 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry counterattacked the {{positions}} {{but was unable}} to take them back, in the face of machine gun and small arms fire, and was forced to withdraw by nightfall. After this failed attempt to retake the equipment, Dean ordered {{the positions}} where the captured equipment was located to be destroyed by an airstrike. With the 1st Battalion having taken heavy casualties and the 3rd Battalion forced to move to counter North Korean attacks, the northwest flank of the American line had been <b>beaten</b> <b>back.</b> The North Korean 4th Division began crossing the river, only slightly impeded by US aircraft attacking its boats.|$|E
50|$|Viktor goes to {{a coffee}} shop, and some toughs come in and grab a woman inside and {{take her to the}} back of the shop to beat and rape her. He takes out the man {{guarding}} the entrance, and is about to leave, but the sound of the woman being <b>beaten</b> flashes <b>back</b> to his father beating his mother, so he has a change of heart and rescues her, finding out her name is Bethesda. He winds up meeting her again later, and they fall in love.|$|R
60|$|One night Vey {{had been}} badly <b>beaten</b> in some <b>back</b> {{room of a}} saloon and carried out into a vacant lot and left there. He lay there all that night and all the next day. Probably he would have died there had not Steele {{happened}} along.|$|R
6000|$|... 14th. Scarlet.--The {{engagement}} {{ended last}} night by the complete evacuation of Grierson. Pipes cleared {{the whole country}} about that town in splendid style, and the army encamped {{on the field of}} battle; sadly reduced indeed, but victorious for the moment. The enemy, since their first appearance at Grierson, have lost 4,400 men, and have been <b>beaten</b> decisively <b>back.</b> There is now not a man on our side of the Sandusky; and our loss of 2,600 is serious indeed, but, seeing how much has been accomplished, not excessive. The enemy's horse was cut to pieces.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Gelimer {{remained}} blockaded by Pharas at {{the mountain}} stronghold of Medeus, {{but as the}} blockade dragged through the winter, Pharas grew impatient. He attacked the mountain stronghold, only to be <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> {{with the loss of}} a quarter of his men. While a success for Gelimer, it did not alter his hopeless situation as he and his followers remained tightly blockaded and began to suffer from lack of food. Pharas sent him messages calling upon him to surrender and spare his followers the misery, {{but it was not until}} March that the Vandal king agreed to surrender after receiving guarantees for his safety. Gelimer was then escorted to Carthage.|$|E
5|$|Now {{commanded}} by Balinor, Callahorn's reformed Border Legion marches out of Tyrsis and engages the Northland army at the Mermiddon River, killing many Northlanders before {{being forced to}} pull back; the Border Legion retreats to Tyrsis and make preparations for defense. During the siege of Tyrsis, Hendel and Menion come upon Stenmin {{and some of his}} supporters. Hendel is killed, but Menion kills Stenmin. After three days, the Border Legion is <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> from the Outer Wall of Tyrsis as a result of treachery—the wall falls when the traitors destroy the locks on the main gate, jamming it open. At the defenders' last stand on the Bridge of Sendic, the Northlanders abruptly break and run.|$|E
60|$|Manak Chand {{ordered his}} cavalry to charge, {{but just as}} he did so, a {{cannonball}} from one of Clive's field pieces passed close to his head. The sensation was so unpleasant that he at once changed his mind. The order for retreat was given, and the <b>beaten</b> army fell <b>back,</b> in disorder, to Calcutta.|$|R

50|$|Adilshahi troops {{headed by}} Siddhi Masood, Suryarao Surve and Jaswantrao Dalavi were {{attacked}} from a hill called Gonimooth, fiercely <b>beaten</b> and turned <b>back</b> to fort Panhala by the Marathas headed by Rango Narayan. He was handsomely rewarded by Shivaji for his great performance. Later, during his coronation ceremony in June 1674, Shivaji conferred on him {{the honor of}} ‘Palkhi’ and doubled his remuneration.|$|R
5|$|That evening, around 23:00, the 9th Infantry Battalion's {{rear echelon}} at Barara, along the Toko–Mosigetta–Buin Road, came under attack. Under {{the command of}} the {{battalion}} second-in-command, and possessing only four Bren light machine guns for direct fire support, they were nevertheless able to hold off the initial attack. Following this, sporadic fighting continued into the early morning, when at 04:45 on 29 March a force of about 100 Japanese attacked the position supported by sustained machine gun and rifle fire. Rushing the Australian position with bayonets, they were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> by stiff defence and fell back from the position, leaving behind 23 dead but taking their wounded with them. Four Australians were wounded in this encounter.|$|E
5|$|The 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion {{attacked}} the defensive positions {{held by the}} 42nd Guards Rifle Division and the remaining armour of the 18th Tank Corps, while the panzer units {{attacked the}} defences of 9th Guards Airborne Division and the 29th Tank Corps. These German attacks were repelled by concentrated anti-tank artillery fire. The 29th Tank Corps responded with a counterattack and penetrated German lines, reaching Komsomolets State Farm before being <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> by direct fire from German artillery. That afternoon, Totenkopf was ordered to abandon their positions northwest of Prokhorovka and return to tenable positions around Hill 226.6. Soviet attempts to sever the narrow salient were unsuccessful, and Totenkopf completed its withdrawal by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|The Alamanni on {{the other}} hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They {{defeated}} Aurelian at the Battle of Placentia in 271 AD but were <b>beaten</b> <b>back</b> for a short time after they lost the battles of Fano and Pavia later that year. They were beaten again in 298 AD at the battles of Lingones and Vindonissa but fifty years later they were resurgent again, making incursions in 356 AD at the Battle of Reims, in 357 AD at the Battle of Strasbourg, in 367 AD at the Battle of Solicinium and in 378 AD at Battle of Argentovaria. In the same year the Goths inflicted a crushing defeat on the Eastern Empire at the Battle of Adrianople, in which the Eastern Emperor Valens was massacred along {{with tens of thousands of}} Roman troops.|$|E

25|$|The French III and X corps counter{{attacked}} {{but were}} <b>beaten</b> further <b>back.</b> Lanrezac’s countermanding orders never reached X Corps. Lanrezac’s Fifth Army was now attacked on its {{right by the}} German Third Army; although these attacks were held, Lanrezac asked Joffre for permission to retreat. Lanrezac asked for the BEF to attack the German Second Army in flank, although, contradicting himself, he also reported that the BEF was still in echelon behind his own left flank, which if true {{would have made it}} impossible for the BEF to do as he asked. Sir John, who had cancelled his own planned advance on news that Lanrezac had asked to fall back, agreed to hold his position.|$|R
