5|$|In {{addition}} to being listed as endangered in 2014 by the IUCN, the ring-tailed lemur has been listed since 1977 by CITES under Appendix I, which makes trade of wild-caught specimens illegal. Although there are more endangered species of lemur, the ring-tailed lemur is considered a flagship species due to its recognizability. As of 2017, only about 2,000 ring-tailed lemurs are estimated to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wild, making the threat of extinction far more serious for them than previously believed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{controversy}} of Sampson's administration {{was over the}} selection of the state's highway commissioner. The Highway Department employed over ten thousand people and spent nearly 45% of the state's budget. Legislators' votes could often be bought with promises of new road construction in their districts. Thus, the department became a primary vehicle for dispensing patronage to political supporters. Sampson's predecessor, Governor Fields, had chosen retired congressman and Democratic political boss Ben Johnson to head the department, and Sampson had agreed to retain him in exchange for his support against Beckham. However, Sampson felt that such a powerful position could not <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of a Democrat, and he removed Johnson from office in December 1929.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount Hope at 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E

5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process should seek to minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried {{for a few days}} in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E

EQC chief executive Ian Simpson said that the $4billion cap for each earthquake {{is unlikely to be}} exceeded by the costs of residential building and land repairs, so $3billion would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> EQC's Natural Disaster Fund after payouts.|$|E

Even if those who remained despised Agathocles, they would not be inclined to rebellion out of care for their relatives who were with Agathocles.|$|E
25|$|Taking low-key {{photographs}} {{is possible}} in dark rooms where light penetrates only through a small window, but the best results are achieved by using artificial studio lights. Sometimes, a single directed light source is sufficient. Usually, well-targeted sources are used to get the desired effect, since a large light source could considerably reduce the desired result. Special {{attention is paid to}} having sufficient details that will, invariably, <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade. This type of lighting it's also known as Rembrandtian light.|$|E

25|$|The {{weakness}} of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty (dysphagia). Typically, this means that some food may <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mouth after an attempt to swallow, or food and liquids may regurgitate into the nose rather than go down the throat (velopharyngeal insufficiency). Weakness of the muscles that move the jaw (muscles of mastication) may cause difficulty chewing. In individuals with MG, chewing tends to become more tiring when chewing tough, fibrous foods. Difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking is the first symptom in about one-sixth of individuals.|$|E
25|$|Electrodes {{can either}} be placed {{directly}} on brain areas of interest or can {{be placed in the}} subdural space of the brain. Subdural electrodes can shift slightly and can be affected by cerebrospinal fluid in the subdural space, which could interfere with the current used to stimulate the brain from the electrodes and possibly cause shunting and dissipate the current, making the stimulation's effect less accurate. However, an advantage of subdural electrode grids is that they can <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> brain for multiple days, and allow functional testing during stimulation outside the operating room.|$|E
25|$|When the queens emerge, {{the workers}} in the colony will form two 'systems' or arms in {{opposite}} directions. These queens that are hatched will move down either the arms and only two queens will succeed, one for each branch. The remaining new queens will <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle and are abandoned to die. Two new bivouacs will be formed and break off into different directions. The workers will surround the two to-be queens and ensure they reach the arms and survive. These workers that surround the queens {{are affected by the}} CHC (pheromone) profile emitted from the new queen.|$|E

25|$|At one point, Orpheus married Eurydice, a nymph. While {{fleeing from}} {{an attack by}} Aristaeus, she stepped on a snake that bit her, killing her. To reclaim her, Orpheus entered the Underworld, where the music from his lyre charmed Hades. Hades relented and let Orpheus bring Eurydice back, on the {{condition}} that he never once look back until outside. Unfortunately, near the very end, Orpheus faltered and looked back, causing Eurydice to <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Underworld forever. Orpheus spent {{the rest of his life}} strumming his lyre while wandering aimlessly through the land, rejecting all marriage offers from women.|$|E
25|$|A {{peripheral}} IV cannot <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vein indefinitely, {{because of}} the risk of insertion-site infection leading to phlebitis, cellulitis and sepsis. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated their guidelines and now advise the cannula need to be replaced every 96 hours. This was based on studies organised to identify causes of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in hospitals. In the United Kingdom, the UK Department of health published their finding about risk factors associated with increased MRSA infection, now include intravenous cannula, central venous catheters and urinary catheters as the main factors increasing the risk of spreading antibiotic resistant strain bacteria.|$|E

25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, or may <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> as-cast state. (The {{same can be}} said of cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment to wealth and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E
25|$|An English {{tradition}} of the 19th century ("riddling the ashes") involved spodomancy on St. Mark's Eve (April 24). Ashes would be left on the hearth on St. Mark's Eve, and examined the next day. Folklore said that the footprint of anyone who was {{to die in the}} coming year would <b>be</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ashes. On the Isle of Man, a similar tradition was observed, although a death would occur only if the footprint pointed inward (an outward-pointing imprint would mean a birth). Another Manx tradition has it that riddling the ashes on St. Mark's Eve or Halloween will allow the spirit-imprint of one's future husband to appear in the ashes the next morning. Elsewhere in Europe, the riddling of the ashes to learn of births and deaths was observed on Halloween or New Year's Eve.|$|E
