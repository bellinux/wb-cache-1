By {{the latter half}} of 2001, however, the volume of media reports {{declined}} precipitously, and by 2002, coverage of Falun Gong by major news organizations like the New York Times and Washington Post had almost completely ceased, particularly from within China. In a study of media discourse on Falun Gong, researcher Leeshai Lemish found that Western news organizations also became less <b>balanced,</b> <b>and</b> more likely to uncritically present the narratives of the Communist Party, rather than those of Falun Gong or human rights groups.|$|E

It is proved that {{there does not}} exist any sequence balancing number in the Fibonacci sequence and the only sequence cobalancing number in the Fibonacci sequence is F 2 = 1. Higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers are also introduced. A result on nonexistence of third order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also proved. A conjecture on the nonexistence of solutions of higher order <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers is also stated at the end...|$|R
40|$|Limitations in {{mobility}} {{are common}} in persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). As <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities are key aspects of mobility, the prevalence of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait problems {{is also expected to}} be high in this population. The objective {{of this study was to}} critically review the available literature on <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait characteristics in persons with ID. Furthermore, the consequences of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait problems in relation to falls were studied, as well as the trainability of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait in persons with ID. The systematic literature search identified 48 articles to be included in this review. The literature consistently reports that <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities are affected in persons with ID compared to their age-matched peers. These problems start at a young age and remain present during the entire lifespan of persons with ID, with a relatively early occurrence of age-related decline. From these results a conceptual model was suggested in which the development of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities in the ID population across the life span are compared to the general population. Regarding the second objective, our review showed that, although the relationship of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait problems with falls has not yet been thoroughly investigated in persons with ID, there is some preliminary evidence that these aspects are also important in the ID population. Finally, this review demonstrates that <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait are potentially trainable in persons with ID. These results suggest that falls might be prevented with ID-specific exercise interventions...|$|R

5|$|So {{immigrants}} who had newly acquired land were not enfranchised as were not {{most of the}} rural ethnically Polish farmers, who still held land by way of lease or feudal fief only like serfs or vassals of their landlords, unlike Prussia proper where serfdom had been abolished in 1807 and 1810. Immigrant farmers from the Holy Roman Empire (such as the Bambrzy) or later from member states of the German Confederation, had usually remained free peasants, causing their stronger representation within the eight members elected by peasants, {{of a total of}} 48. With regard to ethnicity, most of the nobility representatives were Polish, peasantry representatives were <b>balanced,</b> <b>and</b> the townsfolk representatives were mostly German. The first sejm included 22 Poles and 26 Germans, and most of the subsequent elections produced an almost even split between the Poles and the Germans. A major issue of the Sejm was the abolition of serfdom, which would enlarge the number of Polish speaking landowners and after ten years allow their participation in Sejm elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three of them at the London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a <b>balanced</b> <b>and</b> measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
40|$|Background: Falling among old {{individuals}} {{has provoked}} ceaseless discussion among gerontologists and physical therapists {{and it is}} still one of the greatest issues among this population. Loss of the <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> functional mobility is the main reason of falling. There have been numerous studies conducting the effect of the conventional <b>balance</b> exercise <b>and</b> exergame independently on <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> functional mobility of elderly. Previous studies lacked dealing with the effect of combined exergame and conventional exercise on the <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> functional mobility. Combined exercises are enjoyable and may have more effective to improve <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> performance to reduce risk of fall among elderly people. This package would be preferable for older people. Objective: We hypothesize that while conventional <b>balance</b> exercise <b>and</b> exergame improve <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> functional mobility, combined both types of exercise would superior improvements in elderly performance. Conclusion: Ultimately we expect that this hypothesis will provide a useful framework for facilitating combined exergame <b>and</b> conventional <b>balance</b> intervention in older people...|$|R

An early idea to implement air support (air strikes and attack helicopters) involved players fighting over special zones to access a trigger for air support against enemies. This idea was discarded because it discouraged {{the type of}} deathmatch gameplay they intended. The kill streak reward system was put in its place to encourage the improvement of player skills. Players were allowed to select weapons before matches to get accustomed to weapons more easily and minimize weapon hunting. Maps were designed primarily for deathmatch games—the developers felt such designs suited other types of gameplay as well. Map layouts were designed to minimize locations players could hide from enemy gunfire.|$|E

To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} of America and the plundering of silver by the Spanish conquistadors, Central and South America became the dominant producers of silver until around {{the beginning of the}} 18th century, particularly Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina: the last of these countries later took its name from that of the metal that composed so much of its mineral wealth. In the 19th century, primary production of silver moved to North America, particularly Canada, Mexico, and Nevada in the United States: some secondary production from lead and zinc ores also took place in Europe, and deposits in Siberia and the Russian Far East as well as in Australia were mined. Poland emerged as an important producer during the 1970s after {{the discovery}} of copper deposits that were rich in silver, before the centre of production returned to the Americas the following decade. Today, Peru and Mexico are still among the primary silver producers, but the distribution of silver production around the world is quite <b>balanced</b> <b>and</b> about one-fifth of the silver supply comes from recycling instead of new production.|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{limitations}} {{are common in}} persons with Intellectual Disabilities (ID). Differences in <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities between persons with ID and controls have mainly been demonstrated by instrumented assessments (e. g. posturography and gait analysis), which require sophisticated and expensive equipment such as force plates or a 3 D motion analysis system. Most physicians and allied healthcare professionals working with persons with ID do not have such equipment at their disposal, so they must rely on clinical tests to determine whether <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait are affected. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether existing clinical <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait tests are feasible in older persons with mild to moderate ID and to examine whether these tests are able to show limitations in <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities in the ID population compared to age-matched peers in the general population. Furthermore, it was aimed to identify the most important determinants of <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait disability in persons with the ID. A total of 76 older persons with mild to moderate ID (43 male, mean age 63. 1 +/- 7. 6 years) and 20 healthy controls (14 male, mean age 62. 2 +/- 5. 6 years) participated. <b>Balance</b> <b>and</b> gait abilities were assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Functional Reach test (FR), the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), the timed Single Leg Stance (SLS) and the Ten Metre Walking Test (TMWT). Our study showed that it is feasible to conduct standard clinical <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait tests in older persons with mild to moderate ID. <b>Balance</b> <b>and</b> gait performance of persons with ID is substantially worse compared to older persons of the general population. Age, number of co-morbidities, Body Mass Index (BMI), body sway and fear of falling are associated with <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait performance in persons with ID. These factors might help in the selection of subjects to be monitored on their <b>balance</b> <b>and</b> gait capacities...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, {{northern}} India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell {{again to the}} superior mobility and firepower {{of a new generation}} of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather <b>balanced</b> <b>and</b> pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience. Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India. As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.|$|E

40|$|A {{different}} approach {{to the theory of}} balancing numbers is possible by means of a Pell’s equation which can be derived from the definition of balancing numbers. Each balancing number corresponds to a balancer, and each balancer, in turn, is a cobalancing number. Similarly, each cobalancing number corresponds to a cobalancer and interestingly, each cobalancer is a balancing number. The cobalancing numbers as well as their cobalancers are also solutions of a Diophantine equation similar to that satisfied by <b>balancing</b> numbers <b>and</b> their balancers. Some Diophantine equations exhibit beautiful solutions in terms of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers. The Lucas-balancing and Lucas-cobalancing numbers, obtained respectively as functions of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers, are useful in the computation of <b>balancing</b> <b>and</b> cobalancing numbers of higher order.
