I felt uncomfortable about having to smile in someone's face when I really didn't like them or even know them well enough to like them." [...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a very introspective time <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> confront my fears and master every demonic thought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, young and gifted in this western culture." [...] She went on to say that she had to fight to retain her identity, and was forced [...] "to deal with folks who weren't happy about that." ...|$|E

While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show usually {{concluded}} with Red giving {{a message to}} his wife, Bernice (usually a double entendre), and delivering his signature piece of life advice {{in the form of}} a hockey metaphor: [...] "Keep your stick on the ice." [...] This was followed by a general meeting of the Possum Lodge membership while the credits rolled, which began with the ritual stating of the Lodge motto: [...] "Quando omni flunkus moritati" [...] (Pseudo-Latin for [...] "When all else fails, play dead"). From season six onward, this was often followed by the Man's Prayer: [...] "I'm a man, but I can change, if I have to, I guess." [...] In the final episode of the series, a revised version of the prayer was said: [...] "I'm a man, but I changed, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> Oh well." [...] Steve Smith later identified that this was a tribute to his wife Morag, who had simply commented, [...] "Oh well," [...] upon viewing the first episode back in 1991. In one episode, women take over Possum Lodge and change the prayer to [...] "I am woman, hear me roar. I'm in charge, get over it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Piss Flowers {{is a work}} made up {{of twelve}} sculptures that Chadwick made while on a {{residency}} at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada, in February 1991. During their stay, she and her partner, David Notarius travelled to different locations, made mounds of snow and laid out a flower shaped metal cutter. They would take turns to urinate in the snow then pour plaster into the cavities. These casts were attached to pedestals that {{were based on a}} hyacinth bulb. The whole thing was then cast in bronze and enamelled white. The works are a result of her physical contact with the location, preserving a direct impact of reality. Chadwick describes the flowers as a [...] "metaphysical conceit for the union of two people expressing themselves bodily". The work utilises the pleasure of taboo; elevating the medium of urine that is generally regarded as polluting and marginal in a dynamic and playful way. [...] "It may have been mischievous to piss in the snow, but it was damn hard work to end up with the 12 bronzes," [...] Chadwick recalled. [...] "Piss Flowers took two years, largely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find [...] £12,000 to make them". The artist [...] "sold herself" [...] to make a programme about Frida Kahlo for the BBC in order to fund the work.|$|E
2500|$|Recording artist Prince {{played the}} guitar on three {{songs from the}} album, [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Keep It Together", and [...] "Act of Contrition", though he {{remained}} uncredited. [...] Prince and Madonna also worked together on the track [...] "Love Song". The song was recorded at Prince's Studio on Paisley Park; [...] "We were friends and talked about working together, so I went to Minneapolis to write some stuff with him, {{but the only thing}} I really dug was 'Love Song' [...] We ended up writing it long-distance, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be in L.A. and he couldn't leave Minneapolis, and quite frankly I couldn't stand Minneapolis. When I went there, it was like 20 degrees below zero, and it was really desolate. I was miserable and I couldn't write or work under those circumstances", Madonna recalled. [...] For the artwork, the singer chose to work with photographer Herb Ritts. Initially, photos from the session with Ritts were also to be used for the lead single's packaging. For the photoshoot, she decided to dye her blonde hair brown; she commented [...] "I love blonde hair, but it really does something different to you. I feel more grounded when I have dark hair. It's unexplainable. I also feel more Italian when my hair is dark". The cover art features a close-up of the singer's jean-clad midsection and bare midriff. The cover has been seen as a reference to Sticky Fingers by The Rolling Stones. The packaging on the first pressings of the CD, cassette, and LP were scented with patchouli oils to simulate church incense. [...] A publicist for Warner Bros. Records revealed this had been the singer's idea; [...] "She wanted to create a flavor of the 60's and the church. She wanted to create a sensual feeling you could hear and smell". Initial pressings also included an insert with safe sex guidelines and a warning about the dangers of AIDS, to which Madonna had lost friends. Its inclusion was decided after Warner Bros. had agreed to release an album by stand-up comedian Sam Kinison the year before, although he had stated that AIDS came from gay men involved in bestiality. Madonna dedicated the album to [...] "My mother, who taught me how to pray".|$|E
