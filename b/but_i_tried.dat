500|$|England {{experienced}} {{another surprise}} upset under Winterbottom's guidance in 1953 when Hungary defeated England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. [...] Winterbottom said afterwards, [...] "...The press tended {{to think we}} would win easily, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{to point out that}} the Hungarians were actually a great side." [...] He guided England to first place in the 1954 British Home Championship, which qualified the team for the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, but saw his side knocked out in the quarter-finals, going down 4–2 against Uruguay. Four wins from four matches enabled England's qualification for the 1958 World Cup only for Winterbottom's side to fail in the group play-off stage, losing 1–0 to USSR. [...] England lost to Brazil in the quarter-final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and, under attack from the British press, Winterbottom resigned five months later. [...] He remains the longest serving manager of England.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as the}} Emperor, and a general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were first explored with the script for the two-part [...] "Kitumba". Writer John Meredith Lucas said that [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to think of what the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on." [...] While the episode itself was later filmed for the fan production , Star Trek first visited the Klingon homeworld in The Next Generation episode [...] "", and the themes would be revisited through the series.|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E

500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred {{to a lot of the}} lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang any words on the cassettes I got <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's nothing worse than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E
500|$|Jesse Eisenberg's {{breakthrough}} {{starring role}} was in Zombieland. The horror-comedy, which saw him with Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin on a roadtrip through a post-zombie apocalypse America, was a sleeper hit. In 2010, he portrayed Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg {{in the film}} The Social Network, for which he earned the Best Actor Award from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and nominations for Best Actor at the BAFTA Awards, Golden Globes, and Academy Awards. According to the film's director, David Fincher, both he and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin knew Eisenberg was the one for the role {{as soon as they}} watched his audition tape, despite Eisenberg's own anxieties about his audition. On November 22, 2010, Eisenberg was honored, along with Whoopi Goldberg, Joycelyn Engle, and Harvey Krueger, at the Children at Heart Celebrity Dinner Gala and Fantasy Auction, to benefit the children of the Chernobyl disaster. Steven Spielberg is Chair of the event each year. On January 29, 2011, Eisenberg hosted Saturday Night Live on NBC, with musical guest Nicki Minaj. During his opening monologue, Zuckerberg himself appeared. Eisenberg said that meeting the man he portrayed on-screen was [...] "an overwhelming experience," [...] and was happy that [...] "we were both able to have fun at the situation." [...] Zuckerberg, who has been a vocal disser on the artistic licenses taken by The Social Network, would later say that he thought Eisenberg [...] "was a little afraid to meet me after his portrayal, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to be nice." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards Spinks said: [...] "I came {{to fight}} like I said I would. I {{just tried to}} do what I knew I had to do, and that was fight. Not that I stood toe to toe with him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round. So I went out and knocked him out in the first round. And later I found out he was fooling." [...] Tyson dedicated the win to Jimmy Jacobs, who had died in March.|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} the tour as an audiovisual storybook, sharing her life experience through {{the evolution of}} her music. Catherine McHugh of Entertainment Design reports [...] "Part of the reason Janet Jackson titled her latest record The Velvet Rope was to criticize barriers that separate different classes in society. So {{from the beginning of}} her show, Jackson strives to prove her accessibility to her audience. The spectacular opening presents Jackson's life—at least professionally—as an open book." [...] The stage was designed by Mark Fisher, saying [...] "She wanted to have a book opening and herself come out of it. So I finessed that book into the video screen." [...] Fisher explained, [...] "Each different scene in the show would be akin to turning the pages in this book, and all the albums that she'd done in the past—Control, Rhythm Nation, janet.—would be represented." [...] Regarding its introduction, Fisher said, [...] "The elevator deposits her gracefully, as befits a princess, on the very front of the downstage." [...] "And of course, the entirely cool and wonderful and breaking-new-ground aspect of it is that it's all made possible by a thin LED screen." [...] Roy Bennett stated [...] "We talked about developing the show around the scenarios of her career. I kept that in mind while lighting each different scene, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to do it in an abstract way, without jumping too far away from the overall look of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pippen {{claimed the}} {{starting}} small forward {{position with the}} Portland Trail Blazers in the 1999–2000 NBA season. Playing alongside new stars such as Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith, Pippen continued to demonstrate his defensive capabilities, even past his prime. On January 3, when the Trail Blazers faced the Bulls, Pippen was honored with a video tribute highlighting his best moments in his 11-year career with the Bulls. Pippen later commented on the tribute by saying: [...] "It was very emotional for me, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to handle {{it as well as}} possible realizing I had a game to play. It was something that brought back a lot of memories for me, a lot of things I miss about this city, playing in this arena." [...] Under Head coach Mike Dunleavy, the Trail Blazers posted a 59–23 record and clinched the second spot in the Pacific Division and the third spot in the Western Conference. Pippen played and started in all 82 games that season, averaging 12.5 points per game, 5 assists and 6.3 rebounds per game. In {{the first round of the}} 2000 NBA Playoffs, Portland defeated the Minnesota Timberwolves 3 games to 1. Their opponents in the second round were the Utah Jazz. In Game 5, while leading the series 3–1, with 12.6 seconds remaining and Portland trailing by 2, Pippen inbounded the ball to Damon Stoudamire who returned it to Pippen, who hit a three pointer with 7.3 seconds remaining. The Jazz fouled Pippen on the next play, and he stepped to the line and made one of two free throws to give the Blazers a 81–79 lead. Bryon Russell of the Jazz attempted a game-winning three-pointer but threw the shot off balance, which resulted in an air ball. The Trail Blazers won the series 4–1 and advanced to the Western Conference Finals. There they faced the Los Angeles Lakers, coached under Phil Jackson, Pippen's former coach in Chicago. The series was stretched to a deciding Game 7, in which the Trail Blazers held a 15-point lead in the 4th quarter. However, led by the All-Star duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal, the Lakers managed to erase Portland's lead and win the game 89–84 and with that also the series. The Lakers proceeded to the 2000 NBA Finals where they faced the Indiana Pacers and were eventually crowned the NBA Champions.|$|E
