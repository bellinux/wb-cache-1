50|$|In the 1990s, Stein made a {{sculpture}} series, <b>Blades,</b> <b>fusing</b> machetes with wood, rope, and other materials. These objects looked like weapons, with knife-like edges, that were ancient {{and spoke to}} relationships of power and violence. Stein composed origin stories that undid these associations and offered alternatives, such as defense and empowerment for the user. These were exhibited at the Monmouth County Arts Center, the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Farleigh Dickinson University, SoHo 20, and the Jamaica Arts Center, among other venues.|$|R

5000|$|Unofficially, the [...] "low-profile mini" [...] fuse is {{sometimes}} incorrected called [...] "micro" [...] since the term means smaller than mini, but recently fuses using the micro name have been released. Regular blade-type fuses, {{also known as}} standard fuses, were developed in 1976 for low voltage use in motor vehicles. The mini fuses were developed in the 1990s. <b>Blade</b> type <b>fuses</b> can be mounted in fuse blocks, in-line fuse holders, or fuse clips.|$|R
5000|$|When {{controlling}} the Dark Prince, the player loses {{the ability to}} wield a secondary weapon, instead using the [...] "Daggertail", a <b>bladed</b> whip <b>fused</b> to his arm. This allows medium range combat moves and new interactions with the environment. The Dark Prince also constantly loses health {{as a result of}} the semi-transformation, with eventual death from the loss. He goes back to full health whenever he collects Sand, from either a monster or object. Also, his Daggertail gives him a different button combination for speed kills, in which he strangles his victims. Coming into contact with water allows the Prince to return to normal.|$|R
5|$|Kisuke's {{story begins}} with him {{suffering}} amnesia {{and on the}} run from his former ninja comrades. Returning to Edo to discover the truth in the company of Yuzuruha, he accidentally breaks an ancient seal keeping damned souls at bay. Defeating the monsters they manifest as, he learns from his mollified ninja companions and their employer Yukinojo that he was part of a mission to steal the Kuzuryu Demon Blade from Momohime's Nakurami Clan and punish them for defying the shogun's order to surrender it, which in turn was tied in with Yukinojo's intentions in marrying Momohime. Yukinojo sends Kisuke against Torahime, Momohime's sister and the shrine maiden in charge of keeping the Kuzuryu's power in check. Pursuing her, Kisuke fights both Torahime and undead soldiers loyal to her family. In pursuit of her, he faces agents who are preserving the flow of magic energy to Mount Fuji, including a young Yamabushi. His battles awaken his memories: he was originally disguised as a servant in Torahime's household as part of Yukinojo's scheme to destroy her family, but fell in love with Torahime and attempted to betray his ninja comrades when stealing the Kuzuryu. Dying from his wounds, the spirit of Senju Oboroya, the creator of the Oboro Style that controls the Demon <b>Blades,</b> <b>fused</b> with Kisuke to save his life and pass on the Oboro Style to someone who would use it for good. The fusion triggered Kisuke's amnesia, but left him with the ability to wield Demon Blades without succumbing to their evil.|$|R

40|$|Self-fluxed {{nickel alloys}} are usually flame fused after thermal spraying. However, {{due to the}} {{practical}} aspects of high temperatures reached during flame fusing, large structures such as the hydraulic turbines for power generation, can not be efficiently coated. An alternative is to fuse the sprayed coating with a gas tungsten electric arc. In this case, heating is much more intensive and substrate temperature {{during and after the}} fusing operation is much lower, thus reducing the possibility that any problem will occur. In this work, coatings of self-fluxed nickel alloy fused by flame and gas tungsten arc were evaluated as protection of hydraulic turbines against cavitational damage. Several tests were performed, including the ASTM ultrasonically vibration-induced cavitation, optical and scanning electronic microscopic metallography, and hardness tests. The results showed that the arc-fused coating presented better cavitation damage resistance, probably due to its finer microstructure. A field application of this new technique is also described. A self-fluxed Ni alloy was flame sprayed in critical regions of Francis-type hydraulic turbine <b>blades</b> and <b>fused</b> by a gas tungsten arc after spraying. The blades will be inspected during the next two years...|$|R
40|$|In 1969 I published, {{together}} with P. G. Heinsbroek, {{a paper on}} the anatomy of the stamens of Victoria amazonica. The flowers used in that study came from plants which were cultivated in the green-house of the Leiden Botanic Garden. Because the possibility could not be excluded that the structures then observed were partly the effect of greenhouse conditions, I subsequently {{took the opportunity to}} study flowers of well developed plants, which were cultivated in the open air under the tropical conditions of the Botanic Garden at Bogor*). The results were exactly the same. Apart from the set of central vascular bundles, normal in laminar structures, there proved to be a peripheral sheath of bundles consisting of abaxial bundles, terminating half way up the stamen, as well as adaxial bundles. All bundles run parallel and the central ones branch upwards into the fertile region of the stamen. The adaxial bundles anastomose {{at the lower end of}} the pollen sacs and one of the resulting anastomoses pursues its course in the middle between the thecae. In literature the last mentioned vascular bundle had been named the ‘auxiliary vein’ (Moseley, 1958). Its position is opposed to the normal median vein, and its xylem pole is inverted. This vein played a role in diverse morphological opinions on the flat stamens. American authors (Eames, 1961), who advocated the primitiveness of laminar stamen structure, disposed of the auxiliary vein by considering it as an insignificant vein. Schneider (1976) thinks the peripheral bundle system is explicable in functional terms. On the other hand, the discovery of the opposed median auxiliary vein was welcomed by authors like Leinfellner (1956), who thought, mainly on the ground of teratology, that the stamens are diplophyllous structures, that is consist of a dorsal and a ventral <b>blade</b> <b>fused</b> medianly. By this view the existence of apparently homogeneous laminar stamens in Ranales had been difficult to explain. However, now the auxiliary vein could be considered as the median vascular bundle of the <b>fused</b> ventral <b>blade,</b> as requested by the theory. Meeuse (1972) took up the suggestion brought forward in our paper of 1969, namely that the stamen vasculature consisted of a bract component (the abaxial bundles) and a flattened axis component (the central and adaxial bundles), in analogy with the Coniferous female cone scale. According to Meeuse this is proof of his thesis that the structure of the stamen in the Ranales is a bract amalgamated with an axial system. However, careful comparison with the results of Cécile Lemoine-Sebastian (a. o. 1972) show that the vascular patterns are different from a situation as described above...|$|R
25|$|Fossils of Confuciusornis {{show that}} it had an {{exceptionally}} large humerus (upper arm bone). Near its shoulder-end this was equipped with a prominent deltopectoral crest. Characteristically this crista deltopectoralis was with Confuciusornis pierced by an oval hole which may have reduced the bone's weight or enlarged the attachment area of the flight miscles. The furcula or wishbone, like that of Archaeopteryx, was a simple curved bar lacking a pointed process at the back, a hypocleidum. The sternum (breastbone) was relatively broad and had a low keel which was raised at the back end. This bony keel {{may or may not}} have anchored a larger, cartilaginous, keel for enlarged pectoral muscles. The scapulae (shoulder <b>blades)</b> were <b>fused</b> to the strut-like coracoid bones and may have formed a solid base for the attachment of wing muscles. The orientation of the shoulder joint was sideways, instead of angled upward as in modern birds; this means that Confuciusornis was unable to lift its wings high above its back. According to a study by Phil Senter in 2006, the joint was even pointed largely downwards meaning that the humerus could not be lifted above the horizontal. This would make Confuciusornis incapable of the upstroke required for flapping flight; the same would have been true for Archaeopteryx.|$|R
2500|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic girdles of the holotype specimen {{were noted}} as missing by 1906, but observations about these elements were since been made {{based on the}} original descriptions and figures from the late 19th century. The shoulder <b>blades</b> (scapulae) were <b>fused</b> and met at the midline, bearing no trace of a median bar. The upper processes of the shoulder blades were very broad, and the [...] "necks" [...] of the shoulder blades were long. The pectoral girdle had a long bar, a supposedly advanced feature thought to be absent from juvenile plesiosaurs. The ischia, a pair of bones that formed part of the pelvis, were joined at the middle, so that a medial bar was present {{along the length of}} the pelvis, a feature usually not found in plesiosaurs. Like other elasmosaurids (and plesiosaurs in general), Elasmosaurus would have had large, paddle-like limbs with very long digits. The paddles at the front (the pectoral paddles) were longer than those at the back (the pelvic paddles).|$|R
