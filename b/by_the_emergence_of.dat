According to Scottish transfer regulations the loan deal was invalid, so instead he was swiftly transferred on a permanent basis for an undisclosed fee, later revealed by Gunn to have been £25,000.|$|E

5|$|After Sri Lanka {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1948, the ACTC decided {{to merge with}} the ruling United National Party (UNP). This move was not supported by half of the ACTC members and resulted in a splitone half of the party decided to merge with the UNP {{and the other half}} decided to leave the party altogether, forming a new Tamil party in 1949, the Federal party. Policies adopted by successive Sinhalese governments, and the 1956 success of the Sinhala Nationalist government under Solomon Bandaranaike, made the Federal Party the main voice of Tamil politics. Increased racial and political tension between the two communities led to the merger of all Tamil political parties into the Tamil United Liberation Front. This was followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> a militant, armed form of Tamil nationalism.|$|E

One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when World War I broke out, she served as a guard ship at various regions around Northern England until late 1915.

5|$|The {{national}} anthem is frequently played at sign-ons and sign-offs of TV {{and radio stations}} in Singapore, but that use of the anthem has declined somewhat <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> 24-hour TV channels and radio stations. Media Corporation of Singapore's Channel 5, Channel 8 and Channel NewsAsia, for example, played the anthem just before 6:00 am daily to signal the start of their respective channel's broadcast day; while all of its owned radio stations begin their day by playing the abridged version of the anthem (consisting of the first six bars) at exactly 6:00 am, except Malay station Warna 94.2FM which plays it at 5:00 am {{as a way of}} protecting the protocol from reaching the Islamic Azan Subuh (which occurs between around 5:25 and 5:58 am).|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{started the}} 1996–97 season well, {{and by the}} turn of the year they were top of the league, two points clear of Arsenal. The club were unable to {{maintain}} their form during the rest of the season, losses to Coventry City, Manchester United and Wimbledon resulted in the club finishing the season in fourth position. Despite early exits in the League and FA Cup, Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were unable to progress after a 3–0 defeat in the first-leg, despite winning the second leg 2–0 and were knocked out 3–2 on aggregate against French team Paris Saint-Germain. Liverpool were without striker Fowler for the start of the 1997–98 season after he suffered knee ligament damage in a pre-season friendly. This was offset <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> Michael Owen, who scored eighteen goals from thirty-six appearances. Paul Ince was signed to replace Barnes who joined Newcastle United. Liverpool were unable to challenge eventual winners Arsenal and finished thirteen points behind in third place. Further redevelopment took place at Anfield during the season with a second tier added to the Anfield Road stand.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a bee, be it a solitary or social species, {{involves}} the laying of an egg, the development through several moults of a legless larva, a pupation stage during which the insect undergoes complete metamorphosis, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> a winged adult. Most solitary bees and bumble bees in temperate climates overwinter as adults or pupae and emerge in spring when increasing numbers of flowering plants come into bloom. The males usually emerge first and search for females with which to mate. The sex of a bee is determined by {{whether or not the}} egg is fertilised; after mating, a female stores the sperm, and determines which sex is required at the time each individual egg is laid, fertilised eggs producing female offspring and unfertilised eggs, males. Tropical bees may have several generations in a year and no diapause stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of another aviary and captive reproduction center was considered throughout 2013, with {{the municipalities of}} Maricao and Isabela being analyzed. In November 2013, plans {{for the establishment of}} a third population in the Maricao State Forest were formally announced. The following month, ten amazons were released at Río Abajo. 2013 set a new record for the reproduction program, which produced 51 fledglings and shattered the previous record of 34 that was established in 2011. The wild population grew by 15 chicks, an improvement from the 12 born during the previous year. During this time frame, the known number of amazon specimens rounded 500 individuals. A severe drought caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> El Niño began during the spring of 2015 and extended throughout the summer, benefitting the breeding of the amazons in El Yunque by extending their reproductive season. However, this weather pattern also increased the number of mongooses present in the forest, representing a risk for the population. On August 13, 2015, a group of 25 amazons was moved from the other aviaries to a repurposed installation in Maricao. Each member was brought individually in order to ensure their safety while being transported and later placed in an acclimation program that is expected to last a year, before they are released to create a new population in the region.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary version Please do not quote. This paper {{investigates the}} factors {{influencing}} <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> {{a particular type}} of self-regulated hybrid institutions: the agricultural marketing boards. We expand on the perspectives of two strands of new institutional theory that provide insights on <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> institutions. One of these strands is concerned by private ordering while the other focuses on public enforcement. The paper adds to <b>the</b> existing literature <b>by</b> examining <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> institutions that stand in between these two polar orders. We illustrate our propositions <b>by</b> analyzing <b>the</b> <b>emergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> industrial milk marketing board in Québec (Canada) in order to shed light on the factors that limited cooperative contracting and that consequently carried out to resorts of a dual institutional nature. The analysis is supported by empirical data from the milk industry in the province of Québec in Canada...|$|R
