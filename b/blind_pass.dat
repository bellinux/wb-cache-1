25|$|In a {{time when}} defense was defined as “an individual's effort to stop or stymie the {{opposing}} team's counterpart”, Toyota's playing style {{was considered one of}} the most glamorous and worthy to watch. With team defense hardly known back then, Toyota was a typical run-and-gun team that depended heavily on their rebounding prowess. Hence, when you have an Andrew Fields, Bruce King, John Irving, Abe King, Ramon Fernandez and even a Bobby Jaworski collaring the rebounds, the most common (and very entertaining) spectacle was to see a baseball pass by the rebounder to a streaking player on the break for an easy twinner. Notables among the recipients of the baseball pass over the years in the Toyota lineup included Segura, Cortez, Tuadles, Arnaiz, and Legaspi. In the halfcourt, it was not uncommon to see a similar play that Fernandez and Jaworski employed in the recent Crispa-Toyota reunion game where Fernandez would post up, Jaworski would stay at the top of the arc and wait for Fernandez to be double-teamed. Once the double team is consummated, Jaworski either waits at the 3 point line or makes a straight cut in the middle of the lanes waiting for the <b>blind</b> <b>pass</b> of Fernandez for an easy two. Another common sight was to see Jaworski mapping out the play, cuts in the middle and makes the interior defense commit to him. He then throws a behind-the-back <b>blind</b> <b>pass</b> to cutting slotmen like Fernandez or King for an easy layup or throws it back to good buddy Arnaiz for a long range bomb shot from the arc. Hence, it wasn't a surprise to see Jaworski, Arnaiz and Fernandez (in that order) being the first 3 PBA players to dish off 2,000 assists in their careers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Miami drove 74 yards {{and tied it}} at 24, with Strock's 15-yard {{touchdown}} completion to Rose. San Diego countered with a 6-play, 60-yard drive to score on Fouts' 25-yard touchdown completion to tight end Kellen Winslow. But Miami re-tied the game with Strock completing six consecutive passes, the last a 50-yard score to Bruce Hardy. Then Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood's interception set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Nathan, giving Miami their first lead of the game, 38–31, on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, with Miami just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers safety Pete Shaw recovered a fumble from Andra Franklin on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 {{seconds left in the}} game, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a <b>blind</b> <b>pass</b> intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but went right into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game.|$|E
500|$|Brazil played Italy in {{the final}} at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pelé scored the opening goal with a header over Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. He then made assists on Brazil's third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth {{finished}} by Carlos Alberto. The last goal {{of the game is}} often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team's outfield players. The play culminated after Pelé made a <b>blind</b> <b>pass</b> that went into Carlos Alberto's running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament.

The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as Stephen Curry, Pete Maravich, Isiah Thomas, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Jason Kidd, Rajon Rondo, Michael Jordan, John Stockton, Ricky Rubio, Jason Williams, and Steve Nash.

50|$|Ramage {{inadvertently}} {{became a}} part of history in his first season in Colorado. While the Rockies were playing the New York Islanders, the Rockies' goaltender left the ice for an extra skater after a delayed penalty was called on the Islanders. Before the penalty was called, the puck deflected off the chest protector of Islanders goaltender Billy Smith into the corner. Ramage picked up the puck and made a <b>blind</b> <b>pass</b> from the corner boards in the opposing zone to the blue line. Nobody was there to receive the pass, and so the puck sailed {{all the way down the}} length of the ice and into the Colorado net. Smith had been the last Islander to touch the puck, and so he became the first NHL goalie ever to be credited with a goal.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{was also}} the first NHL goaltender to be {{credited}} with scoring a goal.
