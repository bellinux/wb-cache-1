25|$|All Canadian {{nurses and}} {{prospective}} nurses are heavily {{encouraged by the}} Canadian Nurses Association {{to continue their education}} to receive a <b>baccalaureate</b> <b>degree.</b> They believe that this is the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a <b>baccalaureate</b> <b>degree</b> will be less likely to make small errors because they have a higher level of education. A <b>baccalaureate</b> <b>degree</b> also gives a nurse a more critical opinion, which gives him or her more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces and territories except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a <b>baccalaureate</b> <b>degree.</b> The basic length of time that it takes to obtain a <b>baccalaureate</b> <b>degree</b> is four years.
