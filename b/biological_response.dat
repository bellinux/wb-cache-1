5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum <b>biological</b> <b>response</b> of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum <b>biological</b> <b>response.</b> Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

25|$|Cannabinoids usually {{contain a}} 1,1'-di-methyl-pyran ring, a variedly derivatized {{aromatic}} ring and a variedly unsaturated cyclohexyl ring and their immediate chemical precursors, constituting {{a family of}} about 60 bi-cyclic and tri-cyclic compounds. Like most other neurological processes, the effects of cannabis on the brain follow the standard protocol of signal transduction, the electrochemical system of sending signals through neurons for a <b>biological</b> <b>response.</b> It is now understood that cannabinoid receptors appear in similar forms in most vertebrates and invertebrates and have a long evolutionary history of 500 million years. The binding of cannabinoids to cannabinoid receptors decrease adenylyl cyclase activity, inhibit calcium N channels, and disinhibit K+A channels. There {{are at least two}} types of cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2).|$|E
25|$|The {{nutrients}} from an OTEC discharge could potentially cause increased biological activity if they accumulate {{in large quantities}} in the photic zone. In 2011 a biological component {{was added to the}} hydrodynamic computer model to simulate the <b>biological</b> <b>response</b> to plumes from 100 megawatt OTEC plants. In all cases modeled (discharge at 70 meters depth or more), no unnatural variations occurs in the upper 40 meters of the ocean's surface. The picoplankton response in the 110 - 70 meter depth layer is approximately a 10-25% increase, which is well within naturally occurring variability. The nanoplankton response is negligible. The enhanced productivity of diatoms (microplankton) is small. The subtle phytoplankton increase of the baseline OTEC plant suggests that higher-order biochemical effects will be very small.|$|E
500|$|A {{receptor}} antagonist {{is a type}} of [...] receptor ligand or {{drug that}} blocks or dampens a <b>biological</b> <b>response</b> by binding to and blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. They are sometimes called blockers; examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In pharmacology, antagonists have affinity but no efficacy for their cognate receptors, and binding will disrupt the interaction and inhibit the function of an agonist or inverse agonist at receptors. Antagonists mediate their effects by binding to the active site or to the allosteric site on a receptor, or they may interact at unique binding sites not normally involved in the biological regulation of the receptor's activity. Antagonist activity may be reversible or irreversible depending on the longevity of the antagonist–receptor complex, which, in turn, depends on the nature of antagonist–receptor binding. The majority of drug antagonists achieve their potency by competing with endogenous ligands or substrates at structurally defined binding sites on receptors.|$|E

40|$|Purpose Consecutive 12 -hr workdays can {{contribute}} to increased stress and fatigue and negative <b>biological</b> <b>responses</b> in nurses, potentially compromising quality of patient care and safety. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to assess changes in stress, fatigue, and <b>biological</b> <b>responses</b> (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) over three consecutive 12 -hr workdays in acute care nurses and how stress and social resources function in predicting fatigue and <b>biological</b> <b>responses.</b> Methods In a prospective study, 81 acute care nurses completed questionnaires and provided saliva samples four times: pre-shifts and post-shifts of day 1 and day 3. Results Although stress and <b>biological</b> <b>responses</b> did not change, fatigue increased significantly from pre-shift day 1 to post-shift day 3, particularly in night shift nurses. Stress measured with a visual analog scale significantly predicted fatigue at the end of day 1 and day 3. High social resources buffered negative impact of stress on fatigue of day 1. Conclusion Fatigue increased over consecutive workdays and stress can influence fatigue in acute care nurses. Social resources, on the other hand, may buffer the negative impact of stress on fatigue. Focused research is necessary to assess the effects of stress on fatigue and patient safety issues over consecutive workdays, incorporating <b>biological</b> <b>responses</b> in nurses at various settings.
