Methods: Thirty-three subjects with 65 {{years of age or}} older, with no voice or hearing disorder complaints, and with good self-perceived general health participated in the study. All participants filled in a vocal self-evaluation questionnaire. The sustained vowel /ε / was recorded in three distinct moments: the first, denominated habitual (H), based on the subject’s regular production; the second, usage (U), after one minute of continuous spontaneous conversation; the third, exercise (E), carried out after a one-minute execution of the SOVTE. After the exercise, the subjects self-evaluated the changes perceived in their voices. The recordings were edited and randomly paired, considering two moments of the same subject: H/U; H/E and U/E, for further perceptual examination of the better production by three specialized speech-language pathologists. Results: There were no differences between H and U (p= 0. 199) and between U and E (p= 0. 773). However, the E production was considered better than the H production (p= 0. 004). In the vocal self-evaluation, most subjects (n= 25, 75. 8 %) did not observe immediate effects in their voices after the exercise. Conclusion: The SOVTE produced positive immediate effects on the vocal quality of elderly subjects, observed only at the perceptual-auditory evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Session - Parkinson's disease: Non-motor symptoms: {{abstract}} no. 288 OBJECTIVE: The {{current study}} adopted a randomized control trial (RCT) design {{to investigate the}} impact of expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) on vocal loudness and sustained phonation performance in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). BACKGROUND: With muscle rigidity and hypokinesia associated with the respiratory system, PD patients exhibit upper airway obstruction (UAO) that hinders normal breathing. Speaking with clear voice can be greatly affected and the problems worsen as the disease progresses. About 80 % of individuals with PD were diagnosed with hypokinetic dysarthria featured with reduced vocal loudness and monotonous speech which could significantly diminish patients’ ability in effective communication. Expiratory muscle strength training (EMST) has been available to improve expiratory driving force for both ventilatory and non-ventilatory actions. Previous studies showed its effects in improving voluntary cough in PD as well as increased maximum phonation time (MPT) for individuals with dysarthria. Seeing the improvement in volitional cough in PD patients, the potential use of EMST in facilitating PD speech and voice was then furthered explored in the present study. METHODS: Maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), sound pressure level (SPL), and MPT were obtained from 40 individuals with PD before and after EMST program. PD participants were randomly assigned into EMST group and sham group. Those in the EMST group were provided a small device, EMST 150, for training administered by an experienced speech therapist, while participants in sham group were provided a spirometer without any loading (placebo). During the training, participants were instructed to blow through the EMST device (loading set at 75 % of MEP) as hard and fast as possible after a maximum inhalation, followed by a rest for 15 - 30 seconds before the next blowing resumed. The training protocol was: 5 blowing repetitions per set, 5 sets a day for 20 days in a 4 -week period. RESULTS: MEP, SPL and MPT were significantly increased for EMST group while no significant changes were seen in Sham group. The data indicate that EMST training can effectively improve phonatory performance in PD patients with compromised respiratory output. CONCLUSIONS: Vocal loudness and sustained phonation improved for EMST program but not <b>blowing</b> <b>exercise.</b> Individuals with PD can speak with louder voice after an expiratory muscle strength training program...|$|E

40|$|Aging is {{associated}} impaired endothelial {{function in the}} skeletal muscle vasculature which contributes to decreased ability to increase muscle <b>blow</b> during <b>exercise.</b> This endothelial dysfunction is mediated, primarily, by impairments in the nitric oxide (NO) pathway in the skeletal muscle vasculature. The major purpose of this dissertation {{is to determine the}} mechanisms that mediate age-related endothelial dysfunction in rat soleus feed artery (SFA) and determine whether exercise training ameliorates this impairment in endothelial function. Therefore in these series of studies we sought to test three major hypotheses: 1) That exercise training reverses age-related decrements in endothelium-dependent dilation in SFA and that this improved endothelium-dependent dilation is the result of increased NO bioavailability due to increased content and phosphorylation of eNOS and/or increased antioxidant enzyme content; 2) That age-related endothelial dysfunction in rat SFA is mediated in part, by NAD(P) H oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS); 3) and, that impaired endothelium-dependent dilation in senescent SFA is due to an impaired potential for p-eNOSser 1177. To test these hypotheses, SFA from young (4 month) and old (24 month) Fischer 344 rats were isolated for either determination of endothelium-dependent and ?independent dilations or biochemical analyses. Results from these investigations suggest that 1) exercise training reverses the detrimental effects of aging on endothelial function in skeletal muscle feed arteries by enhancing the capacity to scavenge superoxide, increasing the bioavailability of NO; 2) ROS contribute to impaired endothelium-dependent dilation in old SFA; whereas, ROS appear {{to play a role in}} ACh-mediated dilation in SFA from young rats; 3) and, that the PI 3 kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) /eNOS pathway is preserved with age...|$|R
40|$|Heart or lung failure: {{what causes}} exertional, high altitude, and cold {{immersion}} pulmonary oedema? Most cardiologists regard the normal heart as an organ that cannot be damaged by physiological loads. The normal heart, they would claim, cannot fail from overwork or fatigue provided it is supplied with sufficient fuel and oxygen. It pumps {{out what is}} returned to it and adjusts its output to the preload (filling volume and pressure) and afterload (peripheral resistance) without suddenly failing. Failure occurs from the heart dilating and raising its filling pressure and the pulmonary venous and capillary pressures to levels where the lungs fill with fluid. Sucking and blowing The amphibian heart can suck as well as blow. Filling of the left ventricle in diastole {{may not be as}} passive as pressure measurements would suggest. An isolated frog's left ventricle with the atria and valves removed and placed in a bath of nutrient oxygenated Ringer solution continues to beat normally for some time. Each time the ventricle contracts it pushes fluid out through the outflow tract and jets backwards, but in diastole it does not remain stationary, as would be expected if it filled passively, but creeps forwards as the ventricle sucks in the fluid. Whether the human heart sucks as well as blows at rest, and indeed whether it sucks as well as <b>blows</b> on maximum <b>exercise</b> is debatable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This project {{presents}} {{a case of}} an individual who was limited in his participation and mobility on an SCI unit {{due to the nature}} of his spinal cord injury. He, like many people with acute spinal cord injuries, are restricted to bed or sitting for long periods of time with minimal activity causing cardiopulmonary endurance issues and musculoskeletal weakness. These two problems for patients with spinal cord injury often lead to pulmonary complications causing respiratory secretions and infection of the pulmonary system. This individual case answers the following PICO question via evidence-based analysis: Does balloon therapy as a respiratory muscle training technique, added to standard of care physical therapy for patients with a spinal cord injury, improve outcomes? Background: Physical therapy for patients with spinal cord injury often focuses on transfer training, upper extremity strengthening and endurance, stretching for range of motion, and sometimes work on ambulation. It is not often physical therapists who work with patients with spinal cord injury focus on respiratory training improvements. Respiratory issues for this population as explained by Schilero, et al., (2009), "remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality"(p. 130). Physical therapists have the time with these patients and the knowledge to intervene and help decrease the risk of these patients acquiring a pulmonary/respiratory complication. Adding a respiratory muscle training intervention, like balloon blowing, can be a highly beneficial exercise for patients with spinal cord injury. Case Description: Patient W is a 64 -year-old hispanic male with history of low back pain and L 1 discectomy in 2014. In 2015, patient W complained of low back pain near the site of his discectomy. An MRI was performed and found a ventral epidural abscess, L 1 -L 2 discitis, and multiloculated left psoas abscess. The MRI also found osteomyelitis had completely degenerated his L 3 vertebrae. This led to his recent spinal cord injury of incomplete paraplegia, and an ASIA C. Patient W was given precautions of only allowed to sit upright for 2 hours with the need of TLSO for support and no axial loading. He was sent to ABQ VA SCI unit and referred to PT for strengthening and endurance issues. Outcomes: A review of the literature shows respiratory muscle training in spinal cord injury patients does have a positive effect on pulmonary outcomes, but more research does need to be done. It also shows there are multiple ways to do this training. It can be done with different devices and expiratory and inspiratory training can be provided. Performing both with a patient who has a spinal cord injured is more appropriate as both muscle groups are necessary to have a good pulmonary/respiratory system. Improving pulmonary outcomes like Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1), Total Lung Capacity (TLC), Vital Capacity (VC), Maximum Inspiratory Pressure (MIP), and Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP) can help these patients have more efficient pulmonary/respiratory systems. These improvements can lead to a more productive cough thus decreasing the risks of acquiring pulmonary complications, like pneumonia. Research also shows that physical therapists spend a large amount of time with these patients working on strength, mobility, and wheelchair mobility but do not often incorporate respiratory training into their interventions. Discussion: This case presentation describes a patient with a L 1 -L 2 spinal cord injury but due to necessary precautions was limited in his mobility and ability to exercise his pulmonary system. The focus of this search was to understand if respiratory muscle training through balloon <b>blowing</b> <b>exercises</b> could help improve his overall outcomes. The research for balloon blowing therapy is very limited and only has case reports and anecdotal evidence to support it. The topic of respiratory muscle training has more evidence, but still needs a greater amount of higher quality studies to solidify its use with spinal cord injury patients to improve pulmonary outcomes. Some studies report that expiratory muscle training is best for improving cough production in these patients and some report inspiratory training is better to improve efficiency of breathing. One study reports that performing both types of training is necessary in spinal cord injury population to attain an efficient and healthy pulmonary/respiratory system in SCI patients. Physical therapists dedicate most treatment time with these patients to strength and mobility improvement to increase the patient's participation in every day life. Adding respiratory muscle training could help improve patient participation further as well as keep them from acquiring respiratory illnesses better than present standard of care physical therapy alone...|$|R
