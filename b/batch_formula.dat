40|$|The main {{motivation}} of this thesis is {{to study the}} long standing problem of mixed alkali effect (MAE) in oxyfluro vanadate glass systems {{from the point of}} view of structural arrangement and to investigate the effect of two rare earth ions, namely, erbium and europium on the structure of tellurium dioxide based glass. In glass science, it is well known that when one alkali in a glass matrix is gradually replaced by another alkali, leads to a non-linear variation in some of the physical properties. There are many a theories trying to explain this effect. Recently the renewed interest lies in explaining MAE in-terms of structural consideration. Rare earth (RE) ion doped glasses are of interest in a variety of applications in photonics because of the special optical properties exhibited by these materials. Atomic like f-f transitions of RE ions depend on the local environment of the these ions. A particular glass matrix may be able to bring out the optical properties of a RE ion better than the other matrix. In this regard structural characterization of a glass matrix with different RE ions for optical properties is of importance. Spectroscopic tech-niques are best suited to investigate structural arrangement in glasses and in this thesis we have used techniques like Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), impedance, photoluminescence and UV- visible absorption spectroscopies. The thesis comprises of five chapters and an appendix. Chapter 1 consists of brief introduction of general properties of glasses and their behavior under different spectroscopic techniques. Chapter 2 deals with the sample preparation and the experimental techniques used in this work. Chapter 3 elaborates on the Raman and EPR spectroscopic studies on the structural arrangement of the mixed alkali oxyfluro vanadate glass systems. Chapter 4 focuses on the ac and electrical modulus analysis to study the MAE in the above samples. Chapter 5 deals with the optical spectroscopic techniques used to study the compatibility of RE ions (erbium and europium) with the tellurium dioxide based glass matrix. Chapter 1 : Disordered materials pose a challenge to understand their structure mainly because of their random arrangement of the constituent units. In this chapter the glassy systems and the different experimental techniques used to study them are discussed in general. The behavior of glassy systems to the external stimuli in various frequency ranges is highlighted. A short review of mixed alkali effect in glasses mainly covering the advances in the last two decades is given. Brief outline of the theory of Raman, EPR and ac impedance spectroscopy are given. Chapter 2 : This chapter discusses the major experimental techniques used in the thesis to study the glass systems at block diagram level. The Raman and EPR spectrometers are discussed. Experimental technique used in ac impedance measurement is outlined. Different methods of preparing glass are listed and melt quenching technique is discussed in detail. Chapter 3 : This chapter discusses the results and analysis of Raman and EPR study in oxyfluoro vanadate glasses emphasizing MAE. The glass having <b>batch</b> <b>formula</b> 40 V 2 O 5 - 30 BaF 2 - (30 - x) LiF - xRbF (x = 0 – 30) is prepared by melt quenching technique. Raman spectroscopic study in back scattering geometry is performed to see the effect of alkali ions on the V – O bond length of VO 6 polyhedra in the glass. The de-convoluted Raman peaks corresponding to V = O and VO 2 are considered and the effect of alkali mixture on these bonds are studied. • The peak shift of V = O and VO 2 bonds shows that V = O is affected only a little by the replacement of lithium (Li) by rubidium (Rb), while VO 2 bond gets affected to a larger extent. • From the peak shift the most probable value of the bond length and the spread in it are estimated. The bond length corresponding to V = O is found to increase and that of VO 2 decrease as a consequence of alkali replacement. • From the FWHM of the corresponding Raman peaks, it is concluded that O - Rb coordination sphere around VO 6 polyhedra is more homogeneous than either O – Li or O - Li /Rb coordination. These results are published in J. Non-Cryst. Solids 370 (2013) 6. EPR studies on the samples are carried out in X band frequency and spin – Hamilto-nian parameters were extracted by simulating and fitting the EPR spectra to experimental data using EasySpin which is a Matlab toolbox. • it is observed that the ratio 4 gjj= 4 g?, which is a measure of tetragonality of octa-hedral crystal symmetry of V 2 O 5, varies non-monotonically with Rb content. • A model based on this observation is proposed. The essential idea of this model is that Rb atoms that are substituted for Li atoms initially prefer terminal positions over planar positions. Continued substitution then replaces planar Li atoms. It is seen that this model of “preferential substitution” explains the observation very well. • Another observation is that the EPR signal intensity, which is due to concentration of V 4 + ions, also shows non-monotonous behavior with Rb content. This is also explained using preferential substitution, taking into consideration the oxidation states of the vanadium ions. • The value of 4 gjj= 4 g?, is a minimum for all rubidium environments around V 2 O 5, which infers that Rb coordination is more symmetric than all Li or Li−Rb. • A good correlation is found between Raman and EPR study of the above system. These results are published in J. Phys. Chem. A 118 (2014) 573. Chapter 4 : The chapter brings out the results of ac conductivity and electrical mod-ulus study of MAE in the glass system mentioned above. The Agilent 4294 A precision impedance analyzer operating in frequency range 40 Hz to 110 MHz, is used for per-forming impedance and capacitance experiments carried out in this thesis. Impedance measurements in our studies are performed in sandwich geometry. • Room temperature dc conductivity shows a decrease as Li is replaced by Rb and reaches its minimum - five orders less than its all Li value at 0. 33 molar fraction of Rb, which is attributed to MAE. This observation is explained using the structural aspect. • Using the linear response theory the number of mobile ions participating in the conduction is estimated. • Imaginary part of the electrical modulus is fitted to Kohlrausch – Williams – Watts (KWW) relation by using a complex nonlinear least squares fitting procedure given by Bergmann. • The stretching parameter b estimated from the above procedure is found to exhibit MAE. The observed variation in b with Rb mole fraction is explained by taking into considerations the contributions from fast and slow processes, and coupling between different relaxing sites. The manuscript is under preparation. Chapter 5 : This chapter illustrates the optical study of RE doped TeO 2 based glasses to determine the suitability of a particular RE ion with a given glass matrix. TeO 2 based glasses having a general formula (in mol %) 65 TeO 2 – 5 BaF 2 – 30 ZnF 2 (TBZ) were prepared by usual melt quenching technique. RE doping was done at the expense of TeO 2. 3 mol % of Eu or Er are added to prepare RE doped glass. Raman, PL, UV-visible absorption studies are carried out on the glass samples. • From the peak shift, intensity variation and FWHM of the Raman spectra of the glass samples it is observed that Eu doped TBZ glass has a greater tendency towards depolymerizing the glass matrix by influencing the conversion of TeO 4 units into the formation of TeO 3 units. • PL spectra of the glass samples shows emission due to different possible transitions. Position of the peak of the de-convoluted spectra shows the position of the particular Stark component and the FWHM is a measure of the inhomogeneous broadening. • The UV-visible absorption spectra are used to calculate the optical density and fitted to the Mott equation to determine the band edge of the glass samples. It is seen that Eu doped TBZ glass has a lesser band gap than that of Er doped glass. The manuscript is submitted to Bul. Mat. Sci.

The following formulae were prepared as a reservoir to be used in <b>batch</b> <b>formulae.</b> Gels: carbopol 934 and carbopol 940 (C. 934 and C. 940); each in three different concentrations was prepared. In addition, emulgels were prepared and thermo sensitive gels utilizing Pluronic F 127 (P. F 127). The physicochemical properties of the drug were characterized by determining the partition coefficients. Subsequently, the prepared formulae were evaluated according to their rheological properties, in vitro release using a USP dissolution tester, in vitro diffusion using Franz's diffusion cells and bioavailability (studied in albino rabbits). All the formulae were manifested as pseudoplastic flow with thixotropy. In general, the viscosity of the prepared formulae increased with increasing the polymer concentrations, and this led to a decline in the percentage of the drug released. From all the formulae that were tested, pluronic F 127 gave the highest drug concentration in rabbits (The highest Cmax and the lowest Tmax) in comparison to the other formulae and the oral commercial formulae.

40|$|Issue: Art glass, {{especially}} products {{produced at}} a studio (hot shop) scale by blowing or casting molten glass, {{represents one of}} the highest value uses for soda-lime glass. The retail value of these glass products is tremendous on a per pound basis. However, these applications are also among the most sensitive both to contaminants that might affect the clarity, and to chemistry that might affect the workability of the glass. This is a critical market barrier for the use of recycled glass. Although virgin raw material costs may appear high compared with recycled glass, in fact they are often {{a small fraction of the}} finished product prices in this application, so any risk associated with using recycled glass obviates against its use.

The contaminated sediment of the former seabed has been disseminated over the surrounding area by strong winds. This deterioration of the ecosystem has created a hazardous situation for the health of approximately 3. 5 million people. This pilot study was undertaken to assist Karakalpak health workers in investigating the degree of exposure to metals, persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and dioxins during the most vulnerable prenatal and postnatal period and to provide guidelines for future research. All subjects came from areas located within 200 km of the southern border of the Aral Sea. Blood was obtained from 18 pregnant women and 28 newborns (cord blood) to determine the levels of metals, lead, cadmium, zinc and selenium and the OCPs alpha-, beta- and gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH; lindane is the product name of gamma -hexachlorocyclohexane), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and isomers and metabolites of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), i. e. op-DDT, pp-DDT, pp-DDE and pp-TDE. Levels of metals were also determined in blood from 28 non-pregnant women. In addition, levels of 17 dioxins were determined in 41 human milk samples and I <b>batch</b> of <b>formula.</b> Information about possible dietary sources of the fat-soluble OCPs and dioxins was obtained from a pooled sample of butter and from seven cottonseed oil samples. A mass-selective detector coupled to a gas chromatograph equipped with a large volume injector was used to analyse the selected OCPs, whereas the dioxins were determined by gas chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The levels of metals in cord and maternal blood were consistent with concentrations observed in European countries. Only three women (7 %) had lead levels greater than 100 ppb. The most notable pollutants in maternal and cord blood were the OCPs, notably HCB, beta -HCH, pp-DDE and the most toxic dioxin, 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD, when calculated as TEQs. A similar pattern was observed in human milk: beta -HCH and pp-DDE levels of more than 1000 ng g(- 1) fat were found in 68 and 43 % of the subjects, respectively. Levels of 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD were six times higher than those observed in Western Europe. Traces of pp-DDE were detected in the <b>batch</b> of <b>formula</b> milk.

Presently, most systems validate formulas one at a time, with little or no interaction between validation of separate formulas.

This paper presents an optimizing compiler for batches of temporal logic formulas. A component of the Carnauba Model Checking System, this compiler addresses the need to handle batches of temporal logic formulas by leveraging the framework common to optimizing programming language compilers. Just as a traditional optimizing compiler attempts to exploit redundancy and other solvable properties in programs to reduce the demand on a runtime system, this compiler exploits similar properties in groups of formulas to reduce the demand on a model checking engine. Optimizations are performed via a set of distinct, interchangeable optimization passes operating on a common intermediate representation. The intermediate representation is capable of representing formulas over the full modal mu-calculus, and the optimization techniques are applicable to any temporal logic that can be translated into the modal mu-calculus. The compiler offers a unified framework for expressing well understood single-formula optimizations as well as numerous inter-formula optimizations that capitalize on redundancy and logical implication. The result is a system that, when applied to a potentially heterogeneous collection of formulas over a common problem domain, is able to measurably reduce the time and space requirements of the subsequent model checking engine...|$|R
40|$|PART I Background: For {{over forty}} years, depolarizing, hyperkalemic cardioplegia {{solutions}} {{have served as}} the standard of care for cardiac surgery. While effective in inducing cardiac arrest, potassium-based solutions are associated {{with an array of}} negative consequences, such as coagulopathies, conduction dysfunction, inflammation, coronary vasoconstriction, myocardial edema, and ischemic injury. Adenosine-lidocaine-magnesium, a non-depolarizing, non-potassium-containing solution, has recently entered the clinical arena. Animal research suggests that this agent may provide a method of diastolic arrest that is as effective as potassium-based cardioplegia but with improved protective benefits. Purpose: The aim is to assess the safety and efficacy of adenosine-lidocaine-magnesium as a cardioplegia solution in terms of overall patient outcomes. Methodology: In June 2014, Banner University Medical Center Tucson became the first American institution to adopt the use of PolarShot (ALM) [...] adenosine-lidocaine-magnesium - as a cardioplegia solution. This one-year, retrospective study compares patients receiving adenosine-lidocaine-magnesium to those receiving high-potassium/low-potassium cardioplegia during adult cardiac surgery. Cases compared in this study include isolated coronary artery bypass, isolated aortic/mitral valve repair/replacement, and combination coronary artery bypass/valve replacement surgery only. A propensity-weighted regression model was used for analysis {{to determine whether or not}} cardioplegia treatment affected clinical outcome. To assess overall clinical outcome, major morbidity and mortality and post-procedural length of stay were chosen as primary endpoints. Results: In terms of treatment (adenosine-magnesium-lidocaine vs. high-potassium/low-potassium), no statistically significant difference was found between groups in regard to major morbidity and mortality event occurrences nor was a significant difference found between post-procedural length of stay. Discussion: After comparing postoperative outcomes between cardioplegia treatment groups, PolarShot (ALM) cardioplegia produced postoperative outcomes that were statistically similar to those of high-potassium/low-potassium cardioplegia. The confidence in these results is limited by low case volume, surgical case variability, and retrospective nature of this study. Conclusion: According to this propensity-weighted regression model, PolarShot (ALM) cardioplegia appears to be a safe and effective alternative to traditional potassium-based cardioplegia for the purpose of adult cardiac surgery. More research, including prospective randomized trials, is necessary to confirm or deny the findings of this study. PART II Background: Historically, surgical cardioplegia compounding was accomplished by filling patient-tailored prescriptions on-demand. Modern day compounding has become a manufacturing process to improve quality and accommodate physician demand. Additionally, sterile compounding standards have become more stringent, further necessitating a standardized compounding approach. In 2013, scrutiny of sterile drug compounding increased with passage of the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA) and subsequent Federal Drug Administration oversight. This federal mandate requires all compounded sterile preparations distributed by 503 B Outsourcing Facilities be tested for potency, stability, and sterility. To accomplish this, compounders must significantly reduce <b>batched</b> <b>formula</b> variability. Purpose: A review of 2014 sales data from a large 503 B outsourcing facility and cardioplegia compounder will be conducted. The study will identify solution differences and detail its findings. The aim of this study is to assess cardioplegia variability on a national level. Methodology: Results will be summarized by cardioplegia strategy (Buckberg, high-potassium/low-potassium, crystalloid, del Nido, Adenocaine, and microplegia), dilution strategy (4 : 1 blood-crystalloid, 8 : 1 blood-crystalloid, 1 : 4 crystalloid-blood, all-blood, and all-crystalloid), formula constituents (base solutions, additives, buffers), potassium concentrations. Any observed patterns in formula usage will also be reported, geographical or otherwise. Results / Discussion: Based on institutional use, high-potassium/low-potassium (two-solution) multidose strategy was the most common. Based on solutions ordered, the most common cardioplegia ingredient was potassium chloride, present in almost ninety percent (89. 64 %) of all units sold. After looking at potassium content, extensive variability was noted in terms of potassium added to the bag (undiluted) and potassium to-be delivered (post-dilutional). Additionally, unique solution formulations identified in multiple institutions were often found in neighboring states or within a single state. Conclusion: The results of this analysis illustrate the extent to cardioplegia formula variability nationwide. Variability exists in both methodology and formulation on a state-to-state, institution-to-institution, even across-single-institution basis. This formula customization appears to be institution- and surgeon-specific, suggesting empirical influence in formula adaptation. Formula standardization may be necessary to combat the compounded issue of formula customization moving forward...|$|R
