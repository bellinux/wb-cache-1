2500|$|... 190x (not to be {{confused}} with 0198) is the prefix for premium rate services (e.g. recorded information, competition lines, psychics, phone sex, etc.). (Prior to the introduction of 8-digit local numbers, the prefix was 0055.) 190 numbers incur a rate as charged by the provider – either at a per-minute rate (limited at $5.50 per minute) or a fixed rate (up to $38.50 per call). The latter method is most often used for fax-back services, where a timed charge is not appropriate. Costs of 190 calls for competitions involving chance are also often limited by state legislation to $0.55 per call. (In the previous numbering plan, 0055 numbers were limited to three bands: Premium Rate, Value Rate and <b>Budget</b> <b>Rate,</b> with per minute rates of $0.75, $0.60 and $0.40 respectively.) ...|$|E
30|$|H. 264 /AVC {{standard}} {{is widely used}} in video streaming, video communication, and various mobile video applications due to its high compression efficiency {{through the use of}} many advanced tools. In recent video applications, the video resolution tends to be larger and, thus, the bandwidth requirement for video transmission also increases. As a result, the importance of the bitrate control is growing as it is necessary to regulate the bitrate of a video stream in order to achieve the target bitrate. In bitrate control algorithms, the target bits are allocated at the frame-level or the macroblock-level by considering the fullness of the output buffer and the encoding complexity. While achieving the allocated bit <b>budget,</b> <b>rate</b> control attempts to make quality compromises in ways that would have a minimum degradation on perceived through controlling quantization parameter (QP) values. When the QP is small, much of the information is preserved and when the QP is large, much of the information is discarded to reduce the bitrate at the cost of an increased distortion.|$|E
40|$|A {{widespread}} loss of glacier {{area and}} volume {{has been observed}} in the European Alps since the 1980 s. In addition to differences among various regions of the Alps, different responses to climate change characterize neighboring glaciers within the same region. In this study we describe the glacier changes in the Ortles-Cevedale group, the largest glacierized area in the Italian Alps. We analyze the spatial variability, the drivers, and the main factors controlling the current loss of ice in this region, by comparing mean elevation changes derived from two digital terrain models (DTMs), along with glacier extents and snow-covered areas derived from Landsat images acquired in 1987 and 2009, to various topographic factors. Glacier outlines were obtained using the band ratio method with manual corrections. Snow was classified from a near-infrared image after topographic correction. The total glacierized area shrank by 23. 4 ± 3 % in this period, with no {{significant changes in the}} mean altitude of the glaciers. In 2009 the snowline was 240 m higher than in the 1960 s and 1970 s. From the snow-covered area at the end of summer 2009, which fairly represents the extent and local variability of the accumulation areas in the 2000 s, we estimate that approximately 50 % of the remaining glacier surfaces have to melt away to re-establish balanced mass budgets with present climatic conditions. The average geodetic mass <b>budget</b> <b>rate,</b> calculated for 112 ice bodies by differencing two DTMs, ranged from − 0. 18 ± 0. 04 to − 1. 43 ± 0. 09 m w. e. a − 1, averaging − 0. 69 ± 0. 12 m w. e. a − 1. The correlation analysis of mass budgets vs. topographic variables emphasized the important role of hypsometry in controlling the area and volume loss of larger glaciers, whereas a higher variability characterizes smaller glaciers, which is likely due to the higher importance of local topo-climatic conditions...|$|E

40|$|Introduction A multi-strategy {{community}} intervention {{known as the}} National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) was implemented in India from 2005 to 2012 {{in an attempt to}} reduce maternal and child mortality. Objective This study examined {{the extent to which the}} NRHM’s maternal and child health (MCH) sector plans were implemented. We observed trends in how intergovernmental (use of central government funds by state governments) budgets were allocated and used to implement MCH plans in Haryana, India. Methods We conducted a retrospective assessment of programme implementation plans, MCH budget allocation and expenditure and financial monitoring reports during the NRHM implementation period. The yearly <b>budget</b> utilization <b>rate</b> was calculated for each MCH strategy implemented.

40|$|Potential Future Exposure (PFE) is a {{standard}} risk metric for managing business unit counterparty credit risk but there is debate on {{how it should be}} calculated. The debate has been whether to use one of many historical ("physical") measures (one per calibration setup), or one of many risk-neutral measures (one per numeraire). However, we argue that limits should be based on the bank's own risk appetite provided that this is consistent with regulatory backtesting and that whichever measure is used it should behave (in a sense made precise) like a historical measure. Backtesting is only required by regulators for banks with IMM approval but we expect that similar methods are part of limit maintenance generally. We provide three methods for computing the bank price of risk from readily available business unit data, i. e. business unit <b>budgets</b> (<b>rate</b> of return) and limits (e. g. exposure percentiles). Hence we define and propose a Risk Appetite Measure, A, for PFE and suggest that this is uniquely consistent with the bank's Risk Appetite Framework as required by sound governance.

The result of the long run model after co integration is proved using the residual based ducky fuller test and the Johnson co integration tests revealed that broad money supply, government <b>budget</b> deficit, exchange <b>rate</b> and inflation expectation are found to be the major determinants of inflation. The result shows that domestic gross product growth rate has no effect on inflation. To curb inflation, therefore, policy makers need to implement prudential fiscal and monetary policy tools.

Concerning this, it is important to consider targeting monetary and fiscal policy variables and appropriately implanting the set targets. ...|$|R

To have maximum possible fidelity at the decoder side, an Unequal Loss Protection (ULP) approach should be used to packetize the scalable video code stream, so that the different parts of the scalable video stream are protected according to their importance. Unequal loss-protected packetization leads to segmentation of the scalable code stream, such that the source can be reconstructed with the maximum possible fidelity at the decoder side. In Ardestani et al. (2009)  [1] we have found an analytical relation between the optimal sizes of any two consecutive segments. This idea yields an efficient (as efficient as the local search algorithm in Stankovic et al. (2002)  [2]) low-complexity progressive solution for the segmentation problem.
