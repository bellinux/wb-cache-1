50|$|The <b>bar-breasted</b> <b>piculet</b> (Picumnus aurifrons) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Picidae. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru.|$|E
50|$|Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests {{and sometimes in}} heavily degraded former forest. The <b>bar-breasted</b> <b>piculet</b> is generally found in humid forests, including terra firme and v√°rzea, and are generally seen within such areas in the edges, second growth, and clearings.|$|E
50|$|Their upperparts are brownish, greyish or olive, in {{some species}} with darker barring or white or {{yellowish}} spotting on the mantle. The underparts vary greatly among the species, ranging from all rich brown in the chestnut piculet, to whitish in the plain-breasted piculet, white with dark bars in the white-barred piculet, and pale yellowish with dark {{bars on the}} chest and dark spots and streaks on the belly in the <b>bar-breasted</b> <b>piculet.</b> They have black crowns with red, orange, or yellow marks in the male and white dots in the female, except that the male speckled piculet has brown crown marks and the female lacks white dots. Most have rather short black tails with white stripes down the edges and the center (Blume and Winkler 2003). In two species, the rufous-breasted and the chestnut piculets, the white is largely replaced by rufous.|$|E
