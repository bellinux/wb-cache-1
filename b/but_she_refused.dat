5|$|Abhishek Bachchan, John Abraham and Priyanka Chopra {{were cast}} in the lead roles. Aishwarya Rai was {{originally}} offered the lead role, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> it {{because she did not}} want to end up with another man in her first film with her husband (Bachchan) after their marriage. After Dostana release, she regretted the decision. Saif Ali Khan refused the role of Kunal because he was uncomfortable with a husband and wife (Bachchan and Rai) playing the other two leads. In early April 2008, Shilpa Shetty was signed for a special appearance in one of the film's songs.|$|E

5|$|Akhmatova {{was widely}} honoured in the USSR and the West. In 1962 she was visited by Robert Frost; Isaiah Berlin tried {{to visit her}} again, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> him, worried that her son might be re-arrested due to family {{association}} with the ideologically suspect western philosopher. She inspired and advised a large circle of key young Soviet writers. Her dacha in Komarovo was frequented by such poets as Yevgeny Rein and Joseph Brodsky, whom she mentored. Brodsky, arrested in 1963 and interned for social parasitism, {{would go on to}} win the Nobel Prize in Literature (1987) and become Poet Laureate (1991) as an exile in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States.

She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Louis I of Anjou died on 10 September 1384, {{enabling}} his rival, CharlesIII of Naples, {{to stabilize}} his rule in Southern Italy {{during the next}} months. The consolidation of CharlesIII's position in Naples {{also contributed to the}} formation of a party of noblemen who supported his claim to Hungary. John Horvat, Ban of Macsó (now Mačva in Serbia), and his brother, Paul, Bishop of Zagreb, were the leading figures of their movement. Sigismund of Luxembourg tried to persuade the queen mother to consent to his marriage to Mary, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> him. He left Hungary in early 1385.|$|E

5|$|Olivier {{had been}} {{attempting}} to broaden his film career. He {{was not well}} known in the United States despite his success in Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused,</b> preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.|$|E
5|$|During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward {{pioneered the}} idea of royal public {{appearances}} as we understand them today—for example, opening the Thames Embankment in 1871, the Mersey Tunnel in 1886, and Tower Bridge in 1894—but his mother did not allow Edward {{an active role in}} the running of the country until 1898. He was sent summaries of important government documents, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> to give him access to the originals. He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the Schleswig-Holstein Question in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet Giuseppe Garibaldi. Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone sent him papers secretly. From 1886, Foreign Secretary Lord Rosebery sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some Cabinet papers were opened to him.|$|E
5|$|Matilda's {{eldest son}} Henry {{slowly began to}} assume {{a leading role in}} the conflict. He had {{remained}} in France when the Empress first left for England. He crossed over to England in 1142, before returning to Anjou in 1144. Geoffrey of Anjou expected Henry to become the King of England and began to involve him in the government of the family lands. In 1147, Henry intervened in England with a small mercenary army but the expedition failed, not least because Henry lacked the funds to pay his men. Henry asked his mother for money, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused,</b> stating that she had none available. In the end Stephen himself ended up paying off Henry's mercenaries, allowing him to return home safely; his reasons for doing so remain unclear.|$|E

5|$|On 23 January 2010, Gorrostieta Salazar was {{attacked}} by armed men in Ciudad Altamirano, Guerrero, while returning from a local event with four other people. Severely injured by bullet wounds in the abdomen, chest, and leg, she {{was taken to a}} local hospital. Also injured were the driver of the vehicle, who was shot twice; Marbella Reyes Ortoño, head of the Institute of Women in Tiquicheo; and Fanny Almazán Gómez, a journalist from El Sol de Morelia. In addition to the bullet wounds, Gorrostieta Salazar suffered further injuries when the vehicle crashed after the shooting. Her wounds left her in constant pain and she had to use a colostomy bag, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> to resign her post as mayor. She publicly displayed her wounds in photographs published in an issue of Contacto Ciudadano magazine, and repeated her statement that she would continue her work.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused.</b> She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E
5|$|When the British largely {{abandoned}} Carleton Island in 1783, Brant {{moved to}} Cataraqui, now Kingston, Ontario. There the British government built her {{a house and}} gave her an annual pension of £100. She was assigned Farm Lot A in Kingston Township, along the northern limit of the town. It was 116 acres, instead of the standard 200 acres, because it was encroached upon by the Clergy Reserve. In addition, Brant and her family received compensation from the British government for their losses in the American Revolution. Hoping {{to make use of}} her influence, the United States offered Brant compensation if she would return with her family to the Mohawk Valley, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hindley was not arrested with Brady, but {{she demanded}} {{to go with}} him to the police station, {{accompanied}} by her dog, Puppet, to which the police agreed. Hindley was questioned about the events surrounding Evans's death, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> to make any statement beyond claiming that it had been an accident. As the police had no evidence that Hindley was involved in Evans's murder, she was allowed to go home, on the condition that she return the next day for further questioning. Hindley was at liberty for four days following Brady's arrest, during which time she went to her employer's premises and asked to be dismissed, so that she would be eligible for unemployment benefits. While in the office where Brady worked, she found some papers belonging to him in an envelope that she claimed she did not open, which she burned in an ashtray. She believed that they were plans for bank robberies, {{nothing to do with the}} murders. On 11 October, Hindley was charged as an accessory to the murder of Edward Evans and was remanded at Risley.|$|E
5|$|In September 1929, Wessel met Erna Jänicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in {{a tavern}} {{not far from}} Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke's procurer. On 1 November she moved into his room {{on the third floor}} of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sub-let from 29-year old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Freedom Fighter, {{although}} she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent; Salm wanted Jänicke to leave, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> to, and Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help on the evening of 14 January 1930. At first the Communists were not interested in helping her, as she was not well-liked by them because of her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and get him out of Salm's flat by force.|$|E
5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed {{her own work}} called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they think she is diabolic and cast out. She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto. According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.|$|E

5|$|Hensley {{had five}} {{children}} {{with his second}} wife, Irene. She was from a prosperous Lutheran family of German descent but believed that she was suffering a curse. She and her family had hoped that Hensley could free her from the curse, but ultimately {{felt that he was}} unable to. The marriage was contentious because of Hensley's frequent unemployment and poor treatment of Irene. He found intermittent work, including bricklaying, but Irene's family had to help support them; her mother provided the family with clothing. After seven years of marriage, Irene left Hensley and returned to her family, although she returned to Hensley and reconciled with him. One of their sons recalled that Irene was much more religious than Hensley, whom he claims only spoke about spiritual matters if there were church leaders present. Hensley was again separated from Irene around 1941. The cause of the estrangement is unknown, although one of their sons claimed that she threatened to have him arrested. She reconciled with him after he promised to find steady employment, and they returned to Pineville with their children. Hensley wanted to put their children in an orphanage so Irene could travel with him, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused.</b> After a visit from her sister, Irene again left him; she and her children went to live with Hensley's children from his first marriage. A divorce was granted in 1943. Irene later died of complications following surgery for goiter. Hensley attended the wake and visited his children, but departed without them and did not return.|$|E
5|$|Khanna acted {{opposite}} Akshay Kumar in two action films: International Khiladi and Zulmi (both 1999). In {{the former}} {{she played a}} news reporter {{who falls in love}} with a criminal whom she interviews. Both performed poorly at the box office. She was paired with Daggubati Venkatesh in the Telugu film Seenu (1999). Khanna played the lead role in Baadshah (1999), featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a detective. In the same year, she acted opposite Saif Ali Khan in Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan, a romantic comedy directed by Mahesh Bhatt. She was paired opposite Aamir Khan in Dharmesh Darshan's Mela (2000). Similar to The Seven Samurai in story, it was an average grosser at the box office. In October 1999, along with Juhi Chawla, Shah Rukh and Salman Khan, she performed at Awesome Foursome concert held as Shah Alam Outdoor Stadium, Malaysia. Chal Mere Bhai (2000) featured her in a special appearance beside a leading role in the comedy Joru Ka Ghulam, opposite Govinda. She also acted in the David Dhawan-directed comedy Jodi No.1 (2001). Her acting in the film met with poor reviews. Film director Karan Johar admitted in an interview that Khanna was in his mind for the role of Tina in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused</b> it, and thus Rani Mukerji was signed. She left the industry after her marriage to Kumar in 2001, citing that she did not enjoy the acting profession anymore. Her last film was Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega (2001), a remake of the Telugu movie Money (1993). It featured her opposite Fardeen Khan and was an average grosser at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The infant Lennon {{started at}} his first school in November 1945— Mosspits, on Mosspits Lane, Wavertree— so she found a {{part-time}} job at a café near the school. After numerous criticisms from the Stanley family about their (still-married) daughter 'living in sin' with John Dykins, and considerable pressure from Mimi—who twice contacted Liverpool's Social Services {{to complain about the}} infant Lennon sleeping in the same bed as Julia and Dykins—she reluctantly handed the care of Lennon over to Mimi and her husband, George Smith. In July1946, Alf visited Mimi's house, 'Mendips' at 251Menlove Avenue, and took Lennon to Blackpool for a long holiday, but he was secretly intending to emigrate to New Zealand with him. Julia and Dykins found out and followed them to Blackpool. Alf asked Julia to go with them both to New Zealand, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>refused.</b> After a heated argument, Alf said their five-year-old child had to choose between his mother or him. He chose Alf (twice) so Julia walked away, but in the end her son (crying) followed her, although this story has been disputed. According to author Mark Lewisohn, Lennon's parents agreed that Julia should take him and give him a home as Alf left again. A witness who was there that day, Billy Hall, has said the dramatic scene often portrayed with a young John Lennon having to make a decision between his parents never happened. Alf lost contact with the family until Beatlemania, when he and his son met again.|$|E
