That {{is a good}} reason researching adhesive binding quality when soft bound book is stored on humid conditions. The benefit of paperback form is an easy way of handling the text block during the reading. Also the paperback has mostly required reading for customers’ different ages for its low-price and practicality. Uncoated paper mostly takes place in making of text block form including perfect binding technique with HM adhesive. If adhesive binding quality is sufficient, the text block damages almost certainly. This research focuses on understanding of high grades paper properties because adhesive binding strength is only available at paper bindability. The text block volume has consisted {{of a number of}} loose leaves and hold together at spine edge with adhesive. Paper bindability can be observed in every aspect paper adherent features, the bounded layers increase in strength if paper properties are suitable for adhesive binding. The hypothesis is that paper property would indicate a reduction in the adhesive binding strength in humid condition. Paperbacks were exposed to moisture-low heat ageing over period of time (ISO 9142). The static tensile stress method (loose leaf pull-test) has been in use. The adhesive joint strength results are compared with a rating of adhesive strength according to FOGRA Nr. 71006 guidelines for page pull-test...|$|E
