5|$|The {{relations}} <b>between</b> <b>family</b> members follow two patterns: {{the bonds}} of marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

40|$|Many {{hospitals}} are expanding or adding neonatal services, resulting in new construction and experimentation with innovative facility design. One {{of the most}} significant innovations has been to provide private single family rooms (SFRs) rather than multi-bed bays. This study examined the interactions <b>between</b> <b>families</b> and staff, families and other families, and families and infants in these two settings. Two Midwestern, Level III neonatal intensive care units were studied in this project. Forty hours of behavioral observation were gathered using pocket PCs preprogrammed with observational software which allowed the observers to record verbal, visual and body behaviors. The primary hypotheses of this study were that: 1) interactions <b>between</b> <b>families</b> in single-family rooms would decrease in the single family room setting relative to the Open Bay setting; 2) interactions <b>between</b> <b>families</b> and staff would decrease in the single-family room settings relative to the Open Bay Setting; and 3) interactions <b>between</b> <b>families</b> and infants would increase in the single family room settings relative to the Open Bay setting. Overall, the data suggested the occurrence of more frequent interactions in Open Bay units, but longer interactions in SFRs. From a design perspective it might be recommended that Open Bay units provide spaces which permit longer encounters <b>between</b> <b>families</b> and other families and staff, and that SFRs provide more spaces that allow for spontaneous encounters with other families and staff, while taking into consideration unnecessarily large distances between rooms...|$|R

25|$|Inequality {{may exist}} {{between members of}} {{different}} generations within a family. Assimilation into American society may create changes in the traditional family structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which age is a strong determinant of status and power. American culture places {{a high value on}} individuality. The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives.

25|$|Among many {{immigrant}} families, {{members of}} the younger generation tend to assimilate to American culture at a faster rate than members of older generations.

25|$|While {{there exist}} strong {{stereotypes}} that women express themselves {{and talk about}} their emotions with others more than men do, {{the results from the}} above studies indicate that on the contrary there are no sex differences concerning the amount of social sharing of emotion between men and women. However, although no such quantitative sex differences were found, one qualitative difference was found between the social sharing behaviors of males and females, and that is with whom they choose to share. Females tend to share their emotions equally <b>between</b> <b>family</b> members, close friends, and spouses/partners. On the other hand, men tend to share more exclusively with their partners/spouses and less so with close friends and family members.|$|E

25|$|Hepatitis B is {{a disease}} caused by {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) which infects the liver of hominoidea, including humans, and causes an inflammation called hepatitis. The disease has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. About {{a third of the}} world's population, more than 2 billion people, have been infected with HBV. Transmission of HBV results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. Possible forms of transmission include (but are not limited to) unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusions, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes, and vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth. HBV can also be transmitted <b>between</b> <b>family</b> members within households, possibly by contact of non-intact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing the virus. However, at least 30% of reported hepatitis B cases among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} with same sex marriage {{is whether or not}} the children of these families will grow up positively and have similar lives compared to children with heterosexual parents. The purpose of this article was to understand how undergraduate students perceived and understood the idea of same-sex families. Each student was given a scenario of a family birthday party, except the couple in one scenario was same sex oriented while the other was not. The scenarios depicted that there was a fight between the parents and grandparents, and gave little information about what the fight was about. The experiment resulted in students believing that the fight was related to the sexual orientation of the same-sex couple. All in all, the conductors of the experiment found no correlation between specific variables conducted in the study such as relationships <b>between</b> <b>family</b> and peers. The conductors of the experiment also found in their results that the children of same sex families grow into adulthood just as happy and optimistic as children with heterosexual parents do. This study depicts a positive response regarding the concern of the well being of same sex families.|$|E
