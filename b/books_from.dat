5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they {{had lived in the}} 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or <b>books</b> <b>from</b> the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp left Bowling Green {{to live at}} his father's {{plantation}} in Simpson County, Kentucky, {{where he}} convalesced from an illness. He learned that Cooke had become a recluse nearby at her mother's plantation after her public disgrace. Having heard from a mutual friend about her beauty and accomplishments, he decided to meet Cooke.
