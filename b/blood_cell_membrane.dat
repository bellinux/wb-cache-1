25|$|SAO {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in the gene encoding the erythrocyte band 3 protein. There is a deletion of codons 400-408 in the gene, leading to a deletion of 9 amino-acids at the boundary between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of band 3 protein. Band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and band 4.1. Ovalocyte band 3 binds more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 anion transporter. These qualitative defects create a red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> that is less tolerant of shear stress and more susceptible to permanent deformation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} whether the supplementation with hemin affects the nanostructure of red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> memranes. Subjects and methods. Human whole blood was supplemented or not with hemin and nanostructure of red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> was studied using atomic force microscopy. Conclusion. Experiments demonstrated that hemin exerted a specific effect on the nanostructure of red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> to form domains upon their surface. The size of granular structures in the domains was 100 — 200 nm, which coincides with that of a spectrin matrix. The effect of domain generation possesed threshold character starting from hemine concentrations of 1. 3 — 1. 7 mM. These results demonstrate the potential of the use of nanostructural changes within the erythrocyte membrane as surrogate biomarkers of erythrocyte response to hemoglobin derivatives in future studies.

The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to compare NEFA concentrations in <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> from patients with that of healthy control subjects, and to correlate possible changes with disease outcome. NEFA C 18 : 2 n- 6 (9, 12 -octadecadienoic acid) was decreased in peripheral <b>blood</b> mononuclear <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> from patients, median (quartile range) : patients: 0. 05 (0. 02) and controls: 0. 07 (0. 14) μg/mg protein, p= 0. 007. C 18 : 2 n- 6 also showed a weaker relationship with other fatty acids: with C 16 : 0 : patients: R= 0. 40, p= 0. 04; controls: R= 0. 82, p= 0. 000001. Saturated and MUFA showed positive correlations with the Bowel and bladder Functional System Scores (FSS). In contrast, in red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 22 : 0 (docosanoic acid) showed inverse correlations with the Sensory and Brainstem FSS.

40|$|A {{population}} based {{case-control study}} was designed to test the hypothesis that cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) had lower concentration of cis linoleic (LA) in their red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> and it would remain a predictor of SCC after adjusting for other risk factors. The probability of LA as a potential biomarker for SCC was investigated because it is the precursor of arachidonic acid (AA), a secondary messenger for proteins involved in cell growth and proliferation. Ras oncogene perpetually activates the two phospholipases A- 2 and C, causing release of AA from the <b>membrane</b> phospholipids. Red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> were used as the medium for assessing the concentration of cis linoleic acid because donation of blood was well accepted by the participants. Tissue availability, and the low cost of operation were the other factors to utilize red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes.</b> Cases who had confirmed pathological diagnosis of SCC between December 1991 -October 1994 were identified and consecutively sampled from the Arizona Skin Cancer Registry. Controls were recruited from the same geographic area using a random digit dialing technique. Subjects, limited to White-Anglo European descendent, were frequency matched by their age (± 5 years). Participants were screened for use of steroids, prescribed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and history of chronic illness. Data on sun exposure habits, medication usage, lifestyle habits, and family history of SCC were collected during a personal interview. A 15 cc blood sample was collected. The composition of fatty acids in the red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> was analyzed using gas-liquid chromatography techniques. Statistical analysis revealed that concentration of LA was significantly lower in the red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> of the cases than the controls. However, cases had higher concentration of linolenic and trans linoleic acids. The concentration of 17 other fatty acids were equal, indicating that the general dietary pattern of cases and controls were similar. Use of logistic regression statistics showed that LA remained a significant independent risk factor for SCC (OR = 2. 83, 95 % Cl = 1. 38 - 5. 97) after adjusting for other risk factors.

40|$|International audienceRationaleImmune modulatory {{effects of}} the n- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are well described. However, EPA and DHA must be incorporated effectively into <b>cell</b> <b>membrane</b> phospholipids to modify cell function. In order to address the absence of human data regarding short term incorporation in literature, {{the present study investigates}} the incorporation kinetics of EPA and DHA within one week of supplementation with a nutritionally complete sip feed enriched with an emulsified fish oil, a specific oligosaccharide mixture, high protein and leucine. Additionally, the effects on ex vivo immune function were determined. MethodIn a single-arm, open label study, twelve healthy elderly (with an average age of 62 years) consumed 400 ml of sip feed (FortiCare Immunopt upgrade) providing 2. 4 g EPA and 1. 2 g DHA daily. Blood samples were taken at day 1 (baseline), day 2, 3, 5 and 8. Ex vivo immune function was measured by the production of cytokines in LPS-stimulated whole blood cultures. ResultsAfter one week of supplementation, the percentage EPA in phospholipids of white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> increased from 0. 5 % to 2. 8 % (p< 0. 001), in red <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> from 0. 8 % to 2. 2 % (p< 0. 001) and in plasma from 1. 1 % to 5. 4 % (p< 0. 001). No change in the percentage DHA in phospholipids of white <b>blood</b> <b>cell</b> <b>membranes</b> was observed, however in red <b>blood</b> <b>cells</b> the percentage DHA increased from 3. 5 % to 3. 9 % (p< 0. 001) and in plasma from 3. 5 % to 4. 8 % (p< 0. 001).
