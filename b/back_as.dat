5|$|The plates lie flat {{along the}} <b>back,</b> <b>as</b> a shingle-like armor. This was Marsh's initial interpretation, {{which led to}} the name 'roof lizard'. As further and {{complete}} plates were found, their form showed they stood on edge, rather than lying flat.|$|E
5|$|There are {{traces of}} early {{agriculture}} {{at the site}} dating as far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> 1000 BC, in the Middle Preclassic. A cache of Mamon ceramics dating from about 700-400 BC were found in a sealed chultun, a subterranean bottle-shaped chamber.|$|E

5|$|A {{neighborhood}} variously called East Hackensack or New Hackensack {{was established}} along a ridge {{on the east}} bank of the Hackensack River, site of a Native American trail that followed the river's path along what is now River Road, with the earliest known buildings constructed dating <b>back</b> <b>as</b> far as 1704.

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} of Native American settlements dates <b>back</b> <b>as</b> far as 3000 BC; the Jeffers Petroglyphs site in southwest Minnesota contains carvings thought to {{date to the}} Late Archaic Period (3000 BC to 1000 BC). Around 700 BC, burial mounds were first created, and the practice continued until the arrival of Europeans, when 10,000 such mounds dotted the state.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} suggests that Nri hegemony in Igboland may go <b>back</b> <b>as</b> far as the 9th century, and royal burials have been unearthed dating to at least the 10th century. Eri, the god-like founder of Nri, {{is believed to have}} settled the region around 948, with other related Igbo cultures following after in the 13th century. The first eze Nri (King of Nri), Ìfikuánim, follows directly after him. According to Igbo oral tradition, his reign started in 1043. At least one historian puts Ìfikuánim's reign much later, around 1225 CE.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock {{that make up the}} Sierra Nevada. Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the Sierra Nevada in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E

5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians as far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians {{to think that they}} were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch <b>back</b> <b>as</b> well.|$|E
5|$|Centuries {{before the}} conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age. This large-scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, Tajikistan, spanning as far <b>back</b> <b>as</b> the 4th millennium BC and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC.|$|E
