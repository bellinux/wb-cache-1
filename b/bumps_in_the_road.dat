When designed for this trade, with a minimum of weight put into their construction and provision for harnessing the four horses, these vehicles took the name of chasse-marée. As speed was essential, they were normally hauled by two pairs of horses. The vehicle took the form of two wheels, of a diameter large enough to minimize the slowing effect of <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> On their axle was mounted an open rectangular frame within which were slung the baskets holding the fish, packed in seaweed. More baskets were stacked above. The teams of usually fairly small horses were worked hard and changed at posting stations {{in the same way as}} those of mail coaches.|$|E

[...] This sentiment was re-iterated by executive producer Brad Falchuk, after the characters kissed for the first time. He revealed that their relationship would not run smoothly, and observed that once couples start dating, [...] "Everything goes to hell." [...] Colfer suggested that Kurt returning to McKinley may cause difficulties in their relationship, but noted [...] "Distance makes the heart grow fonder, right? That’s what they tell me.

500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament I reckon to beat." [...] Despite some <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed {{himself to be a}} full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well". Fischer became the youngest person ever to {{qualify for the}} Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day. [...] "By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands." ...|$|E

25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road)</b> <b>the</b> center section bends uniformly between <b>the</b> pivot mounts. <b>In</b> a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|R

50|$|Ignoring the flexing {{of other}} components, a car can be modeled as the sprung weight, {{carried by the}} springs, carried by the {{unsprung}} weight, carried by the tires, carried by <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> Unsprung weight is more properly regarded as a mass {{which has its own}} inherent inertia separate {{from the rest of the}} vehicle. When a wheel is pushed upwards by a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>the</b> inertia of the wheel will cause it to be carried further upward above the height of the bump. If the force of the push is sufficiently large, the inertia of the wheel will cause the tire to completely lift off <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface resulting <b>in</b> a loss of traction and control. Similarly when crossing into a sudden ground depression, the inertia of the wheel slows the rate at which it descends. If the wheel inertia is large enough, the wheel may be temporarily separated from <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface before it has descended back into contact with <b>the</b> <b>road</b> surface.|$|R
