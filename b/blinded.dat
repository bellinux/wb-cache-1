5000|$|There {{are three}} common options {{for dealing with}} {{a player in the}} <b>blinds</b> who must also pay the kill <b>blind.</b> First, they may pay only the kill <b>blind</b> and their {{scheduled}} <b>blind</b> is not posted. Second, the player may be required to post both their scheduled <b>blind</b> and the kill <b>blind</b> for that hand, with only the kill <b>blind</b> being [...] "live" [...] for determining that player's bet amount (this method adds an extra element of risk to the player [...] "under the gun"). Lastly, the player may post their kill <b>blind</b> in this hand, and then [...] "owe" [...] their scheduled <b>blind</b> in the next hand when they no longer have to post the kill <b>blind,</b> similar to the moving button rule of <b>blinds</b> busting out. This can cause a shifting of all <b>blinds</b> to a player who triggered a kill while [...] "under the gun"; the player would first post the kill <b>blind</b> when the big <b>blind</b> was due, then in the next hand (assuming they didn't have to pay the kill <b>blind</b> again) they would pay their big <b>blind</b> instead of the small <b>blind</b> that is now due. On the third hand, with the player on the button, the small <b>blind</b> would be paid and the player is now [...] "caught up".|$|R

We conclude by outlining opportunities for research aimed at helping people more rapidly and effectively collaborate on future web-centric projects...|$|R
