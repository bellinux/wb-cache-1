The constitutive constants are calculated on a base of the information about the bulge geometry, applied pressure, and forming time. A multi-dome forming test allows one to reduce the number of the experiments required for the characterization, since every multi-dome test produces several domes of different size. In this study, a specific die for multi-dome test was used. The die has six holes with different radiuses of 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 mm. During a test, the specimen is clamped between blank holder and die holder, heated to a specific temperature, and formed by applying constant gas pressure.

40|$|The {{digital image}} {{correlation}} (DIC) technique is a full-field non-contact optical deformation measurement tool. The technique correlates {{images of a}} specimen before and after deformation, so that the deformation can be retrieved. The correlation is obtained by comparing the similarity of the image features (intensity of pixels) before and after deformation to establish the correspondence between undeformed images and deformed images. Since it was proposed in the 1980 s, the technique is largely improved and widely applied in different fields. However, as a measurement method, the accuracy of DIC is still a problem. Plenty of {{studies have been done}} concerning the performance of DIC, and yet there are no solid solutions to assess the accuracy of the measurement. In this research, effort is contributed to the analysis of the error of DIC both theoretically and experimentally. A comprehensive theoretical analysis is presented for the measurement errors on the displacement field and the strain field obtained by subset-based DIC. In general, the systematic measurement error can not be estimated, but the random measurement error is well studied. For the displacement error, a general solution is provided to assess the random measurement error due to the imaging noise. The solution indicates that the random displacement error is determined by the imaging noise level, the intensity gradient of the interested image, the subset size, the sub-pixel part of displacement, and the interpolation scheme. For the strain error, the analysis suggests that the random error relates to the DIC implementations (i. e. subset size, step size and strain window size), the extent of deformation, and the random error of displacement measurement. As the theoretical analysis can not fully estimate the measurement error, an experimental approach is proposed to study the performance of DIC with virtual tests associated with finite element analysis (FEA). The idea of this approach is to numerically simulate a real DIC test, and assess the measurement error of DIC afterwards. In this approach, the interested experiment is firstly simulated by FEA with prescribed material properties. The obtained deformation fields are extracted from FEA, and are utilized to deform a reference image numerically. DIC is then performed to measure this deformation by correlating the numerically deformed image and the reference image. By comparing the DIC measured deformation with the FEA results, one is enabled to assess the accuracy of the DIC measurements. In the current stage, this approach could be generalized to any 2 D DIC applications. Amongst possible applications of DIC, an important one is the study of the the mechanical behaviour of materials, which is often described by phenomenological constitutive equations (e. g. hardening law and yield criterion). The constitutive equations are one of the basis of FEA for material simulations. To obtain the parameters for the constitutive equations, inverse modelling methods can be adopted associated with full field measurements such as DIC. Inverse modelling methods include several different categories, among which the finite element model updating (FEMU) method is intuitive to understand. The FEMU method combined with DIC has been well developed for years. However, the accuracy of DIC measurements is rarely considered. This is rather dangerous since misinterpretation of the measurements leads to meaningless results. In this thesis, the uncertainty of DIC measurement is studied. As such, the measurement error can be taken into account by using a weighted cost function in FEMU. The mechanical properties of steel DC 06 are studied. The results suggest that the identified parameters are sensitive to the measurement errors, and more appropriate parameters are expected when the measurement error and the strain profile are considered. The accuracy of phenomenological constitutive equations is limited: indeed they are only valid for the experiments to which they are calibrated. As such, the identified parameters will generally depend on the type of experiments used to calibrate them. Therefore, FEA of the material under specific deformation might not be acceptable when the parameters are identified for another deformation state. Consequently, it is necessary to identify the parameters from tests in accordance with the interested deformation state so that FEA is capable to provide optimized simulations. As out-of-plane deformation are generally involved in the modern manufacturing fields, material properties obtained from 2 D tests might not be sufficient for accurate FEAs of these processes. In literature, however, FEMU with stereo tests is seldom discussed. In this work, a method is proposed to associate FEMU with stereo DIC in an Erichsen <b>bulging</b> <b>test.</b> It is found that the optimized constitutive parameters for the Erichsen test are different from the ones obtained from 2 D tests, which proves the necessity of the stereo FEMU method. nrpages: 242 status: publishe...|$|E

These values determined forthin aluminium and eledroforrned copperfoils {{were found to be}} comparable with those reported using the sophisticated bulge testers and can be used for routine shop-floor inspection of thin foils...|$|R
40|$|The {{miniature}} {{plane strain}} <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> is acknowledged {{as a powerful}} technique to study the mechanical properties of thin films [1, 2]. A bulge experiment consists of measuring the deflection δ of a mem-brane under pressure P (Fig. 1 a). Full stress-strain curves can be calculated (Fig. 1 b) using the Bulge Equations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this article}} is to provide an {{experimental}} and modeling study of an architectured photosensitive silicone membrane. Mechanical properties are dependent of UV doses used to alter the local cross-link density, resulting in a direct effect on the macroscopic mechanical behavior. A series of mechanical tests were carried out to characterize the mechanical behavior of each phase. Results are presented for various types of loading, including uniaxial, planar, and equibiaxial loading cases, for the UV irradiated and the nonirradiated material. Using the <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> with an architectured sample, the global stretchability with minimum boundary condition perturbations was investigated. To further explore the unusual properties offered by silicone graded membranes, finite element analysis of graded architecture was performed to try to predict the stress-strain response in the <b>bulge</b> <b>test.</b> Soft-to-hard transition is tested and the macroscopic influence of interface was observed...|$|R
40|$|Plasticity in {{thin films}} has been {{extensively}} studied by averaging techniques such as wafer curvature, tensile <b>testing,</b> <b>bulge</b> <b>testing</b> and conventional x-ray diffraction, but is still only partially understood. In the present work, we have investigated plastic phenomena using the X-Ray Microdiffraction Laue technique on beamline 7. 3. 3. at the ALS. This technique is able t...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} method has been employed {{to quantify the}} mechanical behavior of sheet metals (both isotropic and orthotropic) subjected to dynamic bulge loading at strain rates of up to 400 s- 1. Using {{newly developed}} dynamic <b>bulge</b> <b>testing</b> equipment with stereoscopic imaging, the exact shape of the bulging dome has been obtained and represented using high order polynomials before further constitutive analysis. The bulge profile functions discerned {{have been used to}} calculate the actual radius of curvature at the pole, thus replacing the spherical shape generally assumed in traditional <b>bulge</b> <b>test</b> analysis. Furthermore, the calculation of the thickness of the bulge has been improved by employing "dome volume" approaches. Effective strain and stress at the dome's pole have been calculated considering both isotropic and orthotropic materials. The effect of gage length on the obtained values of strain and stress has been assessed. Copyright © 2007 by ASTM International...|$|R
