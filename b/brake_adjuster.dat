40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that drivers use specific visual information to execute braking behaviors [Faj 05] and that drivers calibrate braking behavior to this visual information over time [Faj 09]. Specifically, Fajen (2005) argued that when successfully <b>braking,</b> participants <b>adjust</b> <b>braking</b> pressure to maintain a visually-specified ideal braking pressure less than one’s maximum ability to brake. In the current paper, we investigated whether factors, specifically one’s emotional state, would alter the relationship between braking behavior and visually-specified ideal braking pressure over time. Specifically, we investigated whether the performance of braking changed when anxious. Previous research demonstrated that anxiety influences static perceptual judgments of space [Gra 12] {{and the performance of}} open-loop sports actions [Bei 10]. Open-loop actions are actions where once the movement has been initiated there are no opportunities to alter the outcome (i. e., putting a golf ball). This research shows an influence of anxiety on static perceptual tasks and the performance of open-loop actions suggesting that anxiety may also influence more complex everyday actions like braking. It is important to know whether, and how, the influence of anxiety extends to the performance of closedloop actions like braking given the potential realworld consequences of poor performance...|$|R

50|$|Most players say {{vehicles}} are best controlled {{using a computer}} steering wheel, although a joystick or even keyboard can be used. The keyboard is also used for some actions, like requesting pit service and <b>adjusting</b> <b>brake</b> bias.

The player can jump directly from the racetrack to the control interface by pressing the escape key (ESC), or entering their pit box.|$|R
30|$|It is more {{difficult}} to conduct the full-power test of a CI engine at variable speeds than the SI engine. Through the same procedure of the SI engine test, the <b>brake</b> torque is <b>adjusted</b> until the lowest operating speed is reached with the fuel pump injecting a quantity of fuel to make the exhaust gas slightly colored. This indicates that the engine is near the maximum load since some of the fuel is being wasted in smoke. This is used to define the full-load at different stages.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining wheel cylinder pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles <b>adjust</b> <b>brake</b> pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used).

40|$|At braking the {{traction}} motors are transferred to generator mode and produce electrical energy which passes to the contact mains or storage device in the DC mains for further use. Such braking is called regenerative. The resulting electrical energy can be spent by trains in traction mode. Regenerative braking reduces {{the consumption of}} electric power for traction. In electric railways of our country more than 3 % of the consumed electrical energy is given back to contact mains annually. As this takes place there arises the task to control the braking of the {{traction motors}} with minimal impact on electric power quality and maintaining proper braking performance. Based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of the brake traction of an electric locomotive with asynchronous electric machines the main braking modes have been chosen: at a constant sliding speed and the stator constant voltage; at constant braking power and the stator constant voltage; at a power value more than the nominal braking power; at a constant load torque; at a constant frequency of the stator. The vector control system with the formation of the reactive component of the stator current and the EMF regulator was chosen, basing on the working conditions characteristics in the electric braking mode (recuperation); namely, that the characteristics are defined by the laws regulating the frequency and voltage across the stator windings. This control system can fully reproduce any predetermined trajectory of traction and <b>braking</b> performance and <b>adjust</b> <b>braking</b> power.

50|$|By {{varying the}} {{resistance}} on a flywheel {{attached to the}} pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a friction wheel, a magnetic eddy-current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the <b>brake</b> can be <b>adjusted</b> from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider can not move the pedals. Usually riders who can't pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.|$|R

To quantify lateral deviation in this scenario a test was run at 50 km/h with 12 unaware drivers in a heavy truck. Brakes were configured to emulate automatic braking on split-μ. Results show that the produced maximum lateral deviation from the original direction was 0. 25 m on average. Two drivers deviated by 0. 5 m.

50|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{coaches in}} many {{countries}} began using specially made rowing machines for training and improved power measurement. One original design incorporated a large, heavy, solid iron flywheel with a mechanical friction brake, developed by John Harrison of Leichhardt Rowing Club in Sydney, later to become a {{professor of mechanical engineering}} at the University of New South Wales. Harrison, a dual Australian champion beach sprinter who went on to row in the coxless four at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, had been introduced to rowing after a chance meeting with one of the fathers of modern athletic physiological training and testing, and the coach of the Leichhardt Guinea Pigs, Professor Frank Cotton. Professor Cotton had produced a rudimentary friction-based machine for evaluating potential rowers by exhausting them, without any pretence of accurately measuring power output. Harrison realised the importance of using a small braking area with a non-absorbent braking material, combined with a large flywheel. The advantage of this design (produced by Ted Curtain Engineering, Curtain being a fellow Guinea Pig) was the virtual elimination of factors able to interfere with accurate results—for instance ambient humidity or temperature. The Harrison-Cotton machine represents the very first piece of equipment able to accurately quantify human power output; power calculation within an accuracy range as achieved by his machine of less than 1% remains an impressive result today. The friction <b>brake</b> was <b>adjusted</b> according to a rower's weight to give an accurate appraisal of boat-moving ability (drag on a boat is proportional to weight). Inferior copies of Harrison's machine were produced in several countries utilising a smaller flywheel and leather straps—unfortunately the leather straps were sensitive to humidity, and the relatively large braking area made results far less accurate than Harrison's machine. The weight correction factor tended to make them unpopular among rowers of the time. Harrison, arguably the father of modern athletic power evaluation, died in February 2012.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} the late 1970s the West Berlin {{government}} had discussed introducing such a system to the city, particularly a section linking Tegel Airport with the centre. The go-ahead was finally given for {{the building of a}} test track at Potsdamer Platz on 2 December 1980, with a ground-breaking ceremony taking place on 16 June 1983, construction starting in earnest in December 1983 and the first test runs occurring in June 1984. This has required a direct link for those people staying {{in the western part of}} Potsdamer Platz as there is no rail connection to Gleisdreieck. Five years of intensive testing followed, not without incident. On 18 April 1987 an arson attack at Gleisdreieck destroyed two cars, while a more spectacular mishap occurred on 19 December 1988 when a train with badly <b>adjusted</b> <b>brakes</b> ran through the end wall of the Kemperplatz terminus, much to the amusement of the local press. However, with some spare cars pressed into service the line, just 1.6 km in length, was opened to the public on 28 August 1989, although it did not really run from anywhere to anywhere. Nevertheless, it was regarded as an interesting curiosity and was quite heavily used on that basis, although it was to be short-lived. The station in the western part of Potsdamer Platz is called Kemperplatz.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake system}} uses the {{electro-pneumatic}} straight air brake with regenerative braking from the 1000 series. The series was remodeled with a load compensating device which <b>adjusts</b> <b>brake</b> power to support {{changes in the}} car's body weight which increased the passenger limit. The main controller unit, of a series parallel specification, was also taken from the 1000 series, and taking into account connecting this series with 1380, 1800, and 1850 series cars, test runs on 1800 series cars were carried out. From these tests, {{it was found that}} such trains could be run at up to 120 km/h. Because of this, cars in this series can be used as sudden replacements for cars in limited express trains. It has also been confirmed that this series can be connected to the 5300 series and 5700 series (in this case trains are not run at 120 km/h.) With this series having been connected to the 1380 series for test runs and out-of-service runs, it is theoretically possible to operate a train with this series connected to the 1380 series. However, the 5000 series has cars with only bench seats, as opposed to the 1380 series which, except for the ends of the cars, only has convertible forward- or backward-facing seats, so for the sake of this the two series are operated separately.|$|R
40|$|NIOSH {{recommends}} that all fire departments operating fire apparatus equipped with automatic slack adjusters (ASAs) immediately take the following actions {{to reduce the}} risk of fire fighters being injured in an apparatus crash due to brake failure: 1. Ensure that ASAs are not manually adjusted. 2. Establish procedures to ensure maintenance on fire apparatus is conducted as recommended in NFPA 1911 Standard for the Inspection, Maintenance, Testing, and Retirement of In-Service Automotive Fire Apparatus. 3. Ensure maintenance is only performed by qualified technicians who meet NFPA 1071 Standard for Emergency Vehicle Technician Professional Qualifications. An automatic slack adjuster is a mechanical component of the air <b>brake</b> system that <b>adjust</b> <b>brakes</b> as necessary when the vehicle is in operation to compensate for wear in the brake shoes (drum brakes) or pads (disc brakes). When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment, it signifies the existence of a larger braking system problem that needs correction. Manual adjustment of ASAs should only be done by qualified technicians during installation or when absolutely necessary to move the apparatus to a repair facility (NTSB 2006, 2007; IAFC 2006). In 2006, the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC) warned the fire service of this potential problem (IAFC 2006) following an investigative report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB 2006). While conducting an investigation of a recent apparatus crash-related fire fighter fatality, NIOSH learned that fire departments may not fully appreciate the hazards related to manual adjustment of ASAs. NIOSH would like to renew efforts to bring this to the attention of all U. S. fire departments, fire fighters, and fleet maintenance departments who are tasked with preventive maintenance or operation of apparatus equipped with ASAs. The manual adjustment of ASAs may contribute to unexpected brake failure on fire apparatus. When an ASA is found to be out of adjustment it signifies the existence of a larger problem with the braking system that needs to be corrected immediately. Vehicles found to have ASAs that are out of adjustment should be taken out-of-service immediately until corrective brake service is completed. Fire Departments should ensure that all technicians conducting brake service on fire department apparatus: (1) are certified in air brake repair to the level (T- 4) required by the Automotive Service Excellence Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Technician Certification and (2) have, at a minimum, Level 1 Fire Apparatus Technician Certification as certified by the Emergency Vehicle Technician Certification Commission. Additionally, fire departments should adhere to manufacturer guidelines and recommendations and applicable federal, state or provincial, and local laws regarding apparatus inspection and maintenance [NFPA 1911]. Further, the NTSB has recommended, and NIOSH agrees, that all drivers of fire apparatus equipped with air brakes must undergo training and testing to demonstrate proficiency in the inspection and operation of air-braked vehicles. Such training should emphasize that manual adjustment of automatic slack adjusters is dangerous and should not be done, except during installation, or in an emergency situation when it is absolutely necessary to move the vehicle to a repair facility.

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and braking distance size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and <b>adjusting</b> <b>braking)</b> of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, braking distances amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and braking distances amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and braking distances in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R
40|$|Short {{range of}} {{electric}} vehicles {{is one of}} the stumbling blocks in the way of electric cars to gaining wide user acceptance and becoming a major market player. The possibility to recover vehicle energy otherwise lost as heat during braking is an inherent advantage of a hybrid electric or a fully electric vehicle. Regeneration has the potential to answer this problem by aiding in range extension with recuperation of vehicle energy during braking. The control and dynamics of braking undergoes a major change as compared to a conventional vehicle with friction braking, due to the addition of motor-generator. In this research two regenerative braking concepts namely serial and parallel have been studied and implemented on an electric vehicle. Also a point of interest is to find if any additional states are required from the TNO Vehicle state estimator (VSE) which would aid in regeneration. From the results obtained we try to draw a conclusion on the difference in energy recuperation level in the two strategies with consistent pedal feel in mind. The proposed brake torque distribution strategy has been tested through the simulation on the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) drive cycle and straight line braking scenario. Care has been taken to observe and <b>adjust</b> <b>brake</b> torque such that wheel lock up is prevented and hence regeneration is un-interrupted. The research couldn’t come with any additional parameters to be added to VSE. However, it would be worthwhile to employ VSE to achieve a more accurate estimation of the braking force, which may aid in prolonging regeneration time and hence more energy recuperation. The results provide a good case to invest more time and money into developing serial regenerative braking as it clearly out-performs parallel regenerative braking strategy. The simulation tests conducted in this research are for a longitudinal braking scenario. Further investigation is required to study effects with lateral motion and cornering maneuvers...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} part within {{developments in the}} field of telematics is Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA). Especially in Sweden, where the policy objective is to have zero fatalities or seriously injured victims on the road in 2020, research has been conducted on ISA during the last 10 years. In the Netherlands an experiment is planned in a new district of the city of Tilburg. Intelligent Speed Adaption (ISA) can be done in several ways: (a) the driver is provided continuously with information about local speed limits; (b) the driver is warned when speeding by sound or light signals; and (c) the system reacts automatically to make speeding impossible (through counterpressure of the accelerator or reduction in fuel supply). There are different ways in which information about local speed limits can be obtained: (i) by manual adjustment of a maximum level by the driver; (ii) by a signal to the vehicle, from a beacon along the road driven on; and (iii) an autonomous system in which the road network and relevant speed limit data is stored in the vehicle and in which the vehicle is located by a Global Positioning System (GPS). It is therefore known at every moment where the vehicle is, and what speed limit is. Current dat can be transmitted to the vehicle, so that a lower speed limit is installed as soon as, for example, there are road works ahead or poor weather conditions. In some new cars, especially the more expensive brands, a maximum speed can be manually adjusted. A warning signal is given when this speed is exceeded. Some systems even make <b>braking</b> the <b>adjusted</b> speed limit impossible because the fuel supply is automatically cut off. An important question {{is the extent to which}} ISA is accepted by the driver. From Swedish research it is known that after experiencing ISA's obligatory speed reduction, the acceptance is greater than beforehand. When car drivers have the choice between an ISA system and speed control humps (and other infrastructural measures), they choose for ISA. In general, a warning system is preferred above a system limiting speed. The acceptance is greater when the problem situations are recognizable: in residential areas, on roads where fast and slow traffic are not separated, at the approach of complex intersections, at road works, and during bad weather conditions, etc. ISA also influences driver behaviour. The effects found are: average speed reduced by a few km/h, driving at a constant speed, increase in travel time by 9 %, and increased alertness towards other road users. In Sweden preparations are being made for large scale experiments in several towns, where the beacons as well as autonomous system will be tested. For the Tilburg experiment SWOV has made the research design. How exactly the experiment will be conducted is not yet known. Testing a mixed system - both beacons and autonomous - appears to be desirable. The advantage is that mobile beacons can be used under changing conditions such as road works. Regulations on ISA should be international. That is why research and testing should be conducted in an international framework. On the short term it is expected that more and more new cars will be equipped with a manual speeding warning and also systems in which a voluntary manual speed limit cannot be exceeded. The navigation systems that can be bought nowadays use a CD-ROM and a Global Positioning System (GPS). In the not too distant future they can easily be extended with ISA. In the future it is possible to imagine a mandatorily selective application of ISA. It can be applied, for example, to notorious speeders. ISA could also be used in cars of young drivers. Young drivers have, namely, a relatively large chance of being involved in a road accident. Speeding could be one of the causes. It is evidently clear to begin with applying the automatic systems of ISA in residential and municipal areas, because there a many vulnerable road users in such areas. The public acceptance there will also be the highest. Then followed by the 60 km/h and 80 km/h roads on which many conflict situations between rapid and slow traffic occur, as well as mutually between different types of rapid traffic.
