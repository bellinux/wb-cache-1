40|$|Abstract [...] - During braking process {{kinetic energy}} is {{converted}} into heat energy {{and it should}} be removed from the breaking system for proper functioning. The heat generated is due to the friction between the disc brake rotor and <b>breaking</b> <b>pad.</b> For obtaining a good and efficient braking system the knowledge of maximum heat generated in the system and also proper ventilation methods are needed. This paper investigates the temperature field around a disc brake suitable for an all-terrain vehicle. The analysis is done in commercially available ANSYS software and the results are found to be satisfactory. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Low-latency {{anonymous}} {{communication protocols}} in general, {{and the popular}} onion-routing protocol in particular, are broken against simple timing attacks. While {{there have been few}} proposed solutions to this problem when the adversary is active, several padding schemes have been proposed to defend against a passive adversary that just observes timing patterns. Unfortunately active adversaries can <b>break</b> <b>padding</b> schemes by inserting delays and dropping messages. We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not excessive. ...|$|R

We present a protocol that provides anonymity against an active adversary by using a black-box padding scheme that is effective against a passive adversary. Our protocol reduces, in some sense, providing anonymous communication against active attacks to providing a padding scheme against passive attacks. It uses timestamping to enforce timing patterns and redundancy to deal with both malicious and benign delays. Because of an asymmetry between sending data to a destination and receiving data from a destination, the protocol uses different techniques in each direction. Our analytical results show that anonymity can be made arbitrarily good at the cost of some added latency and required bandwidth. We also perform measurements on the Tor network to estimate the real-world performance of our protocol, showing that the added delay is not excessive...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of brake pad moisture {{effect on the}} passenger car's braking efficiency was carried out. The study aims to assess the change of the car‘s stopping distance at different pad irrigation parameters. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the ultimate change of stopping distance, the length of stopping time and what variations of breaking parameters determine the efficiency of stopping. In this study it was determined what parameters condition the efficiency of breaking when the brake pads are damp. The change of breaking system efficiency was calculated from the moment of brake pedal operation to a full vehicle stop. For this investigation, a pad irritating system was installed in a chosen vehicle. The data of the test was recorded with DL 1 Mk 2 classical data recorder. MS Excel was used for calculations and graphical presentation of the results. According to the results of the study, the alteration of friction coefficient of <b>breaking</b> <b>pads</b> was assessed for both wet and dry braking pads. The change of breaking efficiency at different pad irrigation parameters was calculated. The course of investigation, analysis of calculation and the results of the study are presented in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|The {{operation}} {{is referred to}} as [...] "padding" [...] because originally, random material was simply appended to the message to make it long enough for the primitive. This form of padding is not secure and is therefore no longer applied. A modern padding scheme aims to ensure that the attacker cannot manipulate the plaintext to exploit the mathematical structure of the primitive and will usually be accompanied by a proof, often in the random oracle model, that <b>breaking</b> the <b>padding</b> scheme is as hard as solving the hard problem underlying the primitive.|$|R
50|$|Tripping on an iBook cord or yanking {{the cord}} out {{at an angle}} could bend the spring {{contacts}} inside the connector or <b>break</b> the solder <b>pads</b> under the connector, resulting in a laptop that would fail to charge when connected to the cord, or would only charge if the inserted plug were propped up or pushed down at an angle. An especially forceful yank could flare the outer flange or even break {{the tip of the}} power plug.|$|R
40|$|We review, {{implement}} {{and evaluate}} a recent method for <b>breaking</b> one time <b>pad</b> ciphers {{when the same}} pad is reused. The attack can also be applied {{to a number of}} other ciphers when they are used incorrectly. Some possible enhancements to the algorithm are discussed, including how to exploit multiple reuses of the same pad, what happens when the the encryption function is not a group operation, how to parallelize the algorithm and how to deal with gaps in the ciphertexts. The method works by considering the plaintexts ¯p 1 and ¯p 2 as generated by n-gram Markov models L 1 and L 2 chosen in such a way so as to resemble the real languages in which the texts were written. Given the models, the method implicitly builds a hidden Markov model of the cross product L 1 ×L 2. The most likely recovery of the plaintexts given the ciphertexts ¯c 1, ¯c 2 corresponds to the most likely path through the HMM subject to the constraints that ¯p 1 ⊕ ¯ k = ¯c 1 and ¯p 2 ⊕ ¯ k = ¯c 2 for some choice of ¯ k. In principle, the problem can be solved by the Viterbi algorithm, but {{in order to avoid the}} prohibitive time and memory requirements of exploring the complete state graph, we prune the graph by keeping only the N most probable states in each iteration. Although this sacrifices the optimality of the Viterbi algorithm, it works quite well in practice, successfully recovering about 97 − 99 % of all characters depending on the texts. It also reduces the complexity to O(log(|A|) N min(|¯c 1 |, |¯c 2 |)) memory and O(|A|N min(|¯c 1 |, |¯c 2 |)) time, where A is the set of all possible message characters...|$|R
