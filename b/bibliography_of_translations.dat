40|$|In many countries, the {{teaching}} <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> institutionally vacillates between an academically based {{education and a}} mainly practically oriented translator training. With {{the introduction of the}} new Bachelor-Master structures, the authorities in Flanders (the Dutch speaking part of Belgium) have clearly opted for an academic Master that will be fully integrated in existing university structures. The development <b>of</b> <b>Translation</b> Studies in the last decades has offered many instruments and approaches for safeguarding the academic basis and diversity <b>of</b> <b>translation</b> teaching. One <b>of</b> those instruments is translation description. Most students think in a very normative way about translation. Especially in a teaching situation, they ask for a prescriptive approach and want to know what is ‘good’ and what is ‘bad’. Translation description surpasses this dichotomy and opens up a narrow black-and-white thinking. It thus reveals the great variety of strategies and techniques actually used by translators. On the basis of a two-way comparison of the texts (source-target as well as target-source), the descriptive analyses made by the students precede the evaluation.
