5|$|Dead Island, {{originally}} {{announced in}} 2007 by Techland, is an action role-playing survival horror video game. Set in a zombie-infested tropical island called Banoi, the game focuses heavily on melee combat. According to Techland, {{it was a}} game about killing zombies, not a game focused on delivering an emotional experience. Until 2011, Techland declined to give new information regarding the game as requested by the game's publisher, Deep Silver. With the lack of new information surrounding the game, many critics believed that the game had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> cancelled. The game was released on February 16, 2011, approximately four years after the game's initial announcement.|$|E
5|$|After Alvarado's brutal {{suppression}} of western Honduras, indigenous resistance against the Spanish had coalesced around the Lenca warleader Lempira, who was reputed to have led {{an army of}} thirty thousand native warriors. Lempira had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> building a powerful alliance in southern Higueras, in the mountains south of Gracias a Dios. Its political centre was at the town of the Lenca ruler Entepica, and its greatest stronghold was Lempira's hilltop fortress at Peñol de Cerquín. Lempira also attracted support from the native inhabitants Comayagua valley, and the San Pedro mountains. Even former enemies of Lempira, such as the Cares, swore allegiance to him after he overcame them in battle; though a mixture of force and diplomacy, Lempira's alliance extended as far as San Miguel, in eastern El Salvador, and encompassed some 200 towns. Resistance continued from 1537 into 1538, until Lempira and his forces were defeated in battle by the Spanish, led by Alonso de Cáceres.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered by legal or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E

5|$|Marriage {{plans were}} {{confirmed}} and Poe returned to Baltimore {{to file for}} a marriage license on September 22, 1835. The couple might have <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> married as well, though accounts are unclear. Their only public ceremony was in Richmond on May 16, 1836, when they were married by a Presbyterian minister named Rev. Amasa Converse. Poe was 27 and Virginia was 13, though her age was listed as 21. This marriage bond was filed in Richmond and included an affidavit from Thomas W. Cleland confirming the bride's alleged age. The ceremony {{was held in the}} evening at the home of a Mrs. James Yarrington, the owner of the boarding house in which Poe, Virginia, and Virginia's mother Maria Clemm were staying. Yarrington helped Maria Clemm bake the wedding cake and prepared a wedding meal. The couple then had a short honeymoon in Petersburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has in fact <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man I Used to Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E

25|$|In 1977 rumours began {{circulating}} in the Rhodesian press that Walls had become deeply {{pessimistic about the}} future of Rhodesia, and that he had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> preparing to abandon the country and personally relocate his family into South Africa, and had covertly purchased property there for this purpose. Seeking to scotch these allegations, with the attenuation they would have to the military morale of the troops still fighting under his command, he publicly issued a denial they had any basis in truth.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, exhuming and {{identifying}} the bodies in almost 60 identified but unopened mass burial sites remains a problem.

It is not unusual for reconstruction crews in Grozny to run across collections of bodies, and some of them have <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> moved {{to make room for the}} rebuilding. According to the pro-Moscow Chechen government, 4,825 people disappeared, without a trace, in the republic from 1994 to July 2008.|$|E

25|$|The British had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> arming gendarmes, the {{so-called}} B-Gendarmerie, since 1945 and discussed {{the creation of}} a proper Austrian military in 1947. The Americans feared that Vienna could be the scene of another Berlin Blockade. They set up and filled emergency food dumps, and prepared to airlift supplies to Vienna while the government created a backup base in Salzburg. The American command secretly trained the soldiers of an underground Austrian military at a rate of 200 men a week. The B-Gendarmerie knowingly hired Wehrmacht veterans and VdU members; the denazification of Austria's 537,000 registered Nazis had largely ended in 1948.|$|E
25|$|The Tornado ADV had {{its origins}} in an RAF Air Staff Requirement 395 (or ASR.395), which called for a {{long-range}} interceptor to replace the Lightning F6 and Phantom FGR2. The requirement for a modern interceptor was driven by {{the threat posed by}} the large Soviet long-range bomber fleet, in particular the supersonic Tupolev Tu-22M. From the beginning of the Tornado IDS's development in 1968, the possibility of a variant dedicated to air defence had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> considered; several American aircraft had been evaluated, but found to be unsuitable. However, the concept proved unattractive to the other European partners on the Tornado project, thus the UK elected to proceed in its development alone. On 4March1976, the development of the Tornado ADV was formally approved; it was announced on this day that 165 of the 385 Tornados that were on order for the RAF would be of the Tornado ADV variant.|$|E
25|$|The British tunnellers {{got into}} the German gallery system from a British tunnel {{and were able to}} {{demolish}} the system on 12 March, which relieved the threat of another German mine attack. Skirmishing around the craters diminished and it was thought that the Germans were concentrating on consolidating new positions. On 18 March, the Germans surprised the British with five mines which had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> dug through the clay layer above the chalk. The German attack had nearly as much success as the British attack on 2 March, forcing back the British to the original front line, before local counter-attacks regained some of the craters. When the fighting died down after 19 March, both sides occupied the near lips of the craters. Brigadier-General Cator, the 37th Brigade commander, recommended that attempts to occupy craters should end and the near lips be held instead, because craters were death traps against howitzer and mortar fire and because observation from the crater lip was obstructed by its convex shape and large lumps of chalk brought to the surface by the explosions.|$|E

25|$|The Army {{detailed}} Lahm to {{the fledgling}} Aeronautical Division, a {{section in the}} Office of the Chief Signal Officer (OCSO), on September 17, 1907, {{while he was still}} in Europe. His departure from France was delayed after a relapse of the typhoid he contracted in the spring of 1907 and he took convalescent leave at a rest home in St. Germain. It was in the home's garden on August 1, 1907, the very day that the Aeronautical Division came into being, that Lahm's father introduced him to Wilbur and Orville Wright. The elder Lahm had personally investigated the claims of the brothers and had <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> promoting them among his colleagues in France since 1905. The meeting {{was the beginning of a}} friendship that lasted until the two brothers died. Lahm learned that the Army, through the reluctance and disinterest of the Board of Ordnance and Fortification, had obstructed the attempts of the Wright Brothers to provide the Army with an airplane, and immediately wrote his new superior, Chief Signal Officer (CSO) Brig. Gen. James Allen (who sat on the board), urging that favorable consideration be given their most recent proposal.|$|E
25|$|Leanne {{split up}} with Peter {{and started a}} new {{relationship}} with Nick. They book their wedding for Christmas Day but Leanne visits Peter after Peter confesses he wants her back. Leanne's sister, Eva Price (Catherine Tyldesley) revealed all at the wedding, causing Nick to leave Leanne. Nick confides in his sister-in-law, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane), and she reveals to him that Eva has <b>been</b> <b>quietly</b> causing trouble between him and Leanne. After a heart to heart, they give into temptation and sleep together. They agree {{that it was a}} mistake. Nick and Leanne reconcile and finally marry– just after Kylie announces she is pregnant. Nick encourages Kylie to have an abortion and she nearly goes through with it. David, who is desperate to start a family, discovers Kylie's pregnancy and stops her. David overhears Kylie talking about her one-night stand with Nick, and begins a vendetta on Nick and Leanne, which includes a poison pen letter to Leanne, stolen money, bad reviews on the internet and watering down the spirits at the Bistro. Nick and David went in the Bistro van and started arguing about the one-night stand with Kylie. David was desperate not to let Nick reveal all to Kylie and Leanne, as David feared losing Kylie if she found out what David had done to take revenge on Nick. David tried to get Nick to stop the van. In the struggle, David removes Nick's seatbelt and stops the van {{in the middle of the}} road, which results in the van being hit by a lorry, knocking them both unconscious. David wakes up shortly after with minor injuries, but Nick does not. Nick is left comatose and has a blood clot removed from his brain. While Nick is in his coma, Kylie gives birth to a baby girl, Lily. When Nick awakes from his coma, he suffers a panic attack when he sees David in front of him. Later, when Nick can talk more fluently, he blackmails David to get Lily a paternity test to see who the father is or he will tell the police and the Platt family how the accident was really caused. David does so, and with his friend Tina, he opens the results, revealing that David is the father of baby Lily. Nick later finds life frustrating when he cannot remember simple things. He is discharged from hospital with a walking stick, and goes to live with Leanne. On the day of Lily's christening everything is revealed. Leanne finds out about Nick and Kylie's one-night stand and the entire Platt clan discover that David caused the car accident. They disown David, but Nick is distraught when Leanne flees Weatherfield. She later comes back, but she splits up with Nick after he shouts at Simon and smacks her across the face at Christmas 2013. On the same day, Kylie goes on a drunken rampage and gets arrested. In January 2014, David and Kylie make up.|$|E
500|$|Testimony was {{introduced}} {{entirely in the}} form of sworn affidavits, the most important of which were deemed classified and presented to the court in camera. [...] The government affiants included classification officers, weapon lab scientists, the Secretaries of Energy, State, and Defense, and Nobel physics laureate Hans Bethe, whom Judge Warren cited as the star witness for the plaintiff. [...] The defense side had no experts with direct knowledge of nuclear weapon design, until the unexpected appearance of Ray Kidder, a nuclear weapon designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. [...] One of Kidder’s jobs in 1962 had been to evaluate designs of the 29 thermonuclear devices tested in Operation Dominic. [...] Kidder was able to credibly dispute government arguments in the battle of affidavits, leveling the technical playing field.
