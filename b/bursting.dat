40|$|The Optical <b>Burst</b> Switching {{is a new}} {{switching}} technology that efficiently utilizes the bandwidth in the optical layer. The key areas to be concentrated in Optical <b>Burst</b> Switching (OBS) networks are the <b>burst</b> assembly and <b>burst</b> scheduling i. e., assignment of wavelengths to the incoming <b>bursts.</b> This study presents a New <b>Burst</b> Assembly and Scheduling (NBAS) technique in a simultaneous multipath transmission for <b>burst</b> loss recovery in OBS networks. A Redundant <b>Burst</b> Segmentation (RBS) {{is used for the}} <b>burst</b> assembly. In our proposed algorithm, the proper policy is selected based on the priority of each <b>burst,</b> the length of each <b>burst</b> and the length of the redundant data. After assembling the <b>burst,</b> the <b>burst</b> scheduler algorithm schedules the <b>burst.</b> This algorithm is responsible for the output wavelength and contention-free fiber delay lines to switch every <b>burst</b> payload to its target output fiber. The OBS network simulator (nOBS) patch in NS- 2 is used to simulate our network. NBAS technique improves the quality of service constraints like delivery ratio, delay compared to RBS technique.

40|$|Abstract — Optical <b>burst</b> {{switching}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} promising technologies in the optical domain. In OBS network, <b>bursts</b> of data consisting of multiple packets are switched through the network all optically. A <b>burst</b> header packet is transmitted ahead of the <b>burst</b> in order to configure the switches along the <b>burst’s</b> route. The <b>burst</b> header and the <b>bursts</b> are separated at the source, as well as subsequent intermediate nodes, by an offset time. Even though OBS has a greater advantage with high speed data transfer but if suffers from security vulnerabilities. Once the <b>burst</b> header is redirected by the malicious node, the <b>burst</b> may redirect to fake destination. In this paper, we discuss the various <b>burst</b> integrity algorithms for optical <b>burst</b> switched networks. Moreover we conclude that Secure Hash Algorithm finds to be an optimal solution for <b>burst</b> integrity...|$|R

50|$|There are two {{representative}} <b>burst</b> buffer architectures in the {{high-performance computing}} environments: node-local <b>burst</b> buffer and remote shared <b>burst</b> buffer. In the node-local <b>burst</b> buffer architecture, <b>burst</b> buffer storage {{is located on}} the individual compute node, so the aggregate <b>burst</b> buffer bandwidth grows linearly with the compute node count. This scalability benefit has been well-documented in recent literature.It also comes with the demand for a scalable metadata management strategy to maintain a global namespace for data distributed across all the <b>burst</b> buffers. In the remote shared <b>burst</b> buffer architecture, <b>burst</b> buffer storage resides on a fewer number of I/O nodes positioned between the compute nodes and the back-end storage systems. Data movement between the compute nodes and <b>burst</b> buffer needs to go through the network. Placing <b>burst</b> buffer on the I/O nodes facilitates the independent development, deployment and maintenance of the <b>burst</b> buffer service. Hence, several well-known commercialized software products have been developed to manage this type of <b>burst</b> buffer, such as DataWarp and Infinite Memory Engine.|$|R

40|$|Preemption {{techniques}} have been recently proposed for service differentiation in Optical <b>Burst</b> Switching (OBS) networks. According to [1], an incoming <b>burst</b> {{with the same}} priority that the <b>burst</b> in service will preempt the wavelength if the residual length of the <b>burst</b> in service is smaller than the incoming <b>burst</b> transmission time. For a network scenario with no wavelength conversion, the preemption probability is evaluated assuming Exponential, Gaussian and Pareto-distributed <b>burst</b> sizes. Knowledge of the preemption dynamics at an OBS switch is a fundamental issue in performance evaluation, since the downstream switches will surely be affected. An analytical upper bound is provided, that shows that the preemption probability depends on the <b>burst</b> size distribution, which in turn depends on the <b>burst</b> assembly technique used at the network edges. On the other hand, not only truncated <b>bursts</b> result from preemption, as reported in other studies, but also the <b>burst</b> size distribution for preempting <b>bursts</b> is shifted to larger values.
