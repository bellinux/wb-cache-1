The Park Service wanted to build dormitories next to Camp 4, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> Frost, the American Alpine Club and others succeeded in killing the plan. Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 21, 2003, because of {{its role in the}} development of rock climbing as a sport.|$|E

The show placed first in the Nielsen Media Research ratings for the week with a 21.6 million person viewership. This placed it ahead of runner-up 60 Minutes, which had an audience of 20.7 million.

Tom (Aziz Ansari) suggests they hire Entertainment 720 for the event, a production company recently started by his friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz). Jean-Ralphio encourages Tom to come work with him on the company, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> is reluctant to leave his city hall job.

5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death.

Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex {{in the way of}} getting to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when the gun is shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E
5|$|The Giants scored {{first for}} the second {{consecutive}} game, as Orlando Cepeda singled with one out in the second inning and scored on a double by Felipe Alou against Dodgers' starter Don Drysdale. The Giants then extended their lead {{in the top of the}} sixth inning. Alou struck out to open the inning <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> Haller then walked and advanced to third base on a double by José Pagán. Giants' starter Jack Sanford then reached based on a throwing error by Drysdale, which also allowed Haller to score and advanced Pagán to third base. Chuck Hiller and Jim Davenport followed this with successive singles which scored Pagán and Sanford respectively. This made the score 4–0 in favor of the Giants with Hiller on second and Sanford on first, still with only one out in the inning. Ed Roebuck entered in relief of Drysdale, inducing an out at second base on a groundball by Willie Mays, to leave runners at the corners with two outs. Willie McCovey singled, allowing Hiller to score and make the game 5–0; Cepeda was then retired to end the inning.|$|E

He bled profusely, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> Carrington, artist for the Australasian Sketcher, stopped the haemorrhage with his handkerchief. Hare then ordered O'Connor to surround the hotel, and later attempted to return to the battle but gradually lost so much blood that he had to be conveyed to Benalla by a special railway engine.|$|E
60|$|There {{was some}} little embarrassment, and I could {{perceive}} an impulse in Julia to press nearer to her rival, as if impelled by a generous wish to manifest her sympathy. <b>But</b> <b>Tom's</b> protest soon silenced every thing else, and we alighted, and soon went to rest.|$|R

25|$|Braniff's {{survival}} was assured when Paul Braniff, then general manager, flew to Washington, D.C. to petition for the Chicago-Dallas airmail route 9. The United States Post Office granted Braniff its first airmail route {{in the wake}} of the 1934 Air Mail scandal. In 1935 Braniff became the first airline to fly from Chicago to the U.S.–Mexico border. Paul Braniff left the airline in 1935 to pursue other interests and tour South America for Braniff's eventual service to the region, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> Braniff retained control of the carrier and hired Charles Edmund Beard to run day-to-day operations. Beard became President and CEO of Braniff in 1954, and Fred Jones of Oklahoma City became Chairman of the Board.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than simply}} sneaking Jim {{out of the}} shed where he is being held, Tom {{develops}} an elaborate plan to free him, involving secret messages, a hidden tunnel, snakes in a shed, a rope ladder sent in Jim's food, and other elements from adventure books he has read, including an anonymous note to the Phelps warning them of the whole scheme. During the actual escape and resulting pursuit, Tom is shot in the leg, while Jim remains by his side, risking recapture rather than completing his escape alone. Although a local doctor admires Jim's decency, he has Jim arrested in his sleep {{and returned to the}} Phelps. After this, events quickly resolve themselves. Tom's Aunt Polly arrives and reveals Huck and Tom's true identities to the Phelps family. Jim is revealed to be a free man: Miss Watson died two months earlier and freed Jim in her will, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> (who already knew this) chose not to reveal this information to Huck so that he could come up with an artful rescue plan for Jim. Jim tells Huck that Huck's father (Pap Finn) has been dead for some time (he was the dead man they found earlier in the floating house), and so Huck may now return safely to St. Petersburg. Huck is rewarded six hundred dollars for saving the aunts from the con men. Huck gives most of it to Jim for his family. Huck declares that he is quite glad to be done writing his story, and despite Sally's plans to adopt and civilize him, he intends to flee west to Indian Territory.|$|E

Some photographers catch her in the stranger's arms and the district attorney accuses her of stealing Cousins' jewelry and jails her.

However, Ben relents when Tom invites him again at Leslie's urging (Ben also notes that [...] "Dennis Feinstein" [...] is an oddly ordinary name for a cologne designer, <b>but</b> <b>Tom</b> explains that Dennis' real name, [...] "Dante Fiero", is considered less exotic here). Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) and Andy (Chris Pratt) are now dating, but Andy is worried he is too broke to take her out.|$|E
