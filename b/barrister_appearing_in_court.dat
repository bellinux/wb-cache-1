But, he eventually took high rank at the equity bar, and argued with much success before the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the High Court of Australia (an institution whose creation he had vigorously supported). He became a KC in 1905.

40|$|Extract] Most lawyers — but I {{venture to}} suggest all judges — owe an incalculable {{intellectual}} debt to their law teachers. Memories {{of my days}} at the Sydney Law School come flooding back: of Dr Currey’s inscrutable mien as he told the marvellous story of English legal history. The disciplined Pat Lane, comfortable in the analytical jurisprudence then so dominant in the constitutional law of the High Court of Australia. The mercurial Frank Hutley, whose unpredictable examination questions {{on the law of}} succession were every law student’s nightmare. The busy and elegant Gordon Samuels, instructing us in the late afternoons in the niceties of common law pleading. Little did I think I would share the Bench for a time with Hutley and Samuels. The intrepid David Benjafield, ever cheerful. The painstaking Ross Parsons. Bill Morison, whose lectures on torts were models of clarity. The gentle Ilmar Tammelo who did not live to see his beloved Estonia freed from Russian rule. The incisive Tony Blackshield, still at work in his instruction, then a promising acolyte of Julius Stone. And above all “Big Julie” himself, whose profound influence on the Sydney legal scene cannot be overstated. One distinguished judge, hesitant over the recent burst of creativity <b>in</b> the High <b>Court</b> of Australia, asserted to me recently that he could understand it only by reference to the common approach of the Sydney Justices and the influence upon them — directly or indirectly — of the instruction of Julius Stone concerning the judicial function. I take this occasion to pay tribute to my own law teachers. Instruction in the law never ceases so long as one practises its stern discipline. Every day I continue to be instructed by the passages I read, or which are read to me, from judicial and academic writing. Academic texts are used today <b>in</b> <b>courts</b> as never before. Happily (as I am sure you will agree) scholars do not now need to die in order that their works might be acknowledged <b>in</b> <b>court.</b> That was always to require too large a sacrifice which even those passionate for the law might have felt reluctant to pay. Led by the High Court of Australia, the Australian courts are now much more ready to receive and use academic writing from at home and abroad. Ours is an enormous international legal treasure-house. Computers can retrieve a huge mass of data. They can do so {{in a matter of minutes}} and from the far side of the world. Judges usually have little time to reflect languidly upon the problems before them. Often they stumble, by instinct or feeling for the law, upon decisions which point them in the right direction. Scholars, typically, have more time to give thought to where the law is, where it is going and where it has gone wrong. Ceaselessly, I press my inquisitiveness upon the <b>barristers</b> who <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> my <b>court.</b> All too often they are captives to the instruction of their faraway days in law school. The only comparative law they know is English law. That is the law which they have in books on their shelves. Whilst this is truly a wonderful source of information and opinion, we should not be hostage to it. At least since Cook v Cook, 1 Australian lawyers should have realised that no English decision binds them and that no English law has more precedential authority than the law of any other land...|$|R

40|$|It is {{of great}} {{significance}} for witnesses to <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>in</b> criminal cases so as to safeguard the right of confrontation of the defendant and achieve judicial justice. However, the witnesses in criminal cases refuse to <b>appear</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> and only give written testimony, and {{this has become a}} long-standing problem in the judicial practice of China. To solve this problem, the Criminal Procedure Law of China, amended and improved the system of the witness <b>appearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>in</b> 2012. Nevertheless, if the underlying problems in the judicial system of China are not settled, the system of the witness <b>appearing</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> <b>in</b> criminal cases still cannot turn into practicable measures...|$|R
