50|$|The vertically-cut Pathé discs {{normally}} {{required a}} special Pathé phonograph {{equipped with a}} sapphire <b>ball</b> <b>stylus.</b> The advantage of the sapphire <b>ball</b> <b>stylus</b> was its permanence. There {{was no need to}} change a needle after every record side. Since most records and phonographs used a different playback method, various attachments were marketed that allowed one to equip a Pathé phonograph to play standard, laterally-cut records. Attachments were also sold to equip a standard phonograph to play Pathé records.|$|E
50|$|Gennett Records {{was founded}} in Richmond, Indiana, by the Starr Piano Company. It {{released}} its first records in October 1917. The company took its name from its top managers: Harry, Fred and Clarence Gennett. Earlier, the company had produced recordings under the Starr Records label. The early issues were vertically cut in the gramophone record grooves, using the hill-and-dale method of a U-shaped groove and sapphire <b>ball</b> <b>stylus,</b> but they switched to the more popular lateral cut method in April 1919.|$|E
50|$|A further {{development}} was {{the addition of}} motors for driving each axis. Operators {{no longer had to}} physically touch the machine but could drive each axis using a handbox with joysticks {{in much the same way}} as with modern remote controlled cars. Measurement accuracy and precision improved dramatically with the invention of the electronic touch trigger probe. The pioneer of this new probe device was David McMurtry who subsequently formed what is now Renishaw plc. Although still a contact device, the probe had a spring-loaded steel ball (later ruby <b>ball)</b> <b>stylus.</b> As the probe touched the surface of the component the stylus deflected and simultaneously sent the X.Y,Z coordinate information to the computer. Measurement errors caused by individual operators became fewer and the stage was set for the introduction of CNC operations and the coming of age of CMMs.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Creation of a {{mathematical}} model, which combine ball tip radius error and small tilt of the stylus todetermine translational motion (in two directions) of the <b>stylus</b> <b>ball</b> centre, {{due to the}} surface slope. Design/methodology/approach: First error is described on two dimensional model, thus is very simple. Secondmodel is based on 3 D-mathematical model, which is a basis to determine (and plot) translational movement ofthe <b>stylus</b> <b>ball</b> according to surface slope. Findings: Accurate scanning process on freeform surface with touch trigger probe head could not be performed,due to number of reasons connected to the <b>stylus</b> <b>ball</b> and trigger probe head errors. Research limitations/implications: According to nature of this problem, 4 D, 5 D and 6 D-graphs could not beplotted, which would define translational motion of the <b>stylus</b> <b>ball</b> centre at any slope surface. Practical implications: Understanding the physical model for described error is a basis to create mathematicalcompensation error model. Originality/value: No such mathematical model to determine translational motion (in two directions) of thestylus ball centre was published in any paper before...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{analysis}} is to filter the raw data to remove very high frequency data (called [...] "micro-roughness") since it can often be attributed to vibrations or debris on the surface. Filtering out the micro-roughness at a given cut-off threshold also allows to bring closer the roughness assessment made using profilometers having different <b>stylus</b> <b>ball</b> radius e.g. 2 µm and 5 µm radii. Next, the data is separated into roughness, waviness and form. This can be accomplished using reference lines, envelope methods, digital filters, fractals or other techniques. Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics.|$|R
40|$|To measure various {{components}} with nano-scale precision, a new high-precision touch-trigger probe using a single low-cost sensor for a micro-coordinate measuring machine (CMM) {{is presented in}} this paper. The sensor is composed of a laser diode, a plane mirror, a focusing lens, and a quadrant photo detector (QPD). The laser beam from the laser diode with an incident angle is reflected by the plane mirror and then projected onto the quadrant photo detector (QPD) via the focusing lens. The plane mirror is adhered to the upper surface of the floating plate supported by an elastic mechanism, which can transfer the displacement of the <b>stylus’s</b> <b>ball</b> tip in 3 D to the plane mirror’s vertical and tilt movement. Both motions of the plane mirror can be detected by respective QPDs. The probe mechanism was analyzed, and its structural parameters that conform {{to the principle of}} uniform sensitivity and uniform stiffness were obtained. The simulation result showed that the stiffness was equal in 3 D and less than 1 mN/µm. Some experiments were performed to investigate the probe’s characteristics. It was found that the probe could detect the trigger point with uniform sensitivity, a resolution of less than 5 nm, and a repeatability of less than 4 nm. It {{can be used as a}} touch-trigger probe on a micro/nano-CMM...|$|R
