25|$|From 1869, Beizadea George based {{himself in}} Paris, {{purchasing}} {{an apartment on}} Boulevard Haussmann, and, in 1871, also an Empire-style château in Bécon-les-Bruyères. The latter had been a temporary home by Adolphe Thiers, and then an Orsini residence; heavily damaged by the Paris Commune, it was restored and enlarged by its new owner. Settling in France for good, he forfeited his inheritance of the Știrbei Palace on Calea Victoriei, which went to his brothers, alongside the Buftea estates. Instead, he took his parents' residence in Nice and most of Barbu's French assets. The issue, contested {{between him and his}} siblings, was settled at the Court of Cassation in 1873. This landmark case imposed on him to share the villa with the other inheritors, with special criteria for calculating the inheritance tax. At the time, Știrbei was suing the administration of Paris for damages to his château, taking Jules Favre as his lawyer. In 1882, as Paris auctioned off the ruins of Tuileries Palace, also destroyed by the Commune, Știrbei purchased the fence, which became part of <b>Bécon</b> complex.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1875, when Carpeaux {{was made}} Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor, Știrbei {{was the first}} to bring him the news, at the church in Courbevoie. The artist died a few weeks later at <b>Bécon,</b> [...] "consoled by the {{touching}} care of his princely host." [...] Controversially, Știrbei had purchased Carpeaux's drawings (including his study after the cadaver of Victor Liet) and his seal of authenticity, which technically allowed him to pass plaster cast as the originals; for several years, he battled in court with the Carpeaux estate over ownership of these items, ultimately relinquishing the seal. Before donating the drawings, Știrbei released them as an album, published using photoengraving. Carpeaux's tomb was another issue of contention: the Prince had ordered the body to be buried in Courbevoie, giving it a lavish funeral. The widow, who was kept absent from the ceremony, sued and won, taking the remains to Valenciennes.|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 to 1902, Știrbei edited a posthumous {{edition of}} Weiss' {{complete}} works at Calmann-Lévy, followed in 1910 by his monograph J.-J. Weiss, conférencier, chroniqueur de théâtre, journaliste. His own one-act comedy, La légende de Saint Déodat, came out at Firmin Didot in 1905, with illustrations by Maurice Leloir. In 1906, Prince George welcomed to Paris the Romanian student Eugen Lovinescu, directing his own research on J.-J. Weiss. At the time, as [...] "James Caterly", he published the monograph Les Roumains (1908), which Lovinescu would translate and publish in Romania in 1909 or 1910. Știrbei's new protege was reserved in his overall {{opinion of the}} prince, writing that his Paris home resembled an old [...] "boyar mansion", replete with objets d'art from the Orient. These, Lovinescu believed, were there to show that Știrbei missed his Wallachia. According to Știrbei's own words, he lived [...] "surrounded by memories, by his books, in quiet isolation". From the 1880s onward, he had slowly divided his art objects were between the Louvre, the École des Beaux-Arts, and the Angers and Valenciennes Museums; others preserved at their original location in <b>Bécon.</b> He made the news again in August 1910, {{when one of his}} most trusted servants stole his wife's jewelry, worth 18,000 French francs, from her apartment on Boulevard de Courcelles.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of abnormal odor fish owing to {{industrial waste water}} from oil or its combinative industrial factories around the Miziushia waters was surveyed and the followings were obtained as the result. 1) It was found {{that almost all of}} abnormal odor fishes in the Migushima waters grow around the Mizushima harbour where many exits of industrial waste water from factories are gathered. The area of the distribution is <b>beconing</b> more extensive with the degree of 1 or 2 Km. every year, and it has stretched 8 Km. to the south and 12 Km. to the west around the Mizushima harbour. 2) Fishes having the high swimmung activity (ex. common sea-bass, gizzard shad and gray mullet etc.) were found as abnormal odor fishes as far as the border of the distribution area, and fishes having the low activity (ex. rock, bleak sea-bream and surf-fish etc.) were found within 1 Km. {{from the mouth of the}} harbour. And the following is thinkable that fishes gather to the warm water of the Mizushima harbour owing to the high temperature of waste water of factaries and there become abnormal odor fishes, and in spring when water becomes warm, they scatter away from the harbour...|$|R

[...] Although the work is commonly attributed to Cranmer, its detailed origins are obscure [...] A group of bishops and divines met first at Chertsey and then at Windsor in 1548, drawn from both conservatives and reformers, agreed only [...] "the service of the church {{ought to be in}} the mother tongue" [...] Cranmer collected the material from many sources; even the opening of Preface (above) was borrowed [...] He borrowed much from German sources, particularly from work commissioned by Hermann von Wied, Archbishop of Cologne; and also from Osiander (to whom he was related by marriage) [...] The Church Order of Brandenberg and Nuremberg was partly the work of the latter. Many phrases are characteristic of the German reformer Martin Bucer, or of the Italian Peter Martyr, (who was staying with Cranmer {{at the time of the}} finalising of drafts), or of his chaplain, Thomas <b>Becon.</b> However, to Cranmer is [...] "credited the overall job of editorship and the overarching structure of the book" [...] including the systematic amendment of his materials to remove any idea that human merit contributed to their salvation [...]|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are still}} {{occasionally}} subject to panics. For instance, {{there was a}} bad one the other night when the troops took the Chateau of <b>Becon,</b> and again at Clamart, but I fancy that is owing to the mistake the Communists made in forcing men who are altogether opposed to them into their ranks. These men naturally bolt directly they are attacked, and that causes a panic among the others who would have fought had the rest stood. Still, altogether, they are fighting infinitely better than expected, and at Clamart they fought really well in the open for the first time. Before, I own that my only feelings towards the battalions of beetle-browed ruffians from the faubourgs was disgust, now I am beginning to feel a respect for them, but it makes the prospect here all the darker.|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} behaviour of animal groups serves {{to reduce the}} risk of predation to individuals. By joining a group individuals remain in close proximity to others which reduces the risk of predation. Groups can also afford benefits by allowing for early detection of predators. During predatory attacks groups may confuse or deter predators by making it difficult for single individuals to be targeted. The mechanisms underlying many aspects of {{collective behaviour}} in response to predation are not well known. Here we review the models and studies of collective responses to predation and propose some underlying mechanisms for collective detection, evasion and communication about predators. In foraging flocks collective detection benefits individuals by providing them earlier detection of predators then when alone. Vigilance behaviour of neighboring individuals is copied. The amount of individuals displaying vigilant behaviour reaches a threshold level where the group initiates escape behaviors. Therefore predators raise vigilance levels and allow individuals to detect and escape predation earlier. Predators also attack free flying or free swimming groups. Here information about the location fo the predator may be spread through agitation wave. These waves of changing density have been shown the orient individual group members towards the location of the predator. These waves may also serve to confuse a predation attempt by making it harder for a predator to single out an individual within the group. Often prey species possess highly reflective feather or scale which reflect waves of light during agitation wave propagation, which may in turn further the confusion effect. In addition to performing waves free flying / swimming groups also exhibit consistent flocking patterns. These patterns have been shown reflect the level of predation risk experienced at certain areas. It is possible that flocking patterns represent honest signals of environmental conditions and may therefore serve as communication <b>becons</b> to other groups. Findings that neighboring groups tend to copy flocking patterns lends some support for this, albeit its mechanisms are unknown. However all aspects of collective behaviour involve groups moving and making decisions as a coordinated whole. Collective anti-predatory behaviour could be caused through individual threshold responses leading feeding back to collective group level behavior. In all situations individual responses to the presence or attack of a predator reaches a certain level when positive feedback, through coping neighboring behaviors, spreads this behaviour through the entire group. This process allows groups to make informed and accurate decision when detecting, evading and communicating about predators...|$|R
