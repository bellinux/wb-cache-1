40|$|The {{retrieval}} {{problem for}} a knowledge <b>base</b> <b>O</b> and a concept C is to find all individuals a such that O entails C(a). We describe a method to represent a knowledge <b>base</b> <b>O</b> as an instance �O of a relational database. To answer a retrieval query over O, we can execute a corresponding database query over �O. The main problem of such an embedding is that the semantics of knowledge bases is characterized by an open world assumption while traditional databases feature a closed world semantics. Our procedure is sound and complete for knowledge bases given in the description logic ALN...|$|R

Population method survey is implemented to 28 BUMN manufacturers in Indonesia. The data used are primary and secondary data. Then, the hypothesis is tested using path analysis. The results show that: 1) Top management commitment and perceptions of division managers have no significant relationship with the application o f the basic pillars o f Total Quality management in BUMN manufacturer.
