5|$|A study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) {{found that}} growing sweet sorghum instead of grain sorghum could {{increase}} farmers incomes by US$40 per hectare per crop {{because it can}} provide food, feed and fuel.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{there were}} so many {{uncritical}} and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.|$|E

40|$|There {{are four}} {{questions}} that {{will try to}} answer in this paper, namely (1) what is the context {{which can be used}} to introduce negative integers?, (2) how to use the context to make the students construct an understanding of negative integers? (3) how to use context to make the students can also construct about (a) to compare two integers, (b) to order some integers, and (c) to add and subtract two integers, and (4) what are the impacts of the teaching material which designed <b>by</b> the <b>researcher?</b> Learning approach which is used <b>by</b> <b>researcher</b> in this design is realistic approach. The designs which were made <b>by</b> <b>researcher</b> are for fourth grade students. There are three main principles of realistic mathematics approach. This type of research that is used <b>by</b> <b>researcher</b> in this research is the design research. According Akker, Gravemeijer, McKeney, and Nieveen (in Akker, Gravemeijer, McKeney, and Nieveen, 2006), the characteristics of development research are (1) an interventionist, (2) an iterative, (3) a process-oriented, (4) an usability oriented and (5) a theory oriented. According Gravemeijer and Cobb (in Akker, Gravemeijer, McKeney, and Nieveen, 2006) there are three phases in the development of research, namely (1) the preparation of the trial design, (2) the trial design, and (3) a retrospective analysis.

5|$|The 2001 study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography {{concluded}} that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere.

5|$|According to a 2011 study {{conducted}} at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium {{should not be}} a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles, as the study estimated that on the order of 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries (about 10kg of lithium per car) could be built with current reserves, as estimated by the U.S. Geological Survey. Another 2011 study <b>by</b> <b>researchers</b> from the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found that there are sufficient lithium resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread use of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles.
