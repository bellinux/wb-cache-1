5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in {{fermentation}} to produce ethanol, and in <b>biogas</b> reactors to produce methane. Scientists are researching the use of algae to produce liquid fuels, and bacteria to convert various forms of agricultural and urban waste into usable fuels.|$|E
5|$|A {{hybrid system}} {{combines}} (C)PV and CSP {{with one another}} or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and <b>biogas.</b> The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output {{as a function of}} demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems are most often found on islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce <b>biogas.</b> In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like <b>biogas</b> fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|A lake {{restoration}} plan {{based on a}} decentralised bioreactor system to eliminate the organic load that enters the lake {{in the form of}} non-point and point source pollutants has also been mooted. Phumdis could be harvested in a sustainable manner by conversion into fuel and compost by installing ‘Plug Flow Bioreactors’ in a modular manner around the lake perimeter. Laboratory tests of key species of phumdis have proved its potential to produce <b>biogas.</b> The bioreactors could also be used to treat sewage and thus arrest flow of organic matter into the lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Biogas,</b> or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that <b>biogas</b> (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic digestion {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock. It is estimated that 0.4 GW of generating capacity might be available from agricultural waste in Scotland. The Scottish Executive and SEPA has funded seven small scale farm trial plants with the British anaerobic digestion company Greenfinch in Southwest Scotland. Landfill sites {{have the potential for}} a further 0.07 GW with sites such as the Avondale Landfill in Falkirk already utilising their potential.|$|E
5|$|Solar power {{tends to}} be {{complementary}} to wind. On daily to weekly timescales, high pressure areas tend to bring clear skies and low surface winds, whereas low pressure areas tend to be windier and cloudier. On seasonal timescales, solar energy peaks in summer, whereas in many areas wind energy is lower in summer and higher in winter. Thus the seasonal variation of wind and solar power tend to cancel each other somewhat. In 2007 the Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, <b>biogas</b> and hydrostorage to provide load-following power around the clock and throughout the year, entirely from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of wind and}} solar PV has the advantage that the two sources complement each other because the peak operating times for each system occur {{at different times of}} the day and year. The power generation of such solar hybrid power systems is therefore more constant and fluctuates less than each of the two component subsystems. Solar power is seasonal, particularly in northern/southern climates, away from the equator, suggesting a need for long term seasonal storage in a medium such as hydrogen or pumped hydroelectric. The Institute for Solar Energy Supply Technology of the University of Kassel pilot-tested a combined power plant linking solar, wind, <b>biogas</b> and hydrostorage to provide load-following power from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{husbandry}} has {{a significant}} impact on the world environment. It is responsible for somewhere between 20 and 33% of the fresh water usage in the world, and livestock, and the production of feed for them, occupy about a third of the earth's ice-free land. Livestock production is a contributing factor in species extinction, desertification, and habitat destruction. Animal agriculture contributes to species extinction in various ways. Habitat is destroyed by clearing forests and converting land to grow feed crops and for animal grazing, while predators and herbivores are frequently targeted and hunted because of a perceived threat to livestock profits; for example, animal husbandry is responsible for up to 91% of the deforestation in the Amazon region. In addition, livestock produce greenhouse gases. Cows produce some 570 million cubic metres of methane per day. Livestock is responsible for 65% of all human-related emissions of the powerful and long-lived greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. As a result, ways of mitigating animal husbandry's environmental impact are being studied. Strategies include using <b>biogas</b> from manure.|$|E
5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. Archaea are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the archaea in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. Archaea are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in <b>biogas</b> production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile archaea that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (archaea {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these archaea, such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling archaea. Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic archaea. These acetotrophs are archaea in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce <b>biogas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for <b>biogas</b> production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
25|$|Another {{option is}} to sell the methane product as <b>biogas.</b> For example, <b>biogas</b> can be compressed, much like natural gas, and used to power motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|A greener {{alternative}} to burning bagasse {{for the production}} of electricity is to convert bagasse into <b>biogas.</b> Technologies are being developed to use enzymes to transform bagasse into advanced biofuel and <b>biogas.</b>|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} harnesses anaerobic microorganisms {{to break}} down the biodegradable component of the waste to produce <b>biogas</b> and soil improver. The <b>biogas</b> can be used to generate electricity and heat.|$|E
25|$|In <b>biogas</b> plants, {{propionic acid}} {{is a common}} {{intermediate}} product, which is formed by fermenting propionic acid bacteria. Its degradation in anaerobic environments (e.g. <b>biogas</b> plants) requires the activity of complex microbial communities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogas</b> grid-{{injection}} is {{the injection}} of <b>biogas</b> into {{the natural gas}} grid. The raw <b>biogas</b> has to be previously upgraded to biomethane. This upgrading implies the removal of contaminants such as hydrogen sulphide or siloxanes, {{as well as the}} carbon dioxide. Several technologies are available for this purpose, being the most widely implemented the pressure swing adsorption (PSA), water or amine scrubbing (absorption processes) and, in the last years, membrane separation.|$|E
25|$|Blackwater from toilets {{could be}} held in conservancy tanks instead of open septic tanks and cess pits and then emptied and transported to <b>biogas</b> reactors; {{alternatively}} the toilets could be connected to <b>biogas</b> reactors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogas</b> can be {{recovered}} from {{mechanical biological treatment}} waste processing systems. Landfill gas, a less clean form of <b>biogas,</b> is produced in landfills through naturally occurring anaerobic digestion. If it escapes into the atmosphere, it is a potential greenhouse gas.|$|E
25|$|Methanogenic archaea are {{responsible}} for all biological sources of methane. Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including termites, ruminants, and cultivated crops. Other sources of methane, the principal component of natural gas, include landfill gas, <b>biogas,</b> and methane hydrate. When methane-rich gases are produced by the anaerobic decay of non-fossil organic matter (biomass), these {{are referred to as}} <b>biogas</b> (or natural <b>biogas).</b> Sources of <b>biogas</b> include swamps, marshes, and landfills, as well as agricultural waste materials such as sewage sludge and manure by way of anaerobic digesters, in addition to enteric fermentation, particularly in cattle. Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in landfill sites. Excluding water vapor, about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and variable trace amounts of hydrogen sulfide and siloxanes. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an explosion hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, flared or burned to produce electricity or heat. <b>Biogas</b> can also be produced by separating organic materials from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. Anaerobic lagoons produce <b>biogas</b> from manure, while <b>biogas</b> reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, <b>biogas</b> is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogas</b> is a {{byproduct}} of the anaerobic digestion process.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{is widely}} used in Germany as a {{feedstock}} for <b>biogas</b> plants. Here the maize is harvested, shredded then placed in silage clamps from which it is fed into the <b>biogas</b> plants. This process makes use of the whole plant rather than simply using the kernels as {{in the production of}} fuel ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The three {{principal}} {{products of}} anaerobic digestion are <b>biogas,</b> digestate, and water.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{is widely}} used {{as a source of}} renewable energy. The process produces a <b>biogas,</b> consisting of methane, carbon dioxide and traces of other ‘contaminant’ gases. This <b>biogas</b> can be used directly as fuel, in combined heat and power gas engines or upgraded to natural gas-quality biomethane. The nutrient-rich digestate also produced can be used as fertilizer.|$|E
25|$|Farmers {{can produce}} <b>biogas</b> from manure from their cattle by using {{anaerobic}} digesters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogas</b> {{may require}} {{treatment}} or 'scrubbing' to refine it {{for use as}} a fuel. Hydrogen sulfide, a toxic product formed from sulfates in the feedstock, is released as a trace component of the <b>biogas.</b> National environmental enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or the English and Welsh Environment Agency, put strict limits on the levels of gases containing hydrogen sulfide, and, if the levels of hydrogen sulfide in the gas are high, gas scrubbing and cleaning equipment (such as amine gas treating) will be needed to process the <b>biogas</b> to within regionally accepted levels. Alternatively, the addition of ferrous chloride FeCl2 to the digestion tanks inhibits hydrogen sulfide production.|$|E
25|$|The Urbino 12 LE buses are {{produced}} for low-entry suburban variety with diesel, CNG or <b>biogas</b> power.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{pre-treatment}} {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the necessary retention time to produce <b>biogas.</b> For example, certain processes shred the substrates to increase the surface area or use a thermal pretreatment stage (such as pasteurisation) to significantly enhance the <b>biogas</b> output. The pasteurisation process {{can also be used to}} reduce the pathogenic concentration in the digesate leaving the anaerobic digester. Pasteurisation may be achieved by heat treatment combined with maceration of the solids.|$|E
25|$|A non-profit, Alofa Tuvalu, is {{promoting}} solar water heating and solar ovens {{as well as}} investigating producing <b>biogas,</b> biodiesel and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Methane is {{also present}} in what is called <b>biogas,</b> {{produced}} by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible renewable energy source.|$|E
25|$|Derive {{agricultural}} and energy products including soil conditioner from composting or co-composting and energy {{products such as}} <b>biogas,</b> charcoal pellets, industrial powdered fuel etc.|$|E
25|$|Diesel fuel is {{produced}} from various sources, {{the most common}} being petroleum. Other sources include biomass, animal fat, <b>biogas,</b> natural gas, and coal liquefaction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biogas</b> {{from the}} Maxson {{wastewater}} treatment plant in Memphis is burned in Allen Fossil Plant, accounting for a generating capacity of 4 MW.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of natural}} gas, Combined Cycle Plants can {{be filled with}} <b>biogas</b> derived from {{agricultural}} and forestry waste, which is often readily available in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|While many kitchens {{belonging}} to poor families {{continue to use}} clay stoves and the older forms of fuel, the urban middle and upper classes usually have gas stoves with cylinders or piped gas attached. Electric cooktops are rarer since they consume {{a great deal of}} electricity, but microwave ovens are gaining popularity in urban households and commercial enterprises. Indian kitchens are also supported by <b>biogas</b> and solar energy as fuel. World's largest solar energy kitchen is built in India. In association with government bodies, India is encouraging domestic <b>biogas</b> plants to support the kitchen system.|$|E
