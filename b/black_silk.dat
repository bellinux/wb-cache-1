5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark <b>black</b> <b>silk</b> serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven <b>black</b> <b>silk</b> with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another item in the collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|On 18September Huskisson's {{body was}} placed in a coffin and covered with <b>black</b> <b>silk.</b> Shortly before midnight a team of men {{prepared}} to move the coffin to a hearse which had been parked outside since the afternoon, but Emily Huskisson refused to allow them to take the body. Instead, she spent another night in the vicarage with the coffin. The next morning she left in a horse-drawn carriage with the windows covered. The coffin, meanwhile, set off in the hearse for Liverpool. Although the funeral party changed horses only at remote and quiet coaching inns to avoid attention, it gathered followers as it progressed; by the time it reached Liverpool Town Hall late that evening, the hearse was followed by at least 10 carriages and more than 500 mourners on foot.|$|E

50|$|Silk, another protein-rich fiber, is {{the most}} {{problematic}} of textiles. Often “weighted” with metallic salts to produce a nicer drape in clothing, <b>silks</b> (especially <b>black</b> <b>silks</b> and silks used in trimmings) rarely hold up to washing and repeated handling. Unlike other proteins, silk is not flame retardant. It quickly becomes brittle when kept in hot, dry conditions, and is highly susceptible to rot when in warm, humid climes.|$|R
60|$|The respectability her {{presence}} gave in our pew, and by our hearth, {{was a great}} comfort to our friends of all degrees.

25|$|Bluestocking was an unflattering {{expression}} in the 18th century for upper-class women who cared about culture and intellectual life and disregarded fashion.

50|$|Gothabilly (sometimes hellbilly) is an {{offshoot}} of psychobilly influenced by the goth subculture. The name is a portmanteau word that combines gothic and rockabilly, first used by the Cramps in the late 1970s to describe their somber blend of rockabilly and punk rock. Since then the term has come to describe a fashion style influenced by gothic fashion, as seen in its use of <b>black</b> <b>silks,</b> satins, lace and velvet, corsets, top hats, antique jewelry, PVC, and leather.|$|R

For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with <b>black</b> <b>silk</b> facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black frock coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E

In front of it, mounted on a fine horse, sat a still finer lady, a very large and handsome lady, dressed in <b>black</b> <b>silks,</b> and wearing a black lace veil that hung from her head. At her side was another lady, much muffled up as though she found the climate cold, and riding between them, on a pony, a gallant looking little boy. After these came servants, male and female, six or eight of them, and last of all a great wain, laden with baggage, drawn by four big Flemish horses.|$|R
