This is {{demonstrated in the}} opening lines: [...] "You know I hate sleepin alone, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that you will soon be home. But baby, {{that was a long}} time ago." [...] As the song progresses, she also wonders: [...] "What about my body, body?/You don’t want my body, body." [...] According to Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, the female protagonist [...] "literally packs up her pussy" [...] and leaves the man who no longer seems interested in her, shown in the chorus lines: [...] "Let's go, little kitty kat / I think it's time to go / He don't want you anymore." [...] Similarly, Makkada B. Selah of The Village Voice noted that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] was a threat for [...] "jetting" [...] and John Boone of E! Online commented that it was about Knowles' sex organ. Eb Haynes of AllHipHop commented that [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] warns all restless boys that they too, become restless. Elysa Gardner of USA Today commented that the lyrics of the song include raw feelings for an unfaithful lover which are sung with [...] "sass".|$|E

"I Said" [...] {{includes}} {{elements of}} EDM, and a fuzzy bass that [...] "dominate the song {{even more than}} his [...] repetitive chorus of “I said I said I said it's real / I said I said I said take the wheel / <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you said you said no deal.”" [...] The song was described by Allmusic as a [...] "rubbery midtempo ballad that injects a smidgen of melancholy into the proceedings." [...] "Tonight" [...] has an instrumentation of a disco bass, and the drumbeat and bass of the song [...] "makes the song the most authentically danceable on the album," [...] according to Popmatters. [...] "I Wonder" [...] has a [...] "chopped and screwed beat and dancing piano lines" [...] that [...] "is club pop for the PBR set," [...] according to Paste Magazine. Lyrically, the song deals with getting older and [...] "staying put". [...] "Much Too Late" [...] is [...] "a rant that seems {{to come out of}} nowhere and doesn't fit in with anything else on this record," [...] as described by PopMatters. [...] "Ten Dollars I Found" [...] is the last track of the album, and was described by Popmatters as the only real ballad from the album.|$|E

And John, it was about something you said a few weeks ago, actually. You said the title tag is a ranking signal, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search. Help says pretty much the same things, as does Matt Cutts, in one of this [...]|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{will last}} a long time, well taken care of, <b>but</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> had a sting. Did {{you mean that}} you wouldn't give me {{anything}} more enduring?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. Yes, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} that a severe chill was not hereditary.|$|E
60|$|ATTEN. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that {{he would}} also rob his father, methinks that was an unnatural thing.|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. <b>But</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{yourself}} that his second thoughts were sometimes such an improvement on the first.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{they are}} only equal in duties and in rights. <b>But,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>said</b> just now, {{that is a very}} long story. Are they equal in nothing here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|McMurdo nodded. [...] "Good for you, Brother Baldwin," [...] he said. [...] "You and I {{have had}} our differences, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> have <b>said</b> the true word to-night." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Pardon me, Bishop Helmsdale, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{just now}} that we are strangers; so what you saw in my cabin {{concerns}} me only.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't see {{the back}} of mine, <b>but</b> <b>you</b> can,' <b>said</b> Edgar, lifting her down, and {{proceeding}} {{to take off his}} coat and roll up his shirt- sleeve.|$|R
60|$|Har. Send one {{to seize}} him strait. [Exit a Messenger.] <b>But</b> what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> that Towerson was guiltless of my son's death, I easily believe, and never thought otherwise, though I dissembled.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{provoked}} him," [...] Louis said firmly. [...] "You {{gave him}} provocation such as no gentleman of honour could suffer.
