5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. The {{life expectancy of}} slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, leading to a rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves. Colonial society was largely divided over the religious and moral implications of slavery and colonies passed acts for and against the practice. But <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E
5|$|After the discovery, {{the rare}} element had only minor applications; for example, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, rhodium-containing {{thermocouples}} {{were used to}} measure temperatures up to 1800°C. The first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating. The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium {{to reduce the amount}} of NOx in the exhaust.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1473 in Cracow (Kraków), the {{printing}} business kept growing. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 16th/17th century {{there were about}} 20 printing houses within the Commonwealth, 8 in Cracow, the rest mostly in Danzig (Gdańsk), Thorn (Toruń) and Zamość. The Academy of Kraków and Sigismund II possessed well-stocked libraries; smaller collections were increasingly common at noble courts, schools and townspeople's households. Illiteracy levels were falling, as {{by the end of}} the 16th century almost every parish ran a school.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1880s, Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence, helped along by an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and naval revolts in 1891 and 189394. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century it was lagging behind the Chilean and Argentine navies in quality and total tonnage, despite Brazil having nearly three times the {{population}} of Argentina and almost five times the population of Chile.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 1990s the {{downward}} trend {{was starting to}} reverse: at the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991, and the Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums {{in the aftermath of}} the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January of that year.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20thcentury, the {{difficulty}} of navigating the Columbia {{was seen as an}} impediment to the economic development of the Inland Empire region east of the Cascades. The dredging and dam building that followed would permanently alter the river, disrupting its natural flow but also providing electricity, irrigation, navigability and other benefits to the region.|$|E
50|$|Throughout {{the eight}} years, the Israeli and Egyptian armies faced off {{against each other}} {{on either side of}} the Suez Canal. Sometimes raiding parties from both sides would slip across the canal to carry out {{intelligence}} gathering missions. One of the big concerns was that the canal would become silted up without regular dredging. It turned out to be a non-issue as 90% of the silt is a result <b>of</b> currents caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> ships' propellers, which was virtually non-existent during this period.|$|R
25|$|Musashi's {{late arrival}} is controversial. Sasaki's outraged {{supporters}} {{thought it was}} dishonorable and disrespectful, while Musashi's supporters {{thought it was a}} fair way to unnerve his opponent. Another theory is that Musashi timed the hour of his arrival to match <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide. The tide carried him to the island. After his victory, Musashi immediately jumped back in his boat and his flight from Sasaki's vengeful allies was helped <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tide. Another theory states he waited for the sun to get in the right position. After he dodged a blow, Sasaki was blinded <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|R
50|$|The 2013, 2014 and 2015 Greater Manchester Marathon {{times have}} been {{declared}} invalid after {{the course was}} found to be 380m too short in 2016. UK Athletics will not recognise times from those races. The error was corrected in time for 2016 marathon. The Association of UK Course Measurers (AUKCM) said an accredited measurer had ridden the course in 2013 but indicated there had been an error in the calibration of the bicycle wheel. Marathon courses are measured out using a bicycle fitted with a counter to calculate distance <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels.|$|R

Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006). Grant later played against type with multiple cameo roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012). He is also known for appearing in period pieces such as The Remains of the Day (1993), Sense and Sensibility (1995) and Florence Foster Jenkins (2016).|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century, Tacoma eclipsed Seattle {{to become}} the largest port {{in the state and}} 7th largest in the nation, but fell behind ports in Los Angeles and nearby Vancouver. In 2009, Seattle regained its title as the larger of the ports, but both {{suffered}} losses in overall cargo volume and revenue. Tacoma lost Maersk to Seattle after it merged with CMA-CGM in 2009, but three years later attracted an alliance of three major international shippers from Seattle who had comprised 20 percent of cargo for the port.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> {{the century}} Dallas {{was the leading}} {{wholesale}} market in the entire Southwestern United States for many products.

As it further entered the 20th century, Dallas built up a major presence in banking and insurance.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, Gavin's {{appearance}} in church without the precentor {{would have been}} as surprising as Tammas's without the minister. As certainly as the shutting of a money-box is followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key, did the precentor walk stiffly from the vestry to his box a toll of the bell {{in front of the}} minister. Tammas's halfpenny rang in the plate as Gavin passed T'nowhead's pew, and Gavin's sixpence with the snapping-to of the precentor's door. The two men might have been connected by a string that tightened at ten yards.|$|R

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, the city's {{population}} {{had grown to}} 728, and social organizations began to establish themselves in Marysville, including a lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and a Crystal Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons. The first city hall was opened in late 1901, {{at a cost of}} $2,000; the building also housed the city's fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply systems were both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction of a high school building.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, {{the site}} of Fort Jackson had become the {{footings}} for a new railroad bridge, constructed in 1903. Three years later, a road bridge was constructed just to the west. A brickworks was also located nearby, sometimes utilizing the clay that formed the bastions of Fort Runyon as raw material for the bricks that would later go into the walls of Washington homes. These projects obliterated what little trace there was of Fort Jackson.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> {{the twentieth}} century the church had little to show from its earlier history, or indeed of its former wealth, beyond the great size of the church. The church was {{relatively}} plainly decorated – see below – and had nothing by way of old fittings, plate or vestments. Amongst its liturgical plate were a chalice of 1788, an alms plate of 1839, a set of chalice, paten and flagon of 1841, and a silver mounted glass cruet of 1909.|$|E
50|$|Thus, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>turning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> century, {{the themes}} {{had become the}} {{dominant}} feature of imperial administration. Their large size and power however made their generals prone to revolt, as had been evidenced in the turbulent period 695-715, and would again during the great revolt of Artabasdos in 741-742. The suppression of Artabasdos' revolt heralded the first {{significant changes in the}} Anatolian themes: the over-mighty Opsikion was broken up with the creation of two new themes, the Bucellarian Theme and the Optimates, while the role of imperial guard was assumed by a new type of professional force, the imperial tagmata.|$|R

The piece ends when the pianist stands up and bows towards the audience. It has a certain humorous purpose. The second tacet movement is marked [...] "Molto espressivo". Moreover, the score also includes a fourth bagatelle as an encore of the piece to be performed if the pianist wishes, which is marked [...] "Tempo primo" [...] and only includes a sixteenth rest.|$|R

5|$|In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club {{was founded}} by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed {{standard}} {{for this type of}} terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated with this type of terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.|$|E
