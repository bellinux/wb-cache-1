Depictions of Fenrir have been identified on various objects, and scholarly theories have been proposed regarding Fenrir's relation to other canine beings in Norse mythology. Fenrir {{has been the subject of}} artistic depictions, and he appears in literature.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the unconventional nature of the relationship, the affair was fraught with turmoil. Barker was a heavy drinker and Smart took up the habit, which intensified when the two were together. The couple were involved in numerous fights; during one argument, Smart <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> part of Barker's upper lip. Nonetheless, as evidenced from writings in her journals, Smart's love for Barker continued {{for the remainder of}} her life.|$|E

25|$|The Wrangell Bombardment was the {{bombardment}} of the Stikine village of Old Wrangell (Tlingit: Ḵaachx̱aana.áakʼw) by the United States Army in 1869. The army issued an ultimatum to the villagers, demanding they deliver a Stikine named Scutd-doo to justice following the retribution murder of Leon Smith by Scutd-doo. Scutd-doo's son, Lowan, had earlier {{been killed by}} soldiers following an altercation in which he <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> the finger of {{the wife of the}} quartermaster of Fort Wrangell.|$|E

The hobbits, {{followed}} by Gollum, eventually arrived at Mount Doom, where Frodo was overcome by the Ring's power and claimed it for himself. At that moment, however, Gollum attacked him and <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> his finger, taking back the Ring. Gollum {{was too close to}} the edge: as he gloated over his prize he fell into the fires of Mount Doom, taking the Ring with him, thus destroying it and Sauron's power.|$|E
25|$|In Hittite mythology, the god Anu {{was overthrown}} {{by his son}} Kumarbi; Anu {{attempted}} to flee, but Kumarbi <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> Anu's genitals and swallowed them, and banished him to the underworld. As a consequence of swallowing Anu's genitals, Kumarbi became impregnated with Anu's son Teshub and four other offspring. Teshub overthrew his father Kumarbi, thus avenging his other father Anu's overthrow and mutillation. This account later {{became the basis for}} the Greek story of Uranus's castration by his son Cronus, resulting in the birth of Aphrodite, described in Hesiod's Theogony.|$|E

With the Kremer Racing Porsche of Bob Wollek being <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> the pace, while the Ford entrant, Zakspeed’s Escort being outdated, and their Ford Capri Turbo was unreliable. Ertl would win five of the 11 races during the season, with a second place at the season finale, a Super Sprint event at the Nürburgring, he would win the championship.|$|E
25|$|On 25 December 1869 a Stikine Indian named Lowan <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and {{was killed}} in an ensuing fight by {{soldiers}} who severely wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot Smith fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December, stating before he was hanged that he had acted in revenge against the occupants of the fort for the killing of Lowan and not against Smith in particular. Smith's body was sent for burial in San Francisco, and possibly onward to Texas in the city cemetery in Houston.|$|E
25|$|On April 22, 2010, Voyager 2 {{encountered}} {{scientific data}} format problems. On May 17, 2010, JPL engineers {{revealed that a}} flipped bit in an on-board computer had caused the issue, and scheduled a bit reset for May 19. On May 23, 2010, Voyager 2 resumed sending science data from deep space after engineers fixed the flipped bit. Currently research is being made into marking the area of memory with the flipped <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> limits or disallowing its use. The Low-Energy Charged Particle Instrument is currently operational, and data from this instrument concerning charged particles is being transmitted to Earth. This data permits measurements of the heliosheath and termination shock. There {{has also been a}} modification to the on-board flight software to delay turning off the AP Branch 2 backup heater for one year. It was scheduled to go off February 2, 2011 (DOY 033, 2011–033).|$|E

25|$|The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, {{completed}} in the 8th century, have numerous references to magatama. They appear in {{the first chapter of}} the Nihon Shoki, which largely describes the mythology of Japan. Susanoo, god of the sea and storms, received five hundred magatama from Tamanoya no mikoto, or Ame-no-Futodama-no-mikoto, the jewel-making deity. Susanoo went to heaven and presented them to his sister, the sun goddess Amaterasu, who <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> successive parts of the magatama, and blew them away to create other deities. Tamanoya no mikoto remains the kami god of magatama, glasses, and cameras. In the legend Amaterasu later shuts herself in a cave. Ama-no-Koyane-no-mikoto hung magatama, among other objects, on a five hundred-branch sakaki tree, to successfully lure Amaterasu from the cave. In the year 58, in the reign of the Emperor Suinin, the Nihon shoki records that a dog kills and disembowels a mujina, a type of badger, and a magatama was discovered in its stomach. This magatama was presented to Suinin, who enshrined it at Isonokami Shrine, where it is said to presently reside. A similar practice is described again in the Nihon shoki during the reign of the Emperor Chūai. Chūai made an inspection trip to the Tsukushi, or Kyūshū, and was presented with an enormous sakaki tree hung with magatama as well as other sacred objects.|$|E

40|$|In an unordered code, no {{code word}} is {{contained}} in any other code word. Unordered codes are all unidirectional error detecting (AUED) codes. In the binary case, {{it is well known}} that among all systematic codes with information bits, Berger codes are optimal unordered codes with r = inverted right perpendicularlog(2) (k + 1) inverted left perpendicular similar or equal to log(2) k check bits. This paper gives some new theory on variable length unordered codes and introduces a new class of systematic (instantaneous) unordered codes with variable length check symbols. The average redundancy of the new codes presented here is r similar or equal to (1 / 2) log(2) k + c, where c is an element of(1. 0470, 1. 1332) subset of IR and k is an element of IN is the number of information bits. When is large, it is shown that such redundancy is at most 0. 6069 <b>bits</b> <b>off</b> the redundancy of an optimal systematic unordered code design with fixed length information symbols and variable length check symbols; and, at most 2. 8075 <b>bits</b> <b>off</b> the redundancy of an optimal variable length unordered code design. The generalization is also given for the nonbinary case and it is shown that similar results hold true...|$|R

Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers.

500|$|In chapter 13 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Fenrir {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in a stanza quoted from Völuspá. Fenrir is first mentioned in prose in chapter 25, where the enthroned figure of High tells Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) about the god Týr. High says that {{one example of}} Týr's bravery {{is that when the}} Æsir were luring Fenrir (referred to here as Fenrisúlfr) to place the fetter Gleipnir on the wolf, Týr placed his hand within the wolf's mouth as a pledge. This was done at Fenrir's own request because he did not trust that the Æsir would let him go. As a result, when the Æsir refused to release him, he <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> Týr's hand at a location [...] "now called the wolf-joint" [...] (the wrist), causing Týr to be one-handed and [...] "not considered to be a promoter of settlements between people." ...|$|E

The family lived in Bermuda until 2009, and as of 2016, live in rural New York State. In 2010, Douglas was diagnosed with tongue cancer, and Zeta-Jones faced an emotionally turbulent time; she said, [...] "When you get sideswiped like that [...] it's an obvious trigger for your balance {{to be a little}} <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> – not sleeping, worry, stress." [...] This trigger led to Zeta-Jones suffering from depression, and despite initial apprehension, she spoke publicly about suffering from bipolar II disorder. She sought treatment by checking herself into hospital in 2011, and again in 2013. Owing to the stress of both their illnesses, the couple decided to live separately in 2013, though without taking legal action towards separation or divorce. They reconciled in 2014, with Douglas stating that they were [...] "stronger than ever".|$|E

500|$|American band Sleigh Bells {{recorded}} {{an acoustic}} {{cover of the}} song during their Maida Vale sessions and released it Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show on March 6, 2012. A writer of Billboard magazine commented that their cover was [...] "ethereal". Ray Rahman of Entertainment Weekly described the cover as [...] "really good!... Krauss also has a teen-pop background thanks to her Rubyblue days, so it's actually not that surprising that she can find her away around a Top 40 single so well." [...] However, Maura Johnston of The Village Voice gave a negative review for the cover, saying: [...] "Krauss sighs {{her way through the}} song, turning her voice into a mew that sounds like she was trying to sing along with the radio while not being heard by her roommates or anyone else outside of a six-inch radius... Also, some of the guitar chords are a <b>bit</b> <b>off....</b> it's sorta disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|The fight {{scenes were}} heavily choreographed, but the actors were {{required}} to [...] "go full out" [...] to capture realistic effects like having the wind knocked out of them. Makeup artist Julie Pearce, {{who worked for the}} director on the 1997 film The Game, studied mixed martial arts and pay-per-view boxing to portray the fighters accurately. She designed an extra's ear to have cartilage missing, citing as inspiration the boxing match in which Mike Tyson <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> part of Evander Holyfield's ear. Makeup artists devised two methods to create sweat on cue: spraying mineral water over a coat of Vaseline, and using the unadulterated water for [...] "wet sweat". Meat Loaf, who plays a member of the fight club who has [...] "bitch tits", wore a 90-pound (40kg) fat harness that gave him large breasts for the role. He also wore eight-inch (20cm) lifts in his scenes with Norton to be taller than him.|$|E
500|$|Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production.

[...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. He said, [...] "You want people to be a little <b>bit</b> <b>off</b> balance afterwards." [...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E
