5|$|The <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on the head and neck are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E
5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|The basic German (Luftwaffe) {{camouflage}} {{during most}} of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In {{the first year of the}} war, the top colors were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colors were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colors of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of aluminum (Al) mass fraction {{on the performance of}} an epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating.</b> The conductivity increased and IR emissivity and gloss decreased with increased Al mass fraction. When the Al mass fraction was decreased from 40 % to 30 %, the adhesion and impact strength of epoxy-lacquer based coatings increased and were grade 1 and 50 [*]Kg·cm, respectively. When the Al mass fraction was decreased to 10 %, the mechanical properties of epoxy-lacquer based coatings decreased. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of coatings showed that epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with 30 % Al mass fraction has the best corrosion resistance and the lowest porosity. The epoxy-lacquer <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> with the best stability was that of 30 % Al mass fraction.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{determine}} an effective coating film for cutting carbon steels with a coated cemented carbide tool, tool wear was experimentally investigated. Low carbon steel (AISI 5120 H steel) was turned with four kinds of physical vapor deposition (PVD) coated cemented carbide tools. The coating films used were TiN coating film and three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> films, namely (Ti,W,Si,Al) N, (Ti,W,Si,Al) C and (Ti,W,Si,Al) (C,N) coating film.

The following results were obtained: (1) The critical load of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> films was higher than that of TiN coating film. (2) The hardness of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> films was higher than that of TiN coating film. (3) In cutting low carbon steel, the wear progress of three kinds of titanium-tungsten-silicon-aluminum <b>based</b> <b>coating</b> film tools was slower than that of the TiN coated tool.

25|$|During the 1942–43 timeframe, the {{formerly}} all-black night fighter camouflage used by Luftwaffe night fighters had yielded to a light-color camouflage scheme that {{took advantage of}} the skyglow over German cities at night — this generally comprised the use of the Luftwaffe's usual Hellblau light blue undersurface color for diurnal-flown aircraft, and a light gray <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. The light gray base color usually had irregular patterns of darker gray splotches or irregular wavy lines spread over the light gray areas to increase the camouflage effect. Later in WW II, Luftwaffe night fighters, like some of the Kampfgeschwader-flown He 177A heavy bombers being used at night, switched back to a black coloration for the undersurfaces and vertical sides of the airframe, while retaining the light gray with dark gray-color disruptive patterns established in the mid-war period.|$|E

Spotting occurs in several overlay patterns on one of several recognized <b>base</b> <b>coat</b> colors.

500|$|Rocky Mountain Horses {{stand between}} [...] high. Any solid color is {{accepted}} by the registry, but a dark brown color called [...] "chocolate" [...] with a pale, [...] "flaxen" [...] mane and tail is preferred. [...] This coloration {{is the result of}} the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black <b>base</b> <b>coat.</b> Although uncommon, this gene has been found in over a dozen breeds, including the Rocky Mountain Horse. Minimal white markings are {{accepted by the}} registry, although leg markings may not extend above the knee. The physical characteristics are somewhat variable, due to the disparate breeds that created the Rocky Mountain Horse. The Rocky Mountain Horse is known by enthusiasts for its hardiness and ability to withstand winters in the mountains. It is also praised for its good nature and affinity for humans. Rocky Mountain Horses have the highest risk of any breed for the genetic ocular syndrome multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA is characterized by the abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that the disorder may be tied to the silver dapple gene, as most horses diagnosed with MCOA carry the gene.|$|E
