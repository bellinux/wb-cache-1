5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep venous thrombosis, risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Hiller {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} heating and burning on <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> using X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The bone samples were heated in temperature of 500, 700, and 900 C° for 15 and 45 min. The results show bone crystals began to change during the first 15 min of heating at 500 C0 and above. At higher temperatures, thickness and shape of crystals of bones appear stabilized, but when the samples were heated at lower temperature or for shorter period, XRD traces showed extreme changes in crystal parameters.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D deficiency: Low {{circulating}} Vitamin D {{is common}} {{among the elderly}} worldwide. Mild vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. PTH increases bone resorption, leading to bone loss. A positive association exists between serum 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density, while PTH is negatively associated with <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density.|$|E
40|$|Although <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> {{have been}} widely studied by various {{techniques}} in previous studies, crystal structures and morphology of <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> remained as controversy. In this study, <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> were extracted from human cortical bone with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid solution (pH 7. 4, ambient temperature) and examined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The {{results showed that the}} majority of <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> were flake-like and a few were needle-like. Most of flake-like minerals were less than 100 nm in their largest dimension and the needle-like minerals have a width of similar to 10 nm. Hydroxyapatite structure was identified in relatively thick <b>bone</b> <b>minerals.</b> However, octacalcium phosphate structure was identified in relatively thin flake-like <b>bone</b> <b>minerals.</b> Moreover, central dark line defect similar to that reported in dentin and enamel crystals was observed in some of needle-like <b>bone</b> <b>minerals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Although oral bisphosphonates {{are more}} {{convenient}} and cheaper, {{they are not}} absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent. In a trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density, it is uncertain whether {{this leads to a}} reduction in fractures or an improvement in {{the quality of life of}} individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta.|$|E

25|$|This form {{of therapy}} {{has been shown}} to prevent loss of <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density (BMD) {{as a result of a}} {{reduction}} in bone turnover. However, bone health entails quite a bit more than just BMD. There are many other factors to consider.|$|E
25|$|Heredity: Those with {{a family}} history of {{fracture}} or osteoporosis are at an increased risk; the heritability of the fracture, as well as low <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density, is relatively high, ranging from 25 to 80%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|In accordance, a {{study found}} that in women treated with a GnRH analogue, {{spironolactone}} therapy almost completely prevented the bone loss {{that is associated with}} these drugs, whereas treatment with the selective AR antagonist flutamide had no such effect. Other studies have also found an inverse relationship between spironolactone and decreased <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density and bone fractures in men. Estrogens are well known for maintaining and having positive effects on bone, and {{it has been suggested that}} the estrogenic activity of spironolactone may be involved in its positive effects on <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density. However, it should also be noted that high levels of aldosterone have been associated with adverse bone changes, and so the antimineralocorticoid activity of spironolactone might partially or fully be responsible for these effects as a potential alternative explanation.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} mineralise the bone, the osteoblasts secrete vesicles {{containing}} alkaline phosphatase.

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a disease {{condition}} {{that is associated with}} alterations in the body’s physiological homeostasis. Bone metastases are common in advanced cancer and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to assess the serum levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and the <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> in breast cancer. A total of 80 subjects within the ages of 20 - 65 years were investigated (40 breast cancer subjects and 40 age-matched apparently healthy female subjects as controls). Serum calcium was estimated using calcium kit from Randox Laboratories, inorganic phosphate and magnesium were estimated using kits from Biosystems while the estimation of serum alkaline phosphatase activity was done using King Armstrong’s method. The serum total calcium and serum alkaline phosphatase activity were significantly increased (P< 0. 05) while serum magnesium was significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) in breast cancer subjects compared with the control subjects. There was no significant increase in serum inorganic phosphate of the breast cancer subjects compared with the control subjects. There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean serum levels of the <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> and ALP activity between the breast cancer subjects on chemotherapy and those not on chemotherapy. It was concluded that regular laboratory assessment of serum levels of <b>bone</b> <b>minerals</b> and ALP activity should be carried out on breast cancer patients to avoid bone associated disorder...|$|R

25|$|The most {{important}} {{risk factors for}} osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in <b>bone</b> <b>mineral</b> density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect.|$|E
25|$|Mounting {{evidence}} indicates that the amount and type of fat in the diet can have important effects on bone health. Most of this evidence is derived from animal studies.

25|$|Tobacco smoking: Many {{studies have}} {{associated}} smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear.

25|$|Vitamin D {{deficiency}} causes osteomalacia (called rickets when {{it occurs}} in children).
