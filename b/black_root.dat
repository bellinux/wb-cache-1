5|$|Plants figure {{prominently}} in mythology and religion, where they symbolise themes such as fertility, growth, immortality and rebirth, {{and may be}} more or less magical. Thus in Latvian mythology, Austras Koks is a tree which grows {{from the start of the}} Sun's daily journey across the sky. A different cosmic tree is Yggdrasil, the World tree of Norse mythology, on which Odin hung. Different again is the barnacle tree, believed in the Middle Ages to have barnacles that opened to reveal geese, a story which may perhaps have started from an observation of goose barnacles growing on driftwood. Greek mythology mentions many plants and flowers, where for example the lotus tree bears a fruit that causes a pleasant drowsiness, while moly is a magic herb mentioned by Homer in the Odyssey with a <b>black</b> <b>root</b> and white blossoms.|$|E

Magic plants are found, too, in Serbian mythology, where the raskovnik is supposed to be able to open any lock. In Buddhist symbolism, both the lotus and the Bodhi Tree are significant. The lotus is one of the Ashtamangala (eight auspicious signs) shared between Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism, representing the primordial purity of body, speech, and mind, floating above the muddy waters of attachment and desire. The Bodhi Tree is the sacred fig tree under which the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment; the name is also given to other Bodhi trees thought to have been propagated from the original tree.|$|E

She glided to the great golden mixing-cup of wine that stood on a table behind Ægeus, and {{with her back to}} Theseus she ladled wine into a cup of strange {{coloured}} glass. 'Pledge me and the king,' she said, bringing the cup to Theseus. He took it, and from his breast he drew the flower of <b>black</b> <b>root</b> and white blossom that Hermes had given him, and laid it in the wine. Then the wine bubbled and hissed, and the cup burst and broke, and the wine fell on the floor, staining it as with blood.|$|E
6000|$|The {{plant is}} {{described}} by Homer with some minuteness. 'It was black at the root, but the flower was like to milk. [...] "Moly," [...] the gods call it, {{but it is hard}} for mortal men to dig, howbeit with the gods all things are possible.' The etymologies given of 'moly' are almost as numerous as the etymologists. One derivation, from the old 'Turanian' tongue of Accadia, will be examined later. The Scholiast offers the derivation '[Greek], to make charms of no avail'; but this is exactly like Professor Blackie's etymological discovery that Erinys is derived from [Greek]: 'he might as well derive critic from criticise.' {148} The Scholiast adds that moly caused death to the person who dragged it out of the ground. This identification of moly with mandrake is probably based on Homer's remark that moly is 'hard to dig.' The <b>black</b> <b>root</b> and white flower of moly are quite unlike the yellow flower and white fleshy root ascribed by Pliny to mandrake. Only confusion is caused by regarding the two magical herbs as identical.|$|E
6000|$|The last couplet Milton afterwards, on his Italian journey, {{entered in}} an album {{belonging}} to an Italian named Cerdogni, and underneath it the words, Coelum non animum muto dum trans mare curro, and his signature, Joannes Miltonius, Anglus. The juxtaposition of these verses is significant: {{though he had}} left his own land Milton had not become what, fifty or sixty years before, Roger Ascham had condemned as an [...] "Italianated Englishman." [...] He was one of those [...] "worthy Gentlemen of England, whom all the Siren tongues of Italy could never untwine from the mast of God's word; nor no enchantment of vanity overturn them from the fear of God and love of honesty" [...] (Ascham's Scholemaster). And one might almost infer that Milton, in his account of the sovereign plant Haemony which was to foil the wiles of Comus, had remembered not only Homer's description of the root Moly [...] "that Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave,"{16:A} but also Ascham's remarks thereupon: [...] "The true medicine against the enchantments of Circe, the vanity of licentious pleasure, the enticements of all sin, is, in Homer, the herb Moly, with the <b>black</b> <b>root</b> and white flower, sour at first, but sweet in the end; which Hesiod termeth the study of Virtue, hard and irksome in the beginning, but in the end easy and pleasant. And that which is most to be marvelled at, the divine poet Homer saith plainly that this medicine against sin and vanity is not found out by man, but given and taught by God." [...] Milton's Comus, like his last great poems, is a poetical expression of the same belief. [...] "His poetical works, the outcome of his inner life, his life of artistic contemplation, are," [...] in the words of Prof. Dowden, [...] "various renderings of one dominant idea--that the struggle for mastery between good and evil is the prime fact of life; and that a final victory of the righteous cause is assured by the existence of a divine order of the universe, which Milton knew by the name of 'Providence.'" ...|$|E
