40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{simulation results}} of hydrostatic bearing dynamics in spindle assembly of standard flexible production module with throttled circuit. The necessity of dynamic quality increase for {{automatic control system}} of the hydrostatic bearing {{with the use of}} correcting means in the form of RC-chains is shown. The features of correction parameters choice coming from the existence of the crossing connections in automatic control system structure are noted. We propose the block diagram of automatic control system of the hydrostatic bearing in Simulink working field and cyclic algorithm for determination program of RC-chain parameters implemented in MATLAB taking into account typical thermal processes for the finishing treatment. Graphic-analytical method for the correction parameters choice is presented based on the stability stock phase gradient for dynamic quality determination of automatic control system. Researches of the method estimability in case of using the standard metal <b>bellow</b> <b>valve</b> as the hydrocapacity for RC-chain are also carried out. Recommendations for the <b>bellow</b> <b>valve</b> choice are formulated. The check of dynamic quality indicators concerning transition processes calculated by means of the appropriate programs developed for MATLAB is performed. Examples are given for phase stability factor gradient schedules with partition of various areas of hydrostatic bearing dynamic quality for different frequencies of spindle rotation and procedure description of data cursor function application on MATLAB toolbar. Improvement of hydrostatic bearing dynamics under typical low loadings for finishing treatment is noted. Also, decrease of dynamic indicators for high loadings treatment in case of roughing treatment is marked...|$|E

50|$|Newly constructed, fabricated, or {{repaired}} {{systems or}} other vessels are sometimes tested to verify satisfactory production or repair. Plumbers often test for leaks after {{working on a}} water or other fluid system. A vessel or system is sometimes pressure tested by filling with air and the pressure monitored {{to see if it}} drops, indicating a leak. A very commonly used test after new construction or repair is a hydrostatic test, sometimes called a pressure test. In a hydrostatic test, a system is pressurized with water to look for a drop in pressure or to see where it leaks out. Helium testing may be done to detect for any very small leakage such as when testing certain diaphragm or <b>bellows</b> <b>valves,</b> made for high purity and utra high purity service, requiring low leak rate capability. Helium and hydrogen have very small molecules which can go through very small leaks.|$|R

This new package is a replacement for a package {{that has been used}} to ship tritium in a variety of content configurations and forms since the early 1970 s. The new design is based on changes in the regulatory requirements. The BTSP design incorporates many improvements over its predecessor by implementing improved testing, handling, and maintenance capabilities, while improving manufacturability and incorporating new engineered materials that enhance the package's ability to withstand dynamic loading and thermal effects. This paper will specifically summarize the design philosophy and engineered features of the BTSP containment vessel closure. The closure design incorporates a concave closure lid, metallic C-Ring seals for containing tritium gas, a metal <b>bellows</b> <b>valve</b> and an elastomer O-Ring for leak testing.

50|$|Air lift uses {{compressed}} air to lift water in operations such as dredging and underwater archeology. It {{is also found}} in aquariums to keep water circulating. These forms of lift were used as far back as 1797 in mines to lift water from mine shafts. These systems used single point injection of air into the liquid stream, normally through a foot valve {{at the bottom of the}} string. Gas lift was used as early as 1864 in Pennsylvania to lift oil wells, also using {{compressed air}}, via an air pipe bringing the air to the bottom of the well. Air was used in Texas for large-scale artificial lift. In 1920 natural gas replaced air, lowering the risk of explosion. From 1929 until 1945 about 25000 patents were issued on different types of gas lift valves that could be used for unloading in stages. Some of these systems involved moving the tubing, or using wireline sinker bars to change the lift point. Others were spring operated valves. Ultimately, in 1944 W.R. King patented the pressurized <b>bellows</b> <b>valve</b> that is used today. In 1951 the sidepocket mandrel was developed for selectively positioning and retrieving gas lift valves with wireline.|$|R

After cleaning the surface, the abrasive, together with the rust or coating that {{was removed from the}} surface, is vacuumed into the machine through the suction hose. The dust separator contains angled steel collision pads, working with the force of gravity, to allow any reusable abrasive to fall back into the pressure vessel. The filters are manually back flushed to prevent clogging. After back flushing, dust is dumped from the dust chamber into the dust collection bag or drum by operation of the <b>bellows</b> <b>valve.</b> The safety and health evaluation during the testing demonstration focused on dust and noise exposure. Dust exposure was found to be minimal, but noise exposure was potentially significant. Further testing for each of these exposures is recommended because the outdoor environment where the testing demonstration took place may cause the results to be inapplicable to indoor settings. It is feasible that the dust and noise levels will be higher in an enclosed operating environment. Other safety and health issues found were ergonomics, heat stress, tripping hazards, lockout/tagout, and arm-hand vibration...|$|R

High Order Modes excited by short intense bunches are propagating along the vacuum chamber, penetrating and dissipating inside vital vacuum elements, like shielded <b>bellows,</b> vacuum <b>valves</b> and vacuum pump. As a result, these elements get large temperature rise or temperature oscillations. Often HOM heating has a resonance character.

40|$|The {{simulation}} of the Auxiliary Charcoal Bed (ACB) Vacuum System {{was performed to}} evaluate the original vacuum system design, detect and identify design deficiencies, investigate the effects of proposed corrections on system performance, and generally aid in refining the system design before construction and mockup testing. The simulation was performed by using the Advanced Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL). The vacuum system design goals are to provide approximately 20 SCFM of both booster gas and purge gas through the system and maintain a flow of approximately 40 SCFM with a velocity of 50 to 75 f/sec {{at the entrance to}} the cyclone separator. The model results showed that the original system design was incapable of meeting the system performance goals. Further simulations showed that the following modifications to the original vacuum system design were required to make the system performance acceptable; (1) Remove valve PCV 4. (2) Modify the flow controllers FTC 3 and FTC 4 from the original flow range of 0 - 17. 6 SCFM (0 - 500 SLM) to 0 - 35. 3 SCFM (0 - 1000 SLM).

40|$|The {{isotope ratio}} of {{atmospheric}} helium, ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio, {{is believed to}} be constant on a global scale since the mixing time for the atmosphere is significantly shorter than the residence time for helium. Human activity such as fossil fuel exploitation may release significant amounts of crustal helium with low ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio. Recently a decrease in the atmospheric ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio from 1. 362 ×(10) ^ in December 1977 to 1. 339 ×(10) ^ in September 1988 was reported. These observations are compatible with an estimate of the anthropogenic release of crustal helium. For verification of the ^ 3 He/^ 4 He change with time, measurement of ancient air before the industrialization is highly desirable. Air bubbles in Antarctic ice cores may be the most suitable samples for the purpose. The ice core samples, which were obtained at Mizuho Station in 1984,were carefully processed to extract the trapped air at the National Institute of Polar Research. A released air sample of about 0. 3 ccSTP from ice cores at 330 -m depth, which was estimated to be about 3600 years old, was introduced into an evacuated stainless-steel canister equipped with a stainless-steel <b>bellows</b> <b>valve.</b> The ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and ^ 4 He/^ He ratios of the samples were measured using the purification vacuum line and high precision mass spectrometer at the University of Tokyo. The observed ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio relative to the running standard was converted into the absolute ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio using a calibration line based on artificially mixed in-house standard gases. The observed ^ 4 He/^ Ne ratio was calibrated against the present air standard. Experimental errors of ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and ^ 4 He/^ Ne ratios are about 1 % and 10 %, respectively. Chemical compositions of the samples were determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and ^ 4 He/^ Ne ratios of air bubbles extracted from ice core samples before industrial activity vary significantly from 9. 9 ×(10) ^ to 1. 30 ×(10) ^ and from 0. 31 to 0. 47,respectively. Major chemical constituents of the samples are nitrogen, oxygen and argon, which agree well with present atmosphere. Ancient air might have had a higher ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio than that of the present air when considering that the atmospheric ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio has decreased with time. However, {{this is not the case}} with the Mizuho samples. There is a negative correlation between the ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and ^ 4 He/^ 20 Ne ratios, suggesting that the ice core samples were somewhat contaminated by helium with low ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratios, suggesting that the ice core samples were somewhat contaminated by helium with low ^ 3 He/^ 4 He ratio. It is said that the cryogenic experiment using liquid helium as a coolant was carried out in the ice core storage room at the National Institute of Polar Research. The ^ 3 He/^ 4 He of coolant helium is generally lower than that of air. Helium in the samples might be compromised by the contamination of coolant helium if the helium content of the ambient atmosphere was significantly high in the storage room. Further studies are required to verify the results...|$|R

These can be made of a single goat-skin, of sufficient power, in skilful hands, to raise small bars of iron to a welding heat.

In this channel, a rectangular piston, with a slot to accommodate the SMA strip, ran along the strip and was utilized to prevent mixing between the hot and the cold fluid in order to increase the energy density of the system. The fuel, such as propane, was utilized as main energy source in order to achieve high energy and power densities of the SMA actuator system. Numerical analysis was carried out to determine optimal channel geometry and to estimate maximum available force, strain and actuation frequency.

40|$|The Conversion Project (CP) of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{involves}} converting {{slightly less}} than 40 kg of {sup 233 }U to a stable form for safe storage. The operation is performed within a few vessels interconnected by valves and 1 / 2 -in. metal tubing. During this conversion, a particularly toxic and corrosive by-product is formed, namely aqueous hydrofluoric acid (HF). The production of HF {{is a result of}} the hydrolysis of UF{sub 6 } and subsequent steam treatments of UO{sub 2 }F{sub 2 }. For each mole of UF{sub 6 } converted, 6 mol of HF are produced. The HF that forms during conversion combines with water to produce approximately 1. 5 L of 33 wt % HF. As this mixture is transferred within the process system, the tubing and valves are exposed to high concentrations of HF in liquid and vapor form. Of particular concern in the system are the almost 30 valves that have the potential for exposure to HF. For these valves, a vendor-supplied UG valve was installed. UG valves consist of an Alloy 400 (Monel) body and stem tip and Alloy 600 (Inconel) <b>bellows.</b> These <b>valves</b> have been used under experimental conditions that simulate the CP. It has been established that they have a finite life when exposed to a HF and air environment. Most failures were seen around the flange at the bottom of the bellows, and it was suspected that this flange and the weld material were not Inconel. In December 2001, the vendor confirmed that this flange was not Inconel but instead was stainless steel 316. After discussions between the vendor and ORNL staff involved with the CP effort, it was decided that the entire wetted area of the bellows would be fabricated from Alloy 600. In March 2002, four newly fabricated bellows assemblies were received from the vendor for the purposes of corrosion testing in HF.

A major task of the Phase- 1 commissioning was the vacuum scrubbing of new beam pipes in anticipation of a sufficiently long beam lifetime and low background noise in the next commissioning, prior to which a new particle detector will be installed. The pressure rise per unit beam current decreased steadily with increasing beam dose, as expected. Another important task was to check the stabilities of various new vacuum components at high beam currents of approximately 1  A. The temperature increases of the <b>bellows</b> chambers, gate <b>valves,</b> connection flanges, and so on were less than several degrees at 1  A, and no serious problems were found. The effectiveness of the antechambers and TiN coating in suppressing the electron-cloud effect (ECE) in the positron ring was also confirmed. However, the ECE in the Al-alloy bellows chambers was observed where TiN had not been coated. The use of permanent magnets to create an axial magnetic field of approximately 100  G successfully suppressed this effect.

Since depolarized 3 He will produce a background, relaxation of the polarized 3 He, characterized by the probability of depolarization per bounce, Pd, was measured for materials that will be in contact with polarized 3 He. Depolarization probabilities were determined from measurements of the longitudinal relaxation time of polarized 3 He in bulk liquid 4 He inside an acrylic cell coated with the wavelength shifter deuterated tetraphenyl butadiene (d-TPB), which will be used to coat the nEDM measurement cell. Relaxation measurements were also performed while rods, made from plumbing material Torlon and <b>valve</b> <b>bellows</b> material BeCu, were present in the cell.

Cryogenic commissioning began mid-September, 1989, and continued to Cooldown, January 3, 1990. Cryogenic commissioning followed the construction and installation of the piping. The checkout was serial and problems found 'as we were going along'. There was a clear message to work in parallel and certify subsystems in advance of their need. Typical problems were VJ line external <b>bellows</b> and ball <b>valves</b> that were not He leak tight. The early preparations concentrated on the relief (singular) of the LAr 100, 000 I dewar (sound familiar?). About one month was lost to the refurbishing of valves. After commissioning the dewar they accepted four LAr transfers for a total of 15, 000 gallons, each in the range of 0. 4 - 0. 6 ppm O{sub 2 } measurement with equipment accurate to +/- 0. 1 ppm. As I watched, tests were concluding that qualified the Barrel calorimeter as having LAr with 0. 6 +/- 0. 1 ppm O{sub 2 } to the delight of those making the measurement. There was real satisfaction in the recent HV measurement that only 55 of 40, 000 channels had shorts. The ratio is essentially that predicted from the early module testing experience and another reason to celebrate. Twelve of the twenty-four Barrel feedthroughs flanges (one end, total is forty-eight) had been fitted with Pre-Amps and that installation seemed to be going very well. There are hermetic feedthroughs at the PV wall, a length of manganin wire in the vacuum space to a warm hermetic feedthrough flange that is double 'O' ring sealed in the vacuum vessel closure plate. The Pre-Amps mount directly to the atmospheric side of these feedthrough flanges. The instrumentation is 'Bare Bones'. There was a need for flow meters when concerns for cooling loop flows arose {{and it would have been}} very helpful to be able to measure the flow in the Argon fill lines. The inside-the-LAC vessel instrumentation (RTD's and TC's) was sparse and had no redundancy. They would have provided more instrumentation and/or redundancy knowing what they know now. I asked questions designed to determine the time and effort necessary to pump the cryostat free of, especially, water. There didn't seem to be a clear answer to the question with the explanation that there was lots of pumping in support of the leak checking and the water was pumped along the way.
