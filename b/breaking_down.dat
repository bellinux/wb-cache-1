5|$|Metabolism {{is usually}} {{divided into two}} categories: catabolism, the <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> of organic matter for example, the <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> of glucose to pyruvate, by {{cellular}} respiration, and anabolism, the building up of components of cells such as proteins and nucleic acids. Usually, <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> releases energy and building up consumes energy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they are}} {{strongly}} oxidative, many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are also}} explosive (highly exothermic), <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> to elemental xenon and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> organic matter. Fruit {{bodies are}} found in wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E

5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself {{is the cause of}} many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> organic matter. It {{is known}} to have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to grow on or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to grow on hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may grow on buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, bark and branches. It accomplishes this by producing enzymes capable of <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> {{the three major}} biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.|$|E
50|$|White-rot fungi <b>break</b> <b>down</b> the lignin in wood, {{leaving the}} lighter-colored {{cellulose}} behind; {{some of them}} <b>break</b> <b>down</b> both lignin and cellulose. Because white-rot fungi are able to produce enzymes, such as laccase, needed to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> lignin and other complex organic molecules, they have been investigated for use in mycoremediation applications.|$|R

She analyzed NS-NNS? conversations based on Communication <b>Break</b> <b>Down</b> theory and Repairing Strategies theory. As a result, she found that most kind of Communication <b>Break</b> <b>Down</b> in NS-NNS conversations is Questioning the Other Statements. She also found that most kind of Repairing Strategies in NS-NNS` conversations is Contributing to Comprehensibility...|$|R
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} others {{species of the}} genus Psilocybe, is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|E
5|$|RNAi has varying {{effects in}} {{different}} species of Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).

5|$|A saprobe or parasite, O.nidiformis is nonspecific in its {{needs and}} is {{compatible}} {{with a wide variety}} of hosts. It has been recorded on native Banksia (including B.attenuata and B.menziesii), Hakea, Acacia, Nuytsia floribunda and various Myrtaceae, including Agonis flexuosa and Melaleuca species, and especially Eucalyptus, as well as Nothofagus, Casuarina species and Allocasuarina fraseriana, and even introduced trees such as Pinus or Platanus species. It plays an important role in <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> wood and recycling nutrients into the soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} time {{required}} for anaerobic digestion depends on the chemical complexity of the material. Material rich in easily digestible sugars <b>breaks</b> <b>down</b> quickly where as intact lignocellulosic material rich in cellulose and hemicellulose polymers can take much longer to <b>break</b> <b>down.</b> Anaerobic microorganisms are generally unable to <b>break</b> <b>down</b> lignin, the recalcitrant aromatic component of biomass.|$|R

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients by <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E

He has been an active astronomer most of his life and currently serves {{as the president of the}} Earthrise Institute, which he founded, and which has as its mission the use of astronomy as a tool for <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> international and intercultural barriers.|$|E
5|$|Historically, Sarcosphaera coronaria {{has been}} {{assumed to be}} saprobic, {{acquiring}} nutrients from <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> decaying organic matter. The fungus, however, is only found with trees known to form mycorrhiza, and it is often locally abundant where it occurs, year after year in the same location, indicative of a mycorrhizal lifestyle. The results of a 2006 study of Pezizalean fungi further suggest that the species is an ectomycorrhizal symbiont, and more generally, that the Pezizales include more ectomycorrhizal fungi than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic digestion facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic digestion enables the <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|In the March 2009 speech {{entitled}} Reform the International Monetary System, Zhou Xiaochuan, {{the governor}} of the People's Bank of China, came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency.

Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF special drawing rights (SDRs).|$|E
5|$|Metagenomics {{can provide}} {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} functional ecology of environmental communities. Metagenomic analysis of the bacterial consortia found in the defecations of Australian sea lions suggests that nutrient-rich sea lion faeces {{may be an important}} nutrient source for coastal ecosystems. This is because the bacteria that are expelled simultaneously with the defecations are adept at <b>breaking</b> <b>down</b> the nutrients in the faeces into a bioavailable form that can be taken up into the food chain.|$|E
