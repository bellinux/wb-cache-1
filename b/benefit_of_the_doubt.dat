5|$|Most {{plays in}} the game are {{resolved}} {{in such a way}} that the scorer is not given more than one choice when recording the outcome of the play, but several types of plays are open to the interpretation of the official scorer. In any difficult judgment call where the official scorer is required to decide whether to credit a hit to the batter, the scorer is guided by rule 10.05. This rule directs the official scorer to give the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the hitter when the scorer believes that the decision to credit the batter with a hit is equally valid to an alternative scoring decision. In a similarly difficult judgment call where the official scorer believes that an earned run or an unearned run are equally valid scoring decisions, rule 10.16 directs the official scorer to give the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the pitcher.|$|E

5|$|This brought wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans to {{the crease}} and exposed the hosts' lower-order. The {{last of the}} {{specialist}} batsmen, Compton nearly departed soon after when he leaned forward to a leg-side delivery from Johnson's off spin. He overbalanced and stumbled forwards, and Tallon removed the bails. There were no television replays to assist the umpires in those days, and although the attempted stumping appeared close to the naked eye, the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> {{was given to the}} batsman and the appeal rejected. Compton made use of this and attacked Toshack successfully, forcing Bradman to make a bowling change. In fading light, Compton combined with the gloveman to add 75 runs for the seventh wicket in 70 minutes, before Lindwall removed Evans—who attempted a wild slash—to leave England 216/7. Compton reached stumps on 64, accompanied by Alec Bedser, who was on four, as England ended the day at 231/7. Compton had been dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before being missed on 64 by the wicket-keeper from the bowling of Johnston just before stumps.|$|E

5|$|Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. England {{consolidated}} their innings after falling to 2/28. The hosts were content to score slowly and regroup, and Johnson’s first ten overs before lunch yielded only seven runs. However, when Johnson was bowling his second spell after lunch, Jack Crapp hit three driven boundaries in quick succession. Crapp {{was eager to}} use his feet {{to get to the}} pitch of Johnson’s deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. Crapp's counter-attack prompted Bradman to take the second new ball and remove Johnson with the score at 2/96. England then lost three quick wickets to the pacemen to be 5/119. Soon after, Yardley lofted Ernie Toshackwho was bowling leg theoryinto the on-side and Johnson caught him for 22 at forward square leg to leave England at 6/141.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} in the production and interpretation of regulatory science, focusing on the conflicting British and American clinical risk assessments of triazolam (Halcion) - the most controversial sleeping pill in the world. <b>The</b> regulation <b>of</b> triazolam is shown to be more permissive in the USA than in the UK. Six principal socio-political factors are put forward to explain this: differential regulatory trust; regulators' socio-technical data selections; medico-scientific disciplinary influences; organizational and professional interests; conflicts of interest of expert advisers; and <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neo-liberal regulatory state. <b>The</b> risk assessments <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> British and American regulatory agencies are shown to be complacent relative to technical standards which the agencies themselves later accepted.

40|$|Drug {{disasters}} from Thalidomide to Opren, {{and other}} less dramatic cases of drug injury, {{raise questions about}} whether the testing and control of medicines provides satisfactory protection for the public. In this revealing study, John Abrahan develops a theoretically challenging realist approach, in order to probe deeply into <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> scientists in <b>the</b> pharmaceutical industry and governmental drug regulatory authorities on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. Through <b>the</b> examination <b>of</b> contemporary controversial case studies, he exposes how <b>the</b> commercial interest <b>of</b> drug manufacturers are consistently given <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scientific <b>doubts</b> about medicine safety and effectiveness, over and above <b>the</b> best interests <b>of</b> patients.; A highly original combination of philosophical rigour, historical sensitivity and empirical depth enables <b>the</b> "black box" <b>of</b> industrial and government science to be opened up to critical scrutiny much more than in previous social scientific study. All major aspects of drug testing and regulation are considered, including pre- clinical animal tests, clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance of adverse drug reactions. The author argues that drug regulators are too dependent on pharmaceutical industry resources and expertise, and too divorced from public accountability. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> corporate bias is particularly severe in the UK, where regulatory decisions about medicine safety are shrouded in greater secrecy than in the US.; Since <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> drug regulation should be to maximize the safety and effectiveness of medicines for patients, the public needs and deserves policies to counteract corporate bias in drug testing and evaluation. John Abraham's realist analysis provides a robust basis for policy interventions at the institutional and legislative levels. He proposes that corporate bias could be reduced by more extensive freedom of information, greater autonomy of government scientists from pharmaceutical industry, <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> independent drug testing by the regulatory authority, increased patient representation on regulatory committees, and more frequent and thorough oversight of regulatory performance by the legislature. This book should be of interest to anyone who cares about how medicines should be controlled in modern society. It should prove particularly rewarding for students and researchers in <b>the</b> sociology <b>of</b> science and technology, science and medicines policy, medical sociologists, the medical and pharmaceutical professions, and consumer organizations...|$|R

60|$|To {{come back}} to the matter in hand. Our 'uplandish man' retains the soft or thin sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> u in some words, such as rule, truth (sometimes also {{pronounced}} tr[)u]th, not trooth), while he says noo for new, and gives to view and few so indescribable a mixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sounds with a slight nasal tincture that it may be called the Yankee shibboleth. Voltaire says that the English pronounce true as if it rhymed with view, and this is the sound our rustics give to it. Spenser writes deow (dew) which can only be pronounced with the Yankee nasality. In rule <b>the</b> least sound <b>of</b> a precedes <b>the</b> u. I find reule in Pecock's 'Repressor.' He probably pronounced it rayoolë, as the old French word from which it is derived was very likely to be sounded at first, with a reminiscence of its original regula. Tindal has reuler, and the Coventry Plays have preudent. In <b>the</b> 'Parlyament <b>of</b> Byrdes' I find reule. As for noo, may it not claim some sanction in its derivation, whether from nouveau or neuf, <b>the</b> ancient sound <b>of</b> which may very well have been noof, as nearer novus? Beef would seem more like to have come from buffe than from boeuf, unless the two were mere varieties <b>of</b> spelling. <b>The</b> Saxon few may have caught enough from its French cousin peu to claim <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same <b>doubt</b> as to sound; and our slang phrase a few (as 'I licked him a few') may well appeal to un peu for sense and authority. Nay, might not lick itself {{turn out to be the}} good old word lam in an English disguise, it the latter should claim descent as, perhaps, he fairly might, from the Latin lambere? The New England ferce for fierce, and perce for pierce (sometimes heard as fairce and pairce), are also Norman. For its antiquity I cite <b>the</b> rhyme <b>of</b> verse and pierce in Chapman and Donne, and in some commendatory verses by a Mr. Berkenhead before <b>the</b> poems <b>of</b> Francis Beaumont. Our pairlous for perilous is <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same kind, and is nearer Shakespeare's parlous than the modern pronunciation. One other Gallicism survives in our pronunciation. Perhaps I should rather call it a semi-Gallicism, for it is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a futile effort to reproduce a French sound with English lips. Thus for joint, employ, royal, we have jynt, emply, r[)y]le, the last differing only from rile (roil) in a prolongation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> y sound. I find royal so pronounced in the 'Mirror for Magistrates.' In Walter de Biblesworth I find solives Englished by gistes. This, it is true, may have been pronounced jeests, but the pronunciation jystes must have preceded the present spelling, which was no <b>doubt</b> adopted after <b>the</b> radical meaning was forgotten, as analogical with other words in oi. In the same way after Norman-French influence had softened <b>the</b> l out <b>of</b> would (we already find woud for veut in N.F. poems), should followed the example, and then an l was foisted into could, where it does not belong, to satisfy <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye, which has affected the pronunciation and even <b>the</b> spelling <b>of</b> English more than is commonly supposed. I meet with eyster for oyster as early as the fourteenth century. I find viage in Bishop Hall and Middleton the dramatist, bile for boil in Donne and Chrononhotonthologos, line for loin in Hall, ryall and chyse (for choice) dystrye for destroy, in the Coventry Plays. In Chapman's 'All Fools' is <b>the</b> misprint <b>of</b> employ for imply, fairly inferring an identity <b>of</b> sound in <b>the</b> last syllable. Indeed, this pronunciation was habitual till after Pope, and Rogers tells us that the elegant Gray said naise for noise just as our rustics still do. Our cornish (which I find also in Herrick) remembers the French better than cornice does. While clinging more closely to the Anglo-Saxon in dropping the g from <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present participle, the Yankee now and then pleases himself with an experiment in French nasality in words ending in n. It is not, so far as my experience goes, very common, though it may formerly have been more so. Capting, for instance, I never heard save in jest, the habitual form being kepp'n. But at any rate it is no invention of ours. In that delightful old volume, 'Ane Compendious Buke of Godly and Spirituall Songs,' in which I know not whether the piety itself or <b>the</b> simplicity <b>of</b> its expression be more charming, I find burding, garding, and cousing, and in the State Trials uncerting used by a gentleman. I confess that I like the n better than ng.|$|R

25|$|Other {{researchers}} and historians have strongly contested {{what has come}} to be referred to as the “Williams thesis” in academia. David Richardson has concluded that the profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Economic historian Stanley Engerman finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the British economy during any year of the Industrial Revolution. Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income. Historian Richard Pares, in an article written before Williams' book, dismisses the influence of wealth generated from the West Indian plantations upon the financing of the Industrial Revolution, stating that whatever substantial flow of investment from West Indian profits into industry there occurred after emancipation, not before.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the past}} it was taught that local {{anesthetic}} {{should not be}} used with adrenaline for procedures in the extremities.

25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw in a split second, with the <b>benefit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>doubt</b> always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which {{over the course of a}} long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E
