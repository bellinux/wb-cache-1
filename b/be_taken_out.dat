5|$|The {{project was}} halted in March 1989, {{for lack of}} funding, after costs had quickly {{escalated}} that January, from £35million to £230million. By this point huge sections of the building's roof had been removed, so that machinery could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b> Without a roof, the building's steel framework has been left exposed and its foundations have been prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{arrive and}} leave via a bus. The entry price can be set, and loans can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b> The player {{starts with a}} limited number of shops, rides, and {{facilities}} available. Research must be carried out to purchase others. Research can also make rides more durable, staff more efficient, and buses larger with increased capacity. The topic of research and how much funding goes into it is determined by the player.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas. For example, Loren Eiseley has found isolated passages written by Buffon suggesting he was almost ready to piece together a theory of natural selection, but states that such anticipations should not <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the full context of the writings or of cultural values of the time which made Darwinian ideas of evolution unthinkable.|$|E
50|$|An {{attractive}} {{feature of}} the festival is the Garuda Vahanam, where the main deity placed on the idol of Garuda <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession on a richly decorated palanquin that resembles the one on which Lord Vishnu <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> during the Theerthavari at the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The Garuda Vahanam <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on all the Saturdays of the Purattasi month.|$|R
50|$|During the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large {{procession}} <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{covering the}} town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> on every full moon day.|$|R
50|$|The map {{pool was}} changed for this major. Dust II <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> {{of the active}} map pool and Valve reintroduced Inferno, which has been revamped since it <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{foundations}} {{are located in}} confined spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult. Dulles Transit Partners offered to inspect seven foundations that were easily accessible, but the FTA insisted that all foundations be tested. Dulles Transit Partners and MWAA agreed to test all foundations before the bridge piers were built upon them. This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line between the West Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The foundations were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing foundations.|$|E

5|$|The candlelight vigil {{following}} the bill's defeat in committee {{was attended by}} labor union members and religious groups. Father Richard Shields of the Episcopal Diocese of Hawaii stated religion should <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of the argument and {{a spokesperson for the}} hotel and restaurant union Local 5 argued the bill provided economic justice. A letter later sent to senators in support of the H.B. 444 by community groups, including the Local 5 union, the Hawaii NAACP, the Hawaii State Democratic Women's Caucus, and the Japanese American Citizens League.|$|E
5|$|The film is an {{adaptation}} of The Winter's Tale by William Shakespeare, the shortened single reel adaption of the play. The film opens with {{the meeting of the}} kings of Bohemia and Sicilia. Hermione, the queen of Sicilia, entertains Polixenes, king of Bohemia. This arouses jealousy in Leontes, the king of Sicilia. Leontes decides to poison Polixenes and orders a courtier to carry out the task. The courtier slips the poison into the cup, but he changes his mind and confesses to the murderous plot. Polixenes and the courtier depart safely, but this enrages the Leontes, who has his wife imprisoned. In prison, Hermoine gives birth to a daughter and sends it to her husband, Hoping to quell his anger. This further upsets Leontes and he orders the child to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> to the wilderness to die. Hermione is then brought before a tribunal, swoons, and is pronounced dead by Paulina.|$|E
5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to stress on the axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit had to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing {{the replacement of the}} bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5000|$|Easter {{is celebrated}} in Cabana {{similar to the}} festivities in Ayacucho, Peru. Easter is celebrated for an entire week. Starting on Palm Sunday in which the Cabanistas recall the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem sitting on a donkey. On Holy Wednesday, the statues of Jesus and Maria <b>are</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession, recalling the famous {{encounter}} between these two religious characters. On Holy Thursday, after Mass, where the priest wash the feet to the brotherhood members of Holy Thursday, the statue of Jesus crucified <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession. Good Friday at 3 pm the cabanistas recall the death of Jesus {{and later in the}} night the image of Jesus in his coffin <b>is</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> in procession.

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out.</b> From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|With {{crew members}} and stevedores abandoning ship, it was {{realised}} by the dock authorities {{that there was}} a problem on board Fort Stikine. A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for. Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre, initially only two engines were sent. Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold. With the arrival of the two fire appliances, there were now eleven hoses in use. Captain Oberst, of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation. He {{was in charge of the}} explosives only after they had been landed. A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers, Oberst, and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy, the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay. It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled. Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded, but he doubted that the ship would sink in that condition. More fire appliances arrived, bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32. by 14:45, ammunition in № 2 hold was exploding. Colonel Sadler, the General Manager of the docks at Bombay, was sent for. He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks, which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled. An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> of port.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the two aforementioned incidents, in 1979, BIA's maintenance engineers had discovered fatigue cracks in the fuselages {{of some of the}} firm's Heralds during routine inspections of the aircraft.

25|$|Ventures {{into the}} genre by writers {{who were not}} devoted {{exclusively}} to science fiction also added respectability.
