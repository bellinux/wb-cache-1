40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{locating}} <b>breakdown</b> <b>mechanic.</b> We consider a public transport network in which it can provide buses failure. The objective is, {{taking into account the}} statistics of breakdowns registered on the network, to locate optimally breakdown mechanics so as to minimize the response time (to ensure the network coverage of break- down mechanics). In this work, we present a binary linear programming model for this location problem which provides assignments-locations of areas served. Once the location made, we discuss dynamic assignment of breakdown mechan- ics depending on their position in the network at a given time t. Numerical simulation results are presented based on real data of urban transportation society of Dakar Dem Dikk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{outcomes}} of pilot study that aimed to investigate how experts think act, and learn. Central to the investigation were the need to identify the role that contributions from individuals ’ personal history as well as situational factors play in experts ’ thinking and acting. The study comprises an investigation of three vocational experts ’ characterisation of expertise, their ways of knowing and the knowledge they deployed when engaged in work-related activities. These experts are a painter, midwife and a <b>breakdown</b> <b>mechanic.</b> Drawing on other and previous work, {{the outcomes of}} this study suggest that current accounts of expertise are perhaps too narrowly defined and that situational factors and dispositional attributes need to be included if expertise is to be understood more fully. The outcomes also suggest that goals for and curriculum practice within vocational education needs to account for situational factors, the range of experiences of individuals in developing expertise and the interest and values which underpins their performance. 1...|$|E

40|$|An old saw has it {{that very}} little divides a genius from a madman, and if one is to judge from the {{recorded}} eccentricities of those society has chosen to label as geniuses, one can readily see why. A good theory of the creative mind then, or indeed, any aspect of mind, will not only explain the mechanics of what one would consider 'healthy cognition', but also the apparent <b>breakdown</b> of these <b>mechanics.</b> This paper considers the rich contribution the field of psychiatry can make {{to the study of}} human creativity, and focuses on some particular aspects of psychoanalytic theory that are amenable to algorithmic expression...|$|R
40|$|Several researchers, {{including}} Leonid Levin, Gerard 't Hooft, and Stephen Wolfram, {{have argued}} that quantum mechanics will break down before the factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then {{there should be a}} natural set of quantum states that can account for all quantum computing experiments performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We investigate as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require additions and tensor products even to approximate, which incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a <b>breakdown</b> of quantum <b>mechanics</b> into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the near future...|$|R
5000|$|Though never {{regarded}} as one of the top fielding second basemen in the league, Steve Sax inexplicably became incapable of making routine throws to first base in 1983, committing 30 errors that season. This is referred to in baseball terminology as [...] "Steve Sax Syndrome", the fielder's variant of [...] "Steve Blass disease," [...] named after the Pirates pitcher who suffered a similar <b>breakdown</b> of basic <b>mechanics</b> (also known as [...] "The Yips"). As his accuracy suffered, fans sitting behind the first base dugout began wearing batting helmets as mock protection. (Teammate Pedro Guerrero, an outfielder pressed into service at third base in 1983, once reportedly stated that his first thought whenever he was in the field was [...] "I hope they don't hit it to me", while his second thought was [...] "I hope they don't hit it to Sax.") by 1989, however, Sax seemed to be completely [...] "cured", leading the American League in both fielding percentage and double plays.|$|R

If this is true, then {{there should be a}} natural "Sure/Shor separator" [...] -that is, a set of quantum states that can account for all experiments performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We propose as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products.

40|$|It {{is argued}} that gravity should cause a <b>breakdown</b> of quantum <b>mechanics,</b> at low energies, {{accessible}} to table-top experiments. It is then shown that one can formulate a theory of quantum gravity in which gravitational correlations exist between worldline or worldsheet paths, for the particle or field of interest. Using a generalized equivalence principle, one can give a unique form for the correlators, yielding a theory with no adjustable parameters. A key feature of the theory is the "bunching" of quantum trajectories caused by the gravitational correlations - {{this is not a}} decoherence or a "collapse" mechanism. This bunching causes a breakdown of the superposition principle for large masses, with a very rapid crossover to classical behaviour at an energy scale which depends on the physical structure of the object. Formal details, and applications of the theory, are kept to a minimum in this paper; but we show how physical quantities can be calculated, and give a detailed discussion of the dynamics of a single particle.

40|$|After {{providing}} an extensive {{overview of the}} conceptual elements [...] such as Einstein's `hole argument' [...] that underpin Penrose's proposal for gravitationally induced quantum state reduction, the proposal is constructively criticised. Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of quantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an ill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound conflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here it is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the <b>breakdown</b> of quantum <b>mechanics</b> is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the collapse time of superpositions reduces to T [...] > oo (E [...] > 0) in the strictly Newtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate the effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular, recognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning {{in the domain of}} full `quantum gravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in principle corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is not the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but a Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions in relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the distinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically distinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an aside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum mechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical commutation relations [Q, P] = ih.
