The <b>Bowling</b> <b>Alley</b> front was quiet during the day. Shortly after midnight on August 24 the North Koreans launched what had by now become their regular nightly attack down the <b>Bowling</b> <b>Alley.</b> This attack was in an estimated two-company strength supported by a few tanks. The 27th Infantry broke up the attack and two more North Korean tanks were destroyed by the supporting artillery fire.

25|$|Ten-pin bowling was {{introduced}} in the United Kingdom in 1960. This was driven by the opening of the Stamford Hill and Golders Green <b>bowling</b> <b>alleys</b> in London. Ten-pin bowling took the UK by storm, with alleys opening up one after the other. At its peak, there were over 160 <b>bowling</b> <b>alleys</b> in the UK, but a lack of re-investment and waning interest left the fad in a sorry state. This led to a general deterioration of <b>bowling</b> <b>alleys,</b> with a commensurate decline in their image. In the 1970s a major chain operator, Top Rank, pulled out of bowling and converted many of the more luxurious alleys into Bingo halls. The industry nearly collapsed, with two thirds of the existing alleys closing over the next few years.|$|R
