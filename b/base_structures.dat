5|$|In-game, Terrans tend {{to favor}} {{traditional}} modes of warfare, often utilizing combined arms tactics with tanks, aircraft or other combat vehicles in combination with regular infantry. Using light ballistics, large calibre weapons and even tactical nuclear warheads, many Terran units are reminiscent of present-day designs. Terrans are the only race without a melee combat unit. Terrans are more adaptive {{than the other two}} races and are able to produce units at an average expense. Primary <b>base</b> <b>structures</b> can even lift off and fly to other locations, allowing players to move buildings for quicker troop deployments, access to new resource locations or to save the structures from destruction by the enemy. Terran buildings and mechanized units can be repaired if damaged, and combat medics can heal wounded organic units.|$|E

40|$|A lunar {{habitat is}} {{provided}} by placing an external tank of an orbiter in a low Earth orbit where the hydrogen tank is separated from the intertank and oxygen tank which form a <b>base</b> <b>structure.</b> The <b>base</b> <b>structure</b> is then outfitted with an air lock, living quarters, a thermal control system, an environmental control and life support system, and a propulsion system. After the mounting of an outer sheath about the <b>base</b> <b>structure</b> {{to act as a}} micrometeoroid shield, the <b>base</b> <b>structure</b> is propelled to a soft landing on the moon. The sheath is mounted at a distance from the <b>base</b> <b>structure</b> to provide a space therebetween which is filled with regolith after landing.

25|$|A {{space frame}} truss is a {{three-dimensional}} framework of members pinned at their ends. A tetrahedron shape is the simplest space truss, consisting of six members that meet at four joints.

500|$|Because the {{gameplay}} {{revolves around}} strengthening individual heroes, {{it does not}} require focus on resource management and base-building, unlike most traditional real-time strategy games. Killing computer-controlled or neutral units earns the player experience points; the player gains a level when enough experience is accumulated. Leveling up improves the hero's toughness and the damage they inflict, and allows players to upgrade spells or skills. In addition to accumulating experience, players also manage a single resource of gold. The typical resource-gathering of Warcraft III is replaced by a combat-oriented money system; in addition to a small periodic income, heroes earn gold by killing or destroying hostile units, <b>base</b> <b>structures,</b> and enemy heroes. This has caused emphasis on a technique called [...] "last-hitting," [...] which is when the player attacks a hostile unit when [...] "its hit points are low enough to kill it with one blow". Using gold, players buy items to strengthen their hero and gain abilities; certain items can be combined with recipes to create more powerful items. Buying items that suit one's hero is an important tactical element of the mod.|$|E
500|$|Protoss and Zerg {{building}} construction {{is limited to}} specific locations: Protoss buildings need {{to be linked to}} a power grid while almost every Zerg structure must be placed on a carpet of biomass, called [...] "creep", that is produced by certain structures. Terran buildings are far less limited, with certain primary <b>base</b> <b>structures</b> possessing the ability to take off and fly slowly to a new location. Terran buildings, however, require the worker unit to continue construction on the building until it is completed. [...] Also, once a Terran building has taken a certain amount of damage, it will catch fire and can eventually burn to the ground without further enemy action if repairs are not performed by a worker unit. The Protoss, by contrast, only require a worker unit {{to begin the process of}} transporting a building to the theater of operations via warp, and their buildings' shields (but not their structure) are regenerative. [...] The Zerg worker unit physically transforms into the structure created, which is capable of slowly healing itself.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} American <b>basing</b> <b>structure</b> in Germany, in a {{new political}} environment {{at the beginning of}} the 21 st century. The end of the Cold War changed the political and strategic situation in Europe and the substance of American military presence in Europe. The War on Terrorism suggests that the current threats are dynamic and unpredictable and the idea of a permanent U. S. <b>basing</b> <b>structure</b> in the heart of Europe should be reconsidered. Specifically, this thesis describes the reasons for restructuring the large and expensive <b>base</b> <b>structure</b> in Germany and the impact of American withdrawal to the German society. Moreover, this thesis presents new challenges and opportunities for American military presence in other parts of European continent. Finally, this thesis reviews the development of U.
