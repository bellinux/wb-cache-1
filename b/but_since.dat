5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, and brass bands were commonly accepted {{in the early years}} because they were a part of normal society, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> then have diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|At the A380 launch, most Europe-Asia and transpacific routes used 747-400s at {{fairly low}} frequencies, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> then routes proliferated with open skies and most {{airlines}} downsized to offer higher frequencies and more routes.|$|E
5|$|August 9, 1970 was a Sunday, and Flight 502 was {{originally}} scheduled to depart Cuzco at 8:30 am, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> {{many of the}} members of the American group wanted to visit the nearby Pisac native handicraft market prior to leaving for Lima, the airline postponed the departure time to 2:45 pm.|$|E

5|$|Heisman {{challenged}} Pop Warner's Pittsburgh {{team to a}} postseason game {{to determine}} a national champion, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> they did not play until the following season, Tech was named national champion.

5|$|It {{is common}} to reduce a wood sample to just the {{cellulose}} component before testing, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> this can reduce {{the volume of the}} sample to 20% of its original size, testing of the whole wood is often performed as well.

5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|A yoga {{system that}} predated the Buddhist school is Jain yoga. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> Jain sources postdate Buddhist ones, it is {{difficult}} to distinguish between the nature of the early Jain school and elements derived from other schools.

5|$|According to a 1992 article, the Iroquois, {{wielding}} weapons {{such as the}} tomahawk, killed 24 French {{and took}} more than 70 prisoners. Other sources, such as Encyclopædia Britannica, claim that 250 settlers and soldiers lost their lives during the “Massacre.” The Iroquois wanted to avenge the 1,200,000 bushels of corn burned by the French, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> {{they were unable to}} reach the food stores in Montreal, they kidnapped and killed the Lachine crop producers instead. Lachine was the main departure point for westward-traveling fur traders, a fact which may have provided extra motivation for the Mohawk attack.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
