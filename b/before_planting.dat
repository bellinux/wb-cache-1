25|$|Sesame is drought-tolerant, in {{part due}} to its {{extensive}} root system. However, it requires adequate moisture for germination and early growth. While the crop survives drought, as well as presence of excess water, the yields are significantly lower in either conditions.

25|$|In {{grain and}} cotton crops, urea is often applied {{at the time}} of the last {{cultivation}} <b>before</b> <b>planting.</b> In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed during the growing season. Top-dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane, urea is side-dressed after planting, and applied to each ratoon crop.|$|E

25|$|It {{should be}} noted that in Washington State, the {{aquaculture}} of geoducks occurs on intertidal lands, whereas in British Columbia, geoducks are cultured in subtidal areas, which necessitates the growing of juvenile geoducks to at least 12nbsp&mm instead of 5nbsp&mm <b>before</b> <b>planting.</b> Once planted in the subtidal bed, the area is covered with netting to protect the clams from predators (PVC tubes are not stable in subtidal beds due to strong currents).|$|E
25|$|Soil test {{information}} and plant analysis results {{are used to}} determine fertility practices. Nitrogen fertilizer is needed {{at the beginning of}} every planting year. There are normally adequate levels of phosphorus and potash when fields have been fertilized for top yields. In order to provide more organic matter, a cover crop of wheat or rye is planted in the winter <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> the strawberries. Strawberries prefer a pH from 5.5 to 6.5 so lime is usually not applied.|$|E

25|$|Rotations {{of plants}} with nematode-resistant species or {{varieties}} is one means of managing parasitic nematode infestations. For example, marigolds, grown over {{one or more}} seasons (the effect is cumulative), {{can be used to}} control nematodes. Another is treatment with natural antagonists such as the fungus Gliocladium roseum. Chitosan, a natural biocontrol, elicits plant defense responses to destroy parasitic cyst nematodes on roots of soybean, corn, sugar beet, potato, and tomato crops without harming beneficial nematodes in the soil. Soil steaming is an efficient method to kill nematodes <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> a crop, but indiscriminately eliminates both harmful and beneficial soil fauna.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary purpose}} of {{ploughing}} is {{to turn over the}} upper layer of the soil, bringing fresh nutrients to the surface, while burying weeds and the remains of previous crops and allowing them to break down. As the plough is drawn through the soil it creates long trenches of fertile soil called furrows. In modern use, a ploughed field is typically left to dry out, and is then harrowed <b>before</b> <b>planting.</b> Ploughing and cultivating a soil homogenises and modifies the upper 12 to 25cm of the soil to form a plough layer. In many soils, the majority of fine plant feeder roots {{can be found in the}} topsoil or plough layer.|$|E
25|$|Christmas tree {{farming is}} a labor-intensive process. Depending {{on the quality}} of the land, {{bulldozing}} may need to be undertaken prior to planting, in order to remove obstacles such as large trees or rocks. If the volume of undergrowth requires it, the soil may be tilled; tilling can help remove any debris remaining after tree or weed removal. Both woody plants and herbaceous weeds must be controlled prior to planting; this is most often done by application of a chemical herbicide. In addition, some types of fertilizers must be introduced into the soil prior to planting. The work done <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> tree seedlings plays an important role in the overall success of a Christmas tree crop.|$|E

25|$|The plow {{is a tool}} used {{in farming}} for initial {{cultivation}} of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and {{represents one of the}} major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed <b>before</b> <b>planting.</b> An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized the plow by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.|$|E
25|$|Correct potato {{husbandry}} can be {{an arduous}} task in some circumstances. Good ground preparation, harrowing, plowing, and rolling are always needed, along with a little grace from the weather and {{a good source of}} water. Three successive plowings, with associated harrowing and rolling, are desirable <b>before</b> <b>planting.</b> Eliminating all root-weeds is desirable in potato cultivation. In general, the potatoes themselves are grown from the eyes of another potato and not from seed. Home gardeners often plant a piece of potato with two or three eyes in a hill of mounded soil. Commercial growers plant potatoes as a row crop using seed tubers, young plants or microtubers and may mound the entire row. Seed potato crops are 'rogued' in some countries to eliminate diseased plants or those of a different variety from the seed crop.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, Kaspersky {{discovered}} the Red October malware, {{which had been}} used for widespread cyber-espionage for five years. It targeted political targets like embassies, nuclear sites, mostly in Europe, Switzerland and North America. The malware was likely written by Russian-speaking hackers and the exploits by Chinese hackers. That June, Kaspersky discovered NetTraveler, which it said was obtaining data on emerging technology from government targets and oil companies. Kaspersky did not identify who was behind it, but it was similar to other cyber-espionage coming from Beijing, China. Later that same year, Kaspersky discovered a hacker group it called Icefog after investigating an cybersecurity attack on a Japanese television company. Kaspersky said the hacker group, possibly from China, was unique in that they targeted specific files they seemed to know about <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> malware to extract them.|$|E

500|$|Tintin in the Congo shows Tintin {{taking part}} in what Michael Farr {{described}} as [...] "the wholesale and gratuitous slaughter" [...] of animals; {{over the course of}} the Adventure, Tintin shoots several antelope, kills an ape to wear its skin, rams a rifle vertically into a crocodile's open mouth, injures an elephant for ivory, stones a buffalo, and (in earlier editions) drills a hole into a rhinoceros <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> dynamite in its body, blowing it up from the inside. Such scenes reflect the popularity of big-game hunting among whites and affluent visitors in Sub-Saharan Africa during the 1930s. Hergé later felt guilty about his portrayal of animals in Tintin in the Congo and became an opponent of blood sports; when he wrote Cigars of the Pharaoh (1934), he had Tintin befriend a herd of elephants living in the Indian jungle.|$|E
500|$|Onions {{are best}} {{cultivated}} in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are {{good as they}} are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require {{a high level of}} nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied <b>before</b> <b>planting</b> because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as [...] "long-day" [...] onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as [...] "intermediate-day" [...] types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, [...] "short-day" [...] onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3to9. Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to [...] "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.|$|E
