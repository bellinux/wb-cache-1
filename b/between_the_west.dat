5|$|Smaller realignments {{also took}} place in other cities along the route. In Canandaigua, NY5 {{originally}} entered the city on West Avenue and followed South Main Street and Lakeshore Drive through the city limits before rejoining its current routing in Hopewell. In the mid-1950s, a new bypass was built north of Lakeshore Drive from South Main Street to Hopewell. It became part of a realigned NY5 by 1956. The remainder of the bypass around the southwestern extents {{of the city was}} built in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The former routing of NY5 on South Main Street remains state maintained as NY942T; until 1996, the portion of West Avenue <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>west</b> end of the bypass and the Canandaigua city line was maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as NY942W. Even though maintenance of the road had been transferred to the town of Canandaigua in 1996, the designation remained in NYSDOT documents until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{foundations}} {{are located in}} confined spots adjacent to I-66 and the electrified third rail of the Orange Line, making access difficult.

This required {{the portion of the}} Orange Line <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>West</b> Falls Church and East Falls Church Metro stations to be taken out of service on weekends while the tests were conducted. The foundations were acceptable and the bridge construction proceeded using the existing foundations.|$|E
