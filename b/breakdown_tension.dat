40|$|In {{recent years}} {{tensiometers}} for direct measurement of matric suction {{have been developed}} at Imperial College and later on at the University of Saskatchewan. The major drawback of these instruments is water cavitation which may occur before pressure equalisation. A {{better understanding of the}} mechanisms that control cavitation inside the tensiometer may therefore help optimise their design and define adequate experimental procedures. This paper presents some of the experiences gained {{over the past four years}} using three tensiometers manufactured by Imperial College. Some of the anomalous responses recorded by tensiometers are first discussed. These were probably due to inadequate saturation of the porous ceramic rather than malfunctioning of the instruments. The results from a series of tests conducted with two or three tensiometers positioned on the same sample are then presented. These were helpful in defining suitable experimental procedures. Finally, the history of <b>tension</b> <b>breakdown</b> of each tensiometer is examined to identify some of the factors that affect the maximum sustainable tension as well as measurement duration. On the basis of data recorded before and after cavitation, a possible mechanism of cavitation in a tensiometer is described...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{a mobile}} health project {{launched}} in Malawi and considers its sustainability {{in light of}} activities {{that occur in the}} pilot stage. It has been said that most projects of this nature fail during piloting hence it is pertinent to review the activities in this early stage. The study follows a grounded theory inspired research approach and is focused on the day to day breakdowns that occur in the pilot, what they reveal, and how the resolutions relate to the project’s goals. It is found that when breakdowns occur, an articulation process to sustain the intervention becomes visible. <b>Breakdowns</b> can reveal <b>tensions</b> in the technical design and organisational context thereby offering opportunities for action in order that an intervention is sustained. The ensuing activity, for analytical purposes, is termed articulation work, and its variety and limitations are explained. In this study we discover two categories of articulation work, technological and human. Further to this, we argue that these two categories of articulation work can be further analysed into different dimensions, based on the levels of organizational involvement required to resolve them: (i) localised; (ii) multiple levels within a single organization; (iii) and multiple levels inter-organizational...|$|R

The prediction is performed through modeling {{the relationship between the}} insulation resistance measured between distribution transformers high voltage winding, low voltage winding and the ground and the <b>breakdown</b> strength, interfacial <b>tension</b> acidity and the water content of the transformers oil. The process of predicting these oil parameters statuses is carried out using various configurations of neural networks. First, a multilayer feed forward neural network with a back-propagation learning algorithm was implemented. Subsequently, a cascade of these neural networks was deemed to be more promising, and four variations of a three stage cascade were tested. The first configuration takes four inputs and outputs four parameter values, while the other configurations have four neural networks, each with two or three inputs and a single output; the output from some networks are pipelined to some others to produce the final values. Both configurations are evaluated using real-world training and testing data and the accuracy is calculated across a variety of hidden layer and hidden neuron combinations.

The {{aim is to}} increase the efficiency of the blank cutting operation into the plates by means of rational applying lubricant-coolant, stabilization of the cutting edge in slitting wheels and combined machining of the plates. The relations for design of the plate deflection for determination of te height parameters of plates cutted by a stabilized wheel and thickness of the disturbed layer after combined machining have been obtained firstly by an analytical way. The rational conditions of cutting blanks of the non-metallic materials into the plates have been determined; the role of technological inheritance in the defects of cutted plates by the finished bases has been revealed; the new process for stabilization of the slitted wheels has been developed. The technological recommendations and device for tension degree check of AKVR wheels have been introduced in 1993 in the leading enterprise (Production Enterprise "Itil"). The efficiency is expressed in the increase of cutting productivity (1, 5 - 2 times) at keeping yield of the finished plates and in the prevention of rejection caused by AKVR <b>breakdown</b> at their <b>tension.</b> Application field: enterprises of microelectronics and mechanical engineering in operations of cutting blanks of non-metallic materials into plates by diamond slitting wheelsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSoil {{tensiometers}} are {{instruments to}} measure directly, without calibration, the soil matric potential between zero and the barometric pressure, {{but in practice}} it is functional up to about 85 kPa, allowing monitoring continuously the soil water status for irrigation scheduling and other hydrological applications. The major drawback of these instruments is water cavitation, which causes interruption of measurements (<b>tension</b> <b>breakdown)</b> and requires instrument re-saturation. In {{order to avoid the}} major problems related with common tensiometers, a new class of instruments named dihedral tensiometers was developed at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation. In this new class of instruments two rectangular hydrophilic flat glass plates or one glass plate with a fine porous flat plate are fixed in angle, defining the dihedral angle. The distance from the vertex to the water meniscus (L) formed after equilibration is linearly proportional to the soil matric potential. Using different spacer thickness between the two flat plates allows constructing sensors for different matric potential ranges and applications. Several dihedral tensiometer prototypes have been designed, constructed and tested for matric potential measurements in pot substrates and soils. Results shows linear responses between the applied water potential, using a Richards chamber as reference, and the distance L. Time responses was of few minutes to about 40 min, depending on the range of measurement, on the spacer thickness, and on the porous element properties and length. Results of experiments performed in laboratory are presented and discussed as well as the basic principles and construction details of the dihedral tensiometer are described...|$|R
40|$|In {{an age of}} self-affirmation and self-assertion, 'selfless love' {{can appear}} {{as a threat to}} the lover's {{personal}} well-being. This perception jars with the Biblical promise that we gain our life through losing it and therefore calls for a theological response. In conversation with the Protestant theologian Paul Tillich and the atheistic moral philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch, Selfless Love and Human Flourishing in Paul Tillich and Iris Murdoch enquires into the anthropological grounds on which selfless love can be said to build up, rather than undermine, the lover's self. It proposes that while the implausibility of selfless love was furthered by the modern deconstruction of the self, both Tillich and Murdoch utilize this very deconstruction towards explicating and restoring the link between selfless love and human flourishing. Julia T. Meszaros shows that they use the modern diagnosis of the human being's lack of a stable and independent self as manifest in Sartre's existentialism in support of an understanding of the self as relational and fallen. This leads them to view a loving orientation away from self and a surrender to the other as critical to the full flourishing of human selfhood. In arguing that Tillich and Murdoch defend the link between selfless love and human flourishing through reference to the human being's ontological selflessness, Meszaros closely engages Søren Kierkegaard's earlier attempt to keep selfless love and human flourishing in a productive, dialectical tension. She also examines the <b>breakdown</b> of this <b>tension</b> in the later figures of Anders Nygren, Simone Weil, and Jean-Paul Sartre, and addresses the pitfalls of this breakdown. Her examination concludes by arguing that the link between selfless love and human flourishing would be strengthened by a more resolute endorsement of a personal God, and of the reciprocal nature of selfless love. nrpages: 240 status: publishe...|$|R
