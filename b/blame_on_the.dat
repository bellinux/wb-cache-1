5|$|Admiral Parker and General Clinton {{engaged in}} a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his {{personal}} bravery.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie {{is found}} in the Trans-Fly region of {{southern}} New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke's Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.|$|E
5000|$|The {{violence}} that erupted {{as a result}} of the Stagecoach Feud was mostly <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Donnellys and gave the family a bad reputation. From that time on, almost every crime committed was <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> family, but although they were charged with numerous crimes, [...] "few convictions were secured against them".|$|R

25|$|Following Shahumyan's death, the Soviet {{government}} depicted him as {{a fallen}} hero of the Russian revolution. Shahumyan's close relationship with Lenin also increased the already heightened tensions between the British and the Soviets, who placed much of the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British in complicity in the massacre.|$|E
25|$|Academic {{research}} also places {{most of the}} <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> direction of transport planning, which systematically marginalised public transport improvements and maintenance in favour of US-influenced roads and motorway plans. As part of this declining importance of public transport, in 1983 there were serious plans by the Auckland Regional Authority to abolish the Auckland railway system altogether.|$|E
50|$|The low turnout (48.56%) was <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> non-inclusion {{of areas}} outside the {{district}} in the special holiday for the election. Another factor was the nonexistence of campaign materials from the candidates. The turnout in Liloan, the town with the lowest turnout at 31.78%, was <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town fiesta that prevented the electorate from voting.|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{beginning}} of construction, the land stalemate dragged on for months, as did the harsh rhetoric in the media. Some {{members of the media}} and public placed blame on Hennepin County for not securing the land before getting authorization to build the ballpark, while others laid the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sellers for allegedly increasing their price once the legislation passed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} after the fire, there were {{considerable}} efforts to assign and avoid <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> part of the band, the nightclub owners, the manufacturers and distributors of the foam material and pyrotechnics, and the concert promoters. Through attorneys, club owners said they did not give permission to the band to use pyrotechnics. Band members claimed they had permission.|$|E
25|$|Some {{other sources}} lay {{some of the}} <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{complexity}} of the technology and the great expense of the warship. An analysis of the events by the International Strategic Studies Association described the deployment of an AEGIS cruiser into that zone as irresponsible, and the Association thought that the great expense of his warship had played a major part in setting a low threshold for opening fire.|$|E

25|$|Iraqi gunmen {{dressed in}} {{military}} uniforms kidnapped the second {{secretary of the}} Iranian embassy, Jalal Sharafi, on February 4, 2007 as he drove through central Baghdad. One official of the Iraqi government stated that the abduction occurred {{at the hands of}} a special army unit that reports directly to the US military command, but this was denied by American military officials. Iran's Foreign Ministry has condemned the kidnapping and pinned the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> US.|$|E
25|$|Some American {{writers on}} the subject (including many ex-SOG personnel) blamed {{the failure of the}} {{operations}} on the penetration of the unit by enemy spies – a claim not entirely unsupported by fact. Others, however, laid more of the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> operational ineptitude of SOG, which simply continued to repeat a failed formula. Changes to the infiltration program (in the form of the diversionary Operation Forae), spurred by suspicions at headquarters, had come only as late as 1967.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the wake}} of the {{newspaper}} stories regarding the murder, the Viscount was reminded of the theft and demanded a search for the jewels in Marie's room in Le Glandier. When the jewels turned up during the search, some newspapers believed her and put all the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Viscountess. However, when she was put on trial for theft, the court was not so persuaded. Marie was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in the nearby town of Tulle.|$|E

25|$|Thousands of Chinese men {{arrived in}} California {{to work as}} laborers, {{recruited}} by industry as low-wage workers. Over time, conflicts in the gold fields and cities created prejudices between white and Chinese laborers. During the decade-long depression after the transcontinental railroad was completed, white workers began to lay <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese laborers. Many Chinese were expelled from the mine fields. Some returned to China after the Central Pacific was built. Those who stayed mostly moved to the Chinatown in San Francisco {{and a few other}} cities, where they were relatively safe from violent attacks they suffered elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|A Commission of Inquiry was {{appointed}} by Governor Franklin Gimson. It was headed by Sir Lionel Leach, {{a member of the}} Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Commission placed large <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> police command for not having anticipated the violence from many indicators between 2 and 11 December. Furthermore, when the riots first started, the police failed to act promptly to disperse the crowd. The Gurkha Contingent standing by was not put into action, while too much dependence was placed on Malay policemen, many of whom defected or at least hesitated to carry out their duties. The British House of Commons criticised the colonial government for its poor handling of the situation.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} $1,236,634 {{was spent}} on a security risk assessment to be performed by the private Georgia based logistical and engineering services firm Unified Consultants Group, Inc. A July 25, 2012 audit, released shortly after the incident cost analysis, performed by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, determined that the contract was mismanaged by the IRS. The security-review process was determined to have had multiple problems, {{and many of the}} sites were not inspected by the contractor. The audit placed the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> IRS agency's individuals responsible for defining, negotiating, and administering the contract, with potentially 100% of funds being used inefficiently and the security improvements of IRS sites may have been ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Adémar de Chabannes {{wrote about}} the events, drawing {{associations}} between Al-Hakim (who founded the Druze faith and self-proclaimed himself to be the Mahdi) and the Antichrist, blaming the Jews for inspiring his desecration of the Holy Sepulchre. Rudolfus Glaber also wrote {{a history of the}} events blaming French Jews from Orléans for sending a message to the Caliph via a pilgrim disguised as a Jew. The message was said to have been hidden inside a hollow staff and urged the Caliph to destroy the sepulchre on threat Christians would take over his empire otherwise. Rudolfus portrays Al-Hakim as gullible and firmly cast <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jews. This led to outbreaks of antisemitism and violence against Jews across Europe with King Robert II of France ordering forced conversions and Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor to expel Jews from Mainz, condemning Judaism as heresy.|$|E
25|$|The {{violence}} {{left one}} man dead and seven people (five soldiers and two MPs) injured. At court martial, 32 {{were found guilty}} of various crimes including mutiny, seizing arms, rioting, and firing upon officers and MPs. The sentences were all reduced on appeal, with the poor leadership and use of racial slurs by MPs considered mitigating factors. General Ira C. Eaker, commander of the Eighth Air Force, placed {{the majority of the}} <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> white officers and MPs and to prevent such an incident happening again, he combined the black trucking units into a single special command. The ranks of this command were purged of inexperienced and racist officers, and the MP patrols were racially integrated. Morale among black troops stationed in England improved, and the rates of courts-martial and venereal disease both fell, although there were several more minor conflicts between black and white American troops in Britain during the war.|$|E
25|$|Born in Kanagawa Prefecture in September of {{the first}} year of Bunkyū (1861), Sōjirō is an illegitimate child who was badly mistreated by his father's family {{to the point of being}} beaten for faltering in his tasks. To build a {{tolerance}} to the beatings, Sōjirō put on a smiling face as his tormenters decide to let him be. One night, at age eight, Sōjirō witnessed the recently scarred Makoto Shishio killing two police officers and was spared due to the criminal seeing the boy's smile. While secretly feeding Shishio and providing him with bandages, Sōjirō takes the man's ideals to heart while receiving a wakizashi. When his family learned that he is harboring Shishio and decide to murder the child and pin the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fugitive, Sōjirō uses the wakizashi Shishio gave him to slaughter his family. Soon after, once Shishio's wounds are healed, Sōjirō travels with him as his right hand and member of the Jupongatana.|$|E
