5|$|The Soviet Union (USSR) {{competed with}} its own single-pilot spacecraft, Vostok.

5|$|The Syrians responded <b>by</b> <b>launching</b> about 100 fighter {{aircraft}} {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>launching</b> such a spoiling {{attack against}} PAVN's {{long-established}} logistical system, the American and South Vietnamese high commands hoped to resolve several pressing issues. A quick victory in Laos would bolster the morale and {{confidence of the}} Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), which was already high {{in the wake of}} the successful Cambodian Campaign of 1970. It would also serve as proof positive that South Vietnamese forces could defend their nation in the face of the continuing withdrawal of U.S. ground combat forces from the theater. The operation would be, therefore, a test of that policy and ARVN's capability to operate effectively by itself.|$|E
5|$|Covert operations, however, {{were another}} matter. One {{result of the}} {{increasing}} PAVN road building effort in Cambodia was that the U.S. also upped the ante against the trail system in Laos <b>by</b> <b>launching</b> the first B-52 Stratofortress strike against the logistical system on 12 December 1965. In April 1967 the U.S. headquarters in Saigon finally received authorization to launch Daniel Boone, an intelligence gathering operation that conducted by the highly secret Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group or SOG.|$|E

5|$|In early October, the NVA had {{intensified}} battalion-size ground probes {{and sustained}} artillery fire against Con Thien, a hilltop stronghold {{in the center}} of the Marines' defensive line south of the DMZ in northern Quang Tri Province. Mortar rounds, artillery shells, and 122mm rockets fell randomly, but incessantly upon the base. The September bombardments ranged from 100 to 150 rounds per day, with a maximum on 25 September of 1,190 rounds. Westmoreland responded <b>by</b> <b>launching</b> Operation Neutralize, an aerial and naval bombardment campaign designed to break the siege. For seven weeks, American aircraft dropped from 35,000 to 40,000 tons of bombs in nearly 4,000 airstrikes.|$|E
