25|$|The biblical {{basis of}} the investigative {{judgment}} teaching was challenged in 1980 by ex-Adventist professor Desmond Ford. (See Glacier View controversy.) While the church has officially reaffirmed its basic position on the doctrine since 1980, many of those within the church's progressive wing continue to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the teaching.

[...] He had {{a strong commitment to}} the idea of freeing Belgium from German occupation but was known to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> what he considered anti-clerical views held by the French authorities. [...] Gleeson was familiar with the realities of war and, in December 1914, wrote that [...] "if ... advocates of war were made to be soaked and caked and crusted with cold, wet trench mud, like these poor soldiers, and to wear those mud-weighted coats they would not be so glib with their treatises on the art of war.

500|$|The poem {{has been}} the object of both {{scholarly}} and popular attention, and its discovery {{was reported in the}} international media. [...] Scholars have tended to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the literary value of the poem, but consider it valuable as a historical source. [...] Much of the scholarship on the poem has focused on the question of who the speaker and the addressee in the poem are, and whether Charaxos and Larichos are the historical or fictional brothers of Sappho. [...] Others have discussed the place of the Brothers Poem in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, and its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories told in the Odyssey. [...] The lost initial stanza or stanzas of the poem have also been the subject of scholarly attention, with various reconstructions being put forward.|$|E
500|$|In a {{commentary}} {{piece for the}} Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford, Charles Stewart expressed his opinion that Dreamtime is best described as [...] "the sort of book that Carlos Castaneda might have written {{if he were a}} German philosopher." [...] He identifies a series of commonalities between Duerr's work and Castenada's, claiming that Duerr's description of his encounter with the Native American yerbatero in the book's preface is an [...] "allusion" [...] to Castenada's meeting with Don Juan Matus, which he described in The Teachings of Don Juan (1968). Praising Duerr's use of source material, Stewart notes that many anthropologists would <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> using ethnographic data to [...] "construct a moral parable" [...] for Western society, and he went on to question whether it was really necessary for Westerners to return to [...] "archaic" [...] modes of thought.|$|E

500|$|The {{second major}} {{division}} in the church occurred over the day of worship, when Sabbatarians within the congregation wanted to worship on Saturday. [...] The practice was largely tolerated, with some parishioners attending one service, some attending another, and some attending both. [...] The elder Obadiah Holmes, however, was hostile to the practice, and was rebuked by Clarke in 1667 over his harshness towards the Sabbatarians. [...] Holmes subsequently withdrew from preaching at the Newport church, but resumed his pastoral duties there in 1671. [...] When he continued to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the Sabbatarians, they finally left to form their own church in December 1671. [...] Additional dissension occurred in the church, centered on the family of Giles Slocum. [...] When Slocum's wife, Joan, denied that Christ was alive, she was excommunicated in 1673. [...] Following this, her husband, their children, and their children's spouses all left the church, and became Quakers.|$|E
500|$|What's the Story was {{released}} to lukewarm reviews {{from the mainstream}} music press. Many contemporary reviewers expressed disappointment at the album's perceived inferiority to Definitely Maybe, taking aim at the 'banal lyrics' and the unoriginal nature of the compositions. David Cavanagh of Q magazine said of the lyrics [...] "They scan; they fill a hole; end of story. They [...] nothing much about anything." [...] Andy Gill of The Independent commented that [...] "She's Electric" [...] is laddism of a tiresomely generic kind [...] "Roll With It" [...] is drab and chummy." [...] Perhaps the most damning review came from David Stubbs of the now-defunct Melody Maker. Despite stating that [...] "Some Might Say" [...] was [...] "the best single of the year", Stubbs went on to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> the album as a whole; [...] "What's the Story [...] laboured and lazy. On this evidence, Oasis are a limited band... they sound knackered." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Mughal era, [...] "it was {{a common}} mode of {{execution}} in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant." [...] Captain Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler Shah Jahan ordered an offending military commander to be carried [...] "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death". The Mughal Emperor Humayun ordered the crushing by elephant of an imam he mistakenly believed to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor Jahangir, {{is said to have}} ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The French traveler François Bernier, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of Delhi, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces [...] "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".|$|E

500|$|McCay is a {{controversial}} figure in Australian history. Disagreement about his significance and reputation began {{before his death}} and continues to the present. General Sir Brudenell White considered McCay to be [...] "one of the greatest soldiers that ever served Australia, greater even than Monash." [...] McCay's achievements included {{the creation of the}} Military Board and the Australian Army Intelligence Corps, and the development of the Staff Corps, [...] "laying the foundations on which the Australian Army was built." [...] In writing Volume III of the Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–1918, which covered 1916, official historian Charles Bean exonerated McCay of blame for Fromelles. This led to a public debate in the pages of The Bulletin in 1929 between critics of McCay and his defenders, led by Elliott. A revival of interest in Australian military history and the rediscovery of graves at Fromelles in the 21st Century led to a number of books being written about the battle, which tended to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> McCay.|$|E
500|$|Another of Przybylo's articles, Asexuality and {{the feminist}} {{politics}} of 'not doing it, published in 2011, takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality. Pryzyblo argues that asexuality {{is made possible}} only through the Western context of [...] "sexual, coital, and heterosexual imperatives". She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore, Valerie Solanas, and Breanne Fahs, who argued for [...] "asexuality and celibacy" [...] as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy. While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy, she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic. In her 2013 article, [...] "Producing Facts: Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex," [...] Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s, which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality, and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert's 2004 study (see above) and has popularized the subject and made it more [...] "culturally visible". In this article, Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon, and continues to <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> its scientific study.|$|E
500|$|Hilda Rix and {{her sister}} Elsie both played musical {{instruments}} as children, and would perform songs or dances at regional shows. Elsie was a singer and actor who performed at the meetings of the Austral Salon, and the sisters collaborated in designing posters to advertise the Salon's activities. As a child, Hilda was enthusiastic about drawing. [...] Her artistic efforts drew praise while she was attending high school at Melbourne Girls Grammar (known as Merton Hall), though in most other respects Rix was not an outstanding student. Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the Heidelberg School, Frederick McCubbin. Her fellow students were mostly women and included Jessie Traill, Norah Gurdon, Ruth Sutherland, Dora Wilson, and Vida Lahey. Rix would subsequently <b>be</b> <b>critical</b> <b>of</b> McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as [...] "vague persuasions". Nevertheless, {{the author of the}} only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of nationalistic ideas and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations.|$|E
