5|$|The rings were {{investigated}} in detail during the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical imaging, and through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries {{relative to the}} Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd Galatea.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is {{the most}} {{reflective}} of Uranus's moons. Its surface shows an opposition surge: the reflectivity decreases from 53% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 35% at an angle of about 1°. The <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of Ariel is about 23%—the highest among Uranian satellites. The surface of Ariel is generally neutral in color. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the latter appears to be redder than the former by 2%. Ariel's surface generally does not demonstrate any correlation between albedo and geology {{on the one hand}} and color on the other hand. For instance, canyons have the same color as the cratered terrain. However, bright impact deposits around some fresh craters are slightly bluer in color. There are also some slightly blue spots, which do not correspond to any known surface features.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} rings were identified. Two additional rings {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer rings were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known rings are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main rings. The rings are extremely dark—the <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E
30|$|One should {{consider}} bolometric <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> rather than geometric albedos in global energy-budget calculations. This is because <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> are spherical, while geometric albedos are directional. Studies oftentimes only report geometric albedos of celestial objects, since these are directly measurable, while <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> must be calculated and require {{knowledge of the}} hemispheric phase integral. Airless bodies usually have <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> that are lower than their geometric albedos.|$|R
30|$|Available surface {{reflectance}} {{data from}} the Solar System suggest that bolometric <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> of ice-free regolith-covered airless bodies typically range from 0.068 to 0.16 (Mallama et al. 2002; Shestopalov and Golubeva 2011). Some small-sized asteroids mostly composed of rocks have lower <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> than 0.068, but such values are not typical for larger regolith-covered bodies. Employing the above albedo limits with Eq. (16) yields a global average temperature for a hypothetical airless Earth 195.4 K ≤ Tna ≤ 200.6 K. This translates into an ATE between 87.0 K and 92.2 K. Thus, one can formally quote Earth’s ATE as 89.6 [*]±[*] 2.6 K, although we consider ATE[*]=[*] 90.5 K to be our best estimate. Therefore, the thermal effect of our atmosphere is 2.7 to 5 times stronger than currently assumed based on Eq. (3). According to our analysis, Earth’s ATE varies spatially from 86 K at the Equator to about 148 K at the Poles.|$|R
40|$|Voyager {{photographic}} {{images and}} photopolarimetric experiment observations {{have been used}} to obtain the spectral geometric and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos,</b> phase integrals, color-dependent phase coefficients, and integrated solar phase-curve parameters of the five Uranian satellites Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. While the results obtained confirm those of Nelson et al. (1987) and Veverka et al. (1987) that these five largest Uranian satellites constitute a unique class of low-albedo and spectrally flat objects, attention is presently given to important differences among the five moons' surface physical properties...|$|R
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually warm summer season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{thoroughly}} investigated {{during the}} Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Two new faint rings—λ and 1986U2R—were discovered {{bringing the total}} number then known to eleven. Rings were studied by analysing results of radio, ultraviolet and optical occultations. Voyager 2 observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun, producing images with back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the complete phase function, geometrical and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of ring particles. Two rings—ε and η—were resolved in the images revealing a complicated fine structure. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of Uranus, including the two shepherd moons of the ε ring—Cordelia and Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|Uranus {{has five}} major moons: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. They range in {{diameter}} from 472km for Miranda to 1578km for Titania. All these moons are relatively dark objects: their geometrical albedo varies between 30 and 50%, whereas their <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> is between 10 and 23%. Umbriel is the darkest moon and Ariel the brightest. The {{masses of the}} moons range from 6.7kg (Miranda) to 3.5kg (Titania). For comparison, the Moon has a mass of 7.5kg. The major moons of Uranus {{are thought to have}} formed in the accretion disc, which existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or resulted from a large impact suffered by Uranus early in its history.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} multi-layered {{clouds in the}} atmospheres of Earth-like planets {{orbiting}} different types of stars are studied. The radiative effects of cloud particles are directly correlated with their wavelength-dependent optical properties. Therefore the incident stellar spectra may {{play an important role}} for the climatic effect of clouds. We discuss the influence of clouds with mean properties measured in the Earth's atmosphere on the surface temperatures and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> of Earth-like planets orbiting different types of main sequence dwarf stars. Comment: accepted for publication in A&...|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic and {{spectrophotometric}} {{data on the}} atmospheres of comets, {{the outer}} planets, and Titan at ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths were acquired. These data support an effort aimed at characterizing the physical properties and distribution of aerosol particles in the atmospheres of these bodies. New spectrophotometry was acquired of Uranus at 0. 2 lambda 0. 3 micrometer with IUE; archival IUE spectrophotometry of Uranus and Neptune in this wavelength range was acquired and recalibrated. New estimates of radiometric <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> and global energy budges of Uranus, Neptune and Titan were published...|$|R
40|$|Spectrophotometric {{observation}} {{were completed}} of Titan and determinations of its geometric and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> and completion of like observations of Uranus, pre-Voyager encounter. CH 3 D was {{studied in the}} spectrum of Uranus and a determination of the CH 3 D/CH 4 mixing ratio in its atmosphere. The observations needed for a direct calibration of the Sun against Vega was completed. The study was continued of CH 3 D in the spectra of Saturn and Titan. High resolution observations of O I, C 2 and C- 12 C- 13 in the coma of P/Halley were also studied...|$|R
5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% {{at an angle}} of about 1°. Oberon has a low <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The geometric albedo of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
40|$|New {{absolute}} spectrophotometry of Uranus between 3295 A and 7676 A {{obtained at}} spectral resolutions of 4 A and 8 A during its 1981 apparition is reported and compared with previous observations by Younkin (1970) recorded during the 1961 - 1963 apparitions. Geometric albedos are calculated, and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> are estimated for {{both sets of}} data. An increase in brightness of about 14 % and a color change occurred during the interval between the epochs of observation, consistent with the high north-polar haze reported by Price and Franz (1979) and the change in aspect of the planet. An upper limit to the internal heat source is estimated from energy balance considerations...|$|R
40|$|Using {{the white}} light {{measurements}} of Knowles Middleton and Mungall (1952), the Minnaert constants, k and B sub zero, are derived for six types of snow surfaces for phase angles up to 80 deg. The {{conclusion is that}} snow is in general a quasi-Lambert scatterer (k = 1. 04 to 1. 35). Even in an extreme case of specular reflection (a 'glazed rain crust'), k is less than 2 at these phase angles. The range in k and B sub zero suggested by these data are then used to estimate some fundamental photometric parameters of smooth snow-covered planets: geometric <b>albedos,</b> phase integrals, <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos,</b> and phase coefficients...|$|R
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average global equilibrium temperature (the temperature {{in the absence of}} atmospheric effects) of Gliese 581g would range from 209 to 228K (−64 to −45°C, or −84 to −49°F) for <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner Solar System). Adding an Earthlike greenhouse effect would yield an average surface temperature in the range of 236 to 261K (−37 to −12°C, or −35 to 10°F). Gliese 581g would be in an orbit where a silicate weathering thermostat could operate, and this could lead to accumulation of sufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to permit liquid water to exist at the surface, provided the planet's composition and tectonic behavior could support sustained outgassing.|$|R
5|$|Umbriel's {{surface is}} the darkest of the Uranian moons, and {{reflects}} {{less than half}} as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size. Umbriel has a very low <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel. The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0° (geometric albedo) to 19% at an angle of about 1°. This phenomenon is called opposition surge. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color, while fresh bright impact deposits (in Wunda crater, for instance) are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere. The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous—it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.|$|E
25|$|Two common albedos {{that are}} used in {{astronomy}} are the (V-band) geometric albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{phase curve}} {{is useful for}} characterizing an object's {{regolith}} (soil) and atmosphere. It is also the basis for computing the geometrical albedo and the <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of the body.

40|$|Small scale surface {{features}} of the moons Deimos and Phobos were studied using star tracker observations made by the Mariner 9 and Viking orbiters. The whole-disk brightness/solar phase angle phase curves were developed out to a phase angle of 125 deg. An analysis was undertaken according to Lumme-Bowell theory to obtain accurate phase integrals zero-phase geometric <b>albedos,</b> and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos.</b> The microstructural and particulate surface properties of the two moons {{were found to be}} very similar, as were the whole-body densities and the microphysical makeup, thereby suggesting a common origin. However, the presence of streamers on Deimos and the relatively smooth surfaces of both moons indicates a long-term influence of Mars producing surface morphologies different from what would occur with asteroids...|$|R
40|$|Voyager 2 imaging {{observations}} over a {{wide range}} of phase angles are used to determine the fundamental photometric parameters for the five largest satellites of Uranus. Over the spectral range covered by Voyager cameras (approximately 350 - 600 nm) the disk-averaged colors are moderately gray (no redder than the spectrum of Saturn's satellite Phoebe). Geometric albedos range from 0. 19 for Umbriel to 0. 40 for Ariel. Phase coefficients determined generally between phase angles of 10 and 60 deg vary from 0. 021 mag/deg for Ariel to 0. 028 mag/deg for Miranda. Phase integrals lie in the range of 0. 5 - 0. 65. The <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> are about 0. 1 for Umbriel and about 0. 2 for the other satellites...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of the principal Uranian satellites are characterized {{on the basis of}} UV and IR geometric albedos, phase curves, and phase coefficients obtained in full-disk photopolarimetric observations during the Voyager 2 encounter with Uranus in January 1986. The data are presented in tables and graphs and found to be consistent with a heavily cratered terrain and loosely packed regolith. The <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> are calculated as 0. 22 + or - 0. 1 for Ariel, 0. 07 + or - 0. 05 for Umbriel, 0. 16 + or - 0. 12 for Titania, and 0. 19 + or - 0. 22 for Oberon. The characteristics of the Uranian satellites indicate compositions (and probably formation conditions and surface-modification mechanisms) distinct from those of the Saturnian and Jovian satellites...|$|R
25|$|Cassini's {{observations}} allowed high-resolution maps of Tethys to {{be produced}} with the resolution of 0.29km. The spacecraft obtained spatially resolved near-infrared spectra of Tethys showing that its surface is made of water ice mixed with a dark material, whereas the far-infrared observations constrained the bolometric <b>bond</b> <b>albedo.</b> The radar observations at the wavelength of 2.2cm showed that the ice regolith has a complex structure and is very porous. The observations of plasma {{in the vicinity of}} Tethys demonstrated that it is a geologically dead body producing no new plasma in the Saturnian magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|Triton is {{approaching}} an unusually warm summer season that only happens once every few hundred years. Elliot {{and his colleagues}} believe that Triton's warming trend could be driven by seasonal changes in the absorption of solar energy by its polar ice caps. One suggestion for this warming {{is that it is}} a result of frost patterns changing on its surface. Another is that ice albedo has changed, allowing for more heat from the Sun to be absorbed. Bonnie J. Buratti et al. argue the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes on the moon, such as massive venting. Because Triton's <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and the other side to face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its <b>bond</b> <b>albedo</b> and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E
40|$|The phase {{curves of}} Io and Ganymede between 0 and 40 deg solar phase angle have been {{compiled}} from Voyager photopolarimeter and ground-based observations. Modeling the data with the Lumme-Bowell theory {{made it possible}} to determine improved estimates of the surface texture and particulate properties. Accurate V-band zero-phase geometric albedos, phase integrals, and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> are also obtained. The properties of the particles on Io's surface appear to be different from those of other solar system objects whose surfaces are totally controlled by impact cratering processes. Sulfur and SO 2 frost, previously identified by spectral analysis, seem to exist in a physical form not commonly found on earth. The agglomeration of volcanic ash into aggregates on Io's surface is postulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{reflected}} {{spectra of}} extrasolar giant planets are primarily influenced by Rayleigh scattering, molecular absorption, and atmospheric condensates. We present model geometric albedo and phase integral spectra and <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> for planets and brown dwarfs with masses between 0. 8 and 70 Jupiter masses. Rayleigh scattering predominates {{in the blue}} while molecular absorption removes most red and infrared photons. Thus cloud-free atmospheres, found on giant planets with effective temperatures exceeding about 400 K, are quite dark in reflected light beyond 0. 6 µm. In cooler atmospheres first water clouds and then other condensates provide a bright reflecting layer. Only planets with cloudy atmospheres will be detectable in reflected light beyond 1 µm.

50|$|It is {{estimated}} that the average global equilibrium temperature (the temperature {{in the absence of}} atmospheric effects) of Gliese 581g would range from 209 to 228 K (−64 to −45 °C, or −84 to −49 °F) for <b>Bond</b> <b>albedos</b> (reflectivities) from 0.5 to 0.3 (with the latter being more characteristic of the inner Solar System). Adding an Earthlike greenhouse effect would yield an average surface temperature in the range of 236 to 261 K (−37 to −12 °C, or −35 to 10 °F). Gliese 581g would be in an orbit where a silicate weathering thermostat could operate, and this could lead to accumulation of sufficient carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to permit liquid water to exist at the surface, provided the planet's composition and tectonic behavior could support sustained outgassing.|$|R
500|$|Voyager 2 was {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to observe Enceladus's surface in detail, in August 1981. Examination of the resulting highest-resolution imagery revealed at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth (young) terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas. In addition, extensive linear cracks and scarps were observed. Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains, these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old. Accordingly, Enceladus must have been recently active with [...] "water volcanism" [...] or other processes that renew the surface. The fresh, clean ice that dominates its surface gives Enceladus the most reflective surface of any body in the Solar System, with a visual geometric albedo of 1.38 and bolometric <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> of [...] Because it reflects so much sunlight, its surface only reaches a mean noon temperature of , somewhat colder than other Saturnian satellites.|$|E
500|$|Triton {{follows a}} {{retrograde}} and quasi-circular orbit, and {{is thought to}} be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The pressure on Triton's surface is about 14μbar. In 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about [...] Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high geometric albedo of more than 70%. The <b>Bond</b> <b>albedo</b> is even higher, reaching up to 90%. Surface features include the large southern polar cap, older cratered planes cross-cut by graben and scarps, as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism. Voyager 2 observations revealed a number of active geysers within the polar cap heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8km. Triton has a relatively high density of about 2g/cm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean. Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), tidal deceleration is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.|$|E
