6000|$|The {{fact was}} that this Sunday walk through the fields was fraught with great {{excitement}} to Marty and Tommy, who saw a perpetual drama {{going on in the}} hedgerows, and could no more refrain from stopping and peeping than if they had been a couple of spaniels or terriers. Marty was quite sure he saw a yellow-hammer on the boughs of the great ash, and while he was peeping, he missed the sight of a white-throated stoat, which had run across the path and was described with much fervour by the junior Tommy. Then there was a little greenfinch, just fledged, fluttering along the ground, and it seemed quite possible to catch it, till it managed to flutter under the <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush.</b> Hetty could not be got to give any heed to these things, so Molly was called on for her ready sympathy, and peeped with open mouth wherever she was told, and said [...] "Lawks!" [...] whenever she was expected to wonder.|$|E

50|$|Old Michaelmas Day {{falls on}} 11 October (10 October {{according}} to some sources). According to an old legend, blackberries should not be picked after this date.

In Cornwall, a similar legend prevails, according to which the devil urinated on them.|$|E

50|$|Folklore in the British Isles {{suggests}} that Michaelmas {{day is the}} last day that blackberries can be picked.

As it is considered ill-advised to eat them after 29 September, a Michaelmas pie is made from the last of the season.|$|E
50|$|On 3 and 4 September, Gustave Dominici was {{questioned}} {{at the police}} station in Forcalquier, where he contradicted the statement made by motorcyclist Jean-Marie Olivier. Olivier had previously taken part in a police reconstruction at the crime scene, where the police had had to dispel groups of former Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTPs - from an armed communist resistance organisation active during World War II) who were attempting to prevent the reconstruction from taking place. According to Olivier, on the morning after the murders, Gustave had emerged from in front of the Drummonds' car. Gustave claimed that he had emerged from a path about 15 metres further away, {{on the other side of}} a <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush,</b> and that he had already once returned to the farm without approaching the camp bed. Olivier and Gustave were both adamant that their own respective accounts were true. Gustave's questioning lasted for seven hours. Superintendent Sébeille eventually handed over to his colleague Superintendent Constant, who was joined by Superintendent Mével, the deputy to Chief Superintendent Harzic. Gustave eventually admitted to having intercepted Olivier from next to the front of the car and not from the other side of the <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush.</b> He also admitted to having seen the two camp beds but not the bodies of Sir Jack and Lady Anne Drummond.|$|E

50|$|Writing on bone, shells, {{wood and}} silk existed in China {{long before the}} 2nd century BC. Paper was invented in China around the 1st century AD.

Texts were reproduced by woodblock printing; the diffusion of Buddhist texts was a main impetus to large-scale production. The format of the book evolved with intermediate stages of scrolls folded concertina-style, scrolls bound at one edge ("butterfly books") and so on.|$|E
5000|$|In British English, a [...] "bramble" [...] is any rough (usually wild) tangled prickly shrub—specifically the <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush</b> (Rubus fruticosus)—or any {{hybrid of}} similar appearance, with thorny stems. Bramble or {{brambleberry}} may also {{refer to the}} blackberry fruit or products of its fruit (e.g., bramble jelly). [...] The shrub grows abundantly {{in all parts of}} the British Isles and harvesting the fruits in late summer and autumn is often considered a favourite pastime. It can also become a nuisance in gardens, sending down its strong suckering roots amongst hedges and shrubs. Many consider it a weed due its tendency to grow in neglected areas and its sharp, tough thorns which can be hazardous to children and pets.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} broad types of {{vegetation}} in the delta: bush, forest, meadow and water. The forests communities are riparian with white willow, grass-forb, and <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush.</b> The meadow areas features tallgrass, cane and sedge; the marshy meadows mostly reeds. The {{high number of}} fish species in the reserve are due to the shallow waters and abundant vegetation. There are relatively few mammal species, but muskrats, hedgehogs, stoats, weasels and various rodents are present, and mass migrations of bats are seen in late spring and early autumn. There are wolves living permanently in all three sectors of the reserve.The migratory bird season is March to November. The reserve has recorded 283 species of birds, 99 of which nest on the site (and 27 of which are listed as vulnerable in the Red Book of Russia), and 155 of which are seen in periods of migration and wintering.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{determine}} the level of manganese content and its seasonal dynamics in selected herbs and trees species and invertebrates in the period 2011 [...] 2013. Trial sites were located in the highly manganese contaminated ecosystem in Krušné hory mountains. The flora and fauna samples were being collected on a monthly basis. The level of manganese was determined by the AAS method. The highest level of manganese was found in the <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush</b> (Rubus caesius L.) and the raspberry bush (Rubus idaeus L.). The larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and the mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were the most contaminated tree species. Majority of plants accumulates manganese during the vegetative period. The invertebrates showed lower level of manganese content than plants. The highest level was found in millipedes (Diplopoda) and isopods (Oniscoidea). Despite the really high concentration of manganese in the enviroment, none of the plants and invertebrates showed symptoms of toxicosis...|$|E
40|$|Dying in a head-down {{position}} is rare, and autopsy may reveal no morphological findings which can sufficiently explain {{the cause of}} death. The authors describe a case of positional asphyxia of a 78 -year-old man, found dead hanging in head-down position inside a <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush.</b> The subject was suspended by his left leg and wedged inside a thick <b>blackberry</b> <b>bush,</b> while his right leg was free and inflected. Investigation revealed that the elderly man had last been seen after lunch {{in the early afternoon}} (about 2. 00 p. m.), two days before being found. The subject had no pre-existing physical or mental condition which might have explained his death. He was 164 cm tall and weighed 90 kg (BMI: 33. 4). External examination of the body revealed abrasions on the head and multiple superficial scratch marks on the hands; no external signs of violence were observed. The deceased's head was cyanotic and revealed marked petechial haemorrhages of the conjunctiva. Rigor mortis was fully developed and reddish fixed livor was observed on the face, neck and upper chest. The distribution of livor was consistent with the position of the body at the scene. Autopsy revealed marked pulmonary and cerebral oedema; the liver showed fatty vacuolization with a mild increase of connective tissue and thickening of the walls of the central veins and centrilobular sinusoids. The heart was enlarged, particularly the left ventricle, with a slight, calcified, diffuse and increased thickness of the aortic and coronary arteries. The remains of meat and vegetables in the initial phase of digestion were found inside the stomach, and there was a strong smell of alcohol. The blood alcohol concentration, ascertained by GC (Gas Chromatography), was 2. 10 g/l. Toxicological assays for addictive drugs (cocaine, heroin, THC) yielded negative results. There were no features suggesting that the deceased had been the victim of an assault. The authors of this case report illustrate the main pathophysiological and diagnostic features of positional asphyxia and possible relevant co-causes of death, with an emphasis on the combined role of acute alcoholic intoxication and obesity in the hastened demise of a subject in the head-down position...|$|E
