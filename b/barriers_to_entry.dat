Thursby includes marketing boards, possibility of a monopsony, {{and a variety of}} government policies in the analysis. She finds that while there are significant economies of scale in the industry, the <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> are not high and regardless of the extent of market power that US firms have in the industry, the optimal policy is actually an export tax, rather than a subsidy.|$|E

50|$|In {{theories}} {{of competition in}} economics, a <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> or an economic <b>barrier</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> is a cost that must be incurred by a new entrant into a market that incumbents do not have or have not had to incur.|$|R

25|$|The primary {{method by}} which the Mafia stifles competition, however, is the {{overseeing}} and enforcement of collusive agreements between businesspeople. Mafia-enforced collusion typically appear in markets where collusion is both desirable (inelastic demand, lack of product differentiation, etc.) and difficult to set up (numerous competitors, low <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry).</b> Industries which fit this description include garbage collection.|$|E
25|$|Urban {{infrastructure}} involves various physical {{networks and}} spaces necessary for transportation, water use, energy, recreation, and public functions. Infrastructure carries a high initial cost in fixed capital (pipes, wires, plants, vehicles, etc.) but lower marginal costs and thus positive economies of scale. Because {{of the higher}} <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> these networks have been classified as natural monopolies, meaning that economic logic favors control of each network by a single organization, public or private.|$|E
25|$|The {{wealth that}} {{resulted}} was distributed widely because of reduced migration costs and low <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> While gold mining itself was unprofitable for most diggers and mine owners, some people made large fortunes, and the merchants and transportation facilities made large profits. The resulting {{increase in the}} world's gold supply stimulated global trade and investment. Historians have written extensively about the migration, trade, colonization and environmental history associated with gold rushes.|$|E

25|$|A 2015 study {{concluded}} that the low <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> in a competitive market such as coffee undermines any effort to give higher benefits to producers through Fair Trade. They used data from Central America, to establish that the producer benefits were close to zero. This is because there is an oversupply of certification, and {{only a fraction of}} produce classified as Fair Trade is actually sold on Fair Trade markets, just enough to recoup the costs of certification.|$|E
25|$|This {{increase}} in production is largely {{the result of the}} removal of <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> and increased competition; the number of industrial firms rose from 377,300 in 1980 to nearly 8 million in 1990 and 1996; the 2004 economic census, which excluded enterprises with annual sales below RMB 5million, counted 1.33million manufacturing firms, with Jiangsu and Zhejiang reporting more firms than the nationwide total for 1980. Compared to other East Asian industrial growth spurts, China's industrial performance exceeded Japan's but remained behind South Korea and Taiwan's economies.|$|E
25|$|The report's {{findings}} were largely ignored. Instead, CAP spending was kept within the remit of the EU, and France led {{an effort to}} agree a fixed arrangement for CAP spending {{that would not be}} changed until 2012. It was made possible by advance agreement with Germany. It is that agreement that the UK currently wishes to see reopened, both in its efforts to defend the UK position on the UK rebate and also given that the UK is in favour of lowering <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> for Third World agricultural exporters.|$|E

25|$|Insects, like {{nearly every}} other {{organism}} on Earth, {{are subject to}} infectious diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes. These encounters can either kill the insect or greatly weaken it. Insects protect themselves against these detrimental microorganisms in two ways. Firstly, the body-enveloping chitin cuticle, {{in conjunction with the}} tracheal system and the gut lining, serve as major physical <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> Secondly, hemolymph itself {{plays a key role in}} repairing external wounds as well as destroying foreign organisms within the body cavity. Interestingly, insects, along with having passive immunity, also show evidence of acquired immunity.|$|E
25|$|Providing <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry.</b> The {{drawing of}} {{boundaries}} around certain {{food and drink}} produce prevents other actors entering particular markets. On this point the PGS framework can potentially deny (or make extremely difficult) entry into the agro-food sector. For example, there are stringent geographical, productive, facilitative, planning, temporal and skilled constraints to entry into the Stilton cheese market in the UK. The successful application to protect the Cornish pasty is another recent example; with Ginsters of Cornwall central to the bid (itself owned by the ‘extra-local’, Leicestershire-based Samworth Brothers – also makers of fellow PGS protected Melton Mowbray Pork Pies).|$|E
25|$|Facebook's {{platform}} is efficient because it lowers <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> and lowers costs for businesses to rapidly innovate new ideas. Scalability is accomplished with less wasted resources and monetized by collecting user behavior and usage data for targeted advertising. Facebook advertising allows firms to reasonably scale up operations to reach Facebook users. Facebook's daily active users have increased 18% year-over-year and burgeoning from 1 million users in 2004, to over 1.9 billion in 2017. Facebook {{is a leader}} among tech companies who continues to improve their carbon impact through more efficient data centers and clean renewable energy.|$|E

25|$|Shell's primary {{business}} is {{the management of}} a vertically integrated oil company. The development of technical and commercial expertise in all stages of this vertical integration, from the initial search for oil (exploration) through its harvesting (production), transportation, refining and finally trading and marketing established the core competencies on which the company was founded. Similar competencies were required for natural gas, which {{has become one of}} the most important businesses in which Shell is involved, and which contributes a significant proportion of the company's profits. While the vertically integrated business model provided significant economies of scale and <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry,</b> each business now seeks to be a self-supporting unit without subsidies from other parts of the company.|$|E
25|$|An {{individual}} {{must be able}} {{to connect}} in order to achieve enhancement of social and cultural capital and achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in what they can do and what they can achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but have nonfunctioning capabilities in {{that they do not have}} the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{regulatory}} <b>barriers</b> <b>to</b> <b>entry</b> {{remain to}} protect the domestic legal industry. Issues relating to Chinese law must be referred to Chinese law firms, and foreign lawyers are also prohibited from interpreting or practicing Chinese law or from representing their clients in court. However, in reality many foreign law firms interpret laws and manage litigation by directing the local firms they must have cooperative relationships with. In this regard, China's restrictive legal market can be directly tied to a phobia of people asserting their legal rights {{in the face of}} rampant corruption. Information received from the State Council Legislative Office suggests that China may be allowing foreigners to sit the Chinese Lawyers Examination, or have a mutual recognition treaty with other countries to allow foreign lawyers to conduct non-litigation Chinese legal work.|$|E
