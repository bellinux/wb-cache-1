25|$|CART {{officials}} {{held out}} the possibility of rescheduling the race, but there was no room in the schedule and it was ultimately canceled. The race marked the first time a CART race had been canceled outright due to driver safety issues. The 1985 Michigan 500 was postponed six days due to concerns about Goodyear's new radial tire. After three major crashes, drivers refused to participate, and the race was run the following weekend with the old <b>bias-ply</b> tires.|$|E
25|$|Redline <b>bias-ply</b> tires {{continued}} as standard equipment on the 1968 GTO, {{though they could}} be replaced by whitewall tires at no extra cost. A new option was radial tires for improved ride and handling. However, very few were delivered with the radial tires because of manufacturing problems encountered by supplier B.F. Goodrich. The radial tire option was discontinued after 1968. Pontiac did not offer radial tires as a factory option on the GTO again until the 1974 model.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the race, tire provider Goodyear created new tires, branded [...] "Wrangler", based on a previous dirt tire that the company made. To give the trucks more grip, the tires were widened by one inch to eleven. The <b>bias-ply</b> tires (instead of radial tires) also had treads to remove dirt quicker, in a block pattern, along with being softer. The left-side tires were staggered three inches shorter to 85.5 inches than the right tires (88.5) to assist in handling. Meanwhile, the trucks had mesh shields and hood deflector screens attached to prevent debris from the dirt from entering the radiators and damaging the vehicles. The trucks also had the front spoilers and splitters removed, the grille closed, and the rear spoilers raised and enlarged by 40 square inches to generate more downforce. The trucks' windshields remained, meaning the track crew had to keep the track dry, to prevent mud from making them unable to be cleared. On the hoods, bug deflectors, which were 8 by 12 inches, were installed to prevent stones from hitting the windshield. Teams added under panels to the trucks' chassis to prevent dirt from increasing the trucks' weight.|$|E

The engine line-up and horsepower ratings were also carried over {{from the previous year}} as were the 3 and 4-speed manual transmissions. The new optional Turbo Hydramatic 3-speed automatic transmission (RPO M40) replaced the two-speed Powerglide. The L30, a [...] small-block [...] V8 engine rated at [...] and a 3-speed manual transmission were standard, but only a few hundred 3-speed manual equipped cars were sold. The 4-speed manual was available in M20 wide-ratio or M21 close-ratio transmission versions. The M22 “Rock Crusher”, a heavy duty, close-ratio 4-speed gearbox, was also available for certain applications. The engine line-up included the L79, a [...] high performance version of the [...] small-block. Also available were several variants of the [...] big-block V8, that taken together made up nearly half the cars.

Then there was the L88 engine that Chevrolet designed strictly for off-road use (racing), with a published rating of , but featured a high-capacity 4-barrel carb, aluminum heads, a unique air induction system, and an ultra-high compression ratio (12.5:1). All small block cars had low-profile hoods. All big block cars had domed hoods for additional engine clearance with twin simulated vents and “427” emblems {{on either side of the}} dome. The new seven-inch wide steel wheels had F70x15 nylon <b>bias-ply</b> tires standard with either white or red stripe tires optional. Rare options were: L88 engine (80), J56 heavy-duty brakes (81), UA6 alarm system (388), L89 aluminum heads (624).|$|E
50|$|Radial tires have {{different}} characteristics of springiness {{from those of}} <b>bias-ply</b> tires, and a different degree of slip while steering.

5000|$|By comparison, radial tires lay all of {{the cord}} plies at 90 degrees to the {{direction}} of travel (that is, across the tire from lip to lip). This design avoids having the plies rub against each other as the tire flexes, reducing the tire's rolling friction. This allows vehicles with radial tires to achieve better fuel economy than with <b>bias-ply</b> tires. It also accounts for the slightly [...] "low on air" [...] (bulging) look that radial tire sidewalls have, especially when compared to <b>bias-ply</b> tires.|$|E

5000|$|At the start, {{the rear}} tires ("slicks") {{were made with}} a <b>bias-ply</b> {{construction}} ("wrinklewall" [...] slicks had not been invented yet), which meant that grip upon launching was poor. Racers who performed these altered wheelbase modifications found it shifted {{the center of gravity}} rearward, which placed more weight on the rear wheels, enhancing traction from these <b>bias-ply</b> slicks. Because of these many obvious modifications they did not look stock, hence the name [...] "funny". The wheelbases were changed to assist traction for the narrow (7 in-wide) slicks (required by NHRA rules), while keeping the mandatory factory distance between axle centers.|$|E

50|$|Starting in 1988, {{teams were}} allowed to have six crew members over the wall during a pit stop. The crews would consist of four tire changers, a fueler, and a fuel vent/airhose man. Previously they were only allowed five (i.e., three tire changers). This was {{due in part to}} the fact that after the series changed from <b>bias-ply</b> tires to radials, the left-front tire (which at the time was seldom changed) would now be changed much more frequently.|$|E
50|$|In the {{interest}} of cost containment, cars may use either roller camshafts (a type used in Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series engines), or flat tappet camshafts (used in Nextel Cup engines). All cars using a roller camshaft must run a 10.0:1 compression ratio, slightly higher than the former 9.5:1 ratio mandated by NASCAR for those series. All cars using a flat-tappet camshaft must run with current NASCAR regulations mandating a 12.0:1 compression ratio, adopted in the late 1990s. Cars must also run <b>bias-ply</b> tires, despite Goodyear's four-season transition (1989-92) to radial tires. The first race with radials was the 1989 First Union 400 at North Wilkesboro, NC. The last <b>bias-ply</b> race was the 1992 Food City 500 at Bristol, TN. NASCAR has exclusively used radial tires since then, and with Bristol being the late track to go radial, with the August 1992 Bud 500) where later-model Historic cars (1986-88 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 1990-94 Chevrolet Lumina, 1989-95 Ford Thunderbird, 1988-94 Pontiac Grand Prix, 1989-91 Buick Regal, and 1989-92 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme) all raced with radial tires, and Contemporary cars have only used radial tires.|$|E

50|$|The first {{radial tyres}} for cars {{appeared}} in 1943, but motorcyclists waited forty more years for this technology {{to come to}} motorcycles. These were the 1983 Pirelli MP7 radials, introduced on the European version of the 1984 Honda VF1000R, a limited edition exotic motorcycle that showcased {{a number of new}} technologies including carbon fibre reinforced bodywork and air-adjustable anti-dive front forks. The new radial tyres had to provide race-replica handling for the very heavy 524 lb dry weight chassis, up to a top speed of 150 mph, making it the fastest production motorcycle of its day. The MP7 radials came to the US market in 1985. Radial construction uses textile or steel belts arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, along with a layer of belts running around the tyre's circumference, with motorcycle radials deviating from the true radial design by adding belts running at angles to the radial belts, in the manner of <b>bias-ply</b> tyres, allowing the grip, durability, feel, and other characteristics to be adjusted to suit the tyre's design. The benefit of radial tyres is that the tyres run cooler yet maintain great flexibility, allowing engineers to coax significant increases in both grip and tread life, without compromise, under a broader range of conditions than <b>bias-ply</b> tyres.|$|E

5000|$|Michelin {{developed}} and patented a key innovation in tire history, the 1946 radial tire, and successfully exploited this technological innovation {{to become one}} of the worlds leading tire manufacturers. The radial was initially marketed as the [...] "X" [...] tire. It was developed with the front-wheel-drive Citroën Traction Avant and Citroën 2CV in mind. Michelin had bought the then-bankrupt Citroën in the 1930s. Because of its superiority in handling and fuel economy, use of this tire quickly spread throughout Europe and Asia. In the U.S., the outdated <b>bias-ply</b> tire persisted, with market share of 87% in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} tires from rims. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called the Tire Bead. The tire bead is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called the Bead Bundle. [...] The inner-most surface of the tire bead creates the air seal between the tire and rim on a radial-ply tire and a <b>bias-ply</b> tire.

50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} camber angle, and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. <b>Bias-ply</b> tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, twisting torque, or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E
50|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Firestone was selling more than 20,000 {{car and truck}} tires a day. Firestone prospered from a company {{of just a few}} hundred {{employees}} to becoming the biggest industrial employer in Memphis, employing over 3,000. This helped lead to a huge milestone in the Firestone plant’s history. On July 1, 1963, the plant celebrated the production of its 100,000,000th tire. The plant in Memphis was the largest tire manufacturer in the company’s worldwide operation. The smokestack from the company was visible for miles apparently. The death blow was dealt to Firestone after the introduction of radial tires. Every driver wanted these because they simply handled better. The plant was making radial tires, but they decided to specialize in the older <b>bias-ply</b> tires, leading to Firestone dwindling away. In 1983 it was announced that the Firestone plant was closing. The closure of the plant caused more than 1,500 manufacturing and precision operator jobs between 1980 and 1990. Closure also caused declines in residential neighborhood populations and reduction of residential property values in the neighborhood.|$|E
50|$|Fitting modern tires {{is also a}} {{suggestion}} to improve the handling. However, most modern tires may be much wider and have a lower profile than those used on classic cars when new, therefore they may interfere with suspension elements and the tire walls may become damaged. The suspension of a classic car may not be suitable for radial ply tyres, having been designed to only accommodate bias ply tires. Narrow classic car wheels may have been designed for narrow high-profile tube tires and not be suitable for modern tubeless radial tires. Another problem with modern tires on classic cars is that increased grip requires increased steering effort; many classic cars do not come with power steering. Many major tire companies have dedicated classic car tire marketing departments and {{will be able to}} give expert technical advice to address all these issues. It is important to know how radial tires will affect the performance of a car originally fitted with <b>bias-ply</b> tires, and the considerations needed to compensate for the differences.|$|E
