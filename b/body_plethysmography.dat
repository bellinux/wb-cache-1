40|$|This {{synthesis}} aims {{to review}} the pulmonary function tests available in swine. Two techniques are used {{in order to measure}} the variations of the mechanical properties of the respiratory system. The oesophageal balloon remains the most used technique in order to determine these properties in pigs. However, it requires a systematic anaesthesia of the animal. The impulse oscillometry specifically measures the mechanical properties of the respiratory system, by a non invasive way, but the animals have to be trained to be immobilized or sedated to perform the measurement. The whole <b>body</b> arometric <b>plethysmography</b> allows measuring the respiratory pattern in unsedated freely moving piglets. That method allows investigating pigs for long term studies while minimizing the stress related to handling. From this point of view, it represents the less stressing technique for pigs. Finally, blood gases analysis is the easiest method to use in the field. It permits to assess respiratory function by measuring pH and blood partial pressures in oxygen and carbon dioxidePeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether Escherichia coli endotoxin (LPS) may predispose the lung to an infection with Pasteurella multocida type A (Pma) and to determine the LPS concentration needed to reproduce clinical signs of bronchopneumonia. Twenty-four hours before inoculating Pma or sterile growth medium, piglets were tracheally instilled with 10, 100 or 400 microg/kg LPS. Cough, body temperature, daily weight gain (DWG) bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells and volume of pneumonic lung were measured. Changes in breathing pattern (Penh) were assessed by whole <b>body</b> barometric <b>plethysmography.</b> No significant changes were observed in Pma-treated or in control animals. Each LPS doses induced DWG reduction while the higher generated a severe subacute interstitial pneumonia causing hyperthermia {{and an increase in}} Penh. The combination of the lower LPS doses with Pma produced an asymptomatic bronchopneumonia leading to DWG reduction, rise in Penh and an increase in BALF macrophages and neutrophils. With 400 microg/kg LPS, Pma worsened the inflammatory process as illustrated by cough, hyperthermia, major DWG reduction and by a greater Penh response. Lung lesions consisted of severe exudative bronchopneumonia. We concluded that LPS may negatively influence growth, predispose to persisting lung inflammatory process and promote Pma infection depending on the dose previously administered. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) causes {{irreversible}} {{central nervous}} system damage unless a phenylalanine (PHE) restricted diet with amino acid supplementation is maintained. To prevent growth retardation, a protein/amino acid intake beyond the recommended dietary protein allowance is mandatory. However, data regarding disease and/or diet related changes in body composition are inconclusive and retarded growth and/or adiposity is still reported. The BodPod whole <b>body</b> air-displacement <b>plethysmography</b> method is a fast, safe and accurate technique to measure body composition. AIM: To gain more insight into the body composition of children with PKU. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with PKU born between 1991 and 2001 were included. Patients were identified by neonatal screening and treated in our centre. Body composition was measured using the BodPod system (Life Measurement Incorporation©). Blood PHE values determined every 1 - 3 months in the year preceding BodPod analysis were collected. Patients were matched for gender and age with data of healthy control subjects. Independent samples t tests, Mann-Whitney and linear regression were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean body fat percentage in patients with PKU (n = 20) was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (n = 20) (25. 2 % vs 18. 4 %; p = 0. 002), especially in girls above 11 years of age (30. 1 % vs 21. 5 %; p = 0. 027). Body fat percentage increased with rising body weight in patients with PKU only (R = 0. 693, p = 0. 001), but did not correlate with mean blood PHE level (R = 0. 079, p = 0. 740). CONCLUSION: Our data show a higher body fat percentage in patients with PKU, especially in girls above 11 years of age...|$|R

40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} {{acceptability}} and feasibility of whole <b>body</b> air displacement <b>plethysmography</b> {{in children and}} to determine its precision and agreement with hydrodensitometry, an appropriate reference method.  METHODS—Age specific two component model equations were used to predict fat mass from body density in 22 children aged 8 - 12 years and in 10 adults for comparison of methods. Precision for each method was established from duplicate measurements.  RESULTS—Plethysmography was accepted more readily than hydrodensitometry (100 % v 69 % provided duplicate measurements). Precision for fat mass in children was 0. 38 kg by plethysmography and 0. 68 kg by hydrodensitometry, and results were similar in adults. The mean (SD) fat mass in children was 6. 9 kg (4. 0) and 6. 7 kg (4. 2) by plethysmography and hydrodensitometry, respectively, but 95 % limits of agreement between methods were large (− 4. 1 kg to 3. 5 kg fat).  CONCLUSION—Plethysmography was more readily accepted and had better precision than hydrodensitometry.

However, the mechanism(s) by which tolerization is achieved remain poorly defined. In this study we endeavored to induce oral tolerance to cockroach allergen (CRA: a complex mixture of insect components) in order to ameliorate asthma-like, allergic pulmonary inflammation. Methods We compared the pulmonary inflammation of mice which had received four CRA feedings prior to intratracheal allergen sensitization and challenge to mice fed PBS on the same time course. Respiratory parameters were assessed by whole <b>body</b> unrestrained <b>plethysmography</b> and mechanical ventilation with forced oscillation. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and lung homogenate (LH) were assessed for cytokines and chemokines by ELISA. BAL inflammatory cells were also collected and examined by light microscopy. Results CRA feeding prior to allergen sensitization and challenge led to a significant improvement in respiratory health. Airways hyperreactivity measured indirectly via enhanced pause (Penh) was meaningfully reduced in the CRA-fed mice compared to the PBS fed mice (2. 3 ± 0. 4 vs 3. 9 ± 0. 6; p = 0. 03). Directly measured airways resistance confirmed this trend when comparing the CRA-fed to the PBS-fed animals (2. 97 ± 0. 98 vs 4. 95 ± 1. 41). This effect was not due to reduced traditional inflammatory cell chemotactic factors, Th 2 or other cytokines and chemokines. The mechanism of improved respiratory health in the tolerized mice was due to significantly reduced eosinophil numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (43300 ± 11445 vs 158786 ± 38908; p = 0. 007) and eosinophil specific peroxidase activity in the lung homogenate (0. 59 ± 0. 13 vs 1. 19 ± 0. 19; p = 0. 017).

40|$|The carotid {{bodies are}} small sensory organs located along the {{bifurcation}} of the carotid arteries. They detect changes in blood gases and relay {{this information to}} the brain to allow for initiation of appropriate respiratory and cardiovascular responses. A decrease in oxygen (hypoxia) sensed by the carotid body results {{in an increase in}} firing of the carotid sinus nerve and ultimately a change in one 2 ̆ 7 s breathing pattern. An inability to respond to an acute hypoxic (low oxygen) episode via increased ventilation may result in death or lead to pathological or chronic conditions such as stroke and hypertension (Prabhakar et. al., 2005). The carotid bodies are therefore responsible for initiating the acute hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) and blunting or attenuation of the HVR has been implicated in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in 2 ̆ 7 at risk 2 ̆ 7 infant groups (Calder et al., 1994; Horne et al., 2005; Gauda et. al., 2007). The exact mechanism(s) responsible for hypoxic chemotransduction by the carotid body remains controversial and are the subject of intense investigation.

Methods: After being {{randomly assigned to one}} of the following groups: Beef, Whey, or Carbohydrate, twenty four master-age male triathletes (n= 8 per treatment) ingested 20 g of supplement, mixed with plain water once a day (immediately after training or before breakfast). All measurements were performed pre and post interventions. Results: Only Beef significantly reduced body mass (p= 0. 021) along with a trend to preserve or increase thigh muscle mass (34. 1 ± 6. 1 vs 35. 5 ± 7. 4 mm). Both Whey (38. 4 ± 3. 8 vs 36. 9 ± 2. 8 mm) and Carbohydrate (36. 0 ± 4. 8 vs 34. 1 ± 4. 4 mm) interventions demonstrated a significantly (p< 0. 05) decreased vastus medialis thickness. Additionally, the Beef condition produced a significant (p< 0. 05) increase in ferritin concentrations (117 ± 78. 3 vs 150. 5 ± 82. 8 ng/mL). No such changes were observed for the Whey (149. 1 ± 92. 1 vs 138. 5 ± 77. 7 ng/mL) and Carbohydrate (149. 0 ± 41. 3 vs 150. 0 ± 48. 1 ng/mL) groups. Furthermore, ferritin changes in the Beef group were higher than the modification observed in Whey (p< 0. 001) and Carbohydrate (p= 0. 025). No differences were found between Whey and Carbohydrate conditions (p= 0. 223). No further changes were observed.

Methods Twenty-seven recreationally physically active males and females (n = 9 per treatment) were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the three groups: hydrolyzed beef protein, whey protein, or non-protein isoenergetic carbohydrate. Treatment consisted of ingesting 20 g of supplement, mixed with orange juice, once a day immediately post-workout or before breakfast on non-training days.

(2) Are values obtained with three normal breathing techniques comparable in assessing severity of obstruction? We collected these data in 17 patients. A significant correlation was found between airway resistance measured with any of the three methods. The scatter was large, both before and after bronchodilation.

The present study examined the impact of ingesting hydrolyzed beef protein, whey protein, and carbohydrate on strength performance (1 RM), <b>body</b> composition (via <b>plethysmography),</b> limb circumferences and muscular thickness (via ultrasonography), following an 8 -week resistance-training program. After being {{randomly assigned to one}} of the following groups: Beef, Whey, or Carbohydrate, twenty four recreationally physically active males (n = 8 per treatment) ingested 20 g of supplement, mixed with orange juice, once a day (immediately after workout or before breakfast). Post intervention changes were examined as percent change and 95 % CIs. Beef (2. 0 %, CI, 0. 2 – 2. 38 %) and Whey (1. 4 %, CI, 0. 2 – 2. 6 %) but not Carbohydrate (0. 0 %, CI, - 1. 2 – 1. 2 %) increased fat-free mass. All groups increased vastus medialis thickness: Beef (11. 1 %, CI, 6. 3 – 15. 9 %), Whey (12. 1 %, CI, 4. 0, - 20. 2 %), Carbohydrate (6. 3 %, CI, 1. 9 – 10. 6 %). Beef (11. 2 %, CI, 5. 9 – 16. 5 %) and Carbohydrate (4. 5 %, CI, 1. 6 – 7. 4 %), but not Whey (1. 1 %, CI, - 1. 7 – 4. 0 %), increased biceps brachialis thickness, while only Beef increased arm (4. 8 %, CI, 2. 3 – 7. 3 %) and thigh (11. 2 %, 95 %CI 0. 4 – 5. 9 %) circumferences. Although the three groups significantly improved 1 RM Squat (Beef 21. 6 %, CI 5. 5 – 37. 7 %; Whey 14. 6 %, CI, 5. 9 – 23. 3 %; Carbohydrate 19. 6 %, CI, 2. 2 – 37. 1 %), for the 1 RM bench press the improvements were significant for Beef (15. 8 % CI 7. 0 – 24. 7 %) and Whey (5. 8 %, CI, 1. 7 – 9. 8 %) but not for carbohydrate (11. 4 %, CI, - 0. 9 - 23. 6 %). Protein-carbohydrate supplementation supports fat-free mass accretion and lower body hypertrophy.

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} effects of aerobic {{training}} (AT) with aerobic plus resistance training (AT+RT) in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) obese adolescents. Design Long-term interdisciplinary weight-loss therapy (1 year of clinical, nutritional, psychological, and exercise-related intervention). Participants Fifty-eight postpubertal obese adolescents were randomized to AT or AT+RT according to NAFLD diagnosis. Adipokine and neuropeptide concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, visceral fat by ultrasound, and <b>body</b> composition by <b>plethysmography.</b> Results the NAFLD group that followed the AT+RT protocol presented lower insulin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and alanine transaminase (ALT) values after intervention compared with AT. It was verified {{that there was a}} higher magnitude of change in the subcutaneous fat, glycemia, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, ALT, and adiponectin in response to AT+RT than in the control group (AT). All patients who underwent the AT+RT exhibited significantly higher adiponectin, leptin, and Delta adiponectin and lower melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) concentrations after therapy compared with the AT group. in the simple linear regression analysis, changes in glycemia, insulin, and HOMA-IR were independent predictors of significant improvement in adiponectin concentration. Indeed, Delta AST (aspartate transaminase) and Delta GGT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase) were independent predictors of Delta ALT, while Delta fat mass and Delta AgRP (agouti-related protein) were independent predictors of Delta MCH. Although the number of patients was limited, we showed {{for the first time the}} positive effects of AT+RT protocol in a long-term interdisciplinary therapy to improve inflammatory biomarkers and to reduce orexigenic neuropeptide concentrations in NAFLD obese adolescents. Conclusion the long-term interdisciplinary therapy with AT+RT protocol was more effective in significantly improving noninvasive biomarkers of NAFLD that are associated with the highest risk of disease progression in the pediatric population.

40|$|Physiological {{changes during}} late phase nasal {{responses}} after allergen challenge {{are difficult to}} establish and different criteria are used for {{the definition of a}} positive late phase nasal reaction. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the value of whole <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> in detecting changes in nasal airway resistance after allergen challenge and to suggest criteria for the definition of early and late phase nasal reactions. Nasal challenge with allergen was performed in 15 allergic patients, Nasal resistance was followed until 10 h after allergen challenge and on a control day using whole <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> The mean percentage changes in the inspiratory nasal resistance during the early phase period (0. 25 - 2 h) and the late phase period (4 - 10 h) were significantly higher on the allergen challenge day than on the control day (p= 0. 001 and p= 0. 01, respectively). The mean percentage change in the inspiratory nasal resistance during the early and late phase period on the control day plus 2 times the standard deviation served as cut-off point for a positive reaction, Using this definition, all patients had early reactions and 7 of the 15 patients (47 %) also had late reactions. We conclude that whole <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> is a useful, noninvasive method for the measurement of the physiological changes in the nose following allergen challenge...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{two most}} {{commonly}} used methods for the measurement of lung volumes are helium dilution and <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> Two methods have been developed which are both easier and less time consuming to perform. Mathematical modelling uses complex calculations from the flow-volume loop to derive total lung capacity (TLC), and the nitrogen balance technique uses nitrogen from the atmosphere to calculate lung volume {{in a similar way}} to helium dilution. This study was designed to compare the two new methods with the two standard methods.  METHODS—Sixty one subjects were studied, 23 with normal lung function, 17 with restrictive airway disease, and 21 with obstructive ventilatory defects. Each subject underwent repeated measurements of TLC by each of the four methods in random order. Reproducible values were obtained for each method according to BTS/ARTP guidelines. Bland-Altman plots were constructed for comparisons between the methods and paired t tests were used to assess differences in means.  RESULTS—Bland-Altman plots showed that the differences between <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> and helium dilution fell into clinically acceptable ranges (agreement limits ± 0. 9 l). The agreement between mathematical modelling or the nitrogen balance technique and helium dilution or <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> was poor (± 1. 8 - 3. 4 l), especially for subjects with airflow obstruction.  CONCLUSIONS—Neither of the new methods agrees sufficiently with standard methods to be useful in a clinical setting. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{inspired}} sinewave {{technique is}} a noninvasive method to measure airway dead space, functional residual capacity, pulmonary blood flow, and lung inhomogeneity simultaneously. The {{purpose of this}} study was to assess the repeatability and accuracy of the current device prototype in measuring functional residual capacity, and also participant comfort when using such the device. To assess within-session repeatability, six sinewave measurements were taken over 2 -hour period in 17 healthy volunteers. To assess day-to-day repeatability, measurements were taken over 16 days in 3 volunteers. To assess accuracy, sinewave measurements were compared to <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> in 44 healthy volunteers. Finally, 18 volunteers who experienced the inspired sinewave device, <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> and spirometry were asked to rate the comfort of each technique on a scale of 1 - 10. The repeatability coefficients for dead space, functional residual capacity, and blood flow were 48. 7 ml, 0. 48 L, and 2. 4 L/min respectively. Bland-Altman analyses showed a mean BIAS(SD) of - 0. 68 (0. 42) L for functional residual capacity when compared with <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> 14 out of 18 volunteers rated the inspired sinewave device as their preferred technique. The repeatability and accuracy of functional residual capacity measurements were found to be as good as other techniques in the literature. The high level of comfort and the non-requirement of patient effort meant that, if further refined, the inspired sinewave technique could be an attractive solution for difficult patient groups such as very young children, elderly, and ventilated patients...|$|E

40|$|Background: Pulmonary {{function}} {{tests are}} valuable measures for diagnosis {{and management of}} respiratory diseases. In the field of occupational medicine, spirometry is commonly performed, and in {{a considerable number of}} spirometries during occupational health evaluations, restrictive pattern is observed without any respiratory symptoms and may necessitate referral of the subject for <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography,</b> which is an expensive test. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of spirometry for detection of restrictive lung pattern in an occupational setting. Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study from 2008 to 2012, 1224 subjects were selected and entered in the study out of 1, 486 individuals referred for annual spirometry. Selected subjects underwent spirometry and <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography.</b> Subjects were divided into two groups of restrictive and non-restrictive patterns and then sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of spirometry for detection of restrictive lung pattern were calculated using total lung capacity measured b...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. <b>Body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> is a lung {{function}} testing method usually applied for determination of thoracic gas volume and airways resistance, but option to measure work of breathing is available in most models. Although the method has been known over fifty years, assessment of work of breathing with {{it has not yet}} systematically studied in obesity. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the relevance of work of breathing measured by <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> in obese subjects and to compare the results with those of healthy controls and patients with pulmonary diseases of different pulmonary mechanics. Methods. Altogether sixty-two adults were studied prospectively: healthy non-smoking obese subjects (BMI > 30, N= 15), patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) (N= 15), emphysematic COPD (emphysema) (N= 16) and healthy non-smoking controls (controls) (N= 16). Inspiratory, expiratory and total work of breathing (WOBin, WOBex and WOB) and specific work of breathing (sWOBin, sWOBex and sWOB) were measured. Results. In obese subjects, WOB, WOBin (p< 0. 001) and WOBex (p= 0. 002) were elevated in comparison to controls. Also in ILD, WOB was significantly higher than in controls (p< 0. 006). sWOBin, sWOBex and SWOB were significantly higher in emphysema than in the controls (p< 0. 001). Conclusions. In obesity and ILD WOB whereas in emphysematic COPD sWOB differed significantly from controls, which is caused by differences in lung mechanics and lung volumes. The results concerning COPD correspond earlier study, but the present results suggest that <b>body</b> <b>plethysmography</b> is suitable for the assessment of work of breathing also in obesity...|$|E
