40|$|FengYun- 3 B (FY- 3 <b>B)</b> <b>soil</b> {{moisture}} product, {{retrieved from}} passive microwave brightness temperature data {{based on the}} Qp model, has rarely been applied at the catchment and region scale. One {{of the reasons for}} this is its coarse spatial resolution (25 -km). The study in this paper presented a new method to obtain a high spatial resolution soil moisture product by downscaling FY- 3 <b>B</b> <b>soil</b> moisture product from 25 -km to 1 -km spatial resolution  using the theory of Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) under bare surface or sparse vegetation covered land surface. The relationship between soil moisture and ATI was first constructed, and the coefficients were obtained directly from 25 -km FY- 3 <b>B</b> <b>soil</b> moisture product and ATI derived from MODIS data, which is different from previous studies often assuming the same set of coefficients applicable at different spatial resolutions. The method was applied to Naqu area on the Tibetan Plateau to obtain the downscaled 1 -km resolution soil moisture product, the latter was validated using ground measurements collected from Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau (TP-STMNS) in 2012. The downscaled soil moisture showed promising results with a coefficient of determination R 2 higher than 0. 45 and a root mean-square error (RMSE) less than 0. 11 m 3 /m 3 when comparing with the ground measurements at 5 sites out of the 9 selected sites. It was found that the accuracy of downscaled soil moisture was largely influenced by the accuracy of the FY- 3 <b>B</b> <b>soil</b> moisture product. The proposed method could be applied for both bare soil surface and sparsely vegetated surface...|$|E
40|$|Boron (B) {{is removed}} from soils when crop {{products}} are harvested. However, B has never {{been used as a}} fertiliser in broadacre agriculture in WA. A GRDC-funded project was started in 1998 to consider the sustainability of this mining of <b>soil</b> <b>B.</b> The project aims are to (1) map the spatial distribution of B deficiency in canola and lupin; (2) investigate the role of <b>B</b> in <b>soil</b> and plants for grain yield of canola and lupin, and; (3) develop management options for B to take account of soil properties and crop requirements. The present paper reports preliminary results that begin to define the extent of low <b>B</b> <b>soils</b> in the W A wheatbelt and its likely implications for crop production. Young leaves of canola and lupin crops were sampled at 136 sites in the wheatbelt during vegetative growth in 1998. Potentially B deficient crops representing 10 - 20 % of sites were widely distributed throughout the wheatbelt. In 73 Reference Soils of south-west Australia, extractable <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> was positively correlated with soil pH and clay content. A preliminary study of the response of farmers' canola crops to a B spray was conducted at 7 sites with sandy to sandy loam texture in the Great Southern Region of WA in 1998. For all sites, a mean increase of 14 % in seed yield was found from the B spray application at flowering. Preliminary pot trial results suggest that responses to B in canola and lupins will occur on a number of low <b>B</b> <b>soils.</b> Our results tend to confirm that the risk of B deficiency warrants further consideration. The key questions now are: where is it most likely to occur, under what crops is it most likely, what seasonal factors bring on B deficiency and what are the management options for dealing with the problem...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the boron (B) status of apple orchards and examine the relations among B nutrition and some soil properties in Isparta province. For this purpose 250 gardens from the seven districts of the region were determined and soil and leaf samples were collected. In order to determine <b>soil</b> and leaf <b>B</b> status and relations among these some soil properties were determined. Similarly, other leaf nutrient concentrations were analyzed. According to the soil analysis it was seen that most of the soils are B-sufficient. If <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> concentrations were evaluated depending on the district, the lowest <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> (0. 26 mg kg - 1) was measured from the gardens of Senirkent, the highest B concentration (3. 44 mg kg - 1) was determined in Atabey. Looking at the individual districts, all apple orchards in Gönen and Keçiborlu have sufficient (0. 5 - 2 mg kg - 1) <b>soil</b> <b>B.</b> Also in Yalvaç, Atabey, Gelendost and Eğirdir 71 %, 95 %, 96 % and 97 % of the <b>soils</b> had higher <b>B</b> concentration than B deficiency level (0. 5 mg kg - 1). The most <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> deficiency problem was observed in Senirkent and Yalvaç. Average <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> levels for Atabey, Eğirdir, Gelendost, Gönen, Keçiborlu, Senirkent and Yalvaç orchards were calculated as 1. 32, 0. 96, 0. 87, 0. 67, 0. 91, 0. 49 and 0. 62, mg kg - 1 respectively and general average were determined as 0. 84 mg kg - 1. Depending on leaf analyze results, it was seen that 94. 8 % of the trees had sufficient B and only 5. 2 percent of trees had B deficiency. According to the results, there is not B deficiency in 85 % of the soils. And this reflects the leaf analysis as well. Although this result, there was not seen any correlation between <b>soil</b> and leaf <b>B</b> concentrations. But, there were negative correlations among available <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> and <b>soil</b> pH and Ca.

40|$|To {{test the}} {{potential}} effects of extracellular electron shuttles (EES) on the rate {{and extent of}} heavy metal release from contaminated soils during microbial iron reduction, we created anaerobic batch systems with anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS) as a surrogate of EES, and with contaminated soils as mixed iron (hydr) oxides and microbial sources. Two types of soils were tested: Zn-contaminated soil A and As/Pb-contaminated <b>soil</b> <b>B.</b> In <b>soil</b> A, the rate of iron reduction was fastest {{in the presence of}} AQDS and> 3500 mg/L of total Fe(II) was produced within 2 d. This suggests that indigenous microorganisms can utilize AQDS as EES to stimulate iron reduction. In the incubations with <b>soil</b> <b>B,</b> the rate and extent of iron reduction did not increase in the presence of AQDS likely because of the low pH (< 5. 5). In addition, less than 2000 mg/L of total Fe(II) was produced in <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> within 52 d suggesting that iron reduction by subsurface microorganisms in <b>soil</b> <b>B</b> was not as effective as that in soil A. Relatively high amount of As (~ 500 mg/L) was released to the aqueous phase during microbial iron reduction in <b>soil</b> <b>B.</b> The release of As might be due to the reduction of As-associated iron (hydr) oxides and/or direct enzymatic reduction of As(V) to As(III) by As-reducing microorganisms. However, given that Pb in liquid phase was < 0. 3 mg/L for the entire experiment, the microbial reduction As(V) to As(III) by As-reducing microorganisms has most likely occurred in this system. This study suggests that heavy metal release from contaminated soils can be strongly controlled by subsurface microorganisms, soil pH, presence of EES, and/or nature of heavy metals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract––In {{selected}} part of clayey soil {{region of}} Malwa (M. P.),where Black cotton (<b>B.</b> C.) <b>soil</b> is available up {{to a large}} extent of depth, normally footing rest on <b>B.</b> C. <b>soil</b> strata having low bearing capacity or on naturally compacted yellow soil strata having considerable bearing capacity. Environmental changes have great impact on the behavior and strength parameter of the clayey <b>soil</b> like <b>B.</b> C. <b>soil</b> or Yellow soil. Skirted footing in which vertical walls surrounds sides of the soil mass beneath the footing is one of the recognized bearing capacity improvement technique. Construction of vertical skirts {{at the base of the}} footing, confining the underlying soil, generates a soil resistance on skirt sides that helps the footing to resist sliding. Bi-angle shaped skirt in which vertical walls surrounds two adjacent sides of the footing is a special case of skirted footing. A model study has been performed to investigate the behavior of Bi-angle shape skirted footing resting on <b>B.</b> C. <b>soil</b> and Yellow soil, subjected to two way eccentric load resulting in Bi-axial bending of the footing. The study helps in evaluating performance of skirted footing. The difference between the settlement of near end and far end is known as tilt of diagonally opposite corners of the footing. The tilt of diagonally opposite corners of the footing is affected considerably due to presence of skirts. Skirts have been found to be helpful in reducing tilt due to eccentric loading.

40|$|Eucalypts are {{increasingly}} {{important in the}} tropics for meeting growing demand for timber, wood chips, paper pulp and biofuel. Many new plantations are planted on low boron (<b>B)</b> <b>soils,</b> with adverse effects on plant growth and productivity. Two experiments in sand culture with different levels of added B, from 0 to 10 μM B, examined the effect of B deficiency on growth, wood yield and morphology of fibres of three commercially available eucalypt clones: K 7 (Eucalyptus camaldulensis × E. deglupta), K 51 (E. brassiana × E. grandis) and K 57 (E. camaldulensis). In plant height, dry weight and wood production, K 7 was more tolerant of B deficiency, but K 57 and K 51 were more responsive to increasing B. At the level of B that depressed growth by up to 54 % and wood yield by up to 65 %, no significant effect of B deficiency was observed on fibre morphology. However, as the wood:shoot ratio in K 51 and K 57 increased with increasing B, {{there is a possibility}} that B has a direct effect on wood production in some genotypes, in addition to an indirect effect via better growth. These results indicate that attention to B nutrition in eucalypt plantations would be beneficial to plant growth and productivity before effects of B on individual wood fibres becomes detectable.

40|$|Temporary B {{deficiency}} can {{be triggered}} by liming of acid soils because of increased B adsorption at higher soil pH. Plants respond directly to the activity of <b>B</b> in <b>soil</b> solution and only indirectly to <b>B</b> adsorbed on <b>soil</b> constituents. Because the range between deficient and toxic B concentration is relatively narrow, this poses difficulty in maintaining appropriate <b>B</b> levels in <b>soil</b> solution. Thus, knowledge of the chemical behavior of <b>B</b> in the <b>soil</b> is particularly important. The present study investigated the effect of <b>soil</b> pH on <b>B</b> adsorption in four soils of Parana State, and to correlate these values with the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the soils. Surface samples were taken from a Rhodic Hapludox, Arenic Hapludalf, Arenic Hapludult, and one Typic Usthorthent. To evaluate the effect of pH on <b>B</b> adsorption, subsamples <b>soil</b> received the application of increasing rates of calcium carbonate. Boron adsorption was accomplished by shaking 2. 0 g soil, for 24 h, with 20 mL of 0. 01 mol L- 1 NaCl solution containing different concentrations (0. 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 0, and 4. 0 mg B L- 1). Sorption was fitted to non-linear form of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Boron adsorption increased as concentration increased. Boron adsorption was dependent on soil pH, increasing as a function of pH in the range between 4. 6 and 7. 4, although the bonding energy has decreased. Maximum adsorption capacity (MAC) of B was observed in the Arenic Hapludalf (49. 8 mg <b>B</b> kg(- 1) <b>soil)</b> followed by Arenic Hapludult (22. 5 mg kg(- 1)), Rhodic Hapludox (17. 4 mg kg(- 1)), and Typic Usthorthent (7. 0 mg kg(- 1)).

There was no significant change in the sand, silt and clay fractions after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The parameters included soil pH, which remained within moderately alkaline region after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The SAR of A and <b>B</b> <b>soils</b> changed from 3. 27 - 2. 95 and 3. 67 - 2. 15, respectively after 200 days of irrigation. But, the decrease in SAR was less in the same soil when irrigated with TDW continuously for 458 days compared to 200 days due to salt leaching to lower soil depths. The concentration of cations (Na +, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) showed significant (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 032) increase after 200 days followed by a significant (p< 0. 001, p< 0. 008) decrease after 458 days of TDW irrigation. The concentrations of Na + in A and <b>B</b> <b>soils</b> decreased with the soil depth except soil C which showed the highest concentration of K as 13. 9 meq L - 1 than the control sample as 3. 2 meq L - 1 after 200 days of irrigation and at 150 cm soil depth. The K + concentration increased from 0. 2 to 0. 5 meq L - 1 and 0. 2 - 0. 8 meq L - 1 in A and <b>B</b> <b>soils,</b> respectively. However, at 458 days of irrigation, the K + concentration dropped below, 0. 2 meq L - 1 in both samples. The electrical conductivity (EC), sodium absorption ratios (SAR), cations (Na+, K +, Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +) and anions (CO 3 2 ¯, HCO 3 ¯, Cl¯, SO 4 2 ¯) showed similar patterns. But the values of these cations/anions increased after 200 days of irrigation which again dropped below the initial values of soils. The average number of bacteria in <b>soil</b> A, <b>B</b> and C after 200 days and 458 days of TDW irrigation were 99 and 393 cells, 149 and 333 cells and 56 and 559 cells, respectively. In addition to the above, the microbial analysis indicated that E. coli was absent in all the soils irrigated with TDW. The research findings suggest that although the TDW irrigation did not mainly affect the physical and chemical properties of soil under investigation, but is likely to contaminate the groundwater on long term basis in Riyadh region...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{susceptibility}} of soils {{has been}} used as a proxy for rainfall, but other factors can contribute to magnetic enhancement in soils. Here we explore influence of century- to millennial-scale duration of soil formation on periglacial and alluvial soil magnetic properties by assessing three terraces with surface and buried soils ranging in exposure ages from < 0. 01 to ~ 16 kyrs along the Delaware River in northeastern USA. The A and <b>B</b> <b>soil</b> horizons have higher Xlf, Ms, and S-ratios compared to parent material, and these values increase in a non-linear fashion with increasing duration of soil formation. Magnetic remanence measurements show a mixed low- and high-coercivity mineral assemblage likely consisting of goethite, hematite and maghemite that contributes to the magnetic enhancement of the soil. Room-temperature and low-temperature field-cooled and zero field-cooled remanence curves confirm the presence of goethite and magnetite and show an increase in magnetization with increasing soil age. These data suggest that as the Delaware alluvial soils weather, the concentration of secondary ferrimagnetic minerals increase in the A and <b>B</b> <b>soil</b> horizons. We then compared the time-dependent Xlf from several age-constrained buried alluvial soils with known climate data for the region during the Quaternary. Contradictory to most studies that suggest a link between increases in magnetic susceptibility and high moisture, increased magnetic enhancement of Delaware alluvial soils coincides with dry climate intervals. Early Holocene enhanced soil Xlf (9. 5 – 8. 5 ka) corresponds with a well-documented cool-dry climate episode. This relationship is probably related to less frequent flooding during dry intervals allowing more time for low-coercive pedogenic magnetic minerals to form and accumulate, which resulted in increased Xlf. Middle Holocene enhanced Xlf (6. 1 – 4. 3 ka) corresponds with a transitional wet/dry phase and a previously documented incision event [...] ...|$|E
30|$|In contrast, {{only about}} 8 % of the {{respondents}} in Gudo Beret Kebele noted the negative impacts of Eucalyptus woodlot which are attributed to its effects on reduction in crop production and water use due to competition especially when grown on farmlands (Negasa et al. 2017 <b>b),</b> <b>soil</b> acidification (Liang et al. 2016), nutrient depletion (Negasa et al. 2017 a), allelopathic effect (Basu and Kandasamy 1997; Hailu et al. 2003), and reduction in growth potential of grass when Eucalyptus is planted near farmlands, grasslands and/or indigenous trees (Hailu et al. 2003; Saint-André et al. 2008; Negasa et al. 2017 b).

40|$|The {{period of}} {{industrialization}} {{after the second}} World War in Europe released SO 2 and NOx by combustion of fossil fuels and contributed the formation of S and N compounds in the forest ecosystem. The Swedish forest soil systems were influenced by emissions of SO 2 followed by H 2 SO 4 deposition, consequently the pool of SO 42 - had increased in the forest ecosystem. This thesis studied SO 42 - adsorption in a podzolic <b>Bs</b> horizon <b>soils</b> taken from a Swedish forest soil system. The soil samples from five different sampling sites were collected and the results revealed different amounts of adsorbed SO 42 - in response to changes in equilibrium concentration and pH. This {{study found that the}} amount of adsorbed SO 42 - (mmol/kg) increased with an added equilibrium concentration of SO 42 - (mmol/l) and with a decreasing pH. This was determined by equilibration experiments. Based on the results a Freundlich-based model was developed to predict the pool of adsorbed SO 42 - in the soil samples. The model predicted the pool of adsorbed SO 42 - (mmol/kg) as a function of pH and the equilibrium concentration of SO 42 - (mmol/l) in the soil solution system. The extended Freundlich model was optimized in three different ways: by use of unconstrained, constrained and simplified two-point calibration. The results showed that the adsorption of sulfate in the Kloten Bs 1 and Risbergshöjden <b>B</b> <b>soils</b> was higher as compared to the Tärnsjo B, Österström B, and Risfallet <b>B</b> <b>soils.</b> The coefficient of determination (R 2) determined from an unconstrained fit of the extended Freundlich model (with three adjustable parameters) for Risbergshöjden B and Kloten Bs 1 were R 2 = 0. 998 and R 2 = 0. 993. Nearly as good fits were found in a constrained fit with two adjustable parameters when it was assumed that nearly 2 protons (2 H+) are co-adsorbed with one SO 42 - ion (Risbergshöjden B; R 2 = 0. 997 and Kloten Bs; R 2 = 0. 992). The simplified two-point calibration with two adjustable parameters showed similar parameter values for all most soils and was considered the best optimization method of extended Freundlich model, especially as it requires only limited input data...|$|R
