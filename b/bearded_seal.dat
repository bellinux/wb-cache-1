5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and endothermic ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the <b>bearded</b> <b>seal</b> and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or endothermic prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
25|$|Mukluks or Eskimo {{boots are}} soft knee-high boot {{traditionally}} made of seal (mostly <b>bearded</b> <b>seal)</b> or caribou skin. Alaskan Eskimo mukluks are traditionally made with <b>bearded</b> <b>seal</b> skin soles and leg uppers of caribou trimmed with fur, but Alaskan Athabaskan mukluks are traditionally made of moose hide and trimmed with fur and beadwork. There were various mukluk types of footwear used by Yup'ik Eskimos, including kamguk, kameksak, piluguk, and others. The word mukluk which {{is derived from}} the Yup'ik word maklak meaning <b>bearded</b> <b>seal,</b> because <b>bearded</b> <b>seal</b> skin is used for the soles of skin boots.

40|$|To {{determine}} if <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> (Erignathus barbatus) harvested near a zinc and lead mine (Red Dog, Alaska, USA) by subsistence hunters from Kivalina, Alaska, were as safe to eat as <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> from other locations in Alaska, we compared 19 trace element concentrations in liver tissue. Liver concentrations from nine <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> harvested near the Red Dog Mine (RDM) port site {{were compared with}} 15 <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> from two reference sites (Hooper Bay and Little Diomede, Alaska, USA). Concentrations did not differ by gender, but we found statistically significant trends in concentrations of cadmium, mercury, manganese, selenium, and vanadium with age. Arsenic and copper were the only elements {{found to be more}} concentrated in the liver of <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> harvested near RDM than in the other locations. The predominant form of arsenic in marine mammals is known to be a nontoxic organic form, not the toxic inorganic form, and copper is an essential element. Although elevated near RDM, neither element was found at concentrations that presented health risks. We found no evidence that <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> harvested near RDM were less safe to eat or that trace element concentrations were greater than those found in <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> harvested elsewhere in Alaska or Canada...|$|R

These animals had been entangled in gill nets for lumpsuckers (Cyclopterus lumpus) and cod (Gadus morhua), shot by local hunters, or found dead on the shore. The majority of the animals were from the north coast of Iceland, during the spring and summer. The majority of the hooded seals, were pups and one-year-olds, although older ani-mals occurred frequently. Males were significantly more abundant in the catch than fe-males. Young seals, pups and one-year-olds, dominated in the catch of harp seals. Males were not significantly more abundant than females. During the period 1989 – 94, there {{seemed to have been}} an increase in the frequency of visits of hooded and harp seals to Icelandic waters, and they seemed to be more numerous off the north coast than about a decade ago. However, they are probably not as numerous now as in earlier times, especially in years of heavy land-ice and polar-ice in the 18 th and 19 th century. Ringed seals were mainly caught during the spring and early summer, while most of the <b>bearded</b> <b>seals</b> were caught in winter.

25|$|Seal: Depending on the season, Inuit {{hunt for}} {{different}} types of seal: harp seal, harbour seal, and <b>bearded</b> <b>seal.</b> Ringed seals are hunted all year, while harp seals are only available during the summer. Because seals need {{to break through the}} ice to reach air, they form breathing holes with their teeth and claws. Through these, Inuit hunters are able to capture seals. When a hunter arrives at these holes, they set up a seal indicator that alerts the hunter when a seal is coming up for a breath of air. When the seal comes up, the hunter notices movement in the indicator and uses his harpoon to capture the seal in the water.|$|E

25|$|Skin or Hide (amiq sg amiik dual amiit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, amir in Cup'ig). Traditionally, {{clothing}} {{may be made}} of {{a variety}} of skins, including <b>bearded</b> <b>seal</b> skin (maklaarem amia), hair-seal skin (nayiim amia), two-year-old spotted sea skin (useqniim amia), walrus skin (asverem amia), caribou skin (tuntum amia), calfskin (kuluviim amia), bearskin (carayiim amia), wolfskin (keglunrem amia), wolverine skin (terikaniam amia), oldsquaw duck skin (allgiaraam amia), swan skin (qugyuum amia) fish skins (neqet amiit), and others. Traditionally, virtually all parkas worn by the Nunivaarmiut were made from the skins of seals, caribou, or birds; the skins of reindeer have been used in more recent times. Mink and fox skins were also utilized in the past, the latter occasionally for the ruff since it was too thin to be durable enough for men's parkas. Mainland furs that have been used in recent times but not in the past include ground squirrels received from the people of Nelson Island who, in turn, obtained them from the Kuskokwim River, and wolverine used primarily for trim. Muskrat skins (single layer) and Arctic ground squirrel (double layer) were used for winter parkas because these furs are light in weight but very warm. However, caribou (or its domesticated cousin, the reindeer, introduced to Alaska in the 1890s) is also quite warm and also more durable, making it perhaps the most desired material for winter clothing. Historically, ground squirrel, muskrat, and caribou were commonly used for clothing.|$|E

500|$|Adult male {{pinnipeds}} {{have several}} strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariids establish territories containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural {{breaks in the}} substrate, and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the Steller sea lion and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory {{for as long as}} 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and <b>bearded</b> <b>seal,</b> the males have underwater territories called [...] "maritories" [...] near female haul-out areas. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the ice.|$|E
