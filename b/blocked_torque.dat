40|$|Highly twisted {{oriented}} polymer fibres {{and carbon}} nanotube yarns show large scale torsional actuation from volume expansion {{that can be}} induced, for example, thermally or by electrochemical charging. When formed into spring-like coils, the torsional actuation within the fibre or yarn generates powerful tensile actuation per muscle weight. For further development of these coil actuators and for the practical application of torsional actuators, {{it is important to}} standardise methods for characterising both the torsional stroke (rotation) and torque generated. By analogy with tensile actuators, we here introduce a method to measure both the free stroke and <b>blocked</b> <b>torque</b> in a one-end-tethered fibre. In addition, the torsional actuation can be measured when operating against an externally applied torque (isotonic) and actuation against a return spring fibre (variable torque). A theoretical treatment of torsional actuation was formulated using torsion mechanics and evaluated using a commercially available highly-oriented polyamide fibre. Good agreement between experimental measurements and calculated values was obtained. The analysis allows the prediction of torsional stroke under any external loading condition based on the fundamental characteristics of the actuator: free stroke and stiffness...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in ultrasonic motor design {{have demonstrated that}} small size tube-shaped motors could be fabricated at low cost. Motors with diameters between 15 and 2. 5 mm have been fabricated and tested. The performance evaluation of these motors is still in progress, but have already shown promising results: the smallest ones exhibit no-load speeds {{in the range of}} 70 rad/s and <b>blocked</b> <b>torques</b> close to 0. 9 mN·m. In this paper, we review the operating principle of these devices and several implementation examples. Then, we show how the finite element method (ATILA) can be used, in combination with genetic optimization procedures, to design tube-shaped motors in various dimensions and for different performance objectives. Several design examples are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{symptoms}} and eventual resolution of a torque increase problem occurring with ball bearings in the joints of the AX- 5 space suit are described. Starting torques that rose 5 to 10 times initial levels {{were observed in}} crew evaluation tests of the suit in a zero-g water tank. This bearing problem {{was identified as a}} <b>blocking</b> <b>torque</b> anomaly, observed previously in oscillatory gimbal bearings. A large matrix of lubricants, ball separator designs and materials were evaluated. None of these combinations showed sufficient tolerance to lubricant washout when repeatedly cycled in water. The problem was resolved by retrofitting a pressure compensated, water exclusion seal to the outboard side of the bearing cavity. The {{symptoms and}} possible remedies to blocking are discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out into the twist blockage which may occur when yarns pass over guides or other surfaces. The influence of primary physical parameters such as surface curvature, are and length of contact, yarn twist level and tension and yarn/surface friction have been investigated together with secondary parameters such as yarn surface, pressure, angle of approach etc. As a result of these investigations, three mechanisms of blockage have been identified. The first of these occurs especially with doubled yarn in which the components lie {{side by side on the}} guide surface and blocked twist builds up until sufficient torque is developed to turn the yarn over against the couple generated by the components of yarn tension and reaction on the guide surface. In the second mechanism <b>blocking</b> <b>torque</b> is generated by components of friction on the yarn surface at right angles to the yarn axis. These orthogonal friction components may arise from interaction between the topography of the twisted yarn surface and the guide surface or may be generated by forces arising from an angular orientation of yarn to guide. The third mechanism is intermediate between the other two where a singles yarn (or its equivalent) is flattened on the surface and resistance to twist transmission is generated partly by internal friction within the yarn and partly by yarn/guide frictional forces. The main circumstances under which these different mechanisms may operate, have been identified and suggestions made for minimising the blockage of twist...|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-channel}} computer-based clinical {{instrument was}} developed to simultaneously acquire, process, display, quantify and correlate electromyographic (EMG) activity, resistive torque, range of motion (ROM), and pain levels in the upper limbs of humans. Each channel consisted of a time and frequency domain <b>block,</b> a <b>torque</b> and angle measurement block, an experiment number counter block and a data storage and retrieval block. The study showed that there was increased level of EMG activity prior to pain onset (P< 0. 05). There was also clear evidence that elevated perception of pain and elevated levels of resistive torque (P< 0. 05) were positively correlated with the EMG activity in the muscles responsible for antalgic posture of the upper limb (P< 0. 05) ...|$|R
50|$|A blocked rotor test is {{conducted}} on an induction motor. It {{is also known}} as short circuit test, locked rotor test or stalled torque test. From this test, short circuit current at normal voltage, power factor on short circuit, total leakage reactance, and starting torque of the motor can be found. The test {{is conducted}} at low voltage because if the applied voltage was normal voltage then the current through the stator windings would be high enough to overheat the windings and damage them. The <b>blocked</b> rotor <b>torque</b> test is not performed on wound-rotor motors because the starting torque can be varied as desired. However, a blocked rotor current test is conducted on squirrel cage rotor motors.|$|R

However, the shipment is actually a bomb that destroys the gang's limousine. Expecting to get away, Nina stops when she sees John <b>Torque</b> <b>blocking</b> the road. Having stashed her {{in the trunk of}} his car, Torque goes to the nearest jail to collect his bounty. He changes his mind and they go to an island paradise, with Convoy and Houston joining them.|$|R
40|$|The {{radioactive}} waste stored in underground storage tanks at Hanford site includes mixtures of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite with organic compounds. The waste can produce undesired violent exothermic reactions when heated locally during the rotary-mode sampling. Experiments are performed varying the downward force at a maximum rotational speed of 55 rpm and minimum nitrogen purge flow of 30 scfm. The rotary drill bit teeth-face temperatures are measured. The waste is simulated {{with a low}} thermal conductivity hard material, pumice <b>blocks.</b> A <b>torque</b> meter is {{used to determine the}} energy provided to the drill string. The exhaust air-chip temperature as well as drill string and drill bit temperatures and other key operating parameters were recorded. A two-dimensional thermal model is developed. The safe operating conditions were determined for normal operating conditions. A downward force of 750 at 55 rpm and 30 scfm nitrogen purge flow was found to yield acceptable substrate temperatures. The model predicted experimental results reasonably well. Therefore, it could be used to simulate abnormal conditions to develop procedures for safe operations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} dynamic {{stability}} {{analysis of a}} single machine infinite bus system through torque angle loop analysis and forms {{an extension of the}} work on <b>Block</b> diagrams and <b>torque</b> angle loop analysis of synchronous machines reported by I. Nagy [3]. It aims to incorporate in the machine model, the damper windings (one on each axis) and to compare the dynamic behaviour of the system with and without damper windings. The effect of using different stabilizing signals (viz. active power and speed deviations) on the dynamic performance is analysed and the significant effect of damper windings on the dynamic behaviour of the system is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|The geomedium block concept envisages that {{stresses}} in {{the medium}} composed of rotating <b>blocks</b> have <b>torque</b> and thus predetermine the medium's energy capacity (in terms of [Ponomarev, 2008]). The present paper describes the wave nature of the global geodynamic process taking place {{in the medium}} characterized by the existence of slow and fast rotation strain waves that are classified as a new type of waves. Movements may also occur as rheid, superplastic and/or superfluid motions and facilitate the formation of vortex geological structures in the geomedium. Our analysis of data on almost 800 strong volcanic eruptions shows that the magma chamber’s thickness is generally small, about 0. 5 km, and this value is constant, independent of the volcanic process and predetermined by properties of the crust. A new magma chamber model is based on the idea of 'thermal explosion’/‘self-acceleration' manifested by intensive plastic movements along boundaries between the blocks in conditions of the low thermal conductivity of the geomedium. It is shown that if the solid rock in the magma chamber is overheated above its melting point, high stresses may occur in the surrounding area, and their elastic energy may amount to 1015 joules per 1 km 3 of the overheated solid rock. In view of such stresses, it is possible to consider the interaction between volcano’s magma chambers as the migration of volcanic activity along the volcanic arc and provide an explanation of the interaction between volcanic activity and seismicity within the adjacent parallel arcs. The thin overheated interlayer/magma chamber concept may be valid for the entire Earth's crust. In our hypothesis, properties of the Moho are determined by the phase transition from the block structure of the crust to the nonblock structure of the upper mantle. </p...|$|R
