5|$|Costa {{was born}} in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide. His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not <b>believe</b> <b>as</b> a child that he would turn professional, {{in part due to}} the remote location of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa is a fan of Palmeiras.|$|E
5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} {{on the evolution}} of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and religious liberty. The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to <b>believe,</b> <b>as</b> he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E

25|$|By {{contrast}} with these views, some recent scholars, travelers and armchair travelers {{have tried to}} map Odysseus's travels. Modern opinions are so varied in detail that for convenience {{they need to be}} classified, as do the ancient ones. This article deals first with those who <b>believe,</b> <b>as</b> did many ancient authors, that the hero of the Odyssey was driven west or south-west from Cape Malea and, more than nine years later, returned from the west to his native Ionian islands: his landfalls are therefore {{to be found in the}} western Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1891 Schiller had {{independently}} reached a doctrine {{very similar to}} William James' Will to <b>Believe.</b> <b>As</b> early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore examining their formal features instead of their function in an actual situation {{is to make the}} same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.|$|E

500|$|Falk's {{enduring}} legacy {{can best}} be described as the NBA's new star-centered focus. [...] Falk's idea was that since most people bought Chicago Bulls tickets to see Michael Jordan, Jordan himself should get {{a large proportion of the}} benefit."Basketball is a hybrid between an individual and team sport", Falk is saying. [...] "Very gifted players almost make a team by themselves. In that environment, a Michael Jordan, Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard, Shaquille O'Neal and Patrick Ewing bring in the fans. Fans come to watch them play primarily. They create marketing opportunities, new stadiums, luxury boxes, and they should be paid a disproportionate amount of money. The salary structure should be close to what it is in Hollywood, where Jim Carrey makes $16 million a film and the second star makes $2 million. That's what I <b>believe</b> <b>as</b> an economics major and as a neo-capitalist." ...|$|E

Alasdair Stuart of Bleeding Cool commented it [...] "builds on this idea of the reflection that you know is fake but can't look away from and internalizes it". With the plot twist, Stuart said, [...] "we're shown exactly what's been a reflection of the truth all along; everything". He also affirmed it questions [...] "our own fundamental need to be the hero or heroine of our own story".|$|E

500|$|The X-Files was {{inspired}} by earlier television series which featured elements of suspense and speculative fiction, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside, and especially [...] When creating the main characters, Carter sought to reverse gender stereotypes by making Mulder a believer and Scully a skeptic. The first seven seasons featured Duchovny and Anderson equally. In the last two seasons, Anderson took precedence while Duchovny appeared intermittently. New main characters were introduced: FBI agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish). Mulder and Scully's boss, Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), also became a main character. The first five seasons of The X-Files were filmed and produced in Vancouver, British Columbia, before eventually moving to Los Angeles to accommodate Duchovny. The series later returned to Vancouver to film The X-Files: I Want to <b>Believe</b> <b>as</b> well as the tenth season of the series.|$|E
500|$|Fill the Void {{received}} generally positive reviews, garnering an 88% [...] "fresh" [...] rating based from 64 reviews on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes; {{the consensus}} states: [...] "Graceful, complex, and beautifully layered, Fill the Void offers a sympathetic portrait of an insulated culture by exploring universal themes." [...] Several critics compared the female characters to Jane Austen's novels. The Weekly Standard editor John Podhoretz opined, [...] "I don't know when I've {{ever seen a}} film as eerily perfect in tone and taste as Fill the Void...There isn't a moment when Burshtein goes wrong, goes melodramatic, goes didactic, goes false. Working as a woman of faith in a medium looked on with understandable suspicion and skepticism by those who <b>believe</b> <b>as</b> she does, Rama Burshtein has made {{a work of art}} of overwhelming beauty and impact." [...] The New York Post critic Farran Smith Nehme disagreed, writing, [...] "While the social milieu is nicely realized, other parts of the drama are not. Too often Burshtein cuts off a scene prematurely, darting away just as the crucial moment of emotion or confrontation appears." ...|$|E
500|$|Philosophers who {{consider}} subjective experience {{the essence of}} consciousness also generally <b>believe,</b> <b>as</b> a correlate, that the existence and nature of animal consciousness can never rigorously be known. Thomas Nagel spelled out {{this point of view}} in an influential essay titled What Is it Like to Be a Bat?. [...] He said that an organism is conscious [...] "if and only if there is something that {{it is like to be}} that organism — something it is like for the organism"; and he argued that no matter how much we know about an animal's brain and behavior, we can never really put ourselves into the mind of the animal and experience its world in the way it does itself. [...] Other thinkers, such as Douglas Hofstadter, dismiss this argument as incoherent. [...] Several psychologists and ethologists have argued for the existence of animal consciousness by describing a range of behaviors that appear to show animals holding beliefs about things they cannot directly perceive — Donald Griffin's 2001 book Animal Minds reviews a substantial portion of the evidence.|$|E

500|$|Betty, however {{difficult}} to <b>believe</b> <b>as</b> her character is established, shows an astonishing depth of dimension in her audition. Previously rehearsed with Rita in the apartment, where Rita feeds her lines woodenly, {{the scene is}} [...] "dreck" [...] and [...] "hollow; every line unworthy of a genuine actress's commitment", and Betty plays it in rehearsal as poorly as it is written. Nervous but plucky as ever at the audition, Betty enters the cramped room, but when pitted inches from her audition partner (Chad Everett), she turns it into a scene of powerful sexual tension that she fully controls and draws in {{every person in the}} room. The sexuality erodes immediately as the scene ends and she stands before them shyly waiting for their approval. One film analyst asserts that Betty's previously unknown ability steals the show, specifically, taking the dark mystery away from Rita and assigning it to herself, and by Lynch's use of this scene illustrates his use of deception in his characters. Betty's acting ability prompts Ruth Perlmutter to speculate if Betty is acting the role of Diane in either a dream or a parody of a film that ultimately turns against her.|$|E
500|$|The ninth season {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews by critics and garnered negative reaction from many long-time fans and viewers. Sabadino Parker from PopMatters, called the show [...] "a pale {{reflection of the}} show it once was". Elizabeth Weinbloom from The New York Times concluded, [...] "shoddy writing notwithstanding, it was this halfhearted culmination {{of what was once}} a beautifully complicated friendship", between Mulder and Scully that ended remaining interest in what was a [...] "waning phenomenon". Another The New York Times review stated, [...] "The most imaginative show on television has finally reached the limits of its imagination." [...] The A.V. Club listed the ninth season and the 2008 film The X-Files: I Want to <b>Believe</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "bad apple" [...] of The X-Files franchise, describing the ninth season as [...] "clumsy mish-mash of stuff that had once worked and new serialized storylines about so-called 'super soldiers'". Brian Linder from IGN, on the other hand, was more positive to the ninth season, saying that the series could still have aired if the writers created a new storyline for Patrick and Gish's characters.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1802, Francis Jeffrey, {{editor of}} the Edinburgh Review, {{submitted}} a review on Thalaba. In the October 1802 edition, he claimed that Southey [...] "belongs to a sect of poets, that has established itself in this country within these ten or twelve years, and is looked upon, we <b>believe,</b> <b>as</b> one of its chief champions and apostles... As Mr Southey is the first author, of this persuasion, that has yet been brought before us for judgment, we cannot discharge our inquisitorial office conscientiously, without premising a few words upon the nature and tendency of the tenets he has helped to promulgate. The disciples of this school boast much of its originality." [...] This led {{to a discussion of}} Southey's flaws: [...] "Originality, however, we are persuaded, is rare than mere alteration... That our new poets have abandoned the old models, may certainly be admitted; but {{we have not been able}} to discover that they have yet created any model of their own." [...] He continued to discuss the flaws of the British Romantic poets before returning to Thalaba when he argued, [...] "The subject of this poem is almost as ill chosen as the diction; and the conduct of the fable as disorderly as the versification... From this little sketch of the story, our readers will easily perceive, that it consists altogether of the most wild and extravagant fictions, and openly sets nature and probability at defiance. In its action it is not an imitation of anything; and excludes all rational criticism, as to the choice and succession of its incidents." ...|$|E
