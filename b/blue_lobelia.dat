50|$|Several {{species are}} {{cultivated}} as ornamental plants in gardens. These include Lobelia cardinalis syn. Lobelia fulgens (cardinal flower or Indian pink), Lobelia siphilitica (<b>blue</b> <b>lobelia),</b> and Lobelia erinus, {{which is used}} for edging and window boxes.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2012, Powell {{released}} [...] "Universe Mahalo: Volume #1" [...] {{which was}} the first official release of his solo project, [...] "Spaceship Aloha." [...] The songs are a combination of samples of traditional Hawaiian music with electronic beats. Powell has said the album was inspired by his time spent visiting Hawaii. A limited run of plantable postcards were made available for purchase as well. Each postcard included a download code and could than be planted and grown into <b>blue</b> <b>Lobelias.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Built {{primarily}} with racing in mind, the aluminium-bodied [...] "100S" [...] (for Sebring) model developed [...] at 4700 rpm. Only 50 production cars were made, plus an additional five works development/special test cars hand {{built by the}} Donald Healey Motor Company at Warwick. To minimize weight and improve performance the cast iron cylinder head {{was replaced by a}} Weslake designed aluminium one, and the overdrive unit was not installed. Dunlop disc brakes were used all-round, the world's first production car to feature them both front and rear. To further lighten the vehicle, bumpers and hood (convertible top) were eliminated, the grille reduced in size, and the windscreen made of plastic. In all, weight was reduced by approximately 200 lb. The majority of 100Ss were two-toned white with <b>Lobelia</b> <b>Blue</b> sides. A handful were produced in solid Spruce Green and red, and a single one in black.|$|R
5000|$|Lobelia heterophylla is a blue to purple flowered herb {{found in}} Southern Australia. The {{specific}} epithet {{refers to the}} variety of leaf forms found on individual plants. The species was first described by Jacques Labillardière in his seminal work on Australian flora, Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. L. heterophylla has a wide distribution, due to its ability to inhabit a variety of soil types. The habit of the herbaceous plant is erect, up to 0.6 metres, with flowers appearing from August or October to December, or January to February. The flower whorl is deeply cleft, its colour range of blue, scarlet or purple is well known and it {{is considered to be}} a desirable specimen for use in gardens. The plant is commonly referred to as wing-seeded <b>lobelia</b> and Australian <b>blue</b> creeper (various-leaved <b>lobelia).</b> The species was featured and illustrated by Joseph Paxton in 1838.|$|R
50|$|West of the Cobbles, the {{landscape}} changes to open managed hay fields dotted with {{eastern red cedar}} and then to upland forests of red oak, eastern hemlock, yellow birch, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and black birch. Rare upland species include the great <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia.</b> Hay fields are managed to preserve habitat for ground nesting bobolinks.|$|E
50|$|Lobelia siphilitica, {{the great}} <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia</b> or great lobelia, is a plant species within the Campanulaceae family. It is a herbaceous, {{perennial}} dicot native to {{eastern and central}} Canada and United States. Growing up to three feet tall, it lives in zones 4 to 9 in moist to wet soils. It produces a spike of zygomorphic flowers in the late summer.|$|E
50|$|Spring wildflowers include bellwort, bloodroot,columbine, dwarf iris,, fire pink,hepatica, jack-in-the-pulpit, lady slipper, ragwort, Solomon’s {{seal spring}} beauty, {{trailing}} arbutus trillium, trout lilly, several varieties of violets,wild germanium, wild ginger and wintergreen. In {{summer and fall}} the flower display turns to black-eyed susans, boneset, goldenrods, grass of parnassus,great <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia,</b> indian pipe,joe pye weed , milkweed, pokeweed, stiff gentian, and jewel weed. In addition there are flowering shrubs such as flame azalea, blue berry, dogwood, redbud, service berry and rhododendron.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a curious}} {{question}} how bees recognise the flowers of the same species. That the coloured corolla is the chief guide cannot be doubted. On a fine day, when hive-bees were incessantly visiting the little <b>blue</b> flowers of <b>Lobelia</b> erinus, I cut off all the petals of some, and only the lower striped petals of others, and these flowers were not once again sucked by the bees, although some actually crawled over them. The removal of the two little upper petals alone made no difference in their visits. Mr. J. Anderson likewise states that when he removed the corollas of the Calceolaria, bees never visited the flowers. (11/7. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1853 page 534. Kurr cut off the nectaries from {{a large number of}} flowers of several species, and found that the greater number yielded seeds; but insects probably would not perceive the loss of the nectary until they had inserted their proboscides into the holes thus formed, and in doing so would fertilise the flowers. He also removed the whole corolla from a considerable number of flowers, and these likewise yielded seeds. Flowers which are self-fertile would naturally produce seeds under these circumstances; but I am greatly surprised that Delphinium consolida, as well as another species of Delphinium, and Viola tricolor, should have produced a fair supply of seeds when thus treated; but it does not appear that he compared the number of the seeds thus produced with those yielded by unmutilated flowers left to the free access of insects: 'Bedeutung der Nektarien' 1833 pages 123-135.) On the other hand, in some large masses of Geranium phaeum which had escaped out of a garden, I observed the unusual fact of the flowers continuing to secrete an abundance of nectar after all the petals had fallen off; and the flowers in this state were still visited by humble-bees. But the bees might have learnt that these flowers with all their petals lost were still worth visiting, by finding nectar in those with only one or two lost. The colour alone of the corolla serves as an approximate guide: thus I watched for some time humble-bees which were visiting exclusively plants of the white-flowered Spiranthes autumnalis, growing on short turf at a considerable distance apart; and these bees often flew within a few inches of several other plants with white flowers, and then without further examination passed onwards in search of the Spiranthes. Again, many hive-bees which confined their visits to the common ling (Calluna vulgaris), repeatedly flew towards Erica tetralix, evidently attracted by the nearly similar tint of their flowers, and then instantly passed on in search of the Calluna.|$|R
50|$|The soils in {{this area}} are {{moderately}} fertile and sometimes rich. The land is moderately rugged, discouraging row-crop agriculture. These soils are easily eroded. There is some commercial agriculture in the loessal plains area of the ridge. The ridge is surrounded by the fertile lands of the delta region. The vegetation is predominantly oak and hickory forests, similar to vegetation found in the Appalachian Mountains. Examples are the tulip tree (a yellow poplar) and the American beech. Ferns and flowers abound here, including the American bell flower, crimson catchfly, butterfly weed, cardinal flower, <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia,</b> phlox, verbena, wild hydrangea, hibiscus, aster and yellow jasmine. The low-lying areas around the ridge were once much swampier, and the ridge provided a natural and more healthful place for settlers to establish homes. The ridge became a natural north-south communications link for the region, since travel along the ridge was much easier than through the swampy lowlands.|$|E

The mashed roots were {{secretly}} put into some common dish, which was eaten by both husband and wife. The Cherokee used a cold infusion of the roots of great <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia</b> and cardinal flower to treat nosebleed.

40|$|Saturday, 29 th April Today I sowed <b>blue</b> <b>lobelia</b> and Pacific Giant pansies. The {{coriander}} and {{the stocks}} have sprouted {{green on the}} grey soil. With what ardour I go out each morning peering through my reading glasses. Yet I miss so much. For instance, why didn 2 ̆ 7 t I see the new fruit coming when I sprayed the leaves? I {{was looking at the}} leaves, that 2 ̆ 7 s why. Sometimes I see people pass by as I stand at the front window. Many do not look to the right or left. They seem blind. But I tell myself this is not a test of intelligence, the person looking at the cement path may be thinking of how to end the play he is writing, how to pay a bill, or a thousand other things.
