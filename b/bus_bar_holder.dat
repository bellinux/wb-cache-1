When the short-circuit power reaches unacceptable levels, a system with automatic switchovers can provide a solution. With this system, each transformer feeds its own <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> (see Fig. 1). The transformers are able to feed both <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> (e. g. for maintenance). When one transformer breaks down, the other will take over its <b>bus</b> <b>bar,</b> but only after the voltage has dropped. To avoid this voltage drop, a DC coupling between both <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> could be used.

40|$|AbstractWith {{decreasing}} module {{prices on}} the spot market, the cost of silver is {{getting more and more}} important in solar cell fabrication. Silver is necessary for the front side metallization and the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metallization in a solar cell. The front side benefits from the good conductivity of silver whereas the rear side <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> need the low oxidation degree and thus the good solderability of this noble metal. We replace silver <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> by a metal paste containing a combination of different metals with a silver content below 40 %. Thus we reach a silver reduction of 30 % compared to conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal paste. Multi crystalline silicon solar cells with the new paste achieve identical efficiencies compared to cells with silver reference pastes, tested on 150 cells per batch. The new paste simply replaces conventional rear <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> metal pastes and passes the common tests. Reliability tests are in progress at the moment. As a pretest, cells with the paste passed a hot-water test. Losses in efficiency of the cells due to corrosion are comparable to the losses of cells with reference silver paste...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bus</b> <b>bars</b> on {{solar cells}} shade silicon from light. When the <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are patterned, they can reflect light {{back onto the}} silicon using total {{internal}} reflection. These patterned <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> are tin plated and produce 1 - 2. 5 % improvement in module efficiency [6]. There is a potential for even greater improvement by using higher reflectivity metal plating on the <b>bus</b> <b>bars.</b> Silver is the most reflective of all metals, but is also very expensive. We tested to see if silver would actually be as reflective as published values and if silver could redirect {{a substantial amount of}} light using total internal reflection. We found that silver plating followed the published spectral dependence curve with little deviation, and would reflect 18. 4 % more light than the published values for tin. Plating 2. 24 microns resulted in 94. 9 % of reflected light undergoing TIR; the most reflected light of any tested material. Finally, given the current cost of silver is $ 430 per kilogram and the variable cost of a solar cell is $ 2 per Watt, the maximum allowable thickness we could afford to plate is 44. 8 microns. In our testing, plating as little as 0. 35 microns produced a very high light capture.

40|$|We {{investigate}} and compare three different fine line printing techniques for the silver front side metallization of industrial-type silicon solar cells: single print, dual print and print-on-print. We obtain finger heights of 5. 6 μm for single print, 9. 5 μm for dual print and 15. 1 μm for print-on-print {{as well as}} finger width between 46. 2 μm and 61. 3 μm.

For the dual print, we test two different <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> designs, a standard rectangular shaped <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> and a segmented <b>bus</b> <b>bar.</b> The resulting PERC solar cells achieve conversion efficiencies of 19. 8 % for dual print and print-on-print. The dual print with segmented <b>bus</b> <b>bar</b> design reduces the Ag paste consumption to 67. 7 mg, measured after printing prior to drying. To our knowledge, this is the lowest front side Ag paste consumption that has been reported so far. Additionally, we model optimum Ag finger width in dependence of electrical and geometrical parameters. We find that even when assuming very optimistic parameters, the optimum finger width of 26 μm is just a factor of two lower compared {{to the state of}} the art technology today...|$|R
40|$|Solar cells used in {{photovoltaic}} (PV) crystalline silicon modules commonly feature {{grid fingers}} and <b>bus</b> <b>bars</b> as front contacts.
