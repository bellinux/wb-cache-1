Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
500|$|Brandon Soderberg of Pitchfork {{commented that}} Beyoncé mixes [...] "vulnerability and confidence" [...] while singing the chorus lines, where she {{repeatedly}} pleads her romantic interest, [...] "Make {{love to me}} when my days look low / Pull me in close and don't let me go / Make love to me when the world's at war / That our love will heal us all", while the music stays steady and soft {{with only a few}} piano chords and a baseline plucked guitar riff. As she continues to chant about making love in apocalyptic circumstances, [...] "So when the world's at war / Let our love heal us all", she projects a universal [...] "all you need is love" [...] feeling, as noted by Jillian Mapes. In the second verse, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Hey! I don't know much about guns but I ... I've been shot by you", as she pushes the final word [...] "you" [...] up at a full octave. She then continues: [...] "Hey! And I don't know when I'm gonna die, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> I'm gonna die by you / Hey! And I don't know much about fighting, but I, I know I will fight for you / Hey! Just when I ball up my fist, I realize that I'm laying right next to you". According to Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times, these lines are intended to show that love conquers all. The song ends with an intense electric guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{reported}} that past season premieres of 30 Rock {{had a solid}} track record as being the worst episodes of the season, nonetheless Rabin found [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] hilarious and breaking that barrier. He wrote that Matt Damon has been great on the show as Carol; however, his only complaint was Carol's character flaw as being too sensitive. Rabin, who has complained [...] "extensively" [...] about Jenna's character in the past, said the character was in [...] "fine form" [...] {{in her role as}} a TGS producer. Rabin gave the episode an A- grade rating. Bob Sassone of TV Squad deemed this episode a [...] "solid season-opener" [...] that featured [...] "lots of great lines and plot development". Meredith Blake, a contributor from the Los Angeles Times, was thrilled that the Jack and Avery relationship [...] "not only lasted the summer, but is thriving", and wrote that she was looking forward to the pregnancy storyline involving Avery. Blake noted that Damon's character was [...] "darn-near perfect, by which I mean 'a male version of Liz.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for HitFix said that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] did not [...] "live up to the good old days" [...] of past episodes, nonetheless {{reported that}} he [...] "laughed enough" [...] and was pleased with the direction the show took Liz and Carol's relationship. Sepinwall did not like Tracy and Kenneth's story, calling it a complete miss, but was appreciative of the other storylines, choosing Pete and Jenna's as his favorite. Alessandra Stanley from The New York Times was positive about Damon's role on the show, noting that he has been a [...] "hoot". Scott Eidler of The Cornell Daily Sun commented that the episode was a [...] "nice start to the [...] season" [...] of 30 Rock as it was [...] "perhaps more plot-driven than packed with the emotional and uproariously funny episodes that concluded last season." [...] Eidler commented that [...] "The Fabian Strategy" [...] never did [...] " [...] the utter hilariousness of last season, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> wasn't the climax... and it can eventually return to its previous heights of hilarity". TV Guides Bruce Fretts was complimentary towards Damon's role as Tina Fey's love interest, writing that Damon [...] "showed a refreshingly silly side in keeping with 30 Rocks anything-goes spirit." [...] Matt Wilstein of The Huffington Post called the premiere [...] "a very solid first episode", enjoying Damon's part on the show and the Kenneth story of him still being fired by NBC.|$|E

2500|$|Former Afghanistan Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullah {{said during}} a press conference with US Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns, [...] "I {{know that it is}} a very {{sensitive}} issue and we know the concerns of the American people. In fact, in our embassy we received hundreds of messages of such kind. As far as I understand the nature of the case has been that the wife of the gentleman has registered a lawsuit against her husband. And then the Government of Afghanistan has nothing to do in it. It's a legal and judicial case. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> through our constitutional process there will be a satisfactory result out of that process." [...] He also stated: [...] "Every time we have a case it is like an alarm. These contradictions [...] will not go away with one or two cases." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{line with}} these new {{interests}} and activities, Lake accepted an offer in 1903 to become professor (ordinarius) of New Testament exegesis and early Christian literature at the Leiden University, the oldest university in the Netherlands. [...] He taught there for ten years, from 1904 until 1914. [...] His inaugural lecture, which he delivered in English, was on [...] "The Influence of Textual Criticism on the Exegesis of the New Testament." [...] At {{the close of the}} lecture he looked his students in the face. [...] "I am very sorry," [...] he said, [...] "that for a few months I shall be handicapped by my inability to use your language, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> by next September I shall {{be in a position to}} lecture in Dutch, at least partially, even though it may be necessary to apologize for frequent solecisms, and for an imperfect pronunciation." [...] He kept his promise and quickly learned to lecture in Dutch. [...] The lecture was published in 1904 and has proven to be a seminal study; though, as Elliott has noted: [...] "It has taken nearly a century for his general thesis that textual variants must be used as an invaluable source for our study of the history of the church to bear fruit in a determined way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{are kind}} indeed to bear me so in remembrance," [...] Malcolm said, [...] "and I am indeed {{grateful}} for it.

6000|$|Just how I {{was to help}} Perry I could scarce imagine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> some fortuitous {{circumstance}} might {{solve the}} problem for me.
