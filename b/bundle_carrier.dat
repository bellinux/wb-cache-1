30|$|As a {{critical}} consideration, a limited bandwidth and/or the insufficient duration of contacts may cause nodes {{to not be}} able to exchange all their bundles. Recall that the duration of contacts is affected by the speed of nodes. In such case, a strategy is required to manage the buffer in the case of forwarding and dropping. For example, assume that two nodes are in contact for 10  s and they have 20 bundles to forward to each other. Also, assume that the bandwidth capacity is 100  KBps, meaning that each node can forward 10 out of 20 bundles upon the contact. Hence, a queue policy makes the 20 bundles sorted based on the value of an objective function, e.g. delivery probability, delay. Then, bundles with higher priority are forwarded first. However, an inappropriate forwarding strategy may result in the system with a low delivery ratio and/or large delays. This is because bundles with a high delivery through a contact may not have the chance of being forwarded. Queue management is also needed when nodes experience buffer overflow. In this case, nodes with a full buffer need to provide room for incoming bundles. For this reason, they sort their buffered bundles based on the value of an objective function and drop a number of buffered bundles and replace them with incoming bundles. As a result, {{it is very important that}} nodes keep bundles in their buffer for a whilst until an appropriate forwarding opportunity arises. However, an inefficient drop policy may drop those bundles before meeting a good <b>bundle</b> <b>carrier</b> or even destination. Note that when bundles are sorted based on a metric, e.g. delivery probability, forward policy selects the bundle with the highest value whilst drop policy selects the bundles with the lowest value.|$|E
40|$|Aircrafts in {{commercial}} routes {{have been proposed}} in some previous work as a novel DTN <b>bundle</b> <b>carriers</b> [1]. Satellites {{can be one of}} the hops in this application. DTN suffers from intermittent disconnections, long delays and has scarce resources. It is a challenge to control the admission to these resources to provide better QoS and ensure optimum resource utilisation. Furthermore, providing fairness to different users who compete to access limited and scarce resources makes the solution even harder. In this paper, we propose a fair novel admission control model for DTN aircrafts applications based on feedback history logging of past admissions. This model will locally estimate the resources and provide fair admissions for users within a group of users in the same area. We will show an analysis of aircrafts fair admission control design for both aircraft initiated and user initiated approaches, which will provide integrated service per flow basis. The paper also presents the initial simulation model using a modified version of DTN 2 emulator and DTNperf_ 2 performance monitoring tool...|$|R

40|$|Telecommunications {{carriers}} suffer large-scale outages {{that impact}} {{hundreds of thousands}} of subscribers by the improper deployment or operation of otherwise faulttolerant designs. This paper gives examples of such outages in telecommunications signaling, transmission, and power systems. In spite of seven years industry tracking of largescale outages at the national level, the survivability of the public telephone network has not improved, as the frequency of outages is not decreasing. This surprising phenomenon is all the more remarkable in that well-known outage scenarios continue which defeat otherwise fault tolerant systems. Averting such survivability deficits requires less focus on fault-tolerant designs and more focus on organizations and people. It {{remains to be seen if}} local access competition will remedy these survivability problems, as voice, video, and data service offerings are <b>bundled</b> by <b>carriers...</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{revisions}} of the standard, starting with Release 0 (Rel. 0). This was later expanded upon with Revision A (Rev. A) to support Quality of Service (to improve latency) and higher rates on the forward link and reverse link. Later in 2006 Revision B (Rev. B) was published, that among other features includes the ability to <b>bundle</b> multiple <b>carriers</b> to achieve even higher rates and lower latencies (see TIA-856 Rev. B below). The upgrade from EV-DO Rev. A to EV-DO Rev. B involves a software update to the cell site modem, and additional equipment for the new EV-DO carriers. Existing cdma2000 operators may also have to retune some of their existing 1xRTT channels to other frequencies, since Rev. B requires all DO carriers be within 5 MHz.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Infrastructure {{networks}} like Internet {{have some}} coverage gaps (e. g. rural areas) where no service connectivity is provided. Cellular networks {{could be used}} in alternative but they usually associate their services with a usage cost. Nowadays, the growing number of mobile devices equipped with a wireless interface and the end-user trend to shift toward wireless technology has opened new possibilities for networking. Opportunistic networking seems a feasible solution in filling in these coverage gaps by providing service connectivity where it is not sustained by an infrastructure. In this context we provide a delay tolerant platform that ensures service connectivity where it is absent. Our approach follows the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) paradigm by implementing a store-and-forward communication model between mobile users and carrier entities (e. g. buses), where a user delegates the <b>carrier</b> a task (<b>bundle),</b> the <b>carrier</b> stores it locally and whenever service connectivity is available (e. g. wi-fi at the bus station) tries to accomplish it, successively notifying the user of the task output next time they encounter again.

40|$|In this study, {{based on}} a conjoint-type survey analysis, the {{switching}} cost of several Japanese telecom services are empirically examined simultaneously, contingent on each <b>carrier's</b> <b>bundling</b> strategies. The results suggest the following conclusions. The hierarchy of switching costs is mobile phone service, fixed phone service, ISP (Internet Service Provider), and broadband access service, in descending order. Even if the government prohibits the formerly state-owned monopoly NTT from forming alliances with other carriers, the legacy NTT group would still command {{more than half of}} the market share under FMC if each carrier adopts a pure bundling strategy. If mixed bundling emerges as the primary strategy in the FMC market, the resulting type of competition from the introduction of FMC does not stimulate competitive pricing.

40|$|DE 2930659 A UPAB: 19930915 To avoid high {{summation}} peaks {{resulting from}} a number of modulated TV carriers using the same transmission line, measures such as setting up a fixed phase relationship between the carrier waves are insufficient. It becomes necessary to provide for a continual automatic adjustment of the phases in order to reduce to a minimum inter-and cross modulation interference. The invention prescribes a method for setting the phase relationship of neighbouring carrier channels in accordance with a phasing pattern that corresponds to the Barker Codes characteristic for Pulse Compression codes. This is achieved by including into a frequency conversion channel (AX) a phase regulator loop (PLLS) which is controlled by a phase setting member (PE) and the input from another generator (fo). An intermediate frequency generator (ZG 1), for example at 38. 9 MHz, is applied to the sending converter unit (ZF/HF) {{as well as to the}} modulation circuit of the receiver unit phase setting stage (PLLE). By means of a mixer stage contained in the regulator loop (PLLS) the thereby generated intermediate frequency has a continually changing phase which is compared with an intermediate frequency of a reference carrier pair, and the result is used to modify the phase of Ax as well as all neighbouring channel pairs until the total phase pattern corresponds to the optimal distribution over the <b>carrier</b> <b>bundle...</b>|$|R
