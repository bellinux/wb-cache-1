50|$|In Euclidean geometry, an {{isosceles}} trapezoid (isosceles trapezium in British English) is a convex quadrilateral {{with a line}} of symmetry bisecting {{one pair}} of opposite sides. It is a special case of a trapezoid. In any isosceles trapezoid two opposite sides (the bases) are parallel, and the two other sides (the legs) are of equal length (properties shared with the parallelogram). The diagonals are also of equal length. The base angles of an isosceles trapezoid are equal in measure (there are in fact two pairs of equal base angles, where one <b>base</b> <b>angle</b> is the supplementary angle of a <b>base</b> <b>angle</b> at the other base).|$|E

50|$|The skinny {{triangle}} {{is frequently}} used in astronomy {{to measure the}} distance to solar system objects. The base of the triangle is formed by the distance between two measuring stations and the angle θ is the parallax angle formed by the object as seen by the two stations. This baseline is usually very long for best accuracy; in principle the stations could be {{on opposite sides of}} the Earth. However, this distance is still short compared to the distance to the object being measured (the height of the triangle) and the skinny triangle solution can be applied and still achieve great accuracy. The alternative method of measuring the <b>base</b> <b>angles</b> is theoretically possible but not so accurate. The <b>base</b> <b>angles</b> are very nearly right angles and would need to be measured with much greater precision than the parallax angle in order to get the same accuracy.|$|R
