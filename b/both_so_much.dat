25|$|After seven years, {{the two men}} {{started to}} fight again but both died from their wounds. But, Hilda loved <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> so that she used spells to conjure up the dead each night, and so the battle went on and on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I didn't know any," [...] I said; {{and this}} seemed to amuse them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I was afraid they would never get their breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master Sedley Archfield!" [...] {{said the}} Doctor; [...] "welcome home, sir! 'Tis {{a meeting of}} old acquaintance. You and this gentleman are <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> altered {{that it is no}} wonder if you do not {{recognise}} one another at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder it didn't {{come to your}} ears," [...] he said. [...] "It was the queerest thing. You {{remember}} that girl whom we <b>both</b> admired <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at the Academy?" ...|$|R
60|$|A {{man and a}} woman {{were alone}} beside the marble basin, face to face, eye to eye, yet finding not one word to say. <b>Both</b> had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to atone for, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to forgive, that mere words were but the poor {{expression}} of all that filled their hearts.|$|R
60|$|Lord Chatterino {{and myself}} pounced upon the {{respective}} documents like two hawks, eagerly looking for flaws, or {{the means of}} maintaining the opinions we had before advanced, and which we had <b>both</b> shown <b>so</b> <b>much</b> cleverness in supporting.|$|R
60|$|Well, it was printed, and she {{got three}} hundred dollars for it, {{likewise}} plenty of praise and blame, <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> greater than she expected that she was thrown {{into a state of}} bewilderment from which it took her some time to recover.|$|E
6000|$|... "She says," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Brewster, {{referring to}} the letter again, [...] "that they were <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in love that they simply had to slip off and get married, and she hopes I won't be cross. Cross!" [...] gasped Mr. Brewster, gazing wildly at his friend.|$|E
60|$|I am, unhappily, off my style, and can {{do nothing}} well; indeed, I fear I have marred ROADS finally by {{patching}} at it when I {{was out of the}} humour. Only, I am beginning to see something great about John Knox and Queen Mary: I like them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> that I feel as if I could write the history fairly.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{have had}} playmates, I have had companions,'" [...] I quoted in return. We were both moved, I think, {{to meet again}} in this scene of our old {{pleasure}} parties so unexpectedly, after so long an interval, and <b>both</b> already <b>so</b> <b>much</b> altered.|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} to the castle where they had <b>both</b> endured <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But when they reached it, it was {{difficult}} to believe that it was the same, for it had all been rebuilt and done up again. And there they lived for a hundred years, a hundred years of joy and happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord, sir, what do men {{care for}} dresses, {{that are used}} to see the heads of {{factories}} and forts half the time dressed in skins? They know that there be holidays and workin'-days; times for every-day wear, and times for feathers and paint. No--no--they look at you <b>both,</b> with <b>so</b> <b>much</b> interest, on account of their traditions." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{she begged}} for her last communion, saying, 'I do pray for that poor Gregorio. Isn't that {{forgiving}} him?' And {{the attempt to}} exchange forgiveness with the Canon for their mutual behaviour {{at the time of}} her marriage overcame them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that they had to leave it not half uttered. Indeed, in speaking of the scene, William Egremont was utterly overwhelmed.|$|E
60|$|Then the invalid clergyman {{stood up}} and prayed, and read a chapter of God's Word, after which he preached--ay, preached {{in a way that}} drew tears from some, and hearty exclamations of thankfulness from others. It was not the power of rhetoric or of eloquence though he possessed <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> as that mighty power, which {{consists}} in being thoroughly and intensely earnest in what one says, and in using a natural, conversational tone.|$|E
6000|$|... "If only, {{when we were}} <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> younger," [...] she sighed, [...] "we had had {{a little}} more courage. But I was so ignorant, and {{there was so much}} else, too, to distract. I shall never forget our first few months of travel--Paris, the Riviera, Italy. I was impressionable, too, and I loved it all so--the colour and the beauty, the rich, warm stream of life, after that wretched village school. I was so aching to understand, and you were such a good tutor. You fed my brain wonderfully. Oh, I suppose I ought to be content!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear,' {{returned}} the cherub, {{looking at them}} <b>both,</b> 'you broke <b>so</b> <b>much</b> in the first--Gush, if I may so express myself--that I think I am equal to a good large breakage now.' ...|$|R
40|$|Cornelia Bryce Pinchot, Real Estate Trust Building, [South Broad Street and Chestnut Street], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, letter, [s. d. ], to Hamlin Garland. "I {{am writing}} for Gifford {{to thank you}} and Mrs. Garland for your letter [...] it is kind of[?] her to {{remember}} me [...] and we <b>both</b> appreciate <b>so</b> <b>much</b> your kind message. " [...] first line...|$|R
50|$|As a cricketer, his {{opportunities}} {{were limited}} by the demands of his business and also by the conflict on his spare time of football, <b>both</b> taking up <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of his annual leave (which was so brief pre-war).|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is such a}} {{pleasant}} prospect for poor Nat, who came to me six months ago so friendless and forlorn. Dan's future is already plain to me. Mr. Hyde will want him soon, and I mean {{to give him a}} brave and faithful little servant. Dan is one who can serve well if the wages are love and confidence, and he has the energy to carve out his own future in his own way. Yes, I am very happy over our success with these boys one so weak, and one so wild; <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> better now, and so full of promise." ...|$|E
6000|$|Next day, {{when they}} were having tea, Griffiths came in. He sank lazily into an arm-chair. There was {{something}} strangely sensual in the slow movements of his large limbs. Philip remained silent, while the others chattered away, but he was enjoying himself. He admired them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that it seemed natural {{enough for them to}} admire one another. He did not care if Griffiths absorbed Mildred's attention, he would have her to himself during the evening: he had something of the attitude of a loving husband, confident in his wife's affection, who looks on with amusement while she flirts harmlessly with a stranger. But at half past seven {{he looked at his watch}} and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Goodness, no. I couldn't love anybody. It isn't in me. Besides I wouldn't want to. Being in love {{makes you}} a perfect slave, I think. And it would give a man such power to hurt you. I'd be afraid. No, no, Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys, and I like them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that I really don't know which I like the better. That is the trouble. Alec is the best looking, of course, and I simply couldn't marry a man who wasn't handsome. He is good-tempered too, and has lovely, curly, black hair. He's rather too perfect--I don't believe I'd like a perfect husband--somebody I could never find fault with." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gunn enters Wesley's office, and <b>both</b> have <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{emotional}} baggage, {{they are}} uncertain how to behave. Wesley {{acknowledges that he}} should apologize for stabbing him earlier but is unsure how as he feels {{it would just be}} awkward. Gunn replies he isn't looking for an apology and he probably wouldn't accept one anyway, adding that his torture in the hell dimension was much worse.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{the more}} disappointing to Magdalen, because Agatha and Paulina <b>both</b> showed <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{unconscious}} likeness to their father, not only in features, but in little touches of gesture and manner. She longed to pet them, and say, [...] "Oh, my dears, how like papa!" [...] but the only time she attempted it, she was met by a severe, uncomprehending look and manner.|$|R
60|$|HOTCHKISS. Ah, youre {{quoting the}} Baptism service. Thats {{not a bit}} real, you know. If I may say <b>so,</b> you would <b>both</b> feel <b>so</b> <b>much</b> more at peace with yourselves if you would {{acknowledge}} and confess your real convictions. You know you dont really think a Bishop the equal of a curate, or a lieutenant in a line regiment the equal of a general.|$|R
60|$|After breakfast, next morning, we {{were all}} called aft to the ward-room, one at a time. I was pumped as to {{the force of the}} Americans, the names of the vessels, the numbers of the crews, and the names of the commanders. I {{answered}} a little saucily, and was ordered out of the ward-room. As I was quitting the place, I was called back by one of the lieutenants, whose appearance I did not like from the first. Although it was now eight years since I left Halifax, and we had <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> altered, I took this gentleman for Mr. Bowen, the very midshipman of the Cleopatra, who had been my schoolmate, and whom I had known on board the prize-brig I have mentioned.|$|E
60|$|From {{the moment}} of first seeing them I had had {{no doubt about the}} sex of the tall old leader of the procession, his shining white beard being as {{conspicuous}} at a distance as a shield or a banner; but looking at the others I was at first puzzled to know whether the party was composed of men or women, or of <b>both,</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> did they resemble each other in height, in their smooth faces, and in the length of their hair. On a closer inspection I noticed the difference of dress of the sexes; also that the men, if not sterner, had faces at all events less mild and soft in expression than the women, and also a slight perceptible down on the cheeks and upper lip.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had left}} her phaeton at a livery stable, and {{was on her way}} to the Bannister house to have a talk with Dora on a subject in which they were now <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> interested. She had been very much {{surprised}} when the girl had come to her and freely avowed her feelings and hopes, but she had been delighted. She liked a spirit of that sort, and it was a joy to her to work with one who possessed it. But she knew human nature, and she was very much afraid that Dora's purpose might weaken. It was quite natural that a young person, in a moment of excitement and pique, should figuratively raise her sword in air and vow a vow; but it was also quite natural, when the excitement and pique had cooled down, that the young person should experience what might be called a [...] "vow-fright," [...] and feel unable to go through with her part. In a case such as Dora's, this was very possible indeed, and all that Miss Panney had planned to say on her present visit was intended to inspire the girl, if it should be needed, with some of her own matured inflexibility and fixedness of purpose. But if the man were doing this sort of thing already and Dora should know it, she would have a right to be discouraged.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between Stregoneria and Benedicaria is more confounded entirely since in their purest forms {{the two are}} completely distinct. However, most practitioners make use of elements from both traditions, and many practitioners were raised with or taught elements of <b>both</b> traditions, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> that {{over the course of}} centuries, it has become impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins. In many cases, even the practitioner herself is not certain as to the distinctions.|$|R
60|$|So he did; but he put {{the third}} term first, and multiplied the hours into the minutes, instead of {{reducing}} them to the same denomination; so that he made out that twenty-five men would take longer to cut a field of grass than three, and then could not {{see that he was}} wrong; but Miss Fosbrook and Sam <b>both</b> looked <b>so</b> <b>much</b> grieved for him, that a start of fright went through him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not if you {{had brought}} me to the Union literally,' said Isabel, smiling. 'Indeed, dear James, I think we have <b>both</b> been <b>so</b> <b>much</b> the better and happier for this last year, that I would not have been without it for any consideration; and if any {{mistakes}} on your part led to it, they were mistakes on the right side. Don't shake your head, for you know they were what only a good man could have made.' ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} young man on Earraid in these days, {{and we were}} much together, bathing, clambering on the boulders, trying to sail a boat and {{spinning}} round instead in the oily whirlpools of the roost. But the most {{part of the time}} we spoke of the great uncharted desert of our futures; wondering together what should there befall us; hearing with surprise the sound of our own voices in the empty vestibule of youth. As far, and as hard, as it seemed then to look forward to the grave, so far it seems now to look backward upon these emotions; so hard to recall justly that loath submission, as of the sacrificial bull, with which we stooped our necks under the yoke of destiny. I met my old companion but the other day; I cannot tell of course what he was thinking; but, upon my part, I was wondering to see us <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at home, and so composed and sedentary in the world; and how much we had gained, and how much we had lost, to attain to that composure; and which had been upon the whole our best estate: when we sat there prating sensibly like men of some experience, or when we shared our timorous and hopeful counsels in a western islet.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ronald!' Lady Breton exclaimed, drawing {{herself up}} with much dignity; 'how on earth you, who have always {{pretended to be}} a {{religious}} person, can utter such a shocking and wicked sentiment as that, really passes my comprehension. What {{in the world is}} religion for, I should like to know, if it isn't to teach us how to save our own souls? But the particular thing I want to speak to you about is just this: couldn't you manage to induce Ernest to see the Archdeacon a little, and let the Archdeacon speak to him about his deplorable spiritual condition? I thought about you <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> at church yesterday, when the dear Archdeacon was preaching such a beautiful sermon; his text was like this, as far as I can remember it. [...] "There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death." [...] I couldn't help thinking all the time of my own two poor rebellious boys, and of the path that their misguided notions were leading them on. For I believe Ernest does really somehow persuade himself that he's in the right--it's inconceivable, but it's the fact; and I'm afraid the end thereof will be the ways of death; and then, as the dear Archdeacon said, [...] "After death the judgment." [...] Oh, Ronald, when I think of your poor dear brother Ernest's open unbelief, it makes me tremble for his future, so that I couldn't rest upon my bed until I'd been to see you and urged you to go and try to save him.' ...|$|E
60|$|But Perseus’ adventures {{were not}} over. As he flew {{on by the}} Lybian coast he heard a sound of wailing, and beheld a {{beautiful}} maiden chained by her hands and feet to a rock. He asked what had led her to this sad plight, and she answered that she was Andromeda, the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of Ethiopia, and {{that her mother had}} foolishly boasted that she was fairer than the Nereids, the fifty nymphs who are the spirits of the waves. Neptune was so much displeased that he sent a flood to overflow the land, and a sea-monster to devour the people and cattle. In an oasis or isle of fertility {{in the middle of the}} Lybian desert was a temple of Jupiter, there called Ammon, and the Ethiopians had sent there to ask what to do. The oracle replied that the evil should cease if Andromeda were given up to the monster. Cepheus had been obliged to yield her up because of the outcries of the people, and here she was waiting to be devoured. Perseus, of course, was ready. He heard the monster coming, bade Andromeda close her eyes, and then held up the Gorgon’s head. In an instant her foe had become a rock, and he cleft the maiden’s chains, brought her back to her father and mother, who gave her to him in marriage, and made a great feast; but here a former lover of hers insulted them <b>both</b> <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> that Perseus was forced to show him the Gorgon’s face, and turn him into stone.|$|E
50|$|Craig {{believes}} his {{attendance at the}} two universities helped the most in his success:Let's face it, for Jeopardy!, {{the name of the}} game is breadth not depth. I think the main reason <b>both</b> universities helped <b>so</b> <b>much</b> is that they cover just about all spheres of learning in extraordinary depth.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Evelyn's {{opinion was}} confirmed, {{when a few}} days later came the answer to Jock's letter to his tutor, {{pleasing}} and touching <b>both</b> friends <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that each showed it to his mother. Another important piece of intelligence came in a letter from John to his cousin, namely that the present Captain of the house, with two or three more [...] "fellows," [...] were leaving Eton at the Midsummer holidays, and that his tutor had been talking to him about becoming Captain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{good care}} of her, John," [...] she had entreated. [...] "She is so small--and sensitive. The others can fight their way--but the world will hurt HER. Oh, John, I don't know what you and she are going to do. You <b>both</b> need me <b>so</b> <b>much.</b> But keep her close to you--keep her close to you." ...|$|R
