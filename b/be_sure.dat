5|$|An inquest into Lynott's {{death was}} held at Birmingham Coroner's Court in January 2003. The hearing was told that marks found {{on her back and}} an arm may have been bruising, but the {{pathologist}} who conducted the original post mortem could not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> how she had died, because her body had lain undiscovered for up to seven days. It was also said that, despite her connection with Smith, police and four pathologists had failed to establish that Lynott had been murdered. The inquest jury returned an open verdict.|$|E

5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{distinctive}} feature of Deinonychus, the shape and curvature of the sickle claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in {{the size and shape}} of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not <b>be</b> <b>sure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elves {{appear in}} some place-names, {{though it is}} hard to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> how many as a variety of other words, {{including}} personal names, can appear similar to elf. The clearest English example is Elveden ("elves' hill", Suffolk); other examples may be Eldon Hill ("Elves' hill", Derbyshire); and Alden Valley ("elves' valley", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} final match, City were level on points with {{neighbours}} Manchester United, with City holding the advantage in goal average – the first decider if teams finished level on points – but needing to win to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> of staying above their cross-city rivals. Liverpool were three points behind, but had a game in hand, so could still win the title if both City and United faltered. City faced tenth-placed Newcastle United at St James' Park; United were at home to bottom-half Sunderland. Bookmakers made United slight favourites for the title.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter units {{from all over the}} country to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to break them.|$|E

5|$|The looming {{referendum}} {{prompted a}} number of actions in the Quebec Superior Court, which were consolidated under the application of prominent lawyer Guy Bertrand. Bertrand asked for interim and permanent injunctions against the holding of the referendum. The Federal Attorney General declined to intervene, and after failing in a motion to strike the application, the Quebec Attorney General unilaterally withdrew from the hearing. The Quebec government moved the September sitting of the National Assembly two days forward to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that parliamentary immunity would prevent MNAs from being summoned to testify.|$|E
5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> he was correct. David Quammen has suggested all these factors may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Experimental research: The {{researcher}} isolates {{a single}} social process and reproduces it {{in a laboratory}} (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking {{to determine whether or}} not certain social variables can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting gender stereotypes). Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.|$|E
5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes {{that it is impossible to}} <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> who was in command on the day.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Major General Ironside {{launched}} his offensive against the 6th Red Army, with the British force subsequently inflicting {{large numbers of}} casualties and taking many prisoners for relatively little loss to themselves. The offensive was mainly fought through thick pine forest and swamp which provided little terrain for manoeuvre and although hugely successful, may have been unnecessary. Indeed, the Bolshevik forces in the region perhaps numbered only 6,000 men, and was probably engaged in holding operations only. It {{has been suggested that}} they probably had no intention of interrupting the Allied evacuation, and may have been caught unprepared by the sudden offensive. To <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> the main Red Army activity in early August was on the Siberian front, where Kolchak's White armies were falling back in disarray.|$|E

5|$|In the afternoon, PT-41 and PT-32 {{made their}} way to Tagauayan, where they found PT-34. There was a {{discussion}} about whether to proceed to Mindanao, or wait for Permit. Bulkeley warned that the seas might even be higher. But, since there was no assurance that the submarine would make it, MacArthur decided to continue, departing in daylight at 18:00 so as to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> to meet their air transport there. Since PT-32 had no fuel to make Mindanao, its passengers were divided between PT-41 and PT-34. Soon after they had departed, PT-35 belatedly arrived at rendezvous point. Akers found the crew of PT-32 there, and discovered that the other two boats had been and gone. He therefore set out for Cagayan de Oro as well.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem to me to be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations {{of what should}} be censored from whom should not {{be made by the}} government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically what should and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E
