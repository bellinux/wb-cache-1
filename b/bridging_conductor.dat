40|$|A broad-range {{vacuum gauge}} {{has been created}} by {{suspending}} a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) (metallic or semiconducting) in a Schottky diode format or in a <b>bridge</b> <b>conductor</b> format, between two electrically charged mesas. SWNTs are highly sensitive to molecular collisions because of their extremely small diameters {{in the range of}} 1 to 3 nanometers. The measurement parameter will be the change in conductivity of SWNT due to decreasing rate of molecular collisions as the pressure inside a chamber decreases. The rate of heat removal approaches a saturation limit as the mean free path (m. f. p.) lengths of molecules increase due to decreasing pressure. Only those sensing elements that have a long relaxation time can produce a measureable response when m. f. p. of molecules increases (or time between two consecutive collisions increases). A suspended SWNT offers such a capability because of its one-dimensional nature and ultrasmall diameter. In the initial approach, similar architecture was used as that of a SWNT-Schottky diode that has been developed at JPL, and has its changing conductivity measured as the test chamber is pumped down from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum (10 (exp - 7) Torr). Continuous response of decreasing conductivity has been measured as a function of decreasing pressure (SWNT is a negative thermal coefficient material) from atmosphere to less than 10 (exp - 6) Torr. A measureable current change in the hundreds of nA range has been recorded in the 10 (exp - 6) Torr regime...|$|R

40|$|With {{the global}} {{transition}} to lead-free electronics, the electronic component market has seen {{an increase in}} the selection of pure tin and tin-rich alloys as lead-free component finishes. The adoption of tin-rich finishes has enhanced a reliability issue associated with the formation of electrically conductive whiskers, emanating from tin finished surface.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe the technical design and verify the technical performance of a new bone conduction implant (BCI) system.

Patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss and single-sided deafness can be rehabilitated by bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA). Whereas the conventional hearing aids transmit sound to the tympanic membrane via air conduction, the BAHA transmits sound via vibrations through the skull directly to the cochlea. It uses a titanium screw that penetrates the skin and needs life-long daily care; it may cause skin infection and redness. The BCI is developed {{as an alternative to}} the percutaneous BAHA since it leaves the skin intact. The BCI comprises an external audio processor with a transmitter coil and an implanted unit called the <b>bridging</b> bone <b>conductor</b> with a receiver coil. Using amplitude modulation of the Class-E power amplifier that drives the inductive link, the sound signal is transmitted to the implant through the intact skin.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of {{the charge}} carriers passing through a molecule <b>bridging</b> two bulky <b>conductors</b> with local vibrational modes of the molecule gives rise to distinct features in the electronic transport properties {{on one hand and}} to nonequilibrium features in the vibrations’ properties, e. g., their population, on the other.

We succinctly summarize parts of our past work related to the signature of the electron-vibration interaction on the full-counting statistics of the current fluctuations (i. e., the cumulant generating-function of the current correlations). In addition, we provide a novel account of the response to an ac field exerted on the junction (on top of the dc bias voltage); in particular, we study the nonequilibrium distribution and the displacement fluctuations of the vibrational modes. Remarkably, we find a behavior pattern that cannot be accounted for by classical forced oscillations. The calculations use the technique of nonequilibrium Green’s functions and treat the electron-vibration coupling in perturbation theory, within the random-phase approximation when required...|$|R
40|$|The {{essential}} {{characteristic of}} controllable fluids is {{their ability to}} change their rheological behaviour under an electrical field. These materials are referred as Electro-Rheological (ER) fluids. An ER fluid {{is a mixture of}} a base fluid, usually some type insulating liquid such as mineral or silicone oil, with suspension particles, such as cornstarch, zeolite, glass bead or cellulose. When there is no electric field, particles are randomly suspended in the base liquid. When an electric field is applied, the particles in the fluid form chains <b>bridging</b> the <b>conductors</b> of opposite polarity and turn the liquid into a solid-like gel. The process is seemingly reversible once the electric field is removed. The process takes place within milliseconds. In this thesis, shear and valve modes of operation are considered for one particular ER fluid from a practically oriented design point of view. Chapter 1 provides background information concerning ER fluids and ER devices in practical applications. Chapter 2 describes a prediction tool for the shear mode of operation based on the Bingham model. The prediction model is based on the (solid to liquid) weight fraction, applied electric field and strain rate. An ER clutch with a single disk was designed, and tested to validate the model. In Chapter 3, an ER valve experiment is presented to relate the force-displacement behaviour with varying applied voltage, weight fraction and other operating conditions (volume flow rate, cyclic frequency and stroke length). A new model for an ER damper in fluctuating flow is also presented in Chapter 4. This new model is a modification of the uniform flow Bingham plastic model. Comparison between the predictions from the model and observations from the experiments is also given in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5, an overview is given of this work’s contribution and future work is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} what adult singers find meaningful about their participation in a volunteer community chorus and to consider the implication of the choral place on participant sense of meaningfulness. The researcher collected data from four adult singers, their family members, and two <b>conductors.</b> <b>Bridging</b> the gap between science and art, the researcher used a qualitative research method called portraiture, wherein narrative portraits are developed and written by a researcher in a descriptive manner providing voice to understanding the phenomenon of interest, to create portraits of four adult singers. Portraiture researchers seek to discover resonant stories within the complicated framework of daily life. Semi-structured interviews with each participant provided data. In addition, adult singers kept personal journals for the researcher, and the researcher observed participant behaviors before, during, and after rehearsals. The researcher implemented axial, focused, and theoretical analysis during data analysis and interpretation to construct a narrative portrait of each participating singer reflecting the emergent patterns and themes.

To achieve this objective, a set of experiments was conducted using matte and bright tin platings on copper, Alloy- 42, and brass metal coupons. The plated coupons were subjected to high temperature exposures, including annealing (at 150 ºC/one hour). Whisker growth on tin-plated samples was characterized using environmental scanning electron microscopy, in terms of the maximum whisker length, length distribution, and whisker density, at different time periods up to 24 months. The experimental results have shown different behaviors of whisker growth (length and density) between bright and matte tin, depending on the materials and exposure conditions. It was experimentally demonstrated that bright tin over brass could be considered a worst-case scenario for assessing the risks associated with tin whiskers. This work has further revealed that the current industry practice of testing for 3000 hours for monitoring the propensity of tin whiskers is insufficient to cover a saturation of whisker density and capture the temporal nature of whiskers. In order to overcome such insufficiencies, the use of time-based distribution data for whisker length and whisker density was proposed as an alternative method for characterizing whisker growth. With the application of this proposed method, the effect of annealing (150 ºC/one hour) and its effect under the presence of electrical current were investigated for retarding whisker formation and growth on tin-plating...|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{whiskers}} {{are tiny}} conductive filaments of zinc typically {{less than a}} few millimeters (mm) long {{and only a few}} thousandths of a millimeter in diameter. They grow from metal surfaces (e. g., steel) that have been electroplated (galvanized) with zinc for corrosion protection. The growth process consists of an unpredictable incubation period (months or perhaps even years) followed by a period of growth at rates as high as 1 mm/year. Zinc whiskers are conductive and therefore they will cause electrical shorts if they manage to <b>bridge</b> tightly-spaced electrical <b>conductors.</b> Now that zinc whisker-induced shorts have been so convincingly demonstrated, some former “seemingly inexplicable ” shorts are now regarded as explainable as having been caused by zinc whiskers. In recent years many computer equipment failures (servers, routers, switches, etc.) ranging from nuisance glitches to catastrophic system failures have been attributed to zinc whiskers. A search of the web shows that the most often reported source for zinc whiskers is the bottom surface of zinc-plated raised (“access”) floor tiles commonly used in computer room construction. Other sources of zinc whiskers include zinc-plated floor supports/rails, computer equipment racks and hardware such as screws, nuts, washers and bus rails. Zinc whisker sources on the underside of floor tiles are a long distance from electronic equipment in floor racks. However, experience demonstrates that whiskers are broken free during floor-bumping activities including construction and maintenance, and become entrained in the air flow used for cooling, and then deposit into the distant electronic equipment, as well as into people's lungs. Sometimes Zinc Whiskers find their way INSIDE equipment cabinets...|$|R
