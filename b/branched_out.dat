5|$|In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater {{built in}} {{what was to be}} the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first {{purpose-built}} Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had <b>branched</b> <b>out</b> to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with an elevator, in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{has also}} <b>branched</b> <b>out</b> into television, and later, internet-based series. His {{first foray into}} the medium was Twin Peaks, {{a joint venture with}} Mark Frost. Twin Peaks became a cult success, leading to Lynch and Frost working {{together}} on a number of other projects, including On the Air, and American Chronicles. In 2002 Lynch began producing two series of shorts released through his official website—the Flash-animated DumbLand, and Rabbits. Having begun acting in his 1972 short The Amputee, Lynch went on to appear on-camera in Twin Peaks, Zelly and Me and Dune. From 2007, Lynch has appeared in a recurring voice role in the animated series The Cleveland Show.|$|E
5|$|Nearby Lincoln has two higher {{education}} institutions, the older being Bishop Grosseteste University, which started life in 1862 {{as a teacher}} training college linked to the Anglican Church. During the 1990s, the college <b>branched</b> <b>out</b> into new subject areas {{with a focus on}} the arts and drama. The larger University of Lincoln began as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside in 1996, when the University of Humberside opened a Lincoln campus next to Brayford Pool. Lincoln Art College and Riseholme Agricultural College, which had previously been part of De Montfort University in Leicester, were absorbed into the university in 2001. The university changed its name to the University of Lincoln in 2002. In the 2005/6 academic year, 8,292full-time undergraduates were studying at the university.|$|E

Notable projects related to Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder with Jason White, The Frustrators with Mike Dirnt, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and {{members of the}} band Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, which the band uses to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a family band called The Boo which recorded a one off Christmas record for their friends and family making a few copies available in a local store.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me in {{many ways}} was a pivotal film for the Bond franchise, and was plagued since its {{conception}} by many problems. The first was the departure of Bond producer Harry Saltzman, who was forced to sell his half of the Bond film franchise in 1975 for £20million. Saltzman had <b>branched</b> <b>out</b> into several other ventures of dubious promise and consequently was struggling through personal financial reversals unrelated to Bond. This was exacerbated by the twin personal tragedies of his wife's terminal cancer {{and many of the}} symptoms of clinical depression in himself.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Oslo had a {{rapid transit}} network that <b>branched</b> <b>out</b> {{north-east}} and north-west {{from the city}} centre. In 1987, the western and eastern network were connected, and through-trains started operating between the two networks from 1993. Plans to make a second connection through the borough of Nordre Aker were launched by politicians in the 1980s. It was argued that this was cheaper than building roads, with the per-kilometre price being {{about a quarter of}} that for motorways. Some politicians also saw the Ring Line as an opportunity to close all parts of the Oslo Tramway, except the Ekeberg- and Lilleaker Line. Oslo Sporveier, the contemporary operator of the metro, started planning the line during the late 1980s. The plans would take advantage of the Gjøvik Line's right-of-way between Storo and Sinsen, while the section from Storo to Tåsen would have to be built in a tunnel.|$|E
