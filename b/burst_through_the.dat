5|$|At 7:45am local time, the ladle in {{question}} {{separated from the}} overhead iron rail that connected it to the blast furnace while it was being positioned over a worktable in preparation to pour out its contents. All 30 tons of liquid steel, which was at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), was spilled. This liquid steel then <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windows and door of an adjoining room five meters away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, the {{temperatures}} {{near the bottom}} of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into steam, boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.|$|E
5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E

25|$|After {{failing to}} make {{progress}} on the flanks – the Dutch on the left, Brigadier Ingolsby's brigade on the right – Cumberland decided to smash {{his way through the}} centre without securing the flanks of his main attack. Despite devastating flanking fire the allied column, made up of British and Hanoverian infantry, <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> French lines to the point of victory. Only when Saxe concentrated all available infantry, cavalry, and artillery was the column forced to yield. The allies retreated in good order, conducting a fighting withdrawal. The battle had shown, however, the strength of a defensive force relying on firepower and a strong reserve.|$|E
25|$|The first {{attack against}} this {{building}} came at 6.30 a.m., barely {{an hour before}} the Yorke Bay amphibious landing, when one of Giachino's squads, led by Lieutenant Gustavo Lugo, started to exchange fire with the British troops inside the house. At the same time, Giachino himself, with four of his subordinates, entered the servants' annexe, believing it to be the rear entrance to the residence. Three Royal Marines, Corporals Mick Sellen and Fleet and Marine Harry Dorey, who were placed to cover the annexe, beat off the first attack. Giachino was hit instantly as he <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door, while Lieutenant Diego Garcia Quiroga was shot in the arm. The remaining three retreated to the maid's quarters.|$|E
25|$|Metastasis in {{ovarian cancer}} {{is very common}} in the abdomen, and occurs via exfoliation, where cancer cells <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ovarian capsule {{and are able to}} move freely {{throughout}} the peritoneal cavity. Ovarian cancer metastases usually grow on the surface of organs rather than the inside; they are also common on the omentum and the peritoneal lining. Cancer cells can also travel through the lymphatic system and metastasize to lymph nodes connected to the ovaries via blood vessels; i.e. the lymph nodes along the infundibulopelvic ligament, the broad ligament, and the round ligament. The most commonly affected groups include the paraaortic, hypogastric, external iliac, obturator, and inguinal lymph nodes. Usually, ovarian cancer does not metastasize to the liver, lung, brain, or kidneys unless it is recurrent disease; this differentiates ovarian cancer from many other forms of cancer.|$|E

25|$|The {{combination}} of {{horizontal and vertical}} motion changes the tilt of the surface. That is, locations farther north rise faster, an effect that becomes apparent in lakes. The bottoms of the lakes gradually tilt away {{from the direction of}} the former ice maximum, such that lake shores on the side of the maximum (typically north) recede and the opposite (southern) shores sink. This causes the formation of new rapids and rivers. For example, Lake Pielinen, which is large (90 x 30km) and oriented perpendicularly to the former ice margin, originally drained through an outlet in the middle of the lake near Nunnanlahti to Lake Höytiäinen. The change of tilt caused Pielinen to <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Uimaharju esker at the southwestern end of the lake, creating a new river (Pielisjoki) that runs to the sea via Lake Pyhäselkä to Lake Saimaa. The effects are similar to that concerning seashores, but occur above sea level. Tilting of land will also affect the flow of water in lakes and rivers in the future, and thus important for water resource management planning.|$|E
25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> front door, and before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards {{in the back of the}} room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E
25|$|As the Prussian {{attack against}} the VI Corps gained momentum, Georges Mouton, Comte de Lobau ordered Durutte to capture the Smohain area. Accordingly, the embattled 4th Division {{commander}} attacked Smohain with the 2nd Brigade and his artillery, while sending the {{two and a half}} battalions that remained of the 1st Brigade against Papelotte. The French infantry overran the farm and immediately began to fortify it. At the close of the day, Karl Friedrich Franziskus von Steinmetz's brigade of Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten's I Prussian Corps arrived at Smohain with 2,500 fresh infantry, followed by 3,300 cavalry. Attacking, they overcame the survivors of Durutte's division and <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> angle of Napoleon's battle line. In the rout that followed, Durutte was chased by Prussian horsemen, receiving one saber slash that nearly cut off his left hand and a second blow that inflicted a severe head wound. After Waterloo, he retired to a property he owned near Ypres in what is now Belgium. He died there on 18 April 1827 after a prolonged illness.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom the 4–4–2 {{formation}} rose {{to prominence}} in the 1960s. The English also developed a tactical formation {{that looked like a}} 4–4–2 (more accurately 4–1–3–2) but switched to 4–2–4 or 4–3–3 depending on how they attacked. The flat back four that had become so popular remained intact, but the midfield was a free-flowing unit with players given license to attack as the scenario saw fit. In defence, using the 1966 World Cup side as an example, Martin Peters, Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball would all stay back to counter the opposition attack. However, in attack they had two options: Peters and Ball could charge forward, creating problems for the opposition out wide with their pace and crossing ability, creating either a 4–2–4 formation or a 3–3–4 formation when one of the full-backs pushed forward; or Charlton could <b>burst</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of the strike partnership of Roger Hunt and Geoff Hurst and overload the centre of the opposition defence in a 4–3–3, providing either an extra man in the box or an effective long-shot alternative. The unsung hero of Alf Ramsey's England side was Nobby Stiles, who was the midfield linchpin, whom the team relied on in defence when Charlton surged forward in support of the strikers.|$|E
