5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the belief systems behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such belief systems are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the <b>birth</b> <b>mother</b> and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her <b>birth</b> <b>mother,</b> she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 08 Prenatal alcohol {{exposure}} {{is the leading}} known cause of preventable lifelong cognitive or behavioral disability. The spectrum of adverse outcomes observed among individuals with prenatal alcohol {{exposure is}} termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASDs) and can range from very mild to the most severe form, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). From 1993 to 1998 the FASD Diagnostic and Prevention Network (FAS DPN) conducted a study to assess the feasibility of using the University of Washington interdisciplinary FAS DPN clinic as a center for identifying and targeting primary prevention intervention to high-risk women (women who {{had given birth to}} a child with FAS, were still fertile, and still drinking regularly). The pilot project demonstrated that 46 % of the patient’s <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> were still fertile and 49 % were still drinking {{at the time of the}} patient’s FASD diagnosis. Of those <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> who were still fertile, 21 % reported that they were still drinking, although all fertile <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> (46 %) are at risk of having a child with prenatal alcohol exposure. The primary aim of this study was to assess the risk status of all <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> whose children received an FASD diagnosis between 1993 - 2012 to identify changes in annual trends among <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> whose children are evaluated at the FAS DPN with the goal of learning how best to target prevention measures to these high-risk women...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{profiles}} {{the lives}} of women in New Zealand, comparing these generalised experiences to emerging adoption law from a feminist perspective. Although this thesis covers adoption's legislative history from its inception, it concentrates on the era of closed adoptions, from 1955 - 1985. This period encompasses a period in adoption history in which women were forced to surrender their children and then silenced and forgotten. This thesis draws on secondary sources and interviews with <b>birth</b> <b>mothers</b> in Christchurch from as long ago as 1940 and from as recently as 1979. Women who gave up their children for adoption were given a 'choice' to adoption or to keep their child. However, the issue in not necessarily one of the <b>birth</b> <b>mother's</b> 'choice', rather it is the conditions under which choices are made. <b>Birth</b> <b>mothers</b> were rendered powerless and invisible by the adoption process. The law' and practice of adoption in New Zealand is examined as a form of social control over <b>birth</b> <b>mothers,</b> the women who gave up their children for adoption. This form of social control is, it is argued, a result of the patriarchal power relations. It is argued that adoption has formed part of population ideology and control, supporting the nuclear family and maintaining the patriarchal status quo...|$|R
