[...] ); according to these sources, these men had begun to pursue <b>bodily</b> <b>interests,</b> and so took wives of the daughters of men, e.g., those who were descended from Cain or from any {{people who did not}} worship God.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Virtual {{agents are}} used to {{interact}} with humans in a myriad of applications. However, the agents often lack the believability necessary to maximize their effectiveness. These agents, or characters, lack personality and emotions, and therefore the capacity to emotionally connect and interact with the human. This deficiency prevents the viewer from identifying with the characters on a personal level. This research explores the possibility of automating {{the expression of a}} character’s mental state through its body language. Using a system that animates a character procedurally, we provide tools to modify the character's body movements in real-time, so that they reflect the character’s mood, personality, <b>interest,</b> <b>bodily</b> pain, and emotions, all of which make up the current mental state of the character. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{argue that}} core aspects of musical rhythm, {{especially}} “groove” and syncopation, {{can only be}} fully understood {{in the context of}} their origins in the participatory social experience of dance. Musical meter is first considered in the context of bodily movement. I then offer an interpretation of the pervasive but somewhat puzzling phenomenon of syncopation in terms of acoustic emphasis on certain offbeat components of the accompanying dance style. The reasons for the historical tendency of many musical styles to divorce themselves from their dance-based roots are also briefly considered. To the extent that musical rhythms only make sense in the context of <b>bodily</b> movement, researchers <b>interested</b> in ecologically valid approaches to music cognition should make a more concerted effort to extend their analyses to dance, particularly if we hope to understand the cognitive constraints underlying rhythmic aspects of music like meter and groove...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} an {{analysis}} of reproductive rights {{in the context of}} future generations yields three insights. First, potential people (who may or may not come into being) do not-by any prevailing approach to morality-have a right to be created by us. They may therefore be ethically 2 ̆ 2 prevented 2 ̆ 2 from coming into existence with what I call the 2 ̆ 2 Offspring Selection Interest 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 OSI 2 ̆ 2). Second, the OSI is often conflated with the distinct reproductive rights interest in protecting one 2 ̆ 7 s body against unwanted intrusion, the 2 ̆ 2 <b>Bodily</b> Integrity <b>Interest</b> 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 BII 2 ̆ 2), with resulting confusion for reproductive rights discourse. And third, once we distinguish the OSI from the BII, we find a surprising amount of agreement, even among present-day abortion opponents, with the premise of abortion rights: that the BII is both weighty and directly implicated in the abortion decision. To find evidence of consensus regarding the OSI, this Article turns to western religious traditions as well as to modern legal rules. To find consensus on the BII, this Article relies on accounts of abortion that animate the pro-choice and pro-life communities within the United States. The goal of the Article is largely descriptive rather than normative: it aims to identify two interests that underlie modern reproductive rights and to demonstrate that both interests are widely accepted by groups that otherwise appear to fall on opposite ends of the reproductive rights spectrum...|$|R
40|$|The current {{investigation}} examined the singular and interactive effects of anxiety sensitivity (AS) and perceived control over anxiety-related {{events in the}} prediction of panic symptoms using a biological challenge paradigm. Two hundred and twenty-nine participants (mage = 21. 02, SD = 7. 55, 124 females) were recruited from the greater Burlington, Vermont community. Results indicated that pre-challenge AS, but not perceived control over anxiety-related events, significantly predicted post-challenge panic attack symptoms, anxiety focused on <b>bodily</b> sensations, and <b>interest</b> in returning for another challenge (behavioral avoidance). There were no interactive effects between AS and perceived control over anxiety-related events. For the physiological measures, pre-challenge AS was predictive of change in skin conductance level (pre-post challenge), and pre-challenge perceived control over anxiety-related events was predictive of change in respiration rate (breathes per minute). No significant effects were evident for heart rate {{and there were no}} significant interactive effects between AS and perceived control over anxiety-related events for any of the physiological variables. Findings of the investigation are discussed in relation to the role of AS and perceive...|$|R
40|$|The article {{proceeds}} {{in three}} main parts. First, it discusses the general case law surrounding customer preferences {{for a particular}} gender, looking at the enactment {{and development of the}} BFOQ defense, particularly in the context of customer preferences. It argues that the courts 2 ̆ 7 general rejection of the customer preference rationale for BFOQs was entirely appropriate, given that these preferences typically reflected malignant gender biases [...] most often, chauvinistic attitudes that result in female subordination. Second, the article examines the rise of the privacy BFOQ. It argues that the courts were correct in recognizing the privacy BFOQ, given the qualitatively different nature of the customer preferences at issue in these cases. It acknowledges that the critical commentary regarding the privacy BFOQ is largely negative, but suggests that these commentators tend to incorrectly assume that customer preferences for same-gender healthcare necessarily derive from unconscious prejudices about “appropriate” gender roles and women 2 ̆ 7 s sexual vulnerability. In making this argument, the article highlights the reasons that actual patients of female OB-GYNs have given for preferring same-gender gynecological care. Moreover, the article argues that courts have not gone far enough in recognizing BFOQs in the healthcare context. In so doing, it identifies cases in which courts explicitly refused to find a gender BFOQ despite the considerable gender-related therapeutic interests implicated by the employment position in question, simply because of their belief that only <b>bodily</b> privacy <b>interests</b> could justify a BFOQ. The article suggests that the privacy BFOQ should be broadened, based on the three criteria described above, to cover a wider range of cases. The article 2 ̆ 7 s final section turns to the specific issues surrounding the male OB-GYN. It analyzes how a discrimination lawsuit brought by a male OB-GYN would likely be addressed under the current doctrine, and then evaluates how the case would be considered under the reformulated BFOQ...|$|R
40|$|The International Convention against Doping in Sport is an {{authentic}} {{turning point for}} those who’s studying Sports Law from a General Theory of Law’s point of view. In fact, before its coming into force, all sporting legal system’s rules, that regulate doping, may be inscribed within those soft law instruments, that today’s globalized society uses as an effective alternative to States’ regulations. After its coming into force, these soft-law rules change nature and become a hard-law command, making them binding rules, authentic jus cogens with legal effects erga omnes: a distinctive feature that until now doesn’t belong to them. Now, all regulations about doping, established within lex sportiva and settled into WADA Code, are introduced in States’ legal systems by traditional legal instruments: soft-law becomes hard-law. This is a problematic change considering, first, the different Grundnorm, upon which are based sports legal system and States’ law, and, then, the intrinsic conventional nature of Sport’s law, certainly not shared by States’ legal systems. This essential difference among Sports law and States’ law points out further questions, especially when Convention comes into force in those nations where doping is a crime, as occurring in France or in Italy. Focusing on Italian legal system, it’s important to underline that the law, by which the Convention comes into force, was adopted without coordination with pre-existing rules about doping: this points out some interesting questions. I’ll consider especially questions deriving from the equivalence, established by art. 2. 3 b) of Convention, among use or attempted use of prohibited substance or prohibited method: may we considering this rule contrasting with the general rule of Italian penal code (art. 56 c. p.), which states a decrease of punishment when it’s carried out an attempted crime?I’ll also focus on questions deriving from the equivalence, established by art. 2. 3 f) of Convention, between possession of prohibited substances or methods and use or presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an athlete’s <b>bodily</b> specimen: what <b>interest</b> is injured, if occurred possession without doping committing? And when occurs this injury...|$|R

The research was conducted in the Campus V Pabelan Study Program Mechanical Engineering Education FKIP UNS. The research was conducted using a quantitative descriptive. Subjects in this study were students of Study Program Mechanical Engineering Education FKIP UNS following courses in the second semester that the practice amounted to 215 students and is divided into four practice courses. Samples were taken with a proportionate stratified random sampling technique as many as 175 students. Techniques of data collection in this study is the documentation, questionnaires, and interviews. The validity of the data using the method of triangulation techniques. Test the validity of the study was conducted based on numerical correlation figures Pearson's Product Moment Correlation with SPSS 15 For Windows. Reliability test of this research using Cronbach Alpha with SPSS 15 For Windows. The method of analysis used a quantitative descriptive analysis. Based on the results of data analysis can be taken a conclusion Factors Contributing to the difficulty of learning is divided into two major lines are a) Internal factors originating from with in the student sare divided into six indicators are physical state, a state of <b>bodily</b> function, intelligence, <b>interest,</b> motivation, and talent. b) External factors that originate from outside of a student include family factors, campus factors, and community factors are divided into ten indicators that concern the elderly, the house, the family's economic situation, lecturers, practice tools, books supporting the practice, the conditions of space workshops, hanging out friends, activities in the community, and neighborhood. However, based on several factors mentioned above the most dominant factor was the cause of learning difficulties of students interests, talents, workshop space conditions, and practices supporting books. This {{can be seen from the}} results of research that proves there are several factors that cause learning difficulties of students in practical courses.
