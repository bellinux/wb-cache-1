25|$|Ehrlichia is a rickettsial {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the family Ehrlichiaceae. There are several species of Ehrlichia, but the one that most commonly affects dogs and causes the most severe clinical signs is Ehrlichia canis. This species infects monocytes in the peripheral blood. The <b>brown</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick,</b> or Rhipicephalus sanguineous, that passes the organism to the dog is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} United States, but most cases tend to occur in the Southwest and Gulf Coast regions where there is a high concentration of the tick.

25|$|Dogs get {{ehrlichiosis}} {{from the}} <b>brown</b> <b>dog</b> <b>tick,</b> which passes an ehrlichia organism {{into the bloodstream}} when it bites. It is also possible for dogs to become infected through a blood transfusion from an infected dog. There are three stages of ehrlichiosis, each varying in severity. The acute stage, occurring several weeks after infection and lasting {{for up to a}} month, can lead to fever and lowered peripheral blood cell counts due to bone marrow suppression. The second stage, called the subclinical phase, has no outward signs and can last {{for the remainder of the}} dog's life, during which the dog remains infected with the organism. Some dogs are able to successfully eliminate the disease during this time. In some dogs the third and most serious stage of infection, the chronic phase, will commence. Very low blood cell counts (pancytopenia), bleeding, bacterial infection, lameness, neurological and ophthalmic disorders, and kidney disease, can result. Chronic ehrlichiosis can be fatal.|$|E

Neem leaf extract (NLE) exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-hyperglycemic, anti-ulcer, immunomodulatory, antiviral, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, nematicidal, anti-malarial, insecticidal, anti-mutagenic and anti-oxidant properties (Biswas et al. 2002; Sharma et al. 2003; Wandscheer et al. 2004; Udeinya et al. 2004; Siddiqui et al. 2004; Subapriya and Nagini 2005; Sithisaran et al. 2005). The Anti-helminthic activity of NLE has also been reported in ruminents (Al-Rofaai et al. 2012). One of the bioactive fractions of neem leaf (nimbolide) has anti-cancer property (Harish Kumar et al. 2010). The apoptosis inducing ability of NLE has been investigated in cancer cells (Dharmalingam et al. 2011).

40|$|Recent {{investigations}} on the sesquiterpene-rich Amyris (Amyris balsamifera L.) and Siam-wood (Fokienia hodginsii L.) {{essential oils}} revealed significant arthropod repellency and toxicity responses. Amyris essential oil {{and one of}} its major components, elemol, were evaluated in laboratory bioassays and identified as effective mosquito repellents, specifically characterized by high levels of contact and minimal spatial repellency. Mosquito responses to catnip (Nepeta cataria L.) essential oil are characterized with high spatial activity, but lack significant contact repellency. Sampling within the staticair bioassay chamber with solid-phase microextraction provided measurements of the relative concentration and distribution of volatiles. These results supported the differences observed in repellency between essential oil treatments. Essential oil mixtures containing both spatial (catnip) and contact (Amyris) repellents were made and showed high levels of residual control via both modes of action. Siam-wood essential oil scored high in both spatial and contact efficacy against mosquitoes. Observations during this study included signs of toxicity. Two of the primary components of Siam-wood essential oil were tested for 24 -hour house fly (Musca domestica L.) topical mortality. Transnerolidol and fokienol were found to possess similar insecticidal activity (topical LD 50 values ranged from 0. 17 - 0. 21 µmol/fly). Amyris essential oil was selected for additional testing with <b>brown</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks</b> (Rhipicephalus sanguineusLatreille) in a 2 ̆ 7 barrier 2 ̆ 7 repellency assay.

40|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks</b> are {{distributed}} world-wide, and their systematics and phylogeny {{are the subject}} of an ongoing debate. The present study evaluates the reproductive compatibility between Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from North America, Israel, and Africa. Female ticks of the parent generation were mated with males from the same and alternate colonies. Every pure and hybrid cohort was maintained separately into the F 2 generation with F 1 females being allowed to mate only with males from the same cohort. The following survival parameters were measured and recorded for every developmental stage: feeding duration and success; engorgement weight, fertility, and fecundity of females; molting and hatching success. Ticks from North American and Mediterranean populations hybridized successfully. The survival parameters of all their hybrid lines were similar to those in pure lines throughout the F 1 generation, and F 1 adults were fully fertile. Parent adult ticks from the African population hybridized with either North American or Mediterranean ticks and produced viable progenies whose survival parameters were also similar to those in pure lines throughout the F 1 generation. However, F 1 adults in the four hybrid lines that included African ancestry were infertile. No parthenogenesis was observed in any pure or hybrid lines as proportion of males in F 1 generation ranged from 40 to 60 %. Phylogenetic analysis of the 12 S rDNA gene sequences placed African ticks into a separate clade from those of the North American or Mediterranean origins. Our results demonstrate that Rh. sanguineus ticks from North America and Israel represent the same species, whereas the African population used in this study is significantly distant and probably represents a different taxon.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the recent wide-spread {{publicity}} given DDT as the miracle insecticide of the war, a flood of popular, semi-popular, and technical articles about the uses of DDT for controlling household pests has appeared. Its extensive use by the military forces in combating malaria-carrying mosquitoes, flies, and other pests is known to almost everyone. With the announcement that limited quantities are available for general use, the average householder is anxious to try the new insecticide. The general release of DDT has created a demand for practical information as to how the average person can use this new insecticide. Our aim is to answer some of the questions asked most commonly about DDT and to give the latest available information about its most efficient use in the home. Knowledge of the practical use of DDT in homes and gardens is still far from complete. Its use in this country is as recent as November 1942. Although large amounts have been used at home and overseas, DDT was restricted and used only for specific purposes by trained personnel under careful supervision. Results of this usage indicate that DDT can be used safely and effectively at home by the average person for certain purposes and under certain conditions.

40|$|Preventing tick bites is a {{fundamental}} step towards reducing the impact of tick-borne protozoal, bacterial and viral diseases (TBDs) in humans and animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a combination of imidacloprid 10 %/permethrin 50 % and of fipronil 10 %/S-methoprene 12 % against ticks in naturally infected dogs and to assess methodological parameters to calculate drug efficacy on tick immature stages. From July to August 2004, 45 privately owned dogs of various sexes, ages, breeds, coat length and habits were enrolled in a trial carried out in an area (radius approximately 50 km) in Southern Italy. Three homogeneous groups (both for <b>dog</b> population and <b>tick</b> population) were formed: 15 dogs treated with imidacloprid 10 % and permethrin 50 % spot-on (group A), 15 dogs treated with fipronil 10 % and methoprene 12 % spot-on (group B) and 15 untreated dogs (group C). The dogs in each group were then sub-grouped according to their age and weight. Two different treatments were administered (time 0 and + 28 days) to groups A and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day + 56 post-treatment (p. t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole body surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at time 0 and at day + 56 p. t., ticks were collected from the dogs and identified. For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up to day + 56 p. t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each infection class was evaluated. All the adult ticks collected were identified as <b>brown</b> <b>dog</b> <b>ticks</b> (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day + 28 p. t [...] The efficacy of both products used in groups A and B on adult ticks was high and generally very similar.
