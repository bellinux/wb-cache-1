40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} assess the effect of cotton dust on {{respiratory}} symptoms and spirometric functions test among cotton textile workers. Patients and Methods: This prospective study was conducted at El-Mahalla Chest Hospital on 115 subjects (100 workers exposed to cotton dust from Misr Company for Spinning and Weaving and 15 healthy subject not exposed to cotton dust). All subjects, were subjected to a standardized questionnaire which was patterned according to American Thoracic Society questionnaire and spirometric functions test [Forced expiratory in the first second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV 1 /FVC ratio, {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) % and maximum midexpiratory flow (MMEF) %]. Results: There was a highly significant statistical difference on comparing presence of respiratory symptoms <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> cotton exposed groups. There was significant statistical difference on comparing the presence of respiratory symptoms <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> weaving, spinning, opening of cotton bales and carding groups. Respiratory symptom was the highest prevalent in spinning and weaving workers. Cough, expectoration and chest tightness were the highest prevalent symptoms in cotton exposed groups.

40|$|In 1925 Fisher {{found that}} the growth of Rous sarcoma was acceralated by adding fibrobalsts into the culture medium of the sarcoma. Takeuchi {{found that the}} rapidly growing tissue of Brown Pearce cancer {{contained}} much mucopolysaccaride and he suggested that mucopolysaccaride had acceralated the tumor growth. On {{the basis of these}} findings, the author has attempted a few experiments as follows: Experiment 1. Chondroitin sulfate was injected into Strong A mice either subcutaneously or intraperitoneally. After this pretreatment, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells were transplanted to the back of mice. The tumor growth was observed until they were killed on the 12 th day after the transplantation. No signigicant difference in the tumor weight was found <b>between</b> the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the <b>group</b> which had been pretreated by the intraperitoneal inlection. A significant difference in the tumor weight, however, was found <b>between</b> the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the <b>group</b> given the subcutaneous pretreatment (P< 0. 01). Experiment 2. By using the same method, some other substances (extracts of L-strain cells and of mouse fetus, and P. V. P.) were studied. No intraperitoneal injection was tried this time. A significant difference in the tumor growth was found <b>between</b> the <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> the <b>group</b> which had been pretreated with the extracts of L-strain cells and mouse fetus, but not <b>between</b> the <b>controls</b> <b>and</b> the <b>group</b> pretreated with P.

40|$|Gonadotropin was {{assessed}} using radioimmunoassay on the rat sera of DMBA-induced breast cancer and tissue obtained from DMBA-induced rat breast cancer. In the above materials, {{there were no significant}} differences in the amount observed <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> nontreated groups, ovariectomized and adrenalectomized animals. After removal of the both ovaries and adrenal glands, the rats were given estradiol followed by lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone. In these treated animals' sera, the level of lutenizing hormone was elevated markedly. Concerning the organ uptake of (125) I-lutenizing and follicle stimulating hormones after their intraperitoneal injections, one found the highest distribution of these hormones in the kidney and liver and in lesser degree, in the DMBA-induced rat breast cancer tissue and ovary...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{observe the}} {{clinical}} application of Desloratadine Citrate Disodium combined with Budesonide suspension {{in patients with}} chronic rhinosinusitis CRS after endoscopic sinus surgery, and analyze the change of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), eosinophils (EOS) and inflammatory factors level in patients. Method: A total of 90 cases of patients with CRS were randomly divided into control group (n= 45) and observation group (n= 45) according to the lottery method. Both groups were treated with endoscopic sinus surgery. On the basis of this, control group was given Budesonide suspension and observation group was treated with Desloratadine Citrate Disodium combined with Budesonide suspension. The change of serum IgE, EOS and inflammatory factors were measured before and after operation in all subjects. Results: There {{was no significant difference}} in IgE and EOS levels <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> observation group before treatment. After treatment, the levels of serum IgE and EOS in the two groups were significantly lower than those before treatment. Moreover, after treatment, observation group was lower than control group, and the difference was significant. There {{was no significant difference in}} inflammatory factors level <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> observation group before treatment. After treatment, the levels of serum IL- 6, IL- 8, TNF-α and hs-CRP were significantly lower than those before treatment. After treatment, observation group was lower than the control group in the same period, the difference was significant. Conclusion: Combined Desloratadine Citrate Disodium treatment for CRS patients on the basis of endoscopic sinus surgery and Budesonide Nasal Spray treatment, it can more effectively reduce serum IgE and EOS levels, decrease the inflammatory response. Therefore it was a potential effective treatment for patients with CRS...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} and compare corneal biomechanical findings measured by ocular response analyzer, topographic and pachymetric findings {{in patients with}} unilateral keratoconus patients and healthy controls. METHODS: This is an observational, case-control study. Patients with keratoconus in one eye and forme fruste keratoconus in the fellow eye were compared with sex and age matched with controls healthy subjects. All subjects were evaluated with rotating scheimpflug imaging system. The receiver-operating-characteristic curves were analyzed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the parameters. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with keratoconus in one eye and forme fruste keratoconus in the fellow eye were compared with 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects. Corneal hysteresis (CH) was 8. 0 ± 1. 7 mm Hg in keratoconus group, 8. 3 ± 1. 6 mm Hg in forme fruste keratoconus group, and 9. 8 ± 1. 6 mm Hg in control groups (P= 0. 54 between keratoconus and forme fruste keratoconus groups, P< 0. 01 <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> other groups). Corneal resistance factor (CRF) was 7. 1 ± 2. 2 mm Hg in keratoconus group, 7. 8 ± 1. 2 mm Hg in forme fruste keratoconus group and 9. 9 ± 1. 5 mm Hg in control group (P< 0. 001 <b>between</b> <b>control</b> <b>group</b> <b>and</b> other groups). Using receiver-operating-characteristic analysis, the area under curve values of the parameters to distinguish forme fruste keratoconus from control subjects were: CH (0. 768), CRF (0. 866). Best cut-off points were 9. 3 mm Hg and 8. 8 mm Hg for CH and CRF respectively. CONCLUSION: Ocular response analyzer parameters (CH and CRF) {{are found to be}} significantly lower in forme fruste keratoconus patients compared to normal control subjects...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effectiveness of gestalt therapy and cognitive -behavioral therapy on assertiveness in middle school students. This study was a pre-post test experimental design. By cluster sampling between schools in Sharyar two schools were selected randomly. After conducting Gambrel and Rigy Questionnaire, 30 students were selected and assigned to three groups randomly. 8 sessions of gestalt therapy were implemented for one <b>group</b> <b>and</b> 8 sessions of cognitive- behavioral therapy were implemented for another <b>group.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>group</b> received no intervention. ANCOVA and Post hoc LSD Test were applied to analyze data. ANCOVA showed significant differences between groups.
