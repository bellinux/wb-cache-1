40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between activities and structures, a 3 D-QSAR study is applied {{to a set of}} 43 molecules <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>triazines.</b> This study was conducted using the principal component analysis (PCA) method, the multiple linear regression method (MLR) and the artificial neural network (ANN). The predicted values of activities are in good agreement with the experimental results. The artificial neural network (ANN) techniques, considering the relevant descriptors obtained from the MLR, showed a correlation coefficient of 0. 9 with an 8 - 3 - 1 ANN model which is a good result. As a result of quantitative structure–activity relationships, we found that the model proposed in this study is constituted of major descriptors used to describe these molecules.

Mater. 2017, DOI: 10. 1002 /adma. 201703399. Design and synthesis of ordered, metal-free layered materials is intrinsically difficult due to the limitations of vapor deposition processes {{that are used in}} their making. Mixed-dimensional (2 D/ 3 D) metal-free van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>triazine</b> (C 3 N 3) linkers grow as large area, transparent yellow-orange membranes on copper surfaces from solution. The membranes have an indirect band gap (Eg,opt = 1. 91 eV, Eg,elec = 1. 84 eV) and are moderately porous (124 m 2 g− 1). The material consists of a crystalline 2 D phase that is fully sp 2 hybridized and provides structural stability, and an amorphous, porous phase with mixed sp 2 –sp hybridization. Interestingly, this 2 D/ 3 D vdW heterostructure grows in a twinned mechanism from a one-pot reaction mixture: unprecedented for metal-free frameworks and a direct consequence of on-catalyst synthesis. Thanks to the efficient type I heterojunction, electron transfer processes are fundamentally improved and hence, the material is capable of metal-free, light-induced hydrogen evolution from water without the need for a noble metal cocatalyst (34 µmol h− 1 g− 1 without Pt). The results highlight that twinned growth mechanisms are observed in the realm of “wet” chemistry, and that they can be used to fabricate otherwise challenging 2 D/ 3 D vdW heterostructures with composite properties...|$|R

40|$|Reactive dyes require high {{concentrations}} of an electrolyte to improve dye-fiber interaction, leading to the discharge of harmful effluent. One approach to reduce this unsafe release is treatment of the cotton fabric with cationic chemical reagents. This paper reports on the treatment of cotton fabric with cationic starch (Q-TAC), a commercial product, by batchwise method and pad batch method {{for the first time}} prior to reactive dyeing process. Furthermore, three commercial reactive dyes, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> monochloro <b>triazine,</b> vinyl sulfone and monochlorotriazine + vinyl sulfone chemistry, was applied on the cotton fabrics by continuous (pad-dry-cure) method. The treated cotton fabric by batchwise method produced 70 % higher color yield (KIS) and 20 % enhanced dye fixation (%F) than the untreated cotton fabric. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis revealed the presence of Nls peaks in the treated cotton fabrics. The crystallinity of treated cotton fabrics was reduced in comparison to untreated cotton fabric as revealed by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) showed that the surface of treated cotton fabrics was rougher than untreated cotton fabric due to the deposition of cationic starch. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrum confirmed the existence of quaternary ammonium groups, N+(CH 3) (3), in the treated cotton fabrics. The analysis of color fastness tests demonstrated good to excellent ratings for treated cotton fabrics. In this way, cationic starch treatment of cotton fabric before reactive dyeing process has been proven potentially a more environmentally sustainable method than conventional dyeing method.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterisation of new spin-transition materials <b>based</b> <b>on</b> tetrazole and <b>triazine</b> chemistry. The thesis is thus divided in two main parts. The first part examines the iron(II) coordination chemistry with bistetrazoles, which are well-known ligands {{in the field of}} spin-crossover research. The central aim is to generate new members of this interesting family of polymeric spin-transition materials <b>based</b> <b>on</b> these ligands, to better assess the structural/coordination features driving the spin-crossover behaviour. An emphasis is therefore given to the analysis of the crystal structures of the various compounds, newly prepared and reported in the literature (both in the high-spin and low-spin states), to be able to evaluate the influence of the various chemical building units on the overall framework. Additionally, the structural changes caused by the spin transition are thoroughly analysed. In the second part, the use of dpyatriz, a triazine-based ligand, as a unit for the construction of spin-transition materials is reported. In the corresponding chapters, the benefit to use triazine chemistry in the field of spin transition is stressed, setting the grounds for future highly promising systems to be developed. Promotor: J.

40|$|The {{cysteine}} protease rhodesain of Trypanosoma brucei parasites causing African {{sleeping sickness}} {{has emerged as}} a target for the development of new drug candidates. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> a <b>triazine</b> nitrile moiety as electrophilic headgroup, optimization studies on the substituents for the S 1, S 2, and S 3 pockets of the enzyme were performed using structure-based design and resulted in inhibitors with inhibition constants in the single-digit nanomolar range. Comprehensive structure-activity relationships clarified the binding preferences of the individual pockets of the active site. The S 1 pocket tolerates various substituents with a preference for flexible and basic side chains. Variation of the S 2 substituent led to high-affinity ligands with inhibition constants down to 2 nM for compounds bearing cyclohexyl substituents. Systematic investigations on the S 3 pocket revealed its potential to achieve high activities with aromatic vectors that undergo stacking interactions with the planar peptide backbone forming part of the pocket. X-ray crystal structure analysis with the structurally related enzyme human cathepsin L confirmed the binding mode of the triazine ligand series as proposed by molecular modeling. Sub-micromolar inhibition of the proliferation of cultured parasites was achieved for ligands decorated with the best substituents identified through the optimization cycles. In cell-based assays, the introduction of a basic side chain on the inhibitors resulted in a 35 -fold increase in antitrypanosomal activity. Finally, bioisosteric imidazopyridine nitriles were studied in order to prevent off-target effects with unselective nucleophiles by decreasing the inherent electrophilicity of the triazine nitrile headgroup. Using this ligand, the stabilization by intramolecular hydrogen bonding of the thioimidate intermediate, formed upon attack of the catalytic cysteine residue, compensates for the lower reactivity of the headgroup. The imidazopyridine nitrile ligand showed excellent stability toward the thiol nucleophile glutathione in a quantitative in vitro assay and fourfold lower cytotoxicity than the parent triazine nitrile...|$|R

40|$|This {{technical}} report describes {{a method to}} use the AGSIM policy model to estimate changes in soil erosion and diesel fuel consumption for tillage that result from agricultural policy changes. This report uses triazine herbicides {{as a case study}} to explain the development of the method and illustrate its use. The method assumes farmers shift their adoption of different tillage systems {{as a result of the}} agricultural policy being examined. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> these shifts in tillage adoption rates, changes in farmer costs, erosion rates, and consumption of diesel fuel for tillage occur. The changes in farm costs are used as input by AGSIM, along with other changes in costs and/or yields due to the agricultural policy being examined. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> these inputs, AGSIM then projects crop acreage and prices, as well as changes in consumer surplus, that would occur as a result of the policy. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> projected crop acreage changes, the method estimates changes in soil erosion and consumption of diesel fuel for tillage, as well as the monetary value of soil erosion changes and the carbon dioxide emission changes resulting from the fuel use changes. As an illustration of the method, this report presents an updated assessment of the benefits of triazine herbicides to the U. S. economy. For the base year of 2009, this assessment finds that triazine herbicides provide total benefits to the U. S. economy of $ 3. 8 to $ 4. 8 billion per year. Because the triazine herbicides increase the total supply of corn and sorghum, which decreases grain prices, most of these benefits accrue to consumers, especially the livestock and ethanol industries that are major users of corn. These consumer benefits are the sum of the benefits flowing to everyone along the supply chain [...] livestock farmers, processors and handlers, distributors, retailers, and final consumers. Triazine herbicides also reduce the use of tillage for crop production and the conversion of land to crop production, which reduces soil erosion from U. S. cropland by 56 to 85 million tons per year. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> these reductions, <b>triazine</b> herbicides provide $ 210 to $ 350 million per year in benefits from reduced soil erosion as part of this total benefit to the U. S. economy. In addition, triazine herbicides reduce consumption of diesel fuel for tillage by 18 to 28 million gallons per year, implying a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions of 180, 000 to 280, 000 metric tons per year. This total benefit of $ 3. 8 to $ 4. 8 billion is a lower bound on the full value of triazine herbicides to the U. S. economy, because several benefits are not accounted for in this assessment. Among the most substantial benefits missing from this assessment are estimates of the resistance management benefits of triazine herbicides for other herbicides and crops, environmental benefits other than reduced soil erosion, and the benefits to crops not modeled by AGSIM (e. g., sweet corn, sugarcane, citrus, grapes, and other fruits and nuts). ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{investigations into}} the synthesis and properties of novel cyclic and acyclic polyhydroxylated amines arising from carbohydrate derivatives or from the union of simpler, achiral molecules by bespoke de novo construction strategies. These compounds were contrived on the premise of being potential inhibitors of sugar processing enzymes. The highly branched and symmetrical polyhydroxylated amines have found utility {{in the construction of}} novel dendritic structures. In studies directed towards the production of acyclic equivalents of nitrogen analogues of monosaccharides it was found that a reductive animation of dihydroxyacetone by ammonium salts with sodium cyanoborohydride gave bis (l, 3 -dihydroxy- iso propyl) amine [BDI] in good yield and high purity. BDI and its diacetonide are hindered nucleophiles but may be further reductively alkylated to form N -alkyl derivatives. BDI is an open chain equivalent of DMDP [2, 5 -dideoxy- 2, 5 -imino-D-mannitol] but neither BDI nor its N -alkyl derivatives showed inhibition of any glycosidase or transferase assayed. BDI may provide an example of an AB 4 dendritic monomer and initial investigation into the chemistry of this novel branching unit and its expedient origins are addressed. The diacetonide of BDI is a hindered nucleophile with masked hydroxyl groups on the periphery. Various symmetrically and non-symmetrically trisubstituted s -triazines have been synthesised embodying bis (l, 3 -dihydroxy- iso propyl) amine as a dendritic monomer to furnish highly branched structures with an array of peripheral primary hydroxyl groups. Controlled stepwise 2, 4, 6 -trifunctionalisation of cyanuric chloride with a series of amines including the novel BDI branching unit has genertated a series of dendritic molecules. The variable temperature proton NMR experiments of such molecules showed them to exhibit restricted rotation in solution. The syntheses of these rotationally restricted tri-functionalised s -triazines and the observation of the variable temperature NMR experiments are presented. In studies towards a three-directional molecule incorporating BDI and <b>based</b> <b>on</b> a <b>triazine</b> nucleus a number of dendrimer prototypes were constructed from novel AB 4 building blocks. The synthesis of a range of eight carbon, nitrogen containing derivatives utilising carbohydrate lactone starting materials is described. Manipulation of the eight carbon lactone derivatives of protected Î±-D-glucoheptono-l, 4 -lactone generated by a Wittig homologation produces a range of novel, highly functionalised precursors containing an Î±,Î²-unsaturated ester functionality and a free hydroxyl at C- 2. An unsuccessful approach that was anticipated to allow access to eight carbon homologues of Î±- and Î²-HNJ from such precursors is described. Formation of the piperidine ring was envisaged to result from the intramolecular 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of the C- 2 azide or from the intramolecular conjugate addition of the tethered nitrogen at C- 2 to the Î±,Î²-unsaturated ester functionality. It is found that displacement of the 2, 3, 4 -all cis 2 - O -triflate derived from aforementioned protected Î±-D-glucoheptono-l, 4 -lactone derivatives with sodium azide in DMF gives rise to a kinetic C- 2 inverted azide, and a thermodynamic azide cis to the side chain, in which the stereochemistry at C- 2 is retained. Additionally an inversion of the C- 2 alcohol is described, thus allowing complete control of the stereochemistry at C- 2 and consequent tailoring of the desired stereochemistry in the piperidine analogues. </p...|$|R
