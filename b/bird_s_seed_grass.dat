30|$|Somewhat surprisingly, plots {{burned with}} high {{severity}} {{that were not}} seeded did not have significantly greater species richness and diversity than high severity burned plots that were seeded. Others have reported decreased native species richness and diversity due {{to the success of}} <b>seeded</b> <b>grass</b> species (Taskey et al. 1989, Sexton 1998). On our plots <b>seeded</b> with native <b>grass,</b> the graminoid cover was dense in the first growing season (up to 80 % canopy cover), likely due to favorable rainfall (Robichaud et al. 2013). Nonetheless, other plant species were able to establish and persist, although with lower percent cover than on plots without <b>grass</b> <b>seeding.</b> Hunter and Omi (2006) found that both post-fire canopy cover and species richness of native plants were lower where <b>seeded</b> <b>grass</b> cover was high in Arizona, USA. Our results were similar, with less species richness and lower forb and shrub cover on the high burn severity seeded plots.|$|R

30|$|The fodder {{producers}} {{cited the}} inability of market outlets to buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times and low prices offered for <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> as their main challenges in the marketing of their produce. Independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders and the bulking and processing agents mainly faced the challenges of poor quality of seeds due to improper post-harvest handling by producers. Such included inadequate drying, immature seeds and seeds mixed with chaff. The independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders experienced delay in payment when organizations bought <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> on contractual terms. The high cost of an independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> trader certificate which is issued by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) was also cited as a challenge.|$|R
30|$|At {{the second}} stage, there are group and {{individual}} fodder farmers who produce and sell <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to various agents along the chain. Other actors involved in <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production included KVDA, RAE Trust and KALRO. The <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production activities {{of these organizations}} not only serve as demonstrations to the local community but also include sale of the produced <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for income. The agents involved in processing {{were found to be}} RAE Trust, KVDA and KALRO which bulk, process and market the <b>grass</b> <b>seeds.</b> The actors involved in marketing included farmers who sell their produce to other farmers, KVDA, RAE Trust and KALRO. In addition, there are independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders who buy the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> from the producers and sell to farmers and various non-governmental organizations. KVDA, KALRO and RAE Trust sell the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to fodder farmers and various organizations in Baringo and other counties such Laikipia, West Pokot and Turkana. The consumers were found to be mainly the residents of Baringo and other counties who buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for planting which entails the establishment of new pastures and reseeding that involves the establishment of pastures in fields previously with pastures.|$|R
30|$|Pastoral {{households}} are increasingly practising fodder production {{in response to}} forage scarcity associated with land degradation, climate variability and change. Understanding the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain {{is a prerequisite for}} developing sustainable fodder production and guiding appropriate out-scaling in the drylands. This study investigated the producers’ perspectives on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production, marketing and challenges faced along the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Marigat Sub-County of Baringo County, Kenya. The results show that the dominant actors were the bulking and processing agents who provided inputs and were a source of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market to the producers. The producers preferred contractual agreements that allowed them to sell their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to markets of their choice. As independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders allowed for seed price negotiation, they were popular amongst the producers and thus handled the most volume of seeds marketed. Drought occurrence, inability of existing outlets to purchase <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times, together with low prices offered for producers’ <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> were found to be among the challenges facing the producers. There is need to strengthen the fodder groups with a possibility of registering them as cooperatives for the purpose of collective bargaining for better <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> prices.|$|R

30|$|In the wet {{season of}} September to December 2013, {{a total of}} 7.42 tonnes of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> were {{produced}} by the interviewed groups and households and only 4.65 tonnes were sold.

Their functions entailed collection of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> from the producers, sorting of the collected seeds from chaff and packaging the seeds for sale. The role played by the bulking and processing agents of sorting the collected seeds from chaff shows that the producers need more training on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> harvesting and handling practices. This may help them fetch better prices for their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> when offered for sale as the quality of the produce will be high.|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, as the non-staple {{traditional}} medicine, {{the research}} level of S. obtusifolia and S. occidentalis is limited. The published papers {{about these two}} species mainly focus on their pharmacological characteristics (Drever et al. 2008; Ju et al. 2010) and chemical structures (Sob et al. 2008; Li et al. 2010). The authenticity of <b>S.</b> obtusifolia <b>seeds</b> is still identified by some traditional methods such as appearance characters or microstructures. The traditional identification methods are largely dependent on subjective experience and feelings, which easily bring confusion in identifying of <b>S.</b> obtusifolia <b>seeds</b> and <b>S.</b> occidentalis <b>seeds.</b> Even more alarming is that improper use of <b>S.</b> occidentalis <b>seeds</b> will cause serious symptoms (Panigrahi et al. 2014; Teles et al. 2015). However, there has no systematic research from the molecular and secondary metabolite levels to identify <b>S.</b> obtusifolia <b>seeds</b> and <b>S.</b> occidentalis <b>seeds.</b> Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} elucidate the similarities and differences between <b>S.</b> obtusifolia <b>seeds</b> and <b>S.</b> occidentalis <b>seeds,</b> establishing a suitable method to distinguish them.|$|R
