5|$|Several {{stars in}} Serpens have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> planets. The brightest, Omega Serpentis, located between Epsilon and Mu, is an orange giant with a planet {{of at least}} 1.7 Jupiter-masses. NN Serpentis, an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary {{consisting}} of a white dwarf and a red dwarf, is very likely to have two planets causing variations {{in the period of}} the eclipses. Although it does not have a planet, the solar analog HD 137510 has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a brown dwarf companion within the brown-dwarf desert.|$|E
5|$|Anticonvulsants {{suppress}} epileptic seizures, {{but they}} neither cure nor prevent {{the development of}} seizure susceptibility. The development of epilepsy (epileptogenesis) {{is a process that}} is poorly understood. A few anticonvulsants (valproate, levetiracetam and benzodiazepines) have shown antiepileptogenic properties in animal models of epileptogenesis. However, no anticonvulsant has ever achieved this in a clinical trial in humans. The ketogenic diet has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> antiepileptogenic properties in rats.|$|E
30|$|During laparoscopy, 9 women <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> endometriosis, which <b>was</b> {{treated with}} laser ablation. Three women <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> endometriomata, which <b>were</b> excised laparoscopically. Another 11 women <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> adhesions that <b>were</b> {{released}} {{at the time}} of laparoscopy. There was one dermoid cyst that required laparotomy.|$|R
50|$|In one study, madder <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{antimicrobial}} {{properties in}} vitro. In one animal study, madder <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> antidiarrheal activity in rats.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on 25 type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and 25 healthy controls. Sixty-four {{percent of the patients}} <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> vitamin D deficiency, 28 % <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> vitamin D insufficiency, and only 8 % of them <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> normal serum vitamin D level.|$|R
5|$|Autism is a {{disorder}} of neural development characterized by {{impaired social interaction}} and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills. People with autism have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strong visual processing skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are well}} known for their strong muscle-relaxing {{properties}} and {{can be useful in}} the treatment of muscle spasms, although tolerance often develops to their muscle relaxant effects. Baclofen or tizanidine are sometimes used as an alternative to benzodiazepines. Tizanidine has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> superior tolerability compared to diazepam and baclofen.|$|E
5|$|If a chest tube {{is already}} in place, various agents may be instilled through the tube to achieve {{chemical}} pleurodesis, such as talc, tetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline. Results of chemical pleurodesis tend to be worse than when using surgical approaches, but talc pleurodesis has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> few negative long-term consequences in younger people.|$|E

50|$|D. A. Heger (2004) {{presented}} {{a performance comparison}} of binary search trees. Treap <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the best average performance, while red-black tree <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the smallest amount of performance variations.|$|R
5|$|Lacking any {{protective}} shell or {{means of}} escape, sponges {{have evolved to}} synthesize a variety of unusual compounds. One such class is the oxidized fatty acid derivatives called oxylipins. Members of this family have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anti-cancer, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. One example isolated from the Okinawan plakortis sponges, plakoridine A, has shown potential as a cytotoxin to murine lymphoma cells.|$|E
5|$|Research by Michael D'Emic et al {{indicates}} that it was among the slowest-growing theropods. Based on studies of the lines of arrested growth in several bones, {{it was found that}} Majungasaurus took twenty years to reach maturity, which may have been a result of the harsh environment in which it lived. However, other abelisaurids have also <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> comparably slow growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{stars in}} Perseus have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{planetary}} systems. V718 Persei {{is a star}} in the young open cluster IC 348 that appears to be periodically eclipsed by a giant planet every 4.7 years. This has been inferred to be an object with a maximum mass of 6 times that of Jupiter and an orbital radius of 3.3 AU.|$|E
50|$|Two of the eighty-two toe bones {{referred}} <b>to</b> Saurornitholestes <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> stress {{fractures in}} the Rothschild and others study mentioned above.

5|$|The {{brightest}} star is the 2.8-magnitude Beta Hydri, also the closest reasonably bright star {{to the south}} celestial pole. Pulsating between magnitude 3.26 and 3.33, Gamma Hydri is a variable red giant 60 times the diameter of our Sun. Lying near it is VW Hydri, {{one of the brightest}} dwarf novae in the heavens. Four star systems in Hydrus have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> exoplanets to date, including HD 10180, which could bear up to nine planetary companions.|$|E
5|$|The five {{brightest}} stars are all reddish in hue. Shading the others at apparent magnitude 3.8 is Alpha Apodis, an orange giant that has around 48 times the diameter and 928 times the luminosity of the Sun. Marginally fainter is Gamma Apodis, another ageing giant star. Delta Apodis {{is a double}} star, the two components of which are 103 arcseconds apart and visible with the naked eye. Two star systems have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{meat and}} blubber of the {{dolphins}} caught has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{high levels of}} mercury, cadmium, the pesticide DDT, and organic contaminants like PCBs. The levels are high enough to pose a health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat at all. Because of the health concerns, the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly.|$|E

5|$|The {{migration}} of many birds in Australia, including honeyeaters, {{has generally been}} described as occurring mainly in response to external environmental stimuli, such as food availability or an influx of water. However, the yellow-faced honeyeater has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a broad range of}} characteristics that are more often associated with Northern Hemisphere migrants. These are an annual cycle of migratory restlessness, seasonally appropriate orientation based on magnetic, solar and polarised light cues, and a migration program based on the magnetic inclination compass.|$|E
5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, has <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> photoreceptors in {{the skin}} of its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E
5|$|The phallotoxins {{consist of}} at least seven compounds, {{all of which have}} seven similar peptide rings. Although they are highly toxic to liver cells, phallotoxins have since <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> little input into the {{destroying}} angel's toxicity as they are not absorbed through the gut. Furthermore, one phallotoxin, phalloidin, is also found in the edible (and sought-after) blusher (Amanita rubescens).|$|E
