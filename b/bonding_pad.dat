40|$|Abstract—During {{manufacture}} of wire bonding in packaged IC products, {{the breaking of}} bond wires and the peeling of <b>bond</b> <b>pads</b> occur frequently. The result is open-circuit failure in IC products. There were several prior methods reported {{to overcome these problems}} by using additional process flows or special materials. In this paper, a layout method is proposed to improve the bond wire reliability in general CMOS processes. By changing the layout patterns of <b>bond</b> <b>pads,</b> the reliability of bond wires on <b>bond</b> <b>pads</b> can be improved. A set of different layout patterns of <b>bond</b> <b>pads</b> has been drawn and fabricated in a 0. 6 - m single-poly triple-metal CMOS process for investigation by the bond wire reliability tests, the ball shear test and the wire pull test. By im-plementing effective layout patterns on <b>bond</b> <b>pads</b> in packaged IC products, not only the bond wire reliability can be improved, but also the <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> capacitance can be reduced for high frequency application.

40|$|The thermo-structural {{analysis}} of ultrasonic wire bonding is performed {{by means of}} 3 D finite element method. A special,focus {{has been placed on}} monitoring the temperature rise during ultrasonic vibration. An equivalent method is used to simulate the wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad,</b> where the large volumes of wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> are effectively reduced to small computational magnitudes. The history of temperature changes in the wire-bond pad-substrate interfaces influenced by varying bond forces and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> sizes is specifically studied. It is shown that the maximum bulk temperature obtained upon completion of ultrasonic vibration is far lower than the melting temperatures of the wire and <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> materials, indicating that the bulk temperature rise due to ultrasonic vibration is not directly responsible for ultrasonic wire bonding. A large <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> size usually leads to a lower temperature rise, and when the pad size reaches a certain value, the effect of <b>bond</b> <b>pad</b> size on temperature rise becomes insignificant. A higher bond force results in a marginally higher temperature rise than a lower bond force, which does not necessarily affect the wire bondability. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|For an {{assessment}} of the stresses occurring during ball bonding of high-voltage CMOS chips in a structure comprising a thin and a thick silicon dioxide layer below the <b>bonding</b> <b>pad,</b> a dynamic model of the process was set up and the materials parameters were calibrated.

To reproduce the final height of the bonding ball, dynamically increased friction between the ball and the <b>bonding</b> <b>pad</b> as well as ultrasonic softening of the metals within the model had to be taken into account. For a more sensitive prediction of failure, the conventional failure criterion based on the ultimate tensile strength of brittle materials was complemented by an additional criterion su ggested by Christensen which takes the combined effects of perpendicular tensile and compressive principle stresses into account. This yielded a prediction of earlier failure for the thinner oxide layer while no failure was predicted for the thick isolation oxide layer...|$|E

40|$|Al wire bonding, {{also called}} {{ultrasonic}} wedge-wedge bonding, is a microwelding process used {{extensively in the}} microelectronics industry for interconnections to integrated circuits. The bonding wire used is a 25 mu m diameter AlSi 1 wire. A friction power model is used to derive the ultrasonic friction power during Al wire bonding. Auxiliary measurements include the current delivered to the ultrasonic transducer, the vibration amplitude of the bonding tool tip in free air, and the ultrasonic force acting on the <b>bonding</b> <b>pad</b> during the bond process. The ultrasonic force measurement is like a signature of the bond as it allows for a detailed insight into mechanisms during various phases of the process. It is measured using piezoresistive force microsensors integrated close to the Al <b>bonding</b> <b>pad</b> (Al-Al process) on a custom made test chip. A clear break-off in the force signal is observed, which {{is followed by a}} relatively constant force for a short duration. A large second harmonic content is observed, describing a nonsymmetric deviation of the signal wave form from the sinusoidal shape. This deviation might be due to the reduced geometrical symmetry of the wedge tool. For bonds made with typical process parameters, several characteristic values used in the friction power model are determined. The ultrasonic compliance of the bonding system is 2. 66 mu m/N.
