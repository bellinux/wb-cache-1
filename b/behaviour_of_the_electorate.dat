50|$|After the 1992 election, most opinion pollsters altered their {{methodology}} to try {{to correct}} for this observed <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate.</b> The methods varied for different companies. Some, including Populus, YouGov and ICM Research, have adopted the tactic of asking their interviewees how they had voted at the previous election, and then assumed that they would vote that way again at a discounted rate. Others weighted their panel so that their past vote was exactly {{in line with the}} actual result of the election. For a time, opinion poll results were published both for unadjusted and adjusted methods. Polling companies have found that telephone and personal interviews are more likely to generate a shy response than automated calling or internet polls.|$|E

Main Topics : Variables Information was collected {{in order to examine}} behaviour under a number of significant headings: Competition between candidates; turnout - and unused votes in multi - seat wards; partizanship - several aspects of party in local elections; personnel - the characteristics of the individuals standing in these areas. The main headings were: the local authority itself: apart from information about the ward system, much behavioural data can be derived from the data about wards and candidates; the individual ward: some of the evidence about the characteristics of the ward is provided directly but much more may be derived from the data about canditures; the individual canditure: ultimately local electoral behaviour rests on the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> towards individual candidates standing in a specific election...|$|E
40|$|Kenya got {{independence}} in 1963 amidst {{a cloud of}} confusion about the ideological and development path she would follow. Such confusion led to an intensive political debate which tended to categorize the contestants into leftists and pro-western rightist. In Muranga District Kaggiah and Kiano represented the two camps respectively, though the latter {{was more interested in}} boosting his personal political hegemonies than in ideological victory. Since independence, therefore, elections in the District tended to revolve around Kiano's political personality. His ouster in 1979 seems to have led to a new type of political development where the very wealthy commercial group of people has taken over political leadership in the District, thus finally replacing the entire 1960 's political leadership in the area. Political negligence and arrogance, as well as inadequate attention to the people's socio-economic needs and demands have been identified as the main factors behind the ouster of several MPs in Muranga and in Kangema particularly. The dominance of elite interests in an election has great influence on both the attitude and <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate</b> towards the incumbent and his challengers, the party and the government, and the efficacy of elections in influencing governmental policy...|$|E
40|$|In 1990, {{according}} to polls, 7 out of 10 citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were against ethnic parties. Yet, 75 % of voters ended up voting for one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three main ethno-nationalist parties. In no other post-communist country, including other former Yugoslav republics, did ethnic parties receive such large {{support in the}} first democratic elections. In Croatia, for example, in the 1990 elections the Croatian ethnic party Hrvatska demokratska zajednica gathered 42 % and the Serb ethnic party Srpska demokratska stranka gathered only 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vote. Were Bosnians and Herzegovinians already that much ethno-nationalistically oriented in 1990 ? The article rejects this thesis and purports to explain <b>the</b> voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian <b>electorate</b> by using <b>the</b> prisoner’s dilemma theoretical framework.

According {{to the first}} hypothesis, federal transfers to regions correlate with recent voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> regional <b>electorates.</b> <b>The</b> second hypothesis states that transfers are higher in regions with politically powerful governors.

40|$|When {{explaining}} electoral behaviour, cleavage {{theory with}} its practical consequences constitutes a traditional question in established Western democracies, but is just emerging in post-socialist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The general {{objective of this}} study is to identify the spatial patterns of election results and inter-electoral shifts in support of politico-ideological blocs (measured by distribution of mandates, gained by parties at 2009 and 2013 regional elections) at the level of self-governing regions of Slovakia, and evaluate the impact of socio-political cleavages that these territorial discrepancies within the country are caused by. Elections for regional self-government held in Slovakia in 2013 are properly evaluated, when a total of 408 regional MPs were delegated to parliaments of eight NUTS 3 level regions. Spatial patterns of numbers and inter-electoral changes of the mandates gained by individual political blocs representing the right wing, etatist stream, parties of ethnic orientation, so-called ‘Slovak coalition’ and independent candidates are displayed not only at the regional scale, but also at the hierarchically lower level of election districts (with 90 territorial units). For regional elections, socio-economic and ethnic cleavages are considered the most important determinants of spatial differentiation related to the voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> and then distribution of power in regional politics, but the phenomenon of independent candidates has the potential to compete with their explanatory value increasingly...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} do and could e-tools {{contribute}} to a democracy like Switzerland? This paper puts forward experiences and visions concerning <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> e-tools for <b>the</b> most traditional democratic processes- elections and, of special importance in Switzerland, direct-democratic votes. Having <b>the</b> particular voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swiss <b>electorate</b> in mind (low voter turnout - especially among the youngest age group, low political knowledge, etc.) we believe that e-tools which provide information in <b>the</b> forefront <b>of</b> elections or direct-democratic votes offer an enormous service to the voter. As soon as e-voting will be possible in Switzerland (as planned by the government), those e-tools for gathering information online will become indispensable and will gain power enormously. Therefore political scientists should not only focus on potential effects of e-voting itself but rather on <b>the</b> combination <b>of</b> (connected) e-tools <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-voting and the voting sphere. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Switzerland, we argue in this paper, <b>the</b> offer <b>of</b> VAAs such as smartvote for elections and direct-democratic votes can provide the voter with more balanced and qualitatively higher information and thereby make a valuable contribution to the Swiss democracy...|$|R

40|$|Democracy {{purports to}} {{accurately}} reflect <b>the</b> choices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general public. It is justly {{credited with the}} creation and expansion of modern mechanisms of redistribution. Yet, in recent decades {{it appears to have}} become more of an inhibitor than a catalyst in <b>the</b> pursuit <b>of</b> an equitable society. Those treated most unequally were not bystanders. Both in Britain and Israel, roughly two fifths of them did not support <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> welfare state. This thesis shows their engagement with politics was often different than others. It observes the dynamics in a three-force triangle consisting of poor people, democracy and the welfare state. Even though historically this Triangle fuelled the movement towards progressive redistribution, the findings suggest it is no longer the pivotal engine to mitigate market inequalities. <b>The</b> principal beneficiaries <b>of</b> welfare appear to be incapable of mobilising democracy to expand it. The research indicates that poor people were alarmingly uncommitted to democracy and/or the welfare state. Although these institutions underpinned their social and political rights, many barely recognised how they serve their interests. In addition, the poor could not identify themselves as a collective, were more vulnerable to fallacies, emotions and traditions, and tended to prioritise other policy domains. This thesis challenges <b>the</b> operational definitions <b>of</b> political exclusion and illuminates the need to scrutinise and theorise <b>the</b> political <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underprivileged <b>electorate.</b> Policy-wise, a new strategy is required to revive relationships between poor people, democracies and welfare states.

40|$|<b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} Is {{to paint a}} {{comprehensive}} picture of electoral politics {{during a period of}} significant historical change. By focusing on a small, open, two- member borough, it is hoped that an evaluation can be made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various developments which took place in the English electoral system between <b>the</b> Reform Act <b>of</b> 1832 and <b>the</b> Redistribution Act <b>of</b> 1885. In order to achieve this, It was decided to examine five different aspects of Berwick's parliamentary representation during these years, namely, the candidates, the electors, election procedure, election Issues and electoral corruption. At the same time It was necessary to refer to other Investigations Into electoral politics, so that the Berwick experience could be placed in a national context. Chapter 1 takes account of recent work on electoral history and considers some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methodological and conceptual problems Involved In <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> nineteenth-century electoral politics. Chapter 2 traces <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political press in the Victorian era and suggests that, despite <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> political bias, newspapers can provide the historian with valuable Insights Into <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> nineteenth-century electoral politics. Chapter 3 discusses the selection procedure for parliamentary candidates and examines the personal qualities that were considered desirable In a candidate. It then attempts to analyse {{the extent to which these}} qualities contributed to <b>the</b> electoral success <b>of</b> a candidate. Chapter 4 examines the nature and voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Berwick <b>electorate</b> between 1832 and 1874. With <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> poll books, which recorded the way In which Individual electors voted, It is possible to discover useful Information on such features as the size and occupational composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>electorate,</b> electoral participation, <b>the</b> voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> occupational categories, cross-party voting, voting consistency and <b>the</b> voting preferences <b>of</b> freemen and ten-pound householders. Chapter 5 examines <b>the</b> ceremonial aspects <b>of</b> elections, beginning with <b>the</b> registration <b>of</b> voters and ending with the post-election entertainments. Elections were a major event In <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> community, involving electors and non-electors alike. However, by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period electoral procedure had become less ritualistic, and the part played by the disfranchised had been severely restricted.
