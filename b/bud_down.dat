He warned Greaser and Herky to keep close watch over Dick and me. Then he rode away. Dick and I resumed our talk about forestry, and as we were {{separated}} by the length of the cave it was necessary to speak loud. So our captors heard every word we said.|$|E

Further weakening ensued over the next 24 hours, and Bud degenerated into a remnant low early on May 26. Late on May 26, the remnant low of Hurricane Bud dissipated completely.|$|R
60|$|By-and-by Bill and Herky-Jerky {{left the}} camp. I heard Herky tell Greaser {{to keep his}} eye on the stew-pots, and it {{occurred}} to me that Greaser had better keep his eye on Ken Ward.

As usual, he was smoking, and appeared listless, but he still held on to the lasso.|$|R
5000|$|Typically, {{the end of}} a shoot {{contains}} an apical bud, which is the location where shoot growth occurs. The apical bud produces an auxin (IAA) that inhibits growth of the lateral <b>buds</b> further <b>down</b> on the stem towards the axillary bud. It was first discovered that the plant hormone auxin likely regulates apical dominance in 1934. Auxin is predominantly produced in the growing shoot apex and is transported throughout the plant via the phloem and diffuses into lateral buds which prevents elongation.|$|R

5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both <b>bud</b> and split <b>down</b> the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally just above the base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|R
5000|$|Cytokinins are {{involved}} in many plant processes, including cell division and shoot and root morphogenesis. They are known to regulate axillary bud growth and apical dominance. The [...] "direct inhibition hypothesis" [...] posits that these effects result from the cytokinin to auxin ratio. This theory states that auxin from apical <b>buds</b> travels <b>down</b> shoots to inhibit axiliary bud growth. This promotes shoot growth, and restricts lateral branching. Cytokinin moves from the roots into the shoots, eventually signaling lateral bud growth. Simple experiments support this theory. When the apical bud is removed, the axillary buds are uninhibited, lateral growth increases, and plants become bushier. Applying auxin to the cut stem again inhibits lateral dominance.|$|R

60|$|The birds flew away; and <b>Bud</b> settled <b>down</b> {{as one of}} the family, making herself so {{pleasant}} {{that all}} loved her and willingly crowded together to make room for her in the nest. The mother brooded over her at night, and made her fresh gowns every day when the old ones withered up; the father brought her dew to wash in and to drink, and flew far and wide to find ripe berries for her to eat; while the young birds were never tired of hearing her sing, watching her dance {{on the edge of the}} nest, or learning the pretty plays she taught them. Every one was very kind and waited patiently to see what would come. But when at last the little birds flew away, the parents wanted to go with them, and did not like to leave Bud all alone.|$|R
5000|$|On May 12, a low {{pressure}} system formed {{just south of}} eastern Panama. The storm slowly organized as it moved westwards. On May 15, the storm acquired a burst of convection, and the NHC began to monitor the system. As the storm turned west-northwestwards, it organized significantly. On May 17, wind shear began to erode the storm's convection, weakening the system and causing it to stall, although the system continued to persist. On May 20, the storm strengthened rapidly, as it began moving again and that night the NHC reported that the storm had strengthened into Tropical Depression Two-E. Then, as it slightly accelerated to the west, the storm continued to organize, eventually intensifying into Tropical Storm Bud on May 22, with 40 mph (65 km/h) sustained winds. Bud remained at this intensity for one day before strengthening, starting early on May 23, and reached winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) during the afternoon. By the next morning, Bud continued its rapid intensification, reaching sustained winds of 85 mph (145 km/h), and then 110 mph (175 km/h) by the afternoon, as the system turned northward. Later on the same day, Bud turned to the northeast, and began to approach the coast of Western Mexico. Late on May 24, Bud intensified further into a Category 3 major hurricane, and obtained a peak intensity of 115 mph (185 km/h) winds, with a minimum central {{low pressure}} of 961 millibars. Hurricane Bud was able to maintain Category 3 intensity {{for the next several}} hours, even as its outer rainbands began moving onshore in Western Mexico. Early on May 25, Hurricane <b>Bud</b> weakened <b>down</b> to a strong Category 2 hurricane. Hurricane Bud rapidly began to weaken, as it slowly moved onshore.

During the mid-afternoon of May 25, <b>Bud</b> weakened <b>down</b> to a strong tropical storm, as it began making landfall on Western Mexico. Further weakening ensued over the next 24 hours, and Bud degenerated into a remnant low early on May 26.|$|R

50|$|Not {{all plants}} produce {{indeterminate}} inflorescences however; some produce a definite terminal flower that terminates {{the development of}} new buds towards the tip of that inflorescence. In most species that produce a determinate inflorescence in this way, all of the flower buds are formed before the first ones begin to open, and all open more or less at the same time. In some species with determinate inflorescences however, the terminal flower blooms first, which stops the elongation of the main axis, but side <b>buds</b> develop lower <b>down.</b> One type of example is Dianthus another type is exemplified by Allium and yet others by Daucus.|$|R
5000|$|Auxins are {{compounds}} that positively influence cell enlargement, bud formation and root initiation. They also promote {{the production of}} other hormones and in conjunction with cytokinins, they control the growth of stems, roots, and fruits, and convert stems into flowers. [...] Auxins were the first class of growth regulators discovered. They affect cell elongation by altering cell wall plasticity. They stimulate cambium, a subtype of meristem cells, to divide and in stems cause secondary xylem to differentiate. Auxins act to inhibit the growth of <b>buds</b> lower <b>down</b> the stems (apical dominance), and also to promote lateral and adventitious root development and growth. Leaf abscission is initiated by the growing point of a plant ceasing to produce auxins. Auxins in seeds regulate specific protein synthesis, as they develop within the flower after pollination, causing the flower to develop a fruit to contain the developing seeds. Auxins are toxic to plants in large concentrations; they are most toxic to dicots and less so to monocots. Because of this property, synthetic auxin herbicides including 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T have been developed and used for weed control. Auxins, especially 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), are also commonly applied to stimulate root growth when taking cuttings of plants. The most common auxin found in plants is indole-3-acetic acid or IAA. The correlation of auxins and cytokinins in the plants is a constant (A/C = const.).|$|R

40|$|Trehalose 6 -phosphate (Tre 6 P) is {{a signal}} of sucrose {{availability}} in plants, and has been implicated in regulation of shoot branching by the abnormal branching phenotypes of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and maize (Zea mays) mutants with altered Tre 6 P metabolism. Decapitation of garden pea (Pisum sativum) plants has been proposed to release the dormancy of axillary <b>buds</b> lower <b>down</b> the stem due to changes in sucrose supply, and we hypothesized that this response is mediated by Tre 6 P. Decapitation led to a rapid and sustained rise in Tre 6 P levels in axillary buds, coinciding {{with the onset of}} bud outgrowth. This response was suppressed by simultaneous defoliation that restricts the supply of sucrose to axillary buds in decapitated plants. Decapitation also led to a rise in amino acid levels in buds, but a fall in phosphoenolpyruvate and 2 -oxoglutarate. Supplying sucrose to stem node explants in vitro triggered a concentration-dependent increase in the Tre 6 P content of the buds that was highly correlated with their rate of outgrowth. These data show that changes in bud Tre 6 P levels are correlated with initiation of bud outgrowth following decapitation, suggesting that Tre 6 P is involved in the release of bud dormancy by sucrose. Tre 6 P might also be linked to a reconfiguration of carbon and nitrogen metabolism to support the subsequent growth of the bud into a new shoot. This article is protected by copyright.

40|$|In viticulture, {{there are}} several {{applications}} where bud detection in vineyard images is a necessary task, susceptible of being automated {{through the use of}} computer vision methods. A common and effective family of visual detection algorithms are the scanning-window type, that slide a (usually) fixed size window along the original image, classifying each resulting windowed-patch as containing or not containing the target object. The simplicity of these algorithms finds its most challenging aspect in the classification stage. Interested in grapevine buds detection in natural field conditions, this paper presents a classification method for images of grapevine buds ranging 100 to 1600 pixels in diameter, captured in outdoor, under natural field conditions, in winter (i. e., no grape bunches, very few leaves, and dormant buds), without artificial background, and with minimum equipment requirements. The proposed method uses well-known computer vision technologies: Scale-Invariant Feature Transform for calculating low-level features, Bag of Features for building an image descriptor, and Support Vector Machines for training a classifier. When evaluated over images containing buds of at least 100 pixels in diameter, the approach achieves a recall higher than 0. 9 and a precision of 0. 86 over all windowed-patches covering the whole <b>bud</b> and <b>down</b> to 60 % of it, and scaled up to window patches containing a proportion of 20 %- 80 % of bud versus background pixels. This robustness on the position and size of the window demonstrates its viability for use as the classification stage in a scanning-window detection algorithms.

40|$|Oligosaccharide {{synthesis}} is {{an important}} cryoprotection strategy used by woody plants during winter dormancy. At the onset of autumn, starch stored in the stem and <b>buds</b> is broken <b>down</b> {{in response to the}} shorter days and lower temperatures resulting in the buildup of oligosaccharides. Given that the enzyme DSP 4 is necessary for diurnal starch degradation in Arabidopsis leaves, {{this study was designed to}} address the role of DSP 4 in this seasonal process in Castanea sativa Mill. The expression pattern of the CsDSP 4 gene in cells of the chestnut stem was found to parallel starch catabolism. In this organ, DSP 4 protein levels started to rise at the start of autumn and elevated levels persisted until the onset of spring. In addition, expo-sure of chestnut plantlets to 4 °C induced the expression of the CsDSP 4 gene. In dormant trees or cold-stressed plant-lets, the CsDSP 4 protein was immunolocalized both in the amyloplast stroma and nucleus of stem cells, whereas in the conditions of vegetative growth, immunofluorescence was only detected in the nucleus. The studies indicate a potential role for DSP 4 in starch degradation and cold acclimation following low temperature exposure during activity-dormancy transition.

40|$|The {{identification}} of protein-protein as {{emerged as a}} powerful tool to characterize biological systems. In budding yeast in particular, systematic mapping of protein-protein interactions for most open reading frames drastically improve our understanding of this model organisms. Still, some classes of proteins, such as DNA binding proteins, remain poorly studied {{due to a lack}} of proper tools for their study. In this thesis, I describe the development of a novel affinity purification approach for the characterization of DNA binding proteins and of their associated proteins. The modified chromatin immunopurification (mChIP) approach consist of a single affinity purification step whereby chromatin-bound protein networks are isolated from mildly sonicated and gently clarified cellular extracts using magnetic beads coated with antibodies. The mChIP method was characterized in details demonstrating significant gain in sensitivity toward the determination of DNA binding protein interactome. Moreover, I showed that mChIP purification were successful for multiple class of proteins including numerous non-histone DNA binding proteins. Following the successful development of the mChIP method, I embarked on a large-scale characterization of chromatin associated proteins in budding yeast. In this way, 102 different DNA binding proteins were characterized by mChIP to determine their chromatin associated protein networks. This effort resulted in the detection of 3576 high confidence protein associations with 724 distinct preys. Approximately 75 % of the baits had significantly improved interaction coverage using mChIP compared to the classical affinity purification methodologies. I also utilized the mChIP approach to perform targeted study of histone chaperones and unravel their interconnection. In summary, the mChIP method that I developed now makes it possible to systematically study chromatin associated proteins in <b>budding</b> yeast, breaking <b>down</b> a technical barrier that existed in the field of chromatin research for too long...|$|R
60|$|The {{second time}} I went to Blois I took a {{carriage}} for Chambord, {{and came back}} by the Chateau de Cheverny and the forest of Russy, - a charming little expedition, to which {{the beauty of the}} afternoon (the finest in a rainy season that was spotted with bright days) contributed not a little. To go to Chambord, you cross the Loire, leave it on one side, and strike away through a country in which salient features be- come less and less numerous, and which at last has no other quality than a look of intense, and peculiar rurality, - the characteristic, even when it is not the charm, of so much of the landscape of France. This is not the appearance of wildness, for it goes with great cultivation; it is simply the presence of the delving, drudging, economizing peasant. But it is a deep, unrelieved rusticity. It is a peasant's landscape; not, as in England, a landlord's. On the way to Cham- bord you enter the flat and sandy Sologne. The wide horizon opens out like a great potager, without inter- ruptions, without an eminence, with here and there a long, low stretch of wood. There is an absence of hedges, fences, signs of property; everything is ab- sorbed in the general flatness, - the patches of vine- yard, the scattered cottages, the villages, the children (planted and staring and almost always pretty), the women in the fields, the white caps, the faded blouses, the big sabots. At the end of an hour's drive (they assure you at Blois that even with two horses you will spend double that time), I passed through a sort of gap in a wall, which does duty as the gateway of the domain of an exiled pretender. I drove along a straight avenue, through a disfeatured park, - the park of Chambord has twenty-one miles of circumference, - a very sandy, scrubby, melancholy plantation, in which the timber must have been cut many times over and is to-day a mere tangle of brushwood. Here, as in so many spots in France, the traveller perceives that he is in a land of revolutoins. Nevertheless, its great ex- tent and the long perspective of its avenues give this desolate boskage a certain majesty; just as its shabbi- ness places it in agreement with one of the strongest impressions of the chateau. You follow one of these long perspectives a proportionate time, and at last you see the chimneys and pinnacles of Chambord rise ap- parently out of the ground. The filling-in of the wide moats that formerly surrounded it has, in vulgar par- lance, let it <b>down,</b> <b>bud</b> given it an appearance of top- heaviness that {{is at the same time}} a magnificent Orien- talism. The towers, the turrets, the cupolas, the gables, the lanterns, the chimneys, look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building. You emerge from the avenue and find yourself at the foot of an enormous fantastic mass. Chambord has a strange mixture of society and solitude. A little village clusters within view of its stately windows, and a couple of inns near by offer entertainment to pilgrims. These things, of course, are incidents of the political pro- scription which hangs its thick veil over the place. Chambord is truly royal, - royal in its great scale, its grand air, its indifference to common considerations. If a cat may look at a king, a palace may lock at a tavern. I enjoyed my visit to this extraordinary struc- ture as much as if I had been a legitimist; and indeed there is something interesting in any monument of a great system, any bold presentation of a tradition.|$|R
