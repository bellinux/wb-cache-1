40|$|The use of {{vegetation}} to block shortwave radiation can reduce cooling loads in hot climates. From July 22 nd, 1989 to October 7, 1989, this study, using shade cloth to simulate vegetative canopies, compared the electricity used for air conditioning between quarter-scale models. The treatments were: (1) canopies {{of the same}} density on east, west, and/or south walls, (2) wall canopies versus roof canopies of the same density, (3) wall canopies of different densities, and (4) roof canopies of different densities. Although the savings in electricity in any treatment was usually less than 11 %, the results showed: dense canopies gave <b>better</b> savings <b>than</b> medium canopies, which, in turn, gave <b>better</b> savings <b>than</b> the least dense canopies; wall canopies gave <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> a roof canopy; an east wall canopy gave <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> a west wall canopy; and shading all walls except the north gave <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> shading only {{the east and west}} wall...|$|R
30|$|In {{relation}} to the ML- 100 k database, we observed that the term-based approaches produced <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> those produced by the aspect-based approaches.

As it can be seen, both techniques based on machine learning presented <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> their heuristic counterpart. The hierarchy aspects, even though performing similarly to the actor metadata baseline, is statistically superior than the heuristic aspects approach. The classification terms approach presents <b>better</b> results <b>than</b> the heuristic approach at k={ 20, 40, 60 }, but these values are not statistically significant.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effect of the learning models on achievement viewed from creative thinking abilities (CTA) of the students. The learning models compared were PBL, TGT and direct instruction (DI). The type of the research was quasi-experimental research with 3 x 3 factorial design. The population of this research was the students in grade X senior high school in Purbalingga on academic year of 2014 / 2015. The size of the sample was 277 students, which was taken by using stratified cluster random sampling technique. The instruments used for data collection were creative thinking test and achievement test. The hypothesis test used unbalanced two ways analysis of variance. The results of the research were as follows. (1) PBL gave <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> TGT and DI. TGT gave <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> DI. (2) The students with high and medium CTA had <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> the students with low CTA. The students with medium CTA had <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> the students with low CTA. (3) In PBL, the students with high CTA had <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> medium and low CTA, the students with medium and low had the same achievement. In TGT, the students with high and medium CTA had the same achievement, the students with high CTA had <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> low CTA, the students with medium and low CTA had the same achievement. In DI, the students with high, medium and low CTA had the same achievement. (4) At the students with high CTA, PBL and TGT gave the same achievement. PBL and TGT gave <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> DI. At the students with medium CTA, PBL and TGT gave the same achievement, PBL gave <b>better</b> achievement <b>than</b> DI, TGT and DI gave the same achievement.
