40|$|To date, {{stem cell}} therapy for the <b>bladder</b> has been {{conducted}} mainly on an experimental basis {{in the areas of}} <b>bladder</b> dysfunction. The therapeutic efficacy of stem cells was originally thought to be derived from their ability to differentiate into various cell types. Studies about stem cell therapy for <b>bladder</b> dysfunction have been limited to an experimental basis and have been less focused than <b>bladder</b> regeneration. <b>Bladder</b> dysfunction was listed in MESH as “urinary <b>bladder</b> neck obstruction”, “urinary <b>bladder,</b> overactive”, and “urinary <b>bladder,</b> neurogenic”. Using those keywords, several articles were searched and studied. The <b>bladder</b> dysfunction model includes <b>bladder</b> outlet obstruction, cryoinjured, diabetes, ischemia, and spinal cord injury. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs), bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs), and skeletal muscle derived stem cells (SkMSCs) are used for transplantation to treat <b>bladder</b> dysfunction.

5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to resolve a century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim <b>bladders,</b> which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage <b>bladders,</b> releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a heater used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the <b>bladders</b> through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and tail end of the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried <b>bladders</b> for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the gas content is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim <b>bladders</b> appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E
5|$|The makeup for the Trill host {{featured}} a separate nose and forehead pieces, as the {{intention was to}} retain the general look of a human. Air <b>bladders</b> were placed inside a fake abdomen to create the shot in which the symbiont appeared to move under the host's skin. A second fake abdomen was created for the surgery scene in which the symbiont is moved into Riker, which worked by having a crew member lie under the surgery table, pulling the symbiont into the opening using a concealed string. The design of the symbiont {{was based on a}} caterpillar with an octopus for a head, which {{featured a}} further air bladder in order to give the appearance that it was pulsating and painted in fluorescent paint to glow when a black light was shone on it during that scene.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bladder</b> {{augmentation}} is {{a surgical}} alteration of the urinary <b>bladder.</b> It involves removing strips of tissue from the intestinal tract and adding {{this to the}} tissue of the <b>bladder.</b> This has two intended results: increased <b>bladder</b> volume; and a reduced percentage of the <b>bladder</b> involved in contraction, that in turn results in lower internal pressures in the <b>bladder</b> during urination.|$|R

5|$|The {{vertebral}} column in bowfin is ossified and {{in comparison to}} earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the {{vertebral column}} allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a homocercal tail, {{which means that the}} tail has equal lobes that appear symmetrical.This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas <b>bladders,</b> because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air <b>bladders</b> under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose head would blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
5|$|The lung/swim bladder {{originated}} as {{an outgrowth}} of the gut, forming a gas-filled bladder above the digestive system. In its primitive form, the air bladder was open to the alimentary canal, a condition called physostome and still found in many fish. The primary function is not entirely certain. One consideration is buoyancy. The heavy scale armour of the early bony fishes would certainly weigh the animals down. In cartilaginous fishes, lacking a swim bladder, the open sea sharks need to swim constantly to avoid sinking into the depths, the pectoral fins providing lift. Another factor is oxygen consumption. Ambient oxygen was relatively low in the early Devonian, possibly about half of modern values. Per unit volume, there is much more oxygen in air than in water, and vertebrates are active animals with a high energy requirement compared to invertebrates of similar sizes. The Devonian saw increasing oxygen levels which opened up new ecological niches by allowing groups able to exploit the additional oxygen to develop into active, large-bodied animals. Particularly in tropical swampland habitats, atmospheric oxygen is much more stable, and may have prompted a reliance of lungs rather than gills for primary oxygen uptake. In the end, both buoyancy and breathing may have been important, and some modern physostome fishes do indeed use their <b>bladders</b> for both.|$|E
40|$|Hyperexcitability of C-fiber <b>bladder</b> afferent {{pathways}} {{has been}} proposed to contribute to urinary frequency and <b>bladder</b> pain in chronic <b>bladder</b> inflammation including interstitial cystitis. However, the detailed mechanisms inducing afferent hyperexcitability after <b>bladder</b> inflammation are not fully understood. Thus, we investigated changes in the properties of <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons in rats with <b>bladder</b> inflammation induced by intravesical application of hydrochloric acid. Eight days after the treatment, <b>bladder</b> function and <b>bladder</b> sensation were analyzed using cystometry and an electrodiagnostic device of sensory function (Neurometer), respectively. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings and immunohistochemical staining were also performed in dissociated <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons identified by a retrograde tracing dye, Fast Blue, injected into the <b>bladder</b> wall. Cystitis rats showed urinary frequency that was inhibited by pretreatment with capsaicin and <b>bladder</b> hyperalgesia mediated by C-fibers. Capsaicin-sensitive <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons from sham rats exhibited high thresholds for spike activation and a phasic firing pattern, whereas those from cystitis rats showed lower thresholds for spike activation and a tonic firing pattern. Transient A-type K+ current density in capsaicin-sensitive <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons was significantly smaller in cystitis rats than in sham rats, although sustained delayed-rectifier K+ current density was not altered after cystitis. The expression of voltage-gated K+ Kv 1. 4 α-subunits, which can form A-type K+ channels, was reduced in <b>bladder</b> afferent neurons from cystitis rats. These data suggest that <b>bladder</b> inflammation increases <b>bladder</b> afferent neuron excitability by decreasing expression of Kv 1. 4 α-subunits. Similar changes in capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber afferent terminals may contribute to <b>bladder</b> hyperactivity and hyperalgesia due to acid-induced <b>bladder</b> inflammation...|$|R

40|$|The <b>bladder</b> is {{a hollow}} organ {{in the lower}} part of the abdomen. It is shaped like a small balloon and has a muscular wall that allows it to get larger or smaller.

The urine passes from the two kidneys into the <b>bladder</b> through two tubes called ureters. When the <b>bladder</b> is emptied during urination, the urine goes from the <b>bladder</b> to the outside of the body through another tube called the urethra. Early <b>bladder</b> cancer is also called {{superficial}} <b>bladder</b> cancer or non muscle invasive <b>bladder</b> cancer.
