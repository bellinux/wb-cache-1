5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public <b>body</b> <b>to</b> perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public <b>body</b> <b>to</b> reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the <b>body</b> <b>to</b> eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E

5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's <b>body</b> <b>to</b> have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government to sanction an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was the only real <b>body</b> <b>to</b> be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges dragged the bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since no witnesses expressed any doubt that the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E
