5|$|An {{only child}} (single child) is one without any {{biological}} or adopted <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> sisters. Single children are stereotypically portrayed as spoiled, self-centered, and selfish. Only children often perform better {{in school and}} in their careers than children with siblings.|$|E
5|$|Cane later {{explains}} to Rose that Polk {{had been his}} commander of an artillery battery at a battle {{which could have been}} a victory but that Polk panicked and ran, depressing his men, with those who didn't desert their positions being decimated, including Cane's <b>brothers,</b> <b>or</b> captured like Cane himself. Rose makes Cane promise not to harm Polk, but still has Polk placed in protective custody.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether, as Bede understood, Sigebert and Eorpwald were <b>brothers,</b> <b>or</b> whether {{they shared the}} same mother but not the same father, as was stated by the 12th century chronicler William of Malmesbury. According to the {{historian}} Barbara Yorke, Sigebert {{may have been a}} member of a different line of Wuffings who as his rival was forced into exile, {{in order to ensure that}} Eorpwald became king.|$|E

5|$|The rivalry of Horus and Set {{is portrayed}} in two {{contrasting}} ways. Both perspectives appear {{as early as}} the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.|$|E
5|$|What you're {{basically}} {{saying is that}} Joe Berrios {{should get out of}} politics. If my <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> whoever wants to come and work in government, they shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E

5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues <b>Brothers,</b> <b>or</b> even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory for when he turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh {{was the son}} of Gille-Brighde, son of Fergus, king of the Gall-Gaidhil. Donnchadh's ancestry {{cannot be}} traced further; no patronymic is known for Fergus from {{contemporary}} sources, and when Fergus' successors enumerate their ancestors in documents, they never go earlier than he does. The name Gille-Brighde, used by Donnchadh's father (Fergus' son), was also {{the name of the father}} of Somhairle, petty king of Argyll in the third quarter of the 12th century. As the original territory of the Gall-Gaidhil kingdom probably adjoined or included Argyll, Alex Woolf has suggested that Fergus and Somhairle were <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> cousins.|$|E
5|$|Gediminas' origins are unclear, {{but recent}} {{research}} suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and {{could be considered the}} dynasty's founder. Because none of his <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.|$|E

5|$|The Norman {{family of}} de Vaux {{originated}} in Rouen, northern France, {{and settled in}} England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux <b>brothers,</b> <b>or</b> cousins, were {{among a number of}} Anglo-Norman knights invited to Scotland, and granted land, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, at that time part of Scotland, while John de Vaux was granted the barony of Dirleton. John built a castle at Eldbotle, probably to the north-west of modern Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, although neither survives.|$|E
5|$|The Third Doctor's final {{story was}} to be The Final Game by Robert Sloman and Barry Letts as an uncredited co-writer which was {{commissioned}} on 15 February 1973. The story was to end with the reveal that the Master and the Doctor were <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> two different, opposing aspects of the same being (the Ego and the Id), and the Master dying in a manner which suggested that he sacrificed himself to save the Doctor's life. The actor who played the Master, Roger Delgado, {{was killed in a}} car accident in Turkey on 18 June 1973, forcing the scrapping of the story. The story was replaced by Planet of the Spiders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} on a lower social tier than men (according to Confucian ethics), they enjoyed many social and legal {{privileges}} and wielded considerable power {{at home and in}} their own small businesses. As Song society became more and more prosperous and parents on the bride's side of the family provided larger dowries for her marriage, women naturally gained many new legal rights in ownership of property. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without <b>brothers,</b> <b>or</b> a surviving mother without sons, could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property. There were many notable and well-educated women, and it was a common practice for women to educate their sons during their earliest youth. The mother of the scientist, general, diplomat, and statesman Shen Kuo taught him essentials of military strategy. There were also exceptional women writers and poets, such as Li Qingzhao (1084–1151), who became famous even in her lifetime.|$|E

5|$|The news of Daenerys's {{pregnancy}} {{reaches the}} Small Council, delivered {{by one of}} Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders {{that she and her}} unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make him no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> nephews.|$|E

For example, {{in the old}} quarters of Georgetown, the presence of The Seven <b>Brothers</b> <b>or</b> Tujuh Beradik is common while in the royal town of Klang in Selangor, most of the spirits worshipped {{are believed to be}} members of the royal court (Sultans, officers, warriors etc.), each with their own unique identity.|$|E

25|$|Tradition varies on his {{relationship}} to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations she is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth.|$|E
25|$|The more {{numerous}} form {{of these are}} religious institutes, which are characterized by the public profession of vows, life in common as <b>brothers</b> <b>or</b> sisters, and a degree of separation from the world. They are defined in the Code of Canon Law under canons 607–709. The other form is that of secular institutes, in which the members live in the world, and work for the sanctification of the world from within.|$|E

40|$|Coming out” to a <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> {{a sister}} {{can be an}} {{emotional}} affair, but “coming out” to a fraternity <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> a sorority sister {{can be just as}} affecting. This is because of the heterosexist and homophobic environment that these organizations often create. This paper focuses on the importance of forming gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (GLBTQ) allies in fraternities and sororities for those Greek members who identify as GLBTQ. Since many Greek-letter organizations may be described as “families,” coping strategies for fraternity and sorority members who have been confidants of their gay <b>brother</b> <b>or</b> lesbian sister are discussed by using counseling theories designed for parents and families of gay men and lesbians...|$|R
