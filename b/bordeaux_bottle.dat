Two years later, he bought a small vineyard next {{to his home in}} Gascony in France, planting Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, producing about 1,000 litres a year. He was chairman of Leiths School of Food and Wine, which he bought jointly with Caroline Waldegrave in 1994.|$|R
60|$|The {{vineyards}} alone make {{a splendid}} estate, by the way; they produce a delicious red wine, which is exported to <b>Bordeaux,</b> and there <b>bottled</b> and {{sold as a}} vintage claret {{under the name of}} Chateau Monnivet. Charles revelled in the idea of growing his own wines.|$|R
2500|$|In 1725, {{the spread}} of {{vineyards}} throughout Bordeaux was so vast that it was divided into specific areas so that the consumer could tell exactly where each wine was from. The collection of districts {{was known as the}} Vignoble de <b>Bordeaux,</b> and <b>bottles</b> were labeled with both the region and the area from which they originated. During this period, Nicolas-Alexandre, marquis de Ségur rose to prominence as the [...] "Prince of Vignes" [...] due to his ownership of some of Bordeaux's most prestigious estates and Pierre de Rauzan laid the foundation for Château Rauzan-Ségla, Château Rauzan-Gassies, Château Pichon Longueville Baron, and Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande.|$|R

2500|$|Neal Caffrey, a {{successful}} con man, {{is about to}} finish a four-year prison sentence after being convicted of bond forgery, when he stages an elaborate prison break. FBI Special Agent Peter Burke, the man who captured Neal four years earlier, {{is the first to}} be notified with the news. He immediately abandons his current case, a forger known as [...] "the Dutchman", to search for Neal. His intuition tells him that Neal had escaped to search for his girlfriend, Kate Moreau. Peter follows Neal to Kate's Manhattan apartment, where he confronts Neal. Neal explains that Kate has disappeared, leaving behind only an empty <b>Bordeaux</b> wine <b>bottle,</b> signifying their relationship is over. Peter takes Neal back into custody, but not before Neal gives Peter a valuable tip regarding the Dutchman: paper fiber Peter had found earlier had come from new Canadian currency. In return, Neal asks for a meeting with Peter to discuss his future.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous, alleged purveyors of label fraud is wine {{collector}} Hardy Rodenstock. In the 1980s and 1990s, Rodenstock hosted a series of high-profile wine tasting events of old and rare wines from his collection, including many from the 18th and 19th centuries. He invited to these tastings dignitaries, celebrities and internationally acclaimed wine writers and critics such as Jancis Robinson, Robert M. Parker, Jr. and Michael Broadbent {{who at the time}} was a director at the London auction house Christie's and considered one of the world's foremost authorities on rare wine. At one such tasting, Rodenstock produced 125 vintages of Château d'Yquem, including a very rare bottle from the 1784 vintage. In addition to holding these extravagant tastings, Rodenstock also sold many bottles from his collection at auction houses, which supposedly regularly inspect and research wines for authenticity. One such lot that Rodenstock sold were the rare [...] "Jefferson bottles", reportedly rare <b>Bordeaux</b> wines <b>bottled</b> for the American president, Thomas Jefferson. American businessman Bill Koch bought four of these Jefferson bottles which were later determined to be fake - the engravings on the bottle that purportedly linked them to Jefferson were determined to have been done with a high-speed electric drill similar to a dentist's drill; technology that did not exist until modern times. This revelation cast a net of suspicion on the authenticity of all the rare bottles that Rodenstock served at his tastings and sold at auctions.|$|R
