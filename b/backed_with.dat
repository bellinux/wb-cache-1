5|$|Different glands are {{specialized}} {{for different}} pheromones to attract mates. Pheromones from species of Rutelinae are produced from epithelial cells lining the inner {{surface of the}} apical abdominal segments; amino acid-based pheromones of Melolonthinae are produced from eversible glands on the abdominal apex. Other species produce different types of pheromones. Dermestids produce esters, and species of Elateridae produce fatty acid-derived aldehydes and acetates. To attract a mate, fireflies (Lampyridae) use modified fat body cells with transparent surfaces <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> reflective uric acid crystals to produce light by bioluminescence. Light production is highly efficient, by oxidation of luciferin catalyzed by enzymes (luciferases) {{in the presence of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and oxygen, producing oxyluciferin, carbon dioxide, and light.|$|E
5|$|The Rhodesian Army {{sought to}} forge a strong esprit de corps among the new recruits, and to this end {{extended}} them several sentimental allowances: for example, morale amongst the Frenchmen rose when they were informed that the Rhodesian insignia on their berets would be <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> the French tricolour. In a similar vein, their request for permission to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia outside their headquarters each morning was approved. French-speaking men already in the army were attached to the unit to act as interpreters and assist with coordination and tactical instruction. Some of these were Mauritians, who {{by virtue of their}} upbringing spoke both English and French at a native-like level. The company itself, which numbered about 200 men, was assigned headquarters near Salisbury at Cranborne Barracks, the home of the Rhodesian Light Infantry. It was organised {{in the same manner as}} a standard Rhodesian independent company, the only exception being its exclusively francophone personnel.|$|E

5|$|The company's men, {{a mixture}} of former French paratroopers, ex-Foreign Legionnaires and young adventurers, had trouble from the start {{integrating}} with the Rhodesian forces, and became unsettled by the respective ranks they were given in the Rhodesian Army. In an attempt to raise their morale and create a strong esprit de corps, the Army issued them beret insignias <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> the French tricolour and allowed them to raise the flag of France alongside that of Rhodesia each morning. Apparently {{under the impression that}} they had signed up as highly paid mercenaries, many of the French troopers returned home after their first bush trip, unhappy to have received no more money than a regular Rhodesian soldier.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{started on}} September 6, 2004 at Camperdown Studios in Miramar, New Zealand. Camperdown housed the native village and the Great Wall, while {{the streets of}} New York City were constructed on its backlot and at Gracefield in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. The majority of the SS Venture scenes were shot aboard a full-scale deck constructed {{in the parking lot}} at Camperdown Studio and then were <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> a green screen, with the ocean digitally added in post. Scenes set in the Broadway theater from which King Kong makes his escape were filmed in Wellington's Opera House and at the Auckland Civic Theatre. Filming also took place at Stone Street Studios, where a new sound stage was constructed to accommodate one of the sets. Over the course of filming the budget went from $175 million to $207 million over additional visual effects work needed, and Jackson extending the film's running time by thirty minutes. Jackson covered the $32 million surplus himself and finished filming in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} much debate amongst historians about Philip's motives and aims in 346 BC, with {{particular}} regard to Athens. Although Philip had made peace and alliance with Athens prior to his settlement of the Sacred War, they failed to send him troops he requested {{under the terms of}} the alliance. Although these troops were not ultimately needed by Philip, the Athenian failure to honour the terms gave Philip reasonable grounds for war. However, even when in possession of Thermopylae, he made no hostile moves towards Athens, and still prevented any punishment being meted on Athens by the Amphictyonic council. Why was Philip so lenient towards Athens? Cawkwell suggests that Philip was already beginning to contemplate a campaign against Persia in 346 BC (as tentatively suggested by Diodorus), for which purposes he desired the use of the powerful Athenian navy; hence his request for alliance, and his on-going patience with Athens. This may also provide another explanation for Philip's use of the Amphictyonic council to formally settle the Sacred War; if he was to campaign in Asia, he needed Greece to be peaceful, and a peace imposed through a pan-Greek organisation (<b>backed</b> <b>with</b> the threat of Macedonian intervention), was more likely to succeed than one directly imposed by Macedon.|$|E

Runnels fought <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a DDT and climbed the turnbuckles, but Venis threw him to the outside. They then {{went back and forth}} until Venis performed a powerslam, several elbow drops, and pinned Runnels after a Money Shot.|$|R

25|$|Both the Roman and Chinese traditions {{typically}} show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> a {{range of}} spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers.
