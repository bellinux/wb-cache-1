40|$|AbstractObjective: Previous {{work has}} found {{cerebral}} oxygen extraction to decrease during hypothermic cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> in children. To elucidate cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> factors controlling cerebral oxygen extraction, {{we examined the}} effect of perfusate temperature, pump flow rate, and hematocrit value on cerebral hemoglobin-oxygen saturation as measured by near infrared spectroscopy. Methods: Forty children less than 7 years of age scheduled for cardiac operations with continuous cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} warm <b>bypass,</b> hypothermic <b>bypass,</b> hypothermic low-flow <b>bypass,</b> or hypothermic low-hematocrit <b>bypass.</b> For warm <b>bypass,</b> arterial perfusate was 37 ° C, hematocrit value 23 %, and pump flow 150 ml/kg per minute. Hypothermic <b>bypass</b> differed from warm <b>bypass</b> only in initial perfusate temperature (22 ° C); hypothermic low-flow <b>bypass</b> and low-hematocrit <b>bypass</b> differed from hypothermic <b>bypass</b> only in pump flow (75 ml/kg per minute) and hematocrit value (16 %), respectively. Cerebral oxygen saturation was recorded before <b>bypass</b> (baseline), during <b>bypass,</b> and for 15 minutes after <b>bypass</b> had been discontinued. Results: In the warm <b>bypass</b> group, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during and after <b>bypass.</b> In the hypothermic <b>bypass</b> group, cerebral oxygen saturation increased 20 % ± 2 % during <b>bypass</b> cooling (p < 0. 001), returned to baseline during <b>bypass</b> rewarming, and remained at baseline after <b>bypass.</b> In the hypothermic low-flow and hypothermic low-hematocrit <b>bypass</b> groups, cerebral oxygen saturation remained at baseline levels during <b>bypass</b> but increased 6 % ± 2 % (p = 0. 05) and 10 % ± 2 % (p < 0. 03), respectively, after <b>bypass</b> was discontinued. Conclusions: In children, cortical oxygen extraction is maintained during warm cardiopulmonary <b>bypass</b> at full flow and moderate hemodilution. <b>Bypass</b> cooling can decrease cortical oxygen extraction but requires a certain pump flow and hematocrit value to do so. Low-hematocrit hypothermic <b>bypass</b> and low-flow hypothermic <b>bypass</b> can also alter cortical oxygen extraction after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary <b>bypass.</b> (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1997; 113 : 71 - 9...|$|R

5|$|By1929, the {{construction}} had reached Lawrence Township, where another {{long stretch of}} highway was built.

Construction of the highway progressed northbound, with sections of the Mercer-Hunterdon-Warren route reaching Hunterdon County in1931. The Hunterdon County portion up to the Musconetcong River was constructed for six months, with completion in October1931. Construction of the highway northward from the Musconetcong River started in October of the same year. The mainline construction reached the northern terminus in Buttzville in1932.

5|$|Having {{reached the}} floor of the Hudson Valley, NY23 assumes a southeast-trending route through the town of Cairo. It comes close to the hamlet of Cairo, but <b>bypasses</b> it on a four-lane divided highway that takes it around the {{northern}} fringe of the community. As it runs around Cairo, the route connects to NY145 and briefly overlaps NY32, the major northsouth state route {{on the west side of}} the Hudson River. NY23 continues as a divided highway through mostly forested areas to the town of Catskill, where it crosses Catskill Creek and has an indirect intersection with the New York State Thruway (I-87). Not far to the southeast is the village of Catskill, the county seat of Greene County. NY23 <b>bypasses</b> this community as well, connecting to U.S. Route9W (US9W) and NY385 at junctions in lightly populated areas north of the village prior to crossing the Hudson River on the Rip Van Winkle Bridge.|$|E
5|$|M-60 was {{originally}} designed in 1919 {{with the rest}} of the state highway system in Michigan. It ran roughly along its current route connecting downtown Niles to downtown Jackson. In the mid-1920s, the western end was extended to New Buffalo; since then several <b>bypasses</b> of the smaller towns along the highway were added. One of these <b>bypasses</b> resulted in the creation of an alternate route (Alternate M-60, Alt. M-60) through Concord; that route has since been decommissioned. When Niles was bypassed in the 1950s, a business loop (Business M-60, Bus. M-60) was created through town. After the western end was truncated to its current location, that business loop was converted to a business spur.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Cache {{hierarchy}} designs, including <b>bypassing,</b> replacement, and {{the inclusion}} property, have significant performance impact. Recent works on high performance caches {{have shown that}} cache <b>bypassing</b> is an effective technique to enhance the last level cache (LLC) performance. However, commonly used inclusive cache hierarchy cannot benefit from this technique because <b>bypassing</b> inherently breaks the inclusion property. This paper presents a solution to enabling cache <b>bypassing</b> for inclusive caches. We introduce a <b>bypass</b> buffer to an LLC. <b>Bypassed</b> cache lines skip the LLC while their tags are stored in this <b>bypass</b> buffer. When a tag is evicted from the <b>bypass</b> buffer, it invalidates the corresponding cache lines in upper level caches to ensure the inclusion property. Our key insight is that the lifetime of a <b>bypassed</b> line, assuming a well-designed <b>bypassing</b> algorithm, should be short in upper level caches and is most likely dead when its tag is evicted from the <b>bypass</b> buffer. Therefore, a small <b>bypass</b> buffer is sufficient to maintain the inclusion property and to reap most performance benefits of <b>bypassing.</b> Furthermore, the <b>bypass</b> buffer facilitates <b>bypassing</b> algorithms by providing the usage information of <b>bypassed</b> lines. We show that a top performing cache <b>bypassing</b> algorithm, which is originally designed for non-inclusive caches, performs comparably for inclusive caches equipped with our <b>bypass</b> buffer. The usage information collected from the <b>bypass</b> buffer also significantly reduces the cost of hardware implementation compared to the original design...|$|R

5|$|The Delaware State Route System {{includes}} Delaware's {{portion of}} the Interstate Highway System and U.S. Highway System along with state routes. The system also includes special routes of the U.S. and state routes, such as alternate, business, and truck routes. These routes consist of a banner denoting the type of special route above the route marker. Alternate routes provide a second alignment of a route between two points. DE 10 Alternate provides an alternate routing to DE 10 between Willow Grove and Rising Sun by passing through Woodside while DE 10 passes through Camden. Business routes pass through the business area of a city while the main route <b>bypasses</b> it. DE 1 Business passes through the central portion of Milford while DE 1 <b>bypasses</b> {{the city to the}} east. Truck routes provide an alternate route for trucks around a certain portion of a route. DE 14 Truck provides a route for truck traffic that <b>bypasses</b> the section of DE 14 that passes through Harrington. Suffixed routes also exist for short alignments that branch off their parent routes, in which a letter suffix is added after the route number. DE 1 has three suffixed routes in the Rehoboth Beach area while DE 9A provides access to the Port of Wilmington from DE 9.
