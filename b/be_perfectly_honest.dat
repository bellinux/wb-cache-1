Are you seriously {{claiming}} no one warned you it was dangerous?... I mean, {{have you had a}} look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I was extremely disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E
500|$|After leaving The Hills, Conrad {{appeared}} on The View in June 2009, {{where she was}} asked how she felt about her apology from Pratt involving the sex tape rumors. She replied, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I wasn't on the other line of that call [...] I didn't even know about it until , so no, I didn't get an apology, he's lying". At Montag and Pratt's wedding, it was depicted on the series as if Conrad and Cavallari were displeased with each other's presence, though the latter commented that they gave each other [...] "a big hug, and that's it". She also stated that when she joined The Hills, [...] "It's work! And drama sells. I think that's why they're bringing me in, because I know what works".|$|E

500|$|Wasteland Angel {{received}} average reviews upon release, garnering {{a rating}} of 55% on the review aggregation website GameRankings. Gamers Daily News' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level, stating, [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I squealed with delight when I {{got to see the}} carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes." [...] Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective, noting that the game's maps and engine {{did not appear to be}} designed for the first-person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as [...] "more than a little jarring." [...] While Travis Huinker of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics, Shack News's Jeff Mattas enjoyed the controls, stating, [...] "Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics, they feel right at home with the frantic, arcade-style action." [...] Ultimately, Huinker did not recommend the game, but Lindsey called it [...] "the most fun game that I have played this year".|$|E
500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film {{and it was just}} something I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line and we got a good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{decision}} to continue playing Test level rugby Campese writes that, [...] "In the end, my decision to play on was taken with one overriding goal in mind. I wanted to end my Test career on a high note. Not with an appearance off the bench in a Bledisloe Cup loss to the All Blacks." [...] He further adds that, [...] "the prospect of playing 100 Tests had enormous appeal too… But, to <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the initial aim was just {{to get back in}} the starting side." [...] Campese was selected for the Australian team for the first eight Tests of their 1996 season, before being dropped following his 100th Test against Italy. He would play one more Test for Australia against Wales in the Wallabies final Test of the year.|$|E
6000|$|I doubted if {{this man}} <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest.</b> I <b>was</b> {{satisfied}} that the concert-hall manager had had good grounds for discharging him.

6000|$|He {{wished to}} blurt out his indignation but she {{regarded}} {{him with an}} expectant air which checked him. His visible discomfort made her uneasy. He could only repeat [...] "Oh yes.

6000|$|I {{could have}} trusted all I had with him, for he <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> {{and had not}} the least view of doing me any wrong. Indeed, after it was so {{apparent}} that he had, as it were, saved my life, or at least saved me from being exposed and ruined--I say, after this, how could I doubt him in anything? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, not a cent. Wasn't it extraordinary! Have {{you ever}} heard of a blindly trusted uncle who <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest?</b> Well, mine <b>was.</b> But the trouble was that, while an {{excellent}} man to have looking after one's money, he wasn't a very lovable character. He was very hard. Hard! He was as hard as--well, nearly as hard as this seat. He hated poor Fill..." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Rollo, after a moment's pause, [...] "what {{you say is}} very true. But {{it seems}} to me it was a little artful in you to do that; and you always tell me that I must not be artful, but must <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> and open in all that I do. Don't you think you deceived me a little?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must change}} my ground altogether. I can't pretend any longer {{to be the}} {{contemporary}} of my lovers, or to have the least sympathy with their hopes and fears. If I were to <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> with them, I should tell them, perhaps, that disappointed love {{was the best thing}} that could happen to either of them, but, if they insisted on happiness, that a good broken engagement promised more of it than anything else I could think of." ...|$|E
5000|$|Filming was {{interrupted}} by the strike of the Screen Actors Guild on 7 March. Fabian's manager was reported as wanting to buy the film {{so it could be}} completed. [...] "Now I've heard everything," [...] wrote Hedda Hopper. [...] "Fabian, who admits he can't sing and <b>is</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> about it, has been in our business {{a little more than a}} year." [...] The strike ended and filming resumed on 12 April.|$|R
60|$|How Tom Jones {{combined}} these sentiments, which <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> {{with his}} own astonishing lack of retenue, and with Lady Bellaston, is just the puzzle. We cannot very well argue about it. I only ask you to let Jones {{in his right mind}} partly excuse Jones in a number of very delicate situations. If you ask me whether Sophia had not, after her marriage, to be as forgiving as Amelia, I fear I must admit that probably it was so. But Dr. Johnson himself thought little of that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, come now, mamma! Suppose you begin. I've <b>been</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> with myself, and I've been {{honest with}} Mr. Beaton. I don't care for him, and I've told him I didn't; so {{he may be}} {{supposed}} to know it. If he comes here after this, he'll come as a plain, unostentatious friend of the family, and it's {{for you to say}} whether he shall come in that capacity or not. I hope you won't trifle with him, and let him get the notion that he's coming on any other basis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was nothing}} tactless about it," [...] he assured her. [...] "It {{makes it much}} {{easier for me to}} tell you. I married my wife {{thirteen}} years ago because I believed that her wealth would help me in my career. She married me because she was an American with ambitions, anxious to find a definite place in English society. She has been disappointed in me. Other circumstances have now presented themselves. I have discovered that my wife's affections are bestowed elsewhere. To <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> the discovery was a relief to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will indeed; alone I {{should have}} very little {{influence}} with the Portuguese guard. These might <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> themselves, but {{they might not be}} at all disposed to risk their lives by offering any opposition to any band that might demand the ammunition they would believe were in the cases. I was twice stopped by bands of scantily armed peasants on my way down, and although they released me on seeing the letter that I carried to the general, it was evident that they felt but little good-will towards us, and had I had anything about me worth taking, my chance of reaching Lisbon would have been small." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although {{from the}} {{evidence}} of State officials it has been proved that [...] individual cases of abuses are not infrequent even at these posts, the [...] chance traveller will certainly see nothing of them, and when he [...] judges of {{the condition of the}} country by what he actually sees at [...] these stations, his opinions may <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> but they are [...] absolutely worthless. It is as though some well-meaning person, who [...] had heard that a certain fashionable firm was making a fortune by [...] sweated labour, were to venture to deny the facts because a cursory [...] visit to the West End establishment showed that the salesmen behind [...] the counter were well-dressed and well-nourished, ignoring altogether [...] the festering misery of the sweaters' dens in which every article sold [...] over that counter was made up." ...|$|E
6000|$|My answer, {{if it was}} lame and ungallant to such a challenge, <b>was</b> {{at least}} <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest.</b> [...] "I can't make up my mind," [...] I said. [...] "I've been near making plans--taking steps.... Something holds me back...." ...|$|R
500|$|Fairbanks {{described}} Kingsley as [...] "an unusually permissive slave owner" [...] {{who wrote}} about the physical superiority of Africans to Europeans, armed his slaves for protection, and gave them padlocks for their cabins. Historian Daniel Stowell suggests that the cabins and Kingsley's hands-off approach to slave management was intended to prevent the slaves from running away. Kingsley himself wrote about not interfering in his slaves' family lives and [...] "encouraged {{as much as possible}} dancing, merriment and dress, for which Saturday afternoon and night, and Sunday morning were dedicated ... they <b>were</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> and obedient, and appeared quite happy, having no fear but that of offending me; and I hardly ever had occasion to apply other correction than shaming them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, I daresay {{you have}} seen his name {{connected}} with some rather painful cases," [...] said Gideon. [...] "But he <b>is</b> himself a <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> man, and his capacity is recognised. And now, gentlemen, it only remains for me to ask where I shall communicate with you." ...|$|R
60|$|Then, for {{the first}} time, I told him that I was in a but very little better position; and I am bound to say that, {{notwithstanding}} his own infatuation, he had the decency to sympathise with me. Perhaps {{he did not think}} it worth while being jealous, realising that he had no cause so far as the lady was concerned. I went on to suggest that we should try to run away, but we soon rejected the project as futile, and, to <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest,</b> I do not believe that either of us would really have left Ayesha even if some superior power had suddenly offered to convey us from these gloomy caves and set us down in Cambridge. We could no more have left her than a moth can leave the light that destroys it. We were like confirmed opium-eaters: in our moments of reason we well knew the deadly nature of our pursuit, but we certainly were not prepared to abandon its terrible delights.|$|E
6000|$|Hence {{it came to}} {{pass that}} Milby respectability refused to {{recognize}} the Countess Czerlaski, {{in spite of her}} assiduous church-going, and the deep disgust she was known to have expressed at the extreme paucity of the congregations on Ash-Wednesdays. So she began to feel that she had miscalculated the advantages of a neighbourhood where people are well acquainted with each other's private affairs. Under these circumstances, you will imagine how welcome was the perfect credence and admiration she met with from Mr. and Mrs. Barton. She had been especially irritated by Mr. Ely's behaviour to her; she felt sure that he was not in the least struck with her beauty, that he quizzed her conversation, and that he spoke of her with a sneer. A woman always knows where she is utterly powerless, and shuns a coldly satirical eye as she would shun a Gorgon. And she was especially eager for clerical notice and friendship, not merely because that is quite the most respectable countenance to be obtained in society, but because she really cared about religious matters, and had an uneasy sense that she was not altogether safe in that quarter. She had serious intentions of becoming quite pious--without any reserves--when she had once got her carriage and settlement. Let us do this one sly trick, says Ulysses to Neoptolemus, and we will <b>be</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>honest</b> ever after-- ...|$|E

What I am saying, is what I said when you first overpowered me with surprise--you remember how surprised I was?--by proposing for Annie. Not that there was anything so very much out of the way, in the mere fact of the proposal--it would be ridiculous to say that!--but because, you having known her poor father, and having known her from a baby six months old, I hadn't thought of you in such a light at all, or indeed as a marrying man in any way,--simply that, you know.' ...|$|R
