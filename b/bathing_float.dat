Khun Bedu, along with Khun Kawrio and Khun Dee De, reportedly organized members to protest the vote in Loikaw and Demo Soe, Kayah State. On 27 April, the words [...] "no" [...] and [...] "vote no" [...] began to appear on government signs, and on 30 April, group members sprayed a large [...] "X" [...] on a sign by the Loikaw city hall reading [...] "To be a prosperous and developed nation, let’s support the referendum". The protesters also released balloons with attached signs reading [...] "no", sent rafts from banana tree wood or <b>bathing</b> cups <b>floating</b> down the Beluchong River with small flags reading [...] "vote no", and distributed copies of the video of the lavish wedding of Than Shwe's daughter.|$|R

The fox and the lion grudge about their lot of having to feed on potatoes when a voice tells them that they should raise against such decision but the lion prevails in that they should respect the captain's law, however {{after a few days}} their huger gets the best of them and they attack a sheep and Ferdinand vanishes the carnivores to a <b>bathing</b> tub that <b>floats</b> behind the barn. In the meantime, Ferdinand and Tom talk about his father, who was the machinist at Ferdinand's boat, who was very handy with them. Ferdinand manages to [...] "motorize" [...] the barn by modifying an old tractor engine to oars {{at the side of the}} building.|$|R
