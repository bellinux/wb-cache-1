40|$|An oil-film {{thickness}} {{monitoring system}} {{capable of providing}} an early warning of lubrication failure in rolling element bearings has been developed. The system is {{used to measure the}} lubricant-film thickness in a conventional deep groove ball <b>bearing</b> (<b>shaft</b> diameter 80 mm, ball diameter 12. 7 mm). The measurement system comprises a 50 MHz broadband ultrasonic focused transducer mounted on the static outer raceway of the bearing. Typically the lubricant-films in rolling element bearings are between 0. 1 - 1. 0 Î¼m in thickness and so are significantly smaller than the ultrasonic wavelength. A quasistatic spring model is used to calculate oil-film thickness from the measured reflection coefficient data. An accurate triggering system has been developed to enable multiple reflection coefficient measurements to be made as the contact ellipse sweeps over the measurement location. Experiments are described in which the loading conditions and rotational speed are varied. Lubricant-film thickness distributions measured ultrasonically are described and are shown to agree well with the predictions from classical elastohydrodynamic (EHD) lubrication theory, particularly at high radial loads and low rotary speeds. A range of parameters affecting the performance of the measurement are discussed and the limits of operation of the measurement technique defined. Â© 2006 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E

The weights of the SBCN represent its diagnostic knowledge and are derived from the structure of the gearbox graphically presented in DAG. The outputs of SBCN are fault possibility values between 0 and 1 for individual subsystems and components in the gearbox with a 1 representing a definite fault and a 0 representing normality.

40|$|Failure of the spherical <b>bearing</b> <b>shaft</b> of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) gimbal bearing {{assembly}} was encountered during Design Verification Specification {{testing of the}} full scale engine. Investigation revealed that the failure {{was caused by a}} deficiency in the lubrication system. Based upon the materials and gimbal operating conditions, a lubricant of MoS 2 and graphite with a ceramic binder was the best lubricant candidate for this particular application; however, the decision to implement the change was not made without verification testing. Scaled down simulation testing was performed. Four different substrate materials and eight different dry film lubricants were subjected to tests under simulated SSME environmental and stress load conditions. The test specimens were evaluated for friction and operating life. Each test specimen was subjected to cyclic operation under load until failure. The force required to move the bearing surfaces relative to each other was monitored throughout the test, thus providing analytical data for derivation of the coefficient of friction. Results indicate that the MoS 2 /graphite lubricant with ceramic binder proved to be superior from the standpoint of endurance and also from the standpoint of friction reducing capabilities when applied to the titanium substrate material used on SSME.

Micron-sized WC-metal (WC- 0. 6 %C- 21 %Cr- 6 %Ni) powder was coated {{onto the}} {{substrate}} of magnetic <b>bearing</b> <b>shaft</b> material Inconel 718 (substrate or In 718) using JK 3500 HVOF thermal sprayer {{for the improvement}} of the surface properties of the substrate. The optimal coating process for the highest surface hardness was obtained using the Taguchi experimental program. The coating was laser heat-treated (LH) by CO 2 (g) laser for further improvement of the properties. During the thermal spraying, a small portion of metal carbides of powder decomposed to W 2 C, metals and free carbon. The free carbon reacted with excessively sprayed oxygen, and formed carbon oxide gases, forming porous coating. By laser-heating, porosity decreased and the porous strips at the interface of coating and substrate (coat/sub) compacted. At the interface, the precipitated graphite concentration decreased and the metal elements diffused from both the coating and substrate increased, enhancing the functions as buffer zone and increasing adhesion of coating. The surface hardness of substrate increased by coating and further increased by laser-heating from 410 ± 30 Hv to 983 ± 101 Hv and 1425 ± 94 Hv respectively. Porosity of coating decreased by laser-heating from 2. 6 ± 0. 4 % to 0. 35 ± 0. 06 %, and coating thickness shrank from 280 ㎛ to 200 ㎛.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{of the influence of}} oil supply temperature and supply pressure on the performance of a 100 mm plain journal bearing with two axial grooves located at ± 90 º to the load line was carried out. The hydrodynamic pressure at the mid-plane of the bearing, temperature profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, bush torque, oil flow rate, and the position of the shaft were measured for variable operating conditions. Shaft rotational speed ranged from 1000 to 4000 rpm and two different values of applied load were tested (2 kN and 10 kN). The supply temperature ranged from 35 to 50 ºC, whereas the oil supply pressure range was 70 kPa to 210 kPa. Bearing performance is strongly dependent on the supply conditions. It was found that the existence of the downstream groove significantly affects the temperature profile at the oil-bush interface except for the low load, low feeding pressure cases, where the cooling effect of the upstream groove is significant. Feeding temperature has a strong effect on the minimum film thickness. The increase in maximum temperature is significantly lower than the corresponding increase in supply temperature. Increases in supply pressure lead to a significant rise in oil flow rate but have little effect on the maximum temperature and power-loss, except {{in the case of the}} lightly-loaded <b>bearing.</b> <b>Shaft</b> temperature was found to be close to the bearing maximum temperature for low applied loads, being significantly smaller than this value for high loads.
