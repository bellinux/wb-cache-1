25|$|In 1806, the Ashanti pursued two rebel leaders through Fante {{territory}} to the coast. The British refusal to surrender the rebels {{led to an}} Ashanti attack. This was devastating enough that the British handed over a rebel; the other escaped. In 1807 disputes with the Fante led to the Ashanti–Fante War, in which the Ashanti were victorious under Asantehene Osei <b>Bonsu</b> ("Bonsu the whale").|$|E

25|$|By the 17th century, Osei Kofi Tutu I (c. 16951717), {{with help}} of Okomfo Anokye, unified what became the Ashante into a {{confederation}} with the Golden Stool {{as a symbol of}} their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the Akan state of Akwamu, introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. Opoku Ware I (1720–1745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding Techiman, Banda, Gyaaman, and Gonja, states on the Black Volta. Between 1744 and 1745, Asantehene Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. Kusi Obodom (1750–1764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. Osei Kwadwo (1777–1803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. Osei Kwame Panyin (1777–1803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804–1807), and Osei <b>Bonsu</b> (1807–1824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day Ghana and large parts of the Ivory Coast.|$|E

500|$|Billboard named Usher the Hot 100 Artist of the 2000s decade. Usher had {{the most}} no. 1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 charts with 7 and held the no. 1 {{position}} for a total 41 weeks. Confessions was ranked as the top solo album of the decade, selling 20 million copies worldwide. Considered by <b>Bonsu</b> Thompson of Vibe to be [...] "the Thriller of our generation", Damien Scott of Complex said it [...] "became pop culture catnip" [...] because of its theme. Pop music critic, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker remarks that [...] "For a while, Confessions was pop music" [...] and says it [...] "may {{turn out to have}} been the last true blockbuster in pop". Clay Cane said in 2008 [...] "We didn’t see pop-R artists on pop radio, and Usher is one of those people in the 90’s who was the catalyst for that; he was kind of the pioneer [...] He’s the greatest example of pure crossover success". Regarded as the best dancer in pop since Michael Jackson by writers of VH1 and The Guardian, Jody Rosen said in 2012 [...] "He's the biggest male pop singer in the world; sometimes, it seems like he's the only one, in a marketplace still dominated by divas". Complex's Justin Charity referred to him as [...] "the greatest male pop singer of the past couple decades" [...] in 2015. He has attained 9 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, tied with the Bee Gees, Elton John, and Paul McCartney.|$|E
50|$|Shortly afterwards, Etteroe accused Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II of extortion, {{which led}} commandant Smulders to summon Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II to Fort San Sebastian once more. Commandant Smulders {{was not present}} at Badu Bonsu's arrival, however, {{possibly}} because Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II also had a debt with him and wanted to annoy him. A humiliated Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II returned home, leading commandant Smulders to refer {{the case to the}} governor in Elmina, Hendrik Tonneboeijer, who on three separate occasions summoned Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II to Elmina, all to no avail.|$|E
50|$|From {{the early}} 1830s, the Dutch had a {{difficult}} relationship with the chief of Busua, Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II, whom the Dutch {{referred to as the}} King of Ahanta. According to Tengbergen and Douchez, the direct cause of what would become an armed conflict between the Dutch and the Ahanta, was a dispute Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II had with chief Etteroe of Sekondi. Etteroe had panyarred a woman and a child of Badu Bonsu's for a debt of 14 ounces of gold Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II had with him. Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II, however, learnt that Etteroe was trading gunpowder with Wassa, a neighbouring state with whom the Ahanta had a conflict, while this trade had been forbidden by Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II.|$|E
50|$|After Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II settled {{his debt}} with Etteroe {{and the woman}} and child were released, Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II {{requested}} a palaver with Etteroe {{in the presence of}} the Dutch commandant Gerard Smulders of Fort San Sebastian at Shama. Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II accused Etteroe of circumventing the ban on gunpowder trade with Wassa, and eventually Etteroe was condemned to pay a fine of 6 ounces of gold and to pay the process costs deemed 8 ounces of gold, equalling the 14 ounces Badu <b>Bonsu</b> II had earlier paid to Etteroe.|$|E

Mensa <b>Bonsu</b> tried {{to restore the}} {{fortunes}} of Kumasi after its destruction in the 1873-4 Anglo-Ashanti war. However, he did not make himself popular with contemporaries: [...] "Chronically short of revenue, and personally avaricious (for {{women as well as}} gold), King Asantehene Mensa <b>Bonsu</b> carried punitive exactions to new and insupportable levels." [...] Attempts were made to depose the Asantehene in 1877 and 1880. In 1881 <b>Bonsu</b> sent a golden axe to Queen Victoria as a gesture of good will. He was destooled and banished from Kumasi in 1883. The following five years saw Asante civil war. Asantehene Mensa <b>Bonsu</b> died in British captivity in 1896 and was succeeded to the throne by heir apparent Kwaku Dua II of the Kingdom of Ashanti.
