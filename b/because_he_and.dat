5|$|Hastert's son Ethan ran in 2010 as a Republican for his father's old congressional seat (Illinois' 14th congressional district), but was {{defeated}} in the primary by Illinois State Senator Randy Hultgren. Hultgren received 55 percent of the vote, while Hastert received 45 percent. In 2011, Ethan won {{a seat on the}} village board of Elburn, Illinois. Ethan left the Elburn village board in 2014 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his family moved to nearby Campton Hills. Ethan is a partner at the Chicago office of the law firm Mayer Brown.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, Faramir {{is played by}} David Wenham. The actor jokes that he got the role <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Sean Bean, who played Boromir, both had large noses. Faramir and his brother's appearances were slightly altered from the book: in the films, they have fair hair and are slightly bearded, whereas in the book they were dark-haired and, following a statement in Unfinished Tales, lacked beards.|$|E
5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E

But, Magic Johnson was given a late night television show, <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> famous <b>and</b> charming. Failed in 11 shows. Magic Johnson was given a head coaching job of the Lakers, <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> famous <b>and</b> charming, failed in 16 games. Magic Johnson, not interesting as a broadcaster, given broadcasting opportunity after broadcasting opportunity, <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> famous <b>and</b> charming. <b>And</b> now, <b>he</b> gets to run the entire Lakers organization <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> famous <b>and</b> charming. That’s amazing. That’s amazing. He’s a very kind man, to be in his presence is to be awash in all the things people like about celebrity, he will make you feel special, but he wasn’t good at any of those jobs I just mentioned, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> got all of those jobs, bypassing a whole lot of people who are more qualified, <b>because</b> <b>he’s</b> famous <b>and</b> charming." ...|$|R

5|$|News of Breyer's ride to Roubaix {{may have}} spread. Half those who entered {{did not turn}} up at the Brassérie de l'Espérance, the race {{headquarters}} at the start. Those who dropped out before the race began included Henri Desgrange, a prominent track rider {{who went on to}} organize the Tour de France. The starters did include Maurice Garin, who went on to win Desgrange's first Tour and was the local hope in Roubaix <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> two brothers had opened a cycle shop in the boulevard de Paris the previous year.|$|E

Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|Yu's voice acting {{has been}} handled by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and Johnny Yong Bosch in English. Bosch felt uneasy about voicing Yu {{due to the}} fact he also voiced another {{character}} from the game, Tohru Adachi. However, when he initially learned that the protagonist would have very few lines, his worry evaporated. It was first planned that Yu's voice actor for the anime would be recast, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Adachi would begin to interact several more times. However, in the end Bosch remained as the voice of Yu to avoid disappointing the game players. In order {{to solve the problem of}} having both of his characters sound too similar, he decided to speak in a lower register for Yu.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> {{his father}} held strong anti-communist beliefs, Koubek decided to flee Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup d'état of February 1948. He tried {{to cross the}} border into the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany, and failed. A second attempt in July succeeded. Koubek emigrated to the United Kingdom in October 1948, where he worked in a brickyard, as a {{draftsman}} for the city of Gloucester and county of Gloucestershire, a draftsman for the Ministry of Works, and announcer for the Czech language news service of the BBC. He encountered his future wife, Eva, in a bookstore in London. Eva was born in Prague, the daughter of a Czech Army officer. Her brother, whom she later rescued, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Siegel {{believed}} publishers kept rejecting them <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Shuster {{were young}} and unknown, so he looked for an established artist to replace Shuster. When Siegel told Shuster what he was doing, Shuster reacted by burning their rejected Superman comic, sparing only the cover.|$|E

Kekkonen's most severe critics, such as Veikko Vennamo, claimed that he remained President so long mainly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his closest associates were power-hungry. In 1980 Urho Kekkonen was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize.|$|E
25|$|Milton Obote {{was given}} a state funeral, {{attended}} by President Museveni, in the Ugandan capital Kampala in October 2005, to the surprise and appreciation of many Ugandans <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Museveni were bitter rivals. Other groups, such as the Baganda survivors of the Luweero Triangle massacres, were bitter that Obote {{was given a}} state funeral.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, Fisher costarred with then-wife Debbie Reynolds in {{the musical}} comedy Bundle of Joy. He played a {{dramatic}} role in the 1960 drama Butterfield 8 with second wife Elizabeth Taylor. His best friend was showman and producer Mike Todd, {{who died in a}} plane crash in 1958. Fisher's affair and subsequent marriage to Taylor, Todd's widow, caused a show business scandal <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Reynolds had a very public divorce. Due to the unfavorable publicity surrounding the affair and divorce, NBC canceled Fisher's television series in March 1959.|$|E

25|$|Jack Wrather, a local millionaire, {{had fallen}} in love with the ship <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife, Bonita Granville, had fond {{memories}} of sailing on it numerous times. Wrather signed a 66-year lease with the city of Long Beach to operate the entire property. He oversaw the display of the Spruce Goose, on long-term loan. The immense plane, which had been sitting in a hangar in Long Beach for decades unseen by the public, was installed in a huge geodesic dome adjacent to the liner in 1983, attracting increased attendance.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} secrecy {{surrounding the}} report {{written by the}} investigation panel from the Department of Civil Aviation attracted strong criticism. After the Minister, Mr Drakeford, announced to the House of Representatives {{that there was no}} need for a public inquiry into the disaster <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his Department already knew the cause, he was attacked for presuming to know all the reasons when the Coroner's inquest was still in progress. An editorial in the Brisbane Courier-Mail claimed the Minister was trying to avoid public inquiries into aviation accidents. The Attorney-General's decision to withhold the Coroner's report also attracted strong criticism.|$|E

Vivès {{has the most}} to say about Baret, but his memoir is problematical <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Commerson were on bad terms throughout the voyage, and his account – largely written or revised after the fact – is full of innuendo and spiteful comments directed at both Commerson and Baret.|$|E
