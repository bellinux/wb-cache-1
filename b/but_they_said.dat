5|$|That night, Castelli and Saavedra {{informed}} Cisneros {{of their}} resignation from {{the newly formed}} Junta. They explained that the population {{was on the verge}} of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did not have the power to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted to wait for the following day, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that there was no time for further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.|$|E
25|$|Gasporotto {{decided to}} give up the {{ownership}} of Hotelito Desconocido after suffering an accident where he lost his eye. Members of the fisherman group said that Gasporotto left to Uruguay, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they lost track of him when he moved to South America. According to local residents, once the ownership of Hotelito Desconocido was passed on to W Arquitectos, they began to see suspicious activity near the hotel. One {{of the members of the}} fisherman group stated that some of the hotel workers said they sometimes saw helicopters deliver packages at the hotel. He also stated to have seen suspicious convoys of black vehicles in some of the dirt roads leading to the hotel.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} attacks, the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara issued {{multiple}} security warnings {{through its}} Facebook page and on its website. They reported that there were several blockades across Jalisco and Colima, {{and that there were}} vehicles, gasolines, banks, and other buildings set on fire during the attacks. It warned its employees in Jalisco about the attacks and blockades, and asked them to remain at home until the situation was resolved by law enforcement. Their warning also extended to U.S. tourist planning to visit Jalisco, and asked them to avoid visiting the area. They asked U.S. citizens to look out for any public announcements by the Mexican government. The consulate was closed for International Workers' Day (celebrated on May 1), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> they were re-opening their offices on Monday, May 4. The warning concluded by suggesting U.S. citizens traveling or living in Mexico to consult the alerts and warnings page at the website of the U.S. Department of State. The Embassy of Canada, Mexico City also warned Canadians to stay home and limit their outdoor activities.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the success}} of [...] "Give it Away", the band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would {{ultimately}} be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people... I apologized for fucking up <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'" [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magiks second single. By January 1992, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
500|$|The band became {{associated}} with the International Space Year (ISY), designated as 1992 by the United Nations to promote peaceful and collaborative space exploration, when Linnell and Flansburgh were searching the NASA Archive Center for appropriate photographs and visual materials for the album artwork. Staff members at the NASA facility took notice of the duo and inquired about their research. Linnell responded that they [...] "were in this band, we're making this record, and we're going to start touring next year...They were particularly interested in that, because they said that 1992 was ISY. It {{was the first time}} we ever heard of that, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> because we were a band going to be touring around the world in 1992 they wondered if we wanted to be spokesband for the ISY. So we said why not?" ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 2005, a local Knights of Columbus {{council in}} Canada was fined $2,000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. The council's Hall Manager signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn, but canceled it and returned their money after they became aware that it was for the lesbian couple's wedding reception. [...] The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> the Council [...] "could have taken additional steps that would have recognized the inherent dignity of the complainants and their right to be free from discrimination". Instead of simply canceling the appointment, the court said, the council could have directed the complainants to other halls and assisted them in finding another place to hold their event.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before the}} film was due to air on British {{television}} in December 2012, Hedren gave an interview to the Daily Mail in which she repeated her claims about Hitchcock: [...] "He {{made it very clear}} what was expected of me, but I was equally clear that I wasn't interested...Nobody is denying that Hitchcock was a brilliant moviemaker and I enjoyed working with him before I realised he was starting to take an almost obsessive interest in me." [...] Other actresses have spoken about the close attention Hitchcock paid to details of the leading ladies' characters and appearances in his films, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that no harassment was involved. Eva Marie Saint, who starred in 1959's North by Northwest, told The Daily Telegraph [...] "Hitchcock was a gentleman, he was funny, he was so attentive to me, with the character, and he cared about everything my character Eve Kendall wore. He had an eye for the specifics of the character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first single}} off Blood Sugar Sex Magik was [...] "Give It Away", which reached {{number one on}} the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 1991. The band did not foresee [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] being as successful, but {{understood}} the potential commercial viability. Warner Bros. Records sent representatives to a Chili Peppers concert to determine which song should be the next single. When Frusciante began playing [...] "Under the Bridge", Kiedis missed his cue and the entire audience began singing the song instead. Kiedis was initially [...] "mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people I apologized for fucking up <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single'." [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] became the album's second single in March 1992; upon release, journalist Jeff Apter noted that it [...] "was the bona fide, across-all-formats radio hit that the band had been working towards for seven years." [...] It spent twenty-six cumulative weeks on the United States Billboard Hot 100 chart, peaking at number two, being one of the several songs stuck behind Kris Kross' 8-week reign of [...] "Jump". The single has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.|$|E
500|$|Oberman has {{described}} her {{time on the}} show as [...] "hectic". During Chrissie's tenure there was constant shuffling behind the scenes, with three different executive producers taking the reins, with each new producer bringing in new writing teams. Uncertainty came to be manifested in writing and scripts, with character inconsistencies and plot holes working their way into production. One notable example was ownership of The Queen Victoria, with Chrissie legally owner of half the pub after Den legitimately signed over the deed before they renewed their vows in February. However, in November this fact was forgotten, with Chrissie represented as forging Den's signature to nullify her ownership of the pub which legally became Sharon's. Problems with the script did not escape Oberman, who criticised her character's storylines after she left the show, saying the writers [...] "must have been on crack", adding how [...] "plots didn't make logical or emotional sense – <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> 'That's the soap convention, dear, get used to it'". She also considered some scenes to be irresponsible, saying [...] "I was worried when four-year-olds said to me, 'I saw you kill Den.' I don't agree with censorship {{but there has to}} be a level of responsibility." ...|$|E

2500|$|By November 1953, police {{announced}} they had recently received the 251st [...] "solution" [...] to {{the identity of}} the body from members of the public who claimed to have met or known him. <b>But,</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that the [...] "only clue of any value" [...] remained the clothing the man wore.|$|E
2500|$|On June 11, 2006 Saudi {{authorities}} {{released the}} names of the two Saudi men. Some reports identified one of the dead Saudis as Maniy bin Shaman al-Otaibi. Other reports identified that man as Mani bin Shaman bin Turki al Habradi. The Washington Post reported in 2006 after the deaths that Al-Utaybi had been recommended for [...] "transfer" [...] to another country, which meant he would have been continued to be held in guarded detention. The DOD did not state to which country he would have been transferred. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> he would have continued to have been held in detention. The Washington Post reported: [...] "Lieutenant Commander Robert Durand, a spokesman for the Guantanamo detention center, {{said he did not know}} whether al-Utaybi had been informed about the transfer recommendation before he killed himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout June 2004, as Rau's {{condition}} deteriorated, {{other prisoners}} {{began to suspect}} that she was ill, because she would pace all day and would slam doors. Kilroy said that she attempted to raise the matter with BWCC officials, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> {{that it was a}} DIMIA responsibility. On 5 July, Anna was one of 25 prisoners interviewed by an Ethical Standards Unit from the Government of Queensland, which was investigating claims of abuse within the prison system. During the taped interview, Anna recalled an incident in which she was sent to solitary confinement in the Detention Unit, or DU, for attempting to obtain a newspaper from another room in the prison. [...] During Rau's six months in BWCC, she spent five weeks in solitary confinement in the DU.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the issues}} was the album's {{complexity}} and how the touring Beach Boys {{would be able to}} perform its music live. Wilson said that the band [...] "didn't like the idea of growing musically... They wanted to keep making car songs and I said 'No, we've gotta grow, guys'." [...] On another occasion, he recalled: [...] "They liked [...] <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> it was too arty. I said, 'No, it is not!" [...] Marilyn said: [...] "When Brian was writing Pet Sounds, it was difficult for the guys to understand what he was going through emotionally and what he wanted to create.... they didn't feel what he was going through and what direction he was trying to go in." [...] Tony Asher remembered: [...] "All those guys in the band, certainly Al, Dennis, and Mike, were constantly saying, 'What the fuck do these words mean?' or 'This isn't our kind of shit!' Brian had comebacks, though. He'd say, 'Oh, you guys can't hack this.'...But I remember thinking that those were tense sessions." ...|$|E

[...] The women heard (this), but they were unwilling to give their earrings to their husbands; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> to them: Ye desire to make a graven image of a molten image without any power in it to deliver. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the women their reward {{in this world and}} the world to come. What reward did He give them in this world? That they should observe the new moons more stringently than the men, and what reward will He give them in the world to come?

2500|$|On April 21, 2016, Gerardo {{was arrested}} by the National Police of Uruguay in Montevideo, Uruguay. He was arrested {{following}} an extensive money laundering investigation between Latin American officials and the U.S. government that linked him to several shell companies he used to purchase assets in the Americas and overseas. This information was discovered in 2015 through the massive information leak known as the Panama Papers. Following his arrest, Tobares' family spoke {{to the press and}} talked about the investigation. They said they encountered problems in Mexico when the Argentine consular authorities were rotated and new personnel took over the case. In an effort to continue their search, they tried to increase their activity on social media, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>said</b> that some people (who they suspect worked for Gerardo) told them that Tobares was with them or that they had seen him alive in Mexico. Ana Soledad said she was told that Gerardo was once in Argentina and wanted to speak to her, but she refused. [...] "We just want to know where he is so we can bring him home, with his people, with his friends he loved and loved him. We do not want to know who took him. We just want to know, even anonymously, where he is," [...] she said.|$|E

In April 2014, Twiztid announced on their Twitter account that they had signed a distribution deal with InGrooves. According to Monoxide, [...] "There will be no more EP's after Get Twiztid". After only a few shows into Twiztid's The Bootleg Banner Tour, the remaining shows were cancelled.

2500|$|The Mishnah {{explained}} how the Jews of the Second Temple era interpreted {{the requirement of}} [...] that the king read the Torah to the people.

[...] The synagogue attendant took a Torah scroll and handed it to the synagogue president, who handed it to the High Priest's deputy, who handed it to the High Priest, who handed it to the king.

2500|$|On May 23, 2013, Senator Rob Portman {{introduced}} the World War II Memorial Prayer Act of 2013 (S. 1044; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would direct the United States Secretary of the Interior to install at the World War II memorial in the District of Columbia a suitable plaque or an inscription with the words that President Franklin D. Roosevelt prayed with the United States on June 6, 1944, the morning of D-Day. The bill was opposed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Jewish Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, the Hindu American Foundation, and the Interfaith Alliance. Together the organizations argued that the bill [...] "endorses the false notion that all veterans will be honored by a war memorial that includes a prayer proponents characterize as reflecting our country's 'Judeo-Christian heritage and values.'" [...] The organizations argued that [...] "the memorial, as it currently stands, appropriately honors those who served and encompasses the entirety of the war" [...] and was carefully created, so no additional elements, such as FDR's prayer, need to be added. <b>But,</b> <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "the effect of this bill, however, is to co-opt religion for political purposes, which harms the beliefs of everyone."
