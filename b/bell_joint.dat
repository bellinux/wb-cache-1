40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{location}} of broken prestressing wire wraps on the overall strength of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) is investigated here. An advanced computational model based on non-linear finite element analysis is used to study three possible locations of broken wire wraps: at the spigot joint, at the <b>bell</b> <b>joint</b> and in {{the barrel of the}} pipe. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the cracking of the concrete core and the yielding of the prestressing wires and steel cylinder with increasing internal pressure and with an increasing number of broken wire wraps. Two classes of 2. 44 m embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) were modelled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 wire wrap breaks. The results show that broken wire wraps at the joint, and especially the spigot joint, decrease the overall strength of PCCP more so than those at the <b>bell</b> <b>joint</b> or in the barrel of the pipe. The intensity of this effect increases with increasing internal pressure and with a larger number of broken wire wraps. PublishedN/...|$|E

25|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} indicates that the baroque bassoon was a newly invented instrument, rather than a simple modification of the old dulcian. The dulcian was not immediately supplanted, but continued to be used well into the 18th century by Bach and others. The man most likely responsible for developing the true bassoon was Martin Hotteterre (d.1712), who may also have invented the three-piece flûte traversière and the hautbois (baroque oboe). Some historians believe that sometime in the 1650s, Hotteterre conceived the bassoon in four sections (<b>bell,</b> bass <b>joint,</b> boot and wing joint), an arrangement that allowed greater accuracy in machining the bore compared to the one-piece dulcian. He also extended the compass down to B by adding two keys. An alternate view maintains Hotteterre {{was one of several}} craftsmen responsible {{for the development of the}} early bassoon. These may have included additional members of the Hotteterre family, as well as other French makers active around the same time. No original French bassoon from this period survives, but if it did, it would most likely resemble the earliest extant bassoons of Johann Christoph Denner and Richard Haka from the 1680s. Sometime around 1700, a fourth key (G♯) was added, and it was for this type of instrument that composers such as Antonio Vivaldi, Bach, and Georg Philipp Telemann wrote their demanding music. A fifth key, for the low E, was added during the first half of the 18th century. Notable makers of the 4-key and 5-key baroque bassoon include J.H. Eichentopf (c. 1678–1769), J. Poerschmann (1680–1757), Thomas Stanesby, Jr. (1668–1734), G.H. Scherer (1703–1778), and Prudent Thieriot (1732–1786).|$|R
50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the <b>bells</b> of any <b>joints.</b> The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to ground water, the sleeve also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R

David Moseley & Sons planned to open their own telephone exchange in their warehouse on Manchester's New Brown Street but before this happened in October of that year, the 'Lancashire and Cheshire Telephonic Exchange' company bought Moseley’s licence in order to stall his opening.

The {{objective of this}} program is to design, test and commercialize a robotic system capable of sealing multiple cast-iron <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints</b> from a single pipe entry point. The proposed system will perform repairs while the pipe remains in service by traveling through the pipe, cleaning each joint surface, and installing a stainless-steel sleeve lined with an epoxy-impregnated felt across the joint. This approach will save considerable time and labor, avoid traffic disruption, and eliminate any requirement to interrupt service to customers (which would result in enormous expense to utilities). Technical challenges include: (1) repair sleeves must compensate for diametric variation and eccentricity of old cast-iron pipes; (2) the assembly must travel long distances through pipes containing debris; (3) the pipe wall must be effectively cleaned in the immediate area of the joint to assure good bonding of the sleeve; and (4) an innovative bolt-on entry fitting is required to conduct repair operations on live mains. The development effort is divided into eleven tasks. Task 1 (Program Management) and Task 2 (Establishment of Detailed Design Specifications) were completed previously. Task 3 (Design and Fabricate Ratcheting Stainless-Steel Repair Sleeves) has progressed to installing prototype sleeves in test cast-iron pipe segments. Efforts in the current quarter continued {{to be focused on}} Tasks 4 - 8. Highly valuable lessons were learned from field tests of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast-iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. (These field tests were conducted and reported previously.) Several design issues were identified which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter repair robots for cast-iron pipe to assure their commercial success. For Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train), previous problems with bladder design and elastomeric material expansion in the large mains were addressed. A new bladder based on a commercially available design was obtained and tested with success. Minor improvements were highlighted during patch-setting tests and are now being pursued. For Task 5 (Design and Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera), the previous field tests showed clearly that, in mains with low gas velocities, {{it will be necessary to}} improve the system's capacity to remove debris from the immediate vicinity of the <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints.</b> Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (the flails were found to be very effective in cleaning <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints)</b> falls directly to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing servicetap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. Task 6 (Design and Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher that will be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function.

40|$|Bassoon is woodwind {{instrument}} with a conical bore, {{which is}} sounded by a double-reed {{and is used}} as a tenor or bass line of the woodwind section of the orchestra or chamber ensemble. Quite long evolution of bassoon begins in 1525 with instrument called Phagotum. This instrument is followed by dulcian made of one wooden part, through bassoon of the classical and romantic period, which was made from more joints, to the modern shape of instrument, which is known from first half of 19 th century. In this time two main types of bassoon were established: French type (with subtle construction, softer sound and easier reaching of upper register) and German type (robust with a dark homogenous sound mainly in low register). German type, which now dominates in the whole world, was designed especially by Carl Almenraeder (1786 ? 1843) and Johann Adam Heckel (1812 ? 1877). Modern bassoon is made of maple wood and consists of five joints: <b>bell,</b> bass <b>joint,</b> butt, wing joint and bocal. As a sixth joint can we eventually count in a double-reed. In contemporary praxis there exist two sizes of the instrument: bassoon and contrabassoon, sounding one octave lower. The most significant German-bassoon producers before Second World War were beyond Heckel also German firms Adler, Hüller, Kohlert, Mollenhauer and Mönnig. Current main producers of this bassoon type are: Amati (Czech Republic), Bell (Canada), Fox (USA), Heckel (Germany), Mönnig-Adler (Germany), Moosmann (Germany), Püchner (Germany), Schreiber (Germany), Takeda (Japan), Walter (Germany), Wolf (Germany) and Yamaha (Japan). French type of bassoon was formerly produced by Mahillon (Belgium), Boosey & Hawkes (England) and Morton (England). In these days it?s made only by Buffet-Crampon (France) and Selmer (France).

Efforts in this quarter continued to focus on Tasks 4 - 8, with significant progress made in each as well as field testing of the 4 -inch gas pipe repair robot in cast iron pipe at Public Service Electric & Gas. The field tests were conducted August 23 - 26, 2004 in Oradell, New Jersey. The field tests identified several design issues which need to be implemented in both the small- and large-diameter cast iron repair robots to assure their commercial success. Task 4 (Design, Fabricate and Test Patch Setting Robotic Train) progressed {{to the design of}} the control electronics and pneumatic system to inflate the bladder robotic patch setting module in the last quarter 5. In this quarter, work has been concentrated on increasing the nitrogen bladder reservoir volume to allow at least two complete patch inflation/patch setting cycles in the event the sleeve does not set all ratchets in the same row on the first attempt. This problem was observed on a few of the repair sleeves that were recently installed during field tests with the small-diameter robotic system. For Task 5 (Design & Fabricate Pipe-Wall Cleaning Robot Train with Pan/Zoom/Tilt Camera) it was observed that {{it will be necessary to}} add a stiff brush to push debris away from the immediate vicinity of the <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints</b> in mains having low gas velocities. Otherwise, material removed by the cleaning flails (which were found to be very effective in cleaning <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints)</b> simply falls to the low side of the pipe and accumulates in a pile. This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak free repair. Similarly, it is also necessary to design a small magnet to capture existing service tap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. These new features require redesign of the pipe wall cleaning train and modification to the patch setting train. Task 6 (Design & Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabView. However, this must now be re-visited to add control routines for the coupon catcher to be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function.

This accumulation can prevent the sleeve from achieving a leak-free repair. Similarly, it is also deemed necessary to design an assembly to capture existing service-tap coupons and allow their removal from the inside of the pipe. These coupons were found to cause difficulty in launching and retrieving the small pipe repair robot; for example, one coupon lodged beneath the end of the guide shoe. Designs for new features to accomplish these goals for the large robotic system were pursued and are presented in this report. Task 6 (Design & Build Surface Control and Monitoring System) was previously completed with the control and computer display functions being operated through LabVIEW. However, this must now be revisited to add control routines for the coupon catcher to be added. This will most likely include a lift-off/place-on magnet translation function. Task 7 (Design & Fabricate Large Diameter Live Access System) progressed to completing the detailed design of the entry fitting for 12 -inch diameter cast iron pipe in the previous quarter. Field tests with the 4 -inch size fitting were completely successful and did not reveal any significant design issues. The primary suggestion from the PSE&G field crew was to produce a version which completely bolts together and does not require a long seam weld. This could be used in low-pressure cast iron mains to reduce installation time. A bolt-on version is being designed based on this recommendation. Task 8 (System Integration and Laboratory Validation) continued with the development of the robot module inter-connects and of a master LabVIEW-based system display and control software...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{communication}} {{is a method}} that offers efficient and secure ways for the exchange of information in a network. Large-scale quantum communication (of the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel. Quantum communication eventually fails when {{the probability of a}} dark count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, Dür, Cirac and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining entanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated, the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ quantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ with atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by performing a <b>joint</b> <b>Bell</b> state measurement on the two single photons after they have passed through a 300 -m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as quantum messengers.

40|$|European {{foundries}} {{master the}} art of mass-producing cast iron pipes in the early 1800 s (Cast Iron Soil Pipe Institute 2006 : 1). Slow sand filters, buried pipes with <b>bell</b> and spigot <b>joints,</b> steam powered pumps, and water towers make for a universally applicable technology for urban water supply. Piped water systems enjoy a long service life and modest operational costs but require high initial outlays of capital. Also, pipe laying raises complex right-of-way issues (Meidinger 1980). Around 1850 {{it is by no}} means certain that buried water infrastructure can hold its own against contending modes of urban water supply. Cost-wise it certainly cannot compete against local water sources such as shallow wells and canals. By 1900 however, piped supply is establishing itself as the dominant source of domestic water in European and North American cities. Seventy years on, piped networks are the sole source of urban domestic water. i A parallel network of buried sewers carries the large volumes of piped water away from urban homes. How do piped water and waste technologies come to dominate domestic water regimes in European and North American cities? An early literature attributed the rise of urban piped water and sewerage to an unfolding understanding of the nature of waterborne disease (Baker 1949). Subsequent investigations by urban environment historians show that public health concerns play a minor role only in early 19 th century decisions to embrace piped water infrastructure (Juuti and Katko, 2005; Millward 2004; Tarr et al. 1984; Troesken and Geddes 2003). The introduction of piped water supply, in enabling householders to install waterborne waste removal systems, may arguably even have aggravated waterborne disease (Tarr et al. 1984). ii Urban environment historians place the rise of piped water against a background of rapid industrial and population growth in European and North American towns. The environmental stress accompanying 19 th century industrialisation triggers a crisis of urban water and waste that literally overwhelms city administrations (Tarr 1996). National and state governments respond by, late in the 19 th century, enacting laws and regulations that place responsibility for solving the crisis in urban public health on the shoulders of municipal administrations. City administrations respond by committing to large-scale and centralised technologies for handling urban water and waste. Much of the research published in English focuses, rather unsurprisingly, on the United States and Britain. This article attempts to complements our understanding of the emergence of the piped water paradigm with evidence from the European continent. Here, as elsewhere, waterworks are pioneered by private entrepreneurs under municipal concession contracts. Early concessions confer a limited degree of market power to concessionaires. In most cases the concession amounts to no more than a permit to bury piped systems in municipal soil. Gradually waterworks concessions grow in scope. The public health legislation underlying these arrangements provides concessionaires with a virtual monopoly on domestic water supply in the city. The next two sections sketch the development of piped water and sewerage technologies and the increasing involvement of municipalities with piped supply. Section four turns to the central argument. I show how the deepening commitment of municipal administrations to piped water occasions a shift in the legal brief under which concessionaires operate and the consequences this has for domestic water provision in the city.

40|$|The High Court has {{rejected}} {{the view that}} a state-appointed decision maker’s conduct can be immune from review, writes David Hume in this article for APO 2 ̆ 7 s High Court Watch series ON 3 FEBRUARY this year the High Court ruled that state parliaments could not create “islands of power immune from supervision and restraint. ” This judgment {{reflects the fact that}} when the colonies came together to form the Commonwealth, they gave up any capacity they may have had to confer power on administrative bodies and inferior courts and to then make the exercise of that power unreviewable by the State Supreme Court. Whatever the circumstance, the courts must have their say. This is a significant restriction on state legislative power. Its contemporary importance needs to be understood in the context of rising numbers of specialist tribunals, a general disfavour of the expense and delay involved in judicial process, and the national moves towards the harmonisation of state and Commonwealth regulation. Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission involved a prosecution under the NSW Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (the OH&S Act). The defendants were a company, Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd, and the manager of that company, Graeme Kirk. In 2001, an employee of Kirk Group, Graham Palmer, had driven the company’s All-Terrain Vehicle off road and down a hill. There was no path, and the hill was steep. The car overturned, and Mr Palmer died. Kirk Group and Mr Kirk were charged with offences under sections 15 and 16 of the OH&S Act for failing to ensure the healthy, safety and welfare of workers, and failing to ensure that people were not exposed to health and safety risks by reason of conduct of the Kirk Group’s employees. Where an employee has actually been injured, the provisions of the state’s OH&S Act make it very difficult to defend a charge. In effect, the employer has to show that no reasonably practicable measure would have avoided the injury. This imposes a more difficult burden than the defendant would face in any other Australian jurisdiction. In other jurisdictions, the prosecution bears the onus of showing what could have been done; in New South Wales, the onus is effectively on the defendant to show what could not have been done. While this burden can be hefty, it is not prohibitive. Ordinarily, the defendant need not deal with all hypothetically possible measures. They only need respond to those measures set out in the statement of the charge. If the measures are narrowly defined, the defendant faces a difficult but not impossible task. In Kirk, however, the regulator made the defendants’ burden even more onerous. The formal statement of the charge did not specify any particular measures the Kirk Group and Kirk could have taken to prevent the injury. It specified only a general failure to take measures set out in the OH&S Act. The Industrial Court of New South Wales considered the charges, held that Kirk Group and Mr Kirk had failed to prove that there was nothing further they could have done to prevent the injury, and convicted them. After an unsuccessful appeal to the NSW Court of Appeal, the matter came before the full bench of the High Court. The High Court unanimously allowed the appeal by Mr Kirk and the Kirk Group. Chief Justice French, and Justices Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and <b>Bell</b> wrote a <b>joint</b> judgment, while Justice Heydon wrote separately. The joint judgment held that the Industrial Court had made two errors. First, it had misconstrued the OH&S Act by considering that the prosecutor need not demonstrate any particular measures that the defendants could have taken. This construction of the OH&S Act was necessitated by the basic common law principle that “a defendant is entitled to be told… of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge. ” The Industrial Court also made a further error (one which particularly incensed Justice Heydon) in allowing the prosecution to call Mr Kirk as a witness. This was contrary to the express terms of the NSW Evidence Act 1995. Having concluded that the Industrial Court had committed errors, the High Court turned to the more fundamental issue raised by the case. This arose due to a provision of the NSW Industrial Relations Act 1996 that provided that decisions of the Industrial Court are final, and may not be appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called into question by any court or tribunal (whether by order in the nature of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus, by injunction or declaration or otherwise). In the language of administrative lawyers, this is a “privative clause. ” While there are obvious technicalities in the language used in these kinds of privative clauses, the intent of this one was clear – to the greatest extent possible, {{to make sure that the}} decisions of the Industrial Court were the last word on the matter. In the last five years, the High Court has had much to say about privative clauses. In Plaintiff 157 (2003), the High Court rendered ineffective the Howard government’s attempt to protect migration decisions from judicial review. In Futuris (2008), the High Court considered privative clauses again, this time in the context of income tax legislation. The theme of these judgments had been hostility to attempts by the Commonwealth to oust judicial review. Questions remained, however, about the approach the Court would take to attempts by the states to oust judicial review. In the case of the Commonwealth, the Constitution is clear – the High Court has an entrenched power to issue remedies for excess of power by Commonwealth officials. There is no similar express entrenchment for excess of power by state officials. In Kirk, the High Court said that the Constitution does impose limitations on the extent to which states can insulate administrators from judicial review. This, the High Court said, was implicit in two parts of the Constitution. First, chapter III of the Constitution refers to there being a body called “the Supreme Court of a State. ” The implication from this, according to existing High Court authority, is that “it is beyond the legislative power of a State so to alter the constitution or character of its Supreme Court that it ceases to meet the constitutional description. ” The joint judgment noted that, at the time of federation, the Supreme Courts of the states each had the same jurisdiction as was possessed by the Court of Queen’s Bench in England. That included a power to issue the administrative law writ of certiorari (in effect, a writ to quash an unlawful decision by an administrator). Because the state Supreme Courts possessed this power at federation, the joint judgment said, to take that power away would be to render them no longer “Supreme Courts” within the meaning of the Constitution. The power to supervise and issue remedies for default by state officials was a fundamental feature of a Supreme Court, and one which could not be taken away by state legislation. Second, the High Court repeated a proposition from established authority: “there is but one common law of Australia. ” This unity, the joint judgment appeared to say, is guaranteed by the Constitution when it states that there shall be one “Federal Supreme Court” (the High Court) in which is vested the judicial power of the Commonwealth. The fact that the High Court sits at the apex of Australia’s judicial system creates an environment within which the unity of the common law can be secured – divergence from courts and tribunals below can be considered and corrected by one, Commonwealth body. If a decision-maker’s conduct were immune from review, there is an inherent risk that “distorted positions” will be created – in effect, pockets of public power being exercised in divergent ways. This, the High Court said, was impermissible. Having concluded that, were it to oust judicial review, the privative clause would be invalid, the High Court said (following the same reasoning that it did in Plaintiff S 157) that the clause should be read down so as not to apply to decisions vitiated by fundamental (“jurisdictional”) errors. The result was that the appeal was successful – the Industrial Court had erred, and that error could be reviewed and corrected. Kirk fits neatly into the recent trend of High Court decisions. The Court has shown that despite the absence of a constitutional bill of rights, it still enjoys the capacity within the bounds of the Constitution to act so as to ensure that public power is not abused. Where Parliament gives power, the High Court will construe it narrowly to accord with fundamental legal principles (in this case, the principle that a defendant is entitled to know the particulars of the offence against him or her). Further, the High Court will strictly police any excess of that (already narrowly construed) power, and beware the Parliament that seeks to cut the courts out of that process. The lesson of Kirk is that the states, like the Commonwealth, are not immune from this trend. • David Hume is a visiting fellow at the University of NSW and a practising solicitor.  ...|$|R
40|$| federal {{distribution}} of powers, arguing that determining {{the validity of}} an appropriation law requires us to “remember what position a national government occupies” and to take a broad view in doing so, all the while {{being careful not to}} overstep the division of power between {{the federal government and the}} states. In the AAP Case, thirty years later, Justice Mason largely endorsed the views of Chief Justice Latham. Using an argument closely resembling those put forward in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Case, his Honour argued that section 81 provides a parliamentary sanction for both the withdrawal of money and for its expenditure, but does not “supply legal authority for the Commonwealth’s engagement in the activities in connexion with which the moneys are to be spent. ” How section 81 can authorise the actual spending on a particular purpose without simultaneously authorising the Commonwealth’s “engagement” in that purpose was not entirely clear. Giving special consideration of the federal balance of power, Chief Justice Barwick in the AAP Case held that the words “purposes of the Commonwealth” were strictly words of limitation, not words conferring power. While these “purposes” may not be confined to the heads of legislative power in sections 51 and 52, they were nevertheless not a matter that should be left to the whim of parliament. The overriding imperative for Chief Justice Barwick was to maintain the federal {{distribution of}} power, irrespective of how desirable it might be to give the Commonwealth power in “affairs truly national in nature. ” All this confusion makes it marginally easier to sympathise with Pape’s motivation for bringing the present case (although, perhaps only from an academic perspective, rather than one of personal finances). Despite ultimately losing the case, Pape won on the essential core of his challenge in having the High Court unanimously reject the proposition that section 81 provides a substantive source of power simply to spend. It follows that the real power to actually spend the money appropriated needs to be found elsewhere in the Constitution. But, having agreed on this much, the High Court split on exactly where that might be. The “executive” power (s 61) Having settled the proper operation of sections 81 and 83 of the Constitution, the High Court then turned to determine whether the stimulus package could be justified as an exercise of the executive power (s 61) in combination with the incidental power (s 51 (xxxix)). A bare majority of the court (Chief Justice French, and Justices Gummow, Crennan and <b>Bell</b> in a <b>joint</b> judgment) believed that it could. These judgements borrowed heavily from the reasoning of Justice Mason in the AAP Case that the executive power allows the government to engage in activities “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation and which cannot otherwise be carried on for the benefit of the nation. ” Justices Hayne and Kiefel together conceded that the executive power is broad enough to encompass concern with “national issues,” but rejected the argument that the stimulus package could be justified on this basis. Their Honours still held the Tax Bonus Act be valid, but only to the extent that the provisions of the Act could be read down to redefine the payments as a refund on tax liability (rather than as a bonus), such that the law could be seen as one with respect to taxation under s 51 (ii). Only Justice Heydon, in dissent, held that the payments were wholly invalid. Yet, even for the four Justices who upheld the Act as being supported by section 61, there was disagreement as to the true scope of the executive power and how the Tax Bonus Act might be a law with respect to it. While wary of attempts to define the full extent of the powers of the Executive too concretely, Chief Justice French favoured a conservative interpretation of section 61. His Honour held that the executive power was not limited to the legislative powers listed in section 51 and 52. Nevertheless, the power has to be capable of serving the proper purposes of a national government – that is, it must allow for a capacity to engage in enterprises and activities peculiarly adapted to the Commonwealth as a national polity. The executive power extends to “short-term fiscal measures to meet the adverse economic conditions affecting the nation as a whole, where such measures are on their face peculiarly within the capacity and resources of the Commonwealth Government” (such was His Honour’s description of the Tax Bonus Act). Still, Chief Justice French insisted, as did Justices Hayne and Kiefel in their judgment, that no matter how broadly interpreted, the executive power could not be used to disturb the federal balance of power. “National emergency” The majority’s joint judgment (authored by Justices Gummow, Hayne and Bell) similarly refrained from defining the outer-limits of the executive power, but broadly accepted the proposition that section 61 confers on the executive the power to engage in activities “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation. ” The most remarkable aspect of the majority reasoning is that their Honours determined whether the need for an immediate fiscal stimulus package falls within the executive power by drawing an analogy to “a state of emergency in circumstances of a natural disaster. ” Since the executive is the arm of government most capable and equipped to respond to such a crisis, it follows that it must have a constitutional mandate to do so. In defence of this claim, the majority noted that “the world is experiencing a global recession triggered by a global financial and economic crisis which is the most severe deterioration in the global economy since the Great Depression and the most significant economic crisis since the Second World War. ” Reference was made to, amongst other things, the G 20 Meeting in November 2008, reports issued by the International Monetary Fund, and the government’s own forecasts as evidence that the economic downturn could indeed be categorised as a “crisis” in the constitutionally relevant sense of the word. The other Justices were quick to reject the “national crisis” analogy relied on by the majority, but Justice Heydon was particularly critical: “Modern linguistic usage suggests that the present age is one of ‘emergencies’, ‘crises’, ‘dangers’ and ‘intense difficulties’, of ‘scourges’ and other problems… Even if only a very narrow power to deal with an emergency on the scale of the global financial crisis were recognised, it would not take long before constitutional lawyers and politicians between them managed to convert that power into something capable of almost daily use. The great maxim of governments seeking wider constitutional powers would be: ‘Never allow a crisis to go to waste. ’” Having the benefit of hindsight, and given that the panic surrounding the financial crisis has somewhat abated, we might legitimately ask whether the majority was too quick to call upon the notion of a “national crisis” in this case. Looking forward, it may also be that the majority’s reading of the executive power is so broad as to make the unanimous finding as to the scope of section 81 redundant. If you reject the proposition that section 81 provides parliament with free rein to spend public money on any purpose it sees fit, but replace it with the proposition that anything vaguely resembling a “crisis” or “emergency” might justify an expansive use of the executive power in support of such spending anyway, is the practical effect on the parliamentary power to spend not essentially the same? Indeed, on one reading, it seems as though the confusion over the meaning of the phrase “purposes of the Commonwealth” found in section 81 has merely been replaced with confusion over the meaning of “peculiarly adapted to the government of a nation. ” As Justice Heydon pointed out, there are clearly good practical and political reasons to prevent appropriations from being abused as a means of creating de facto legislative powers. But there is an equally legitimate concern that the capacity of the federal government to spend public money is not too tightly constrained. The practical implications of rendering Acts of appropriation invalid after they have been passed – or even after the money has already been spent – are vast. Still, given the substitution of focus from section 81 to section 61, it may be something of an over-statement to claim that all parliamentary appropriations made over the last century thought to be supported by a “power” in section 81 are now at risk of being declared constitutionally invalid. It is far from clear that the Pape Case has compromised the spending power of the Commonwealth. The phrase “purposes of the Commonwealth” in section 81 was, at its widest, basically unlimited. While it is unlikely that the scope of the executive power will ever be quite that expansive, notions of being “peculiarly suited to national government” and of “national crisis” might be sufficiently broad to allow the Commonwealth to largely do what it wants anyway. On the other hand, neither of these concepts have been adequately defined in the present case and the ambiguity inherent in both might ultimately make life for the Commonwealth more difficult than it has been in the past when it comes to spending from the public purse. • Tessa Meyrick is researcher with the Gilbert + Tobin Centre of Public Law at the University of New South Wales Photo: Linda & Colin McKie/ iStockphoto. com  ...|$|R
