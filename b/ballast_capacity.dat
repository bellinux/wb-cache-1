40|$|This {{review paper}} {{summarizes}} the legislative framework and the available technologies for ballast water treatment {{with regard to}} the approval process and relevant issues. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) sets the limits of organism concentration in ballast water allowed to be discharged into the sea. The 2004 International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water and Sediments is the first international document that introduced obligatory ballast water management and control. Even though ballast water treatment systems are not 100 % effective, they significantly reduce the risk of spreading of invasive species through ballast water exchange. An increased manufacturer interest in the system’s approval or development of new technologies is not expected in future because the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. The final choice of optimal ballast water treatment system depends on the ship owner or operator taking into account the price, type of the ship, whether it is a newbuilding or an existing ship, <b>ballast</b> system <b>capacity</b> and the seas where ships ply as well as harbours at which they call...|$|R

With a draught of 3, 5 m respectively 3, 0 m both units have higher dead-weight than existing Rhine - sea - ships. The container vessel has a length less than 100 m and a breadth of 17, 20 m. The stowage of 6 containers in width is possible. The total container capacity amounts 256 TEUs in 4 layers (2 layers on deck). Due to the relatively large breadth the ship was designed as twin-screw vessel. The gas carrier has nearly the recently approved maximum length of 135 m for the river Rhine. The ship was designed as gas carrier for liquefied gas under pressure in separate pressure tanks. The two ships have relatively high stability. Sufficient <b>ballast</b> water <b>capacity</b> is available, in order to improve the seaworthiness under worse weather conditions. A numerical optimisation of the hull-form was carried out for the container vessel.

50|$|After {{delivering}} their cargo, empty commercial ships {{need to take}} {{up water}} from the port of arrival {{in order to maintain}} stability and ensure safe navigation conditions before heading back to the port of departure. This water, called ballast water, which contains aquatic organisms typical of the port of arrival, is stored in ballast tanks and is ultimately discharged at the port of departure when the ship is ready to be re-loaded. During this process, aquatic organisms capable of surviving in ballast water are released into new environments and can therefore become invasive species, causing serious economic and public health issues. Following the ratification of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention, commercial ships will have to treat their ballast water in order to comply with maximum discharge standards established for organisms in different size categories (IMO’s D-2 Standards and US Coast Guard Standards). However, some organisms are capable of surviving or even recovering after harsh treatments, leading to regrowth in ballast water tanks before discharge. In order to minimise regrowth and hence avoid exceeding discharge limits, different criteria such as duration of the journey, <b>ballast</b> water tanks <b>capacity</b> and water flow rate at intake and discharge, among others, should be considered when choosing an appropriate type-approved ballast water treatment systems (BWTS).|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) and ballast water treatment regulations by the International Maritime Organization, the fluctuation of fuel price levels, along with the continuous endeavor of the shipping industry for economic growth and profits has led the shipbuilding industry to explore new and cost-efficient designs for various types of merchant ships. In this respect, proper use of modern computer-aided design/computer-aided engineering systems (CAD/CAE) extends the design space, while generating competitive designs with innovative features in short lead time. The present article deals with the parametric design and optimization of containerships. The developed methodology, {{which is based on}} the CAESES/Friendship-Framework software system, is demonstrated by the conceptual design and multiobjective optimization of a midsized, 6500 -TEU containership. The methodology includes a complete parametric model of the ship’s external and internal geometry and the development and coding of all models necessary for the determination of the design constraints and the design efficiency indicators, which are used for the evaluation of parametrically generated designs. Such indicators defining the objective functions of a multiobjective optimization problem are herein the EEDI, the required freight rate, the ship’s zero <b>ballast</b> container box <b>capacity,</b> and the ratio of the above to below deck number of containers.

40|$|An {{average of}} three to five billion tons of ballast water (BW) is transported {{globally}} per year; 79 million tons of which is released into U. S. waters. Ballast water is necessary for large ships to maintain balance and stability while loading and unloading cargo as well as during transit. As a ship unloads it?s cargo at a port, it takes on ballast water {{and then when it}} loads cargo at the next port, it discharges the ballast water, thus transferring water from port to port. Aquatic organisms are transported around the globe via ballast water. These organisms can potentially cause serious environmental and human health impacts. Historically, transfer of macro-organisms such as fish, snails, and vascular plants via ballast water have been the focus of ballast water research. More recently, microorganisms such as toxin producing dinoflagellates and diatoms i. e. ?harmful algal blooms? and pathogenic bacteria (e. g. Vibrio cholerae), have been found to survive in ballast tanks for several weeks. These organisms have moved to the forefront of ballast water management (BWM) trepidations because they compose serious threats to human health as well as Marine Protected Area (MPA) ecosystems such as coral reefs. Ballasting activities of ships calling at the Port of Houston were used as a model for other major ports in U. S. Gulf States. Ballast water management reports, submitted to the U. S. Coast Guard by all overseas vessels calling at the Port of Houston in 2010 were examined for the ballast management strategies utilized prior to docking. Currently, all ?coastwise? ships are not required to conduct ballast water exchanges (BWE) if they do not transit beyond the 200 nm EEZ. Close inspection of BW management report forms for ?overseas? ships determined that the degree of completeness was variable. By comparing the frequency of vessels entering the Port of Houston, <b>ballast</b> water <b>capacities,</b> the management types utilized, and the locations of ballast water exchanges and discharges, it can be concluded that larger vessels present the highest risk of bacterial transfer to coral reefs. Five coral diseases were discovered to be prevalent throughout the ballast management areas their presence has significantly increased in these areas over the past thirty years. The combination of this disease growth along with an increase in shipping and ballast exchanges suggests that the vector at which pathogens are being displaced must lie within the shipping lanes...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Dünyada ticari eşyaların % 80 ’i deniz taşımacılığı ile taşınmaktadır ve her yıl yaklaşık olarak 3 - 5 milyar balast suyu uluslararası denizlerde bu şekilde {{transfer}} edilmektedir. Balast suyunun bu şekilde taşınması geminin dengesi ve stabilitesinin sağlanması için gereklidir. Dünyada farklı limanlarda yapılmış olan birçok çalışmada balast suyu sucul organizmaların, bakteri ve virüsleri de içeren insan patojenlerinin transfer edilmesinde önemli bir role sahiptir. Balast suyunun alımı sırasında kıyı sularına deniz istilacı türlerinin girişi ve daha sonra sediment ve biyofilmler ile birlikte uzak limanlarda gemi balast tanklarından tahliyesi kıyı ve deniz ekosistemi için önemli bir tehdit oluşturmaktadır. Balast suyunun yönetimi için ‘Gemi Balast Suları ve Sedimanlarının Kontrolü ve Yönetimi Uluslararası Sözleşmesi’ Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü tarafından 2004 yılında kabul edilmiştir. Bu sözleşmede, balast suyu değişimi için D- 1 standardı, balast suyunun performansı için D- 2 standardı, güvenlik, test gereklilikleri ve prosedürleri ile birlikte istisnai durumlar tanımlanmıştır. Yeni balast suyu kurallarına uyum sağlanması, önümüzdeki yıllar içinde denizcilik endüstrisinin en önemli maliyet güçlüğü olarak karşısına çıkacaktır. Balast suyu yönetimi sözleşmesine göre, 2009 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 1500 m 3 ’ten küçük olan gemiler ile 2012 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 5000 m 3 ’ten büyük gemilerde 2016 yılı sonuna kadar ve 2009 yılından önce inşa edilmiş, balast kapasitesi 1500 – 5000 m 3 arasında olan gemilerde 2014 yılı sonuna kadar D- 2 standardının sağlanması gerekmektedir. Bu sebepten tüm ilgililer Uluslararası Denizcilik Örgütü kurallarına göre alternatif sistemler araştırmaktadır. Tank sedimanlarının yönetim masraflarına ek olarak sözleşmenin D- 2 performans standartlarını karşılamak için oluşan masrafları ve operasyonel düzenlemeleri azaltmak veya kaçınmak için balast suyu yönetimi alternatiflerine olan ilgi gün geçtikçe artmaktadır. Bazı armatörler yerel standartlara sahip özel bölgelerde balast suyunu tahliye etmek için yeterli sisteme sahip değildir veya arıtım sistemleri bulunmamaktadır. Bu yüzden balast suyu yönetimi kurallarını karşılayabilmek için liman balast suyu alım tesislerinin mevcut bulunması balast suyunu tahliye etmek için alternatif çözüm olacaktır. Fakat bu liman balast suyu alım tesislerinin, kurulumunda ve işletilmesinde yaşanabilecek zorlukların değerlendirilmesinin yapılması gerekmektedir. Bunun için mevcut atık alım tesisleri ele alınabilir. Türkiye özelinde 2013 yılında 1717 geminin uğrak yaptığı Borusan limanı değerlendirildiğinde mevcut atık alım tesislerinden çok daha fazla elleçleme kapasitesine sahip alım tesislerine ihtiyaç bulunmaktadır. Balast suyunun alternatif yönetiminde, gemi dizaynları ile balast suyunun tahliye edilmemesi, balast suyunun kullanılmaması, konteyner gemilerinde balast suyu olarak katı balast kullanılması ve akış yöntemleri ile kaldırma kuvvetinden yararlanılan yöntemler bulunmaktadır.

Shipping {{moves over}} 80 % of the world’s commodities and transfers approximately 3 to 5 {{billion tons of}} ballast water internationally each year {{that is necessary to}} provides ships’ trimming and stability. Many studies signified {{in different parts of the}} world have shown that ships’ ballast water has very important role for the transfer aquatic organism, human pathogens, including bacteria and viruses. Therefore, the marine environment is at risk to happen a serious ecological problem during discharging ballast water. The introduction of marine invasive species to coastal waters when ships take on ballast water at one port and then discharge with water, sediments, and biofilms from ships’ ballast water tanks it at other, ports is a significant threat to coastal and ocean ecosystems and economies. And, impacts on human and animal health, the environment and socio-economic activities appear. For example, the European zebra mussel has infested over 40 % of internal waterways in United States. In 2004, with ‘International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments’ is adopted by International Maritime Organization, that describes D- 1 standard for ballast water exchange, D- 2 standard for ballast water performance, including the safety, testing requirements and procedures together with exceptional cases. Complying with the new ballast regulations is one of the most significant cost challenges the shipping industry can except to face over the next few years. According to the Ballast Water Management convention, D- 2 standard must be provided for the <b>ballast</b> water <b>capacity</b> less than 1500 m 3 (built from 2009) and the <b>ballast</b> water <b>capacity</b> greater than 5000 m 3 (built from 2012) until the end of 2016 and the <b>ballast</b> water <b>capacity</b> between 1500 – 5000 m 3 (built from 2009) until the end of 2014. For this reason, all parties have been researching alternative systems as per International Maritime Organization regulations. This study describes ballast water treatment systems together with ballast water and invasive species description. The ballast water treatment technology used to treat ballast water has generally been derived from other treatment systems, in which forms of solid-liquid separation and disinfection processes were applied. There are three treatment technology types, which are generally combined that are mechanical, chemical and disinfection. Most systems employ a two-stage approach involving mechanical separation at the first stage, followed by a second stage physical or chemical treatment. At this stage some systems use a combination of two or more treatments. In this study summarizes some systems which were approved or designed and tested. Chemical treatment use active substances to treat microorganisms, and for this, sufficient stocks will have to be carried on board. Therefore, this treatment would not be preferred by shipowners due to producing by-products with their chemical reactions to cause environmental threat. There are so many treatment systems on the market. The existing vessels can be integrated and retrofitted with these systems. Following adoption of the Ballast Water Management Convention, interest in these alternatives to conventional Ballast Water Management has increased since they offer ways to avoid, or substantially reduce, the operational issues and costs of treating compartmentalized ballast water to meet the Convention’s respective D- 2 discharge standards, plus the cost of managing tank sediments. There is limited information in evaluating of these new technologies in reducing the transfer of harmful species in accordance with the goals of the Ballast Water Management Convention. This study gives informations and perspectives about intaking ballast water in the port reception facilities together with alternative methods related with the ballast water management. Ships that cannot meet this requirement for onboard ballast water treatment may be allowed to discharge ballast water to a port-based ballast water reception facility, which is generally understood to mean either a shore-based or barge-based ballast water treatment facility. This system has some disadvantages such as potential delays, sufficient space and equipment suitability. For this, in this study gives case study of port of Baltimore as an example to analyze economically and logistically port reception facilities. According to this case, port reception facility are feasible. On the other hand, technically that can be challenges. Additionally, port reception facilities evaluate in Turkey from this perspective and compared with the port of Baltimore for space situation. Some shipowners have not ballast water treatment system or, have treatment system but their system performance is not enough to discharge of ballast water at the special zones where exist a local standard. Therefore, complying with ballast water regulations, port reception facilities will be alternative solution in order to discharge ballast water. In this study gives information about waste reception facilities in Turkey to analyze challenges that can be occurred in port reception facilities. For this, when Borusan port where called 1717 vessels in 2013 is evaluated, it appears that ports need a port ballast water reception facilities which has more capacity than present waste reception facilities. Additionally, there are many concepts have been designed zero or minimal discharge (such as storm ballast, internal ballast and potable water), no ballast or continuous flow methods that are longitudinal trunks, ship buoyancy control and enhanced ballast water exchange concepts. All continuous flow systems readily exceed the performance required by the D- 1 exchange standard but this standard is to be withdrawn at the end of 2014 / 2016. In regard to other zero ballast methods that may include their high build costs and relatively large wetted surfaces when loaded. The amount will vary according to the design cargo type and capacity, cargo loading and unloading requirements and other trading factors. At the same time, solid ballast method can be alternatively used for the container vessel. As container vessels can be arranged for solid ballast with empty positioning in export and import leg on their rotation. This method would be more attractive for retrofits or new builds than modified container ships. Results of this study underline that alternative system is very crucial for removing invasive species. In the future studies, numeric analyses and assessments of port reception facilities and the other alternative systems such as ballast free and no ballast can be proposed. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R

Uluslararası nakliyeciliğin % 90 'ının gemiler ile yapıldığı günümüzde, gemilerin maksimum yük ve minimum balast ile seyir etmeleri ekonomik olarak tercih edilse de, gemilerin güvenli seyri açısından bu mümkün değildir. Gemilerin balast tanklarına alınan balast suyu ile her gün yaklaşık 7. 000 canlı farklı bir ekosisteme taşınmaktadır. Bu canlıların bir kısmı balast tanklarındaki koşullara karşı dayanıklı olup, geminin sefer süresi boyunca hayatta kalabilmektedirler. Hayatta kalmayı başarabilen canlılar, kimi zaman balast suyu ile boşaltıldıkları ekosistemlerde varlıklarını sürdürüp, yerli türlerin varlığını tehdit edebilirler. Bu yabancı türler sadece ekosistemdeki canlılara zarar vermekle kalmaz, balıkçılığı etkileyerek ekonomik zararlara yol açabilirler, insan sağlığına zarar verebilirler ve sahillerde biyolojik kirliliğe neden olup deniz turizmini olumsuz yönde etkilerler. Balast tanklarındaki su ile taşınan zararlı sucul istilacı türlerin verdikleri zararların boyutlarının ciddi olduğunun farkına varılması ile, ulusal ve uluslararası düzeyde pek çok düzenleme ve çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Yapılan çalışmalar, balast tankları ile taşınan istilacı türlerin sorun olmalarını engellemek için, balast suyunun bu canlılardan arındrılmasına yönelik sistemlerin geliştirilmesini sağlamıştır.

Bu gereklilik ticari açıdan pek çok üretici firmanın balast suyu arıtma sistemi geliştirmesi ile sonuçlanmıştır. Piyasada balast suyu arıtma sistemi üreticileri arasındaki rekabet, gemi sahiplerini gemileri için en uygun olan sistemi seçme konusunda zora sokmaktadır. Çalışmada, hangi yöntemler ile balast suyu arıtılabilindiğine dair detaylı bilgi verilmiş, sonrasında ise balast suyu arıtma sistemi seçerken dikkat edilmesi gereken teknik ve ticari konulara değinilmiştir. Yeni inşa edilen gemiler için sistem seçmek problem olmasa da, Gemi Balast Suları ve Sedimenti Kontrolü ve Yönetimi Sözleşmesi yürürlüğe girdikten sonra inşa yılı eski olan pek çok gemiye balast suyu arıtma sisteminin entegre edilmesi, hem teknik hem de ticari açıdan oldukça zorlu bir süreçtir. Çalışmada detayları anlatılan Anahtar Performans Göstergeleri (KPI) yöntemi ile sistemin kullanılacağı gemilerin özelliklerine göre aynı anda pek çok sistem karşılaştırılıp, en uygun olan sistemin belirlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Maritime {{transportation}} {{has significant}} importance for international trade. Today, ships carry approximately 90 {{percent of all}} global trade. For commercial concerns, it is preferred to travel with maximum cargo and minimum ballast. However, as ballast water is used to provide stability and maneuverability during voyage, travelling with minimum ballast can cause safety problems on ships. In 1800 's, solid materials such as sand, detritus and iron were usually loaded onboard {{in order to provide}} ballast. After use, these materials were discharged to water and could be able to used by other ships. But this technique was not only time consuming but also not effective. By technological progresses through the end of 1800 's, the sea water had been used as ballast. There were not segregated ballast water tanks as it is today. The water used as ballast was stored in empty cargo tanks. The remain of the cargo such as oil, iron, etc. mixed with ballast water. The mix of these remains and water could be toxic and discharging these water to the marine environment were caused environmental and health problems. After realizing these problems, in 1980 's, segregated ballast water tanks were designed and used in order to provide contamination of ballast water. However, as the ballast water became cleaner, there arrised another problems, invasive species. With ballast waters, every day more than 7. 000 different marine species are transferred to different ecosystems. The size of the organisms in ballast water varies from micrometric viruses to organisms up to thirty centimeters. The ones who can survive in ballast tank conditions are discharged at other ports within ballast water. These organisms are called as "invasive species". The introduction of invasive marine species into a new environments by ships' ballast water has been stated as one of the four greatest treats to marine ecosystems. The problems due to the invaisve species can be analyzed in three main sections; impacts on ecology, impacts on economy and impacts on health. Introducing of invasive species can cause problems on native species. The most known example of invasive species effects on environment is recorded in Grate Lakes, United States. This area has been damaged by more than 180 invasive species during years. Zebra mussels, sea lamprey, alewife etc. were introduced to lakes and spreaded, competed with native species and damaged the food chain. These invasion problem also have effects on fisheries, factories n coastal areas. The zebra mussels has spreads more than 40 percent of US waters and cost more than US$ 750 million between 1989 - 2000. Also, it is estimated that invasive species cause US$ 138 billion per year in only USA. Moreover, if the ballast water contaminated with pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae discharged into the sea, this may cause illness and death in humans. After realizing these serious problems caused by the organisms carried in ballast water, there have been conducting national and international regulations. In 2004, the IMO introduced "International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments". With these regulations, the problems caused by ballast water have attracted attentions and the companies have started to research and develop ballast water management technologies. The Convention will enter into force 12 months after ratification by 30 States, representing 35 per cent of world merchant shipping tonnage. Once entered into force, BMW convention requires all ships to use ballast water treatment systems in order to meet Ballast Water Performance Standard (Regulation D- 2). There have been introduced many different ballast water treatment methods. These methods can be mainly divided in three groups; mechanical methods, physical methods and chemical methods. The mechanical methods are filtration and cyclonic separation. With these applications, organisms bigger than 40 - 50 micron can be able to seperated from ballast water. As physical methods, there have been developed system that use heat treatment, ultra sound treatment, de-oxidizing, ultra viole and coagulation. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this study, these advantages and disadvantages of the methods are explained in details. There are also systems that uses oxidizing or non-oxidizing biocides. However, using there method on its own is not enough for BMW convention requires. In order to meet these requirement, usually combined systems such as mechanical + physical or mechanical + chemical are used for ballast water management. There are many companies developed new technologies and systems in order to treat ballast water. As the number of the companies and systems are a lot, shipyards and ship owners have difficulties to find the most suitable ballast water treatment system for their ship. To be able to find the suitable system, there are some factors that need to be considered by both system distributers and shipyards/ship owners. The most important point is the ship type, thus <b>ballast</b> <b>capacity</b> of the vessel. The vessels are divided into two categories in terms of their ballast capacity; high ballast dependent vessels such as bulk carriers and tankers and low ballast dependent vessels such as containerships and other vessels like chemical carriers, passenger ships, Ro/Ro etc. As the range of the ballast capacities are wide range, this can be determinant factor to choose ballast water treatment system, because many companies are powerful in certain pump capacity ranges. Also the water characteristics such as turbidity, salinity and silt content has effects on ballast water treatment. Other factors such as space, power requirement, vessel service area, health and safety requirements are investigated in details. A case study has been examined in seventh section of the study. There has been chosen two ships in order to show how to decide ballast water treatment system. Three combined systems using filtration + UV are considered for the vessels. Technical and design details are given in section 7. After comparing investment and operating costs of the system, the most suitable one is chosen for each vessel. The detailed investment and operation cost comparison is given in the related section. This part shows how a shipyard approaches choosing a ballast water treatment system for a vessel. However, once the BMW regulations enter into force, there will be many vessels that are need to be retrofitted. The system choosing period will not be that easy. In section eight, the main focus area of this study is explained. As there will be a huge work load on shipyards/system distributors to identify the most suitable system for many vessels. In this section, a model developed in Microsoft Excel to find suitable systems that can be applied to many vessels by using Key Performance Indicators (KPI). The model has two parts. In first part, there has been developed an automatic process to eliminate the unsuitable systems. The requirements set up by shipyards/ship owners are compared with the systems' data. With this process, the systems that are not meet the shipyards'/ship owners' requirements are identified. In second part, the system are compared in details. Every criterias which are stated in the study are graded from 1 to 6 and compared with each other. This process helps us to specify system points and find the most suitable system for vessel/vessels. In this study, only two vessels and three systems for each vessel are examined due to the confidentiality. Even so, the advantages of using KPI while choosing a ballast water treatment system can be easily seen from the study. In case of many system offers, in order to make better comparison, using KPI has benefits for shipyards. This study shows that KPI analyze makes system selection easy and reliable. Yüksek LisansM.
