40|$|The {{feasibility}} of developing an eco-friendly bench-scale zeolitization process of NaP 1 from an Al-containing waste and under recycling of effluents was evaluated. Prior lab-scale tests {{were performed to}} optimize the synthesis conditions. The mixture of effluents, i. e., mother liquors (ML) from the synthesis and rinse water (RW) from the cleaning step of the zeolites, was recycled several times to study the reduction of raw materials (NaOH and water) and accordingly the reduction of costs. The <b>bench-scale</b> <b>process</b> allows the complete transformation of the waste into NaP 1 zeolite, reaching equivalent reaction yields (2. 5 ton of zeolite per ton of waste) to the lab-scale process and avoiding the generation of new solid residues. The effect of the recycling of effluents on the physical-chemical properties of the resulting zeolites was investigated. NaP 1 zeolite was the only crystalline phase obtained, showing morphological, textural and crystalline characteristics closely similar to NaP 1 synthesized from fresh NaOH aqueous solutions and from pure chemical reagents. NaOH and water consumption savings of 80 and 67 %, respectively, were obtained, representing a cost reduction around 70 %. These {{results show that the}} <b>bench-scale</b> <b>process</b> to obtain NaP 1 from an Al-waste with recycling of effluents can be a more sustainable alternative compared with the traditional synthesis methods.

40|$|In the {{production}} of ethanol from lignocellulosics, large quantities of water are needed in various process steps. In industrial processes, recycling of process streams is necessary to minimise fresh water requirements and decrease the amount of wastewater produced. This leads to increases in various substances, both volatile and non-volatile which inhibit fermentation. In the present Study ethanol was produced from softwood in a <b>bench-scale</b> <b>process</b> development unit. The stillage stream from the distillation step was fractionated by evaporation and various evaporation fractions characterised and their inhibitory effect on fermentation investigated. irt {{was found that the}} volatile fractions have no negative effect on the fermentation while the non-volatile fraction inhibited fermentation and resulted in a decreased yield. Simulation of a six-effect evaporation unit based on the experimental data shows that the intermediate evaporation condensate fractions are most suited for disposal. The chemical and biological oxygen demands are only about 10 % of the value in the stillage stream. Evaporation {{has been shown to be}} an effective way to drastically diminish the build-up of inhibitory compounds when process streams are recirculated, but the energy demand is high. Various process configurations to reduce the energy demand are suggested. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Synthesizing {{complex and}} large {{molecules}} out of small molecules derived by fermentation processes {{is a key}} factor for future processes based on renewable resources. Promising steps are the self-condensation of alcohols and the cross-condensation of alcohols with acetone. The presented continuous heterogeneous-catalytic gas-phase process {{makes it possible to}} condense small alcohols and ketones to larger hydrocarbon molecules containing only one atom of oxygen per molecule. After an optional oxygen-removing step such as hydrotreatment, fuel-identical hydrocarbons including jet fuel can be obtained. A tailor-made carbon chain distribution and additionally carbon-chain branching can be achieved. The choice of raw materials, the process conditions and the recycling of intermediate products are tuning factors. The crude or partially distilled product can be used neat as drop-in fuel for diesel. The intermediates – longer ketones, primary and secondary alcohols – also serve as value-added raw materials and intermediates for many chemical applications, i. e. plasticizers, surfactants, alkenes, solvents, fatty alcohols, and lubricants. The presented process offers an attractive alternative to other competing processes producing long-chain hydrocarbons, like Fischer-Tropsch or hydrotreatment of fats and oils. Being based on inexpensive, long-term stable and commercially available catalysts and designed {{for a wide range of}} possible raw materials optionally stemming from residues, the suggested route is ready for scale-up.

40|$|BACKGROUND The variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease {{incidence}} peaked {{a decade}} ago and has since declined. Based on epidemiologic evidence, the causative agent, pathogenic prion, has not constituted a tangible contamination threat to large-scale manufacturing of human plasma-derived proteins. Nonetheless, manufacturers have studied the prion removal capabilities of various manufacturing steps to better understand product safety. Collectively analyzing the results could reveal experimental reproducibility and detect trends and mechanisms driving prion removal. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies collected more than 200 prion removal studies on plasma protein manufacturing steps, including precipitation, adsorption, chromatography, and filtration, as well as combined steps. The studies used a range of model spiking agents and <b>bench-scale</b> <b>process</b> replicas. The results were grouped based on key manufacturing variables to identify factors impacting removal. The log reduction values of a group are presented for comparison. RESULTS Overall prion removal capacities evaluated by independent groups were in good agreement. The removal capacity evaluated using biochemical assays was consistent with prion infectivity removal measured by animal bioassays. Similar reduction values were observed for a given step using various spiking agents, except highly purified prion protein in some circumstances. Comparison between combined and single-step studies revealed complementary or overlapping removal mechanisms. Steps with high removal capacities represent the conditions where the physiochemical differences between prions and therapeutic proteins are most significant. CONCLUSION The results support the intrinsic ability of certain plasma protein manufacturing steps to remove prions {{in case of an}} unlikely contamination, providing a safeguard to products...|$|E
40|$|The enzymatic {{hydrolysis}} {{process can be}} used to produce bioethanol from softwood, which are the dominating raw material in the Northern hemisphere. This thesis deals with the development of the process focusing on the pretreatment and the {{enzymatic hydrolysis}} stages. The influence of pretreatment conditions on sugar yield, and the effect of inhibitors on the ethanol yield, were investigated for spruce and pine. The maximum yields of hemicellulose sugars and glucose were obtained under different pretreatment conditions. This indicates that two-stage pretreatment may be preferable. The added catalysts, H 2 SO 4 and SO 2, resulted in similar total sugar yields about 40 g/ 100 g dry raw material. However, the fermentability of SO 2 -impregnated material was better. This pretreatment resulted in the formation of inhibitors to the subsequent process steps, e. g. sugar and lignin degradation products. The glucose yield in the enzymatic hydrolysis stage was affected by various parameters such as enzyme loading, temperature, pH, residence time, substrate concentration, and agitation. To decrease the amount of fresh water used and thereby waste water produced, the sugar-rich pre-hydrolysate from the pretreatment step was included in the enzymatic hydrolysis of the solid fraction, resulting in a reduction in the cellulose conversion of up to 36 %. Different prehydrolysate detoxification methods, such as treatment with Ca(OH) 2, laccase, and fermentation using yeast, were investigated. The latter was shown to be very efficient. The amount of fresh water used can be further reduced by recycling various process streams. This was simulated experimentally in a <b>bench-scale</b> <b>process.</b> A reduction in fresh water demand of 50 % was obtained without any further negative effects on either hydrolysis or fermentation...|$|E

The substrates used for TVFAs production consisted of papaya, apple and banana. The H 2 S produced from the degradation of TVFAs was utilized for the precipitation of a metal-contaminated effluent collected from Bolivar mine (Oruro, Bolivia). The maximum concentration of H 2 S obtained was approximately 16 mM. Removal efficiencies of ca. 100 % for copper, above 94 % for zinc, and above 92 % for lead were achieved. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The use {{of pattern}} {{recognition}} for model-based adaptive control is presented. Vector quantizing neural networks (VQNs) analyze patterns displayed in recent {{histories of the}} process input, output and controller error. The results of these analyses lead to diagnoses and adaptive actions. Process excitation diagnostics are made for online model regression. Performance feedback diagnostics are made for updating both process model and controller tuning parameters. ^ Traditional control algorithms do {{not account for the}} nonlinearity and nonstationarity of chemical processes so they are unable to track changing process characters. The effort they exert toward keeping the process at set point becomes too great or too small and controller performance degrades. Performance feedback adaptive algorithms update the controller parameters in response to observed controller performance. This tracks the changing process character and maintains desired performance. Model-based adaptive algorithms update a process model used in controller design. These are widely applicable to any model-based controller. ^ Presented here are pattern-based approaches to performance feedback and model-based adaptive control. These tools are designed and demonstrated individually using VQNs to perform the pattern recognition task. ^ One pattern-based tool analyzes process input and controller error response patterns after changes in set point and unmeasured disturbances. This leads to diagnoses concerning controller performance and disturbance character. These diagnoses determine appropriate adaptive actions for updating both model and controller tuning parameters. ^ A second pattern-based tool continuously analyzes the recent histories of the process input and output to determine if dynamic trends exist. The results of these analyses are used to diagnose if input-output data contain sufficient dynamics for online model regression. Once determined valid, the new model is used to redesign the controller. ^ These pattern-based tools are combined into a unified adaptive framework. A supervisory adaptation logic allows the adaptive mechanisms to work together to maintain both model accuracy and desired controller performance. This framework is implemented as a piggy-back adaptive module and investigated as a viable commercial product.

40|$|AbstractAir Liquide is {{developing}} a cost effective hybrid CO 2 capture process based on sub-ambient temperature operation of a hollow fiber membrane in combination with cryogenic separation. These membranes, when operated at temperatures below - 20 ˚C, show two to four times increase in CO 2 /N 2 selectivity with minimal CO 2 permeance loss compared to ambient temperature values. Long term (6 month) bench-scale testing with CO 2 /N 2 mixtures at sub-ambient conditions has verified the enhanced separation performance seen at lab scale translated to commercial membrane modules [1, 2]. A relatively high CO 2 capture rate is required to drive down the cost per tonne of captured CO 2 as it valorizes {{the cost of the}} flue gas pre-treatment and compression prior to the membrane unit. However, as the CO 2 recovery increases, the productivity of the membrane module decreases, thereby driving up the membrane system capital cost. The main reason for this is a “pinch effect”: the CO 2 driving partial pressure differential across the membrane decreases as CO 2 recovery proceeds. Computational fluid dynamics modelling shows that this effect can be partially off-set by a sweep operation where a small fraction (< 5 %) of the N 2 - enriched retentate gas is fed into the permeate chamber. Experimental measurements were made with a commercial 12 ” membrane module, as a function of CO 2 recovery, in both sweep and non-sweep (baseline) mode. At the desired 90 % CO 2 recovery level, sweep operation resulted in 30 % higher membrane productivity with negligible effect on permeate purity. This would result in 30 % lower membrane system cost with negligible change in specific energy for CO 2 capture. <b>Bench-scale</b> <b>process</b> optimization work with synthetic CO 2 /N 2 mixtures is currently being performed within Air Liquide's Delaware Research & Technology Center, USA; this will be followed by field testing at the National Carbon Capture Center (Wilsonville, Alabama, USA) with pre-treated flue gas from air-fired coal combustion...|$|E

Gevo separately advanced chemical technology to convert isobutanol through a patented process (dehydration, oligomerization, hydrogenation, and fractionation) into Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) Jet Fuel blendstock. Gevo worked for over eight years with ASTM, a worldwide standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical standards, to introduce Gevo’s ATJ technology into the specification D 7566 “Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons”.

40|$|The direct {{synthesis}} from {{hydrogen and}} oxygen is a green alternative for production of hydrogen peroxide. However, this process suffers from two challenges. Firstly, mixtures of {{hydrogen and oxygen}} are explosive {{over a wide range}} of concentrations (4 - 94 % H 2 in O 2). Secondly, the catalytic reaction of hydrogen and oxygen involves several reaction pathways, many of them resulting in water production and therfore decreasing selectivity. The present work deals with these two challenges. The safety problem was dealed by employing a novel microstructured reactor. Selectivity of the reaction was highly improved by development a set of new catalysts. The final goal was to develop an effective and safe continuous process for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from H 2 and O 2. Activated carbon cloth and Sibunit were examined as the catalysts’ supports. Palladium and gold monometallic and palladium-gold bimetallic catalysts were thoroughly investigated by numerous kinetic experiments performed in a tailored batch reactor and several catalyst charachterization methods. A complete set of data for direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 and its catalytic decomposition and hydrogenation was obtained. These data were used to assess factors influencing selectivity and activity of the catalysts in direct synthesis of H 2 O 2 as well as its decomposition and hydrogenation.

40|$|Both photo-Fenton {{oxidation}} and {{the combination}} of aerobic sequencing batch reactor (SBR) + photo-Fenton processes were investigated in a bench-scale study to degrade and reuse a real textile wastewater with Total Organic Carbon (TOC) = 390 mg L- 1, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) = 1560 mg L- 1 O- 2 and Escherichia coli = 80000 CFU mL(- 1) in further dyeing processes. The independent variables considered {{for the evaluation of}} the oxidative process were temperature, H 2 O 2 and Fe (II) concentrations. Required treated water qualities were determined by both RD 1620 / 2007 (Spanish Normative for wastewater reclamation and reuse) and specific water qualities for internal reuse. The best results were obtained when applying photo-Fenton process as a polishing step, where previous aerobic SBR under 1 day hydraulic retention time (HRT), gave 75 % TOC reduction after 25 cycles. The further photo-Fenton process coupled under: ([Fe (II) ] = 66. 5 mg L- 1; [H 2 O 2] = 1518 mg L- 1; T = 25 degrees C and pH = 2. 7) conditions, achieved final COD and TOC reductions of 97 and 95 % respectively. E. coil was fully removed according to specific normative. Finally, in order to accomplish specific water qualities for 100 % internal reuse, resultant water was further conditioned by reverse osmosis and reused in <b>bench-scale</b> simulated dyeing <b>processes,</b> providing similar dyeing results in terms of K/S than those obtained by using fresh water.

40|$|Microreactors {{have proven}} to be {{versatile}} tools for process intensification. Over recent decades, they have increasingly been used for product and process development in chemical industries. Enhanced heat and mass transfer in the reactors due to the extremely high surfacearea- to-volume ratio and interfacial area allow chemical processes to be operated at extreme conditions. Safety is improved by the small holdup volume of the reactors and effective control of pressure and temperature. Hydrogen peroxide is a powerful green oxidant that is used {{in a wide range of}} industries. Reduction and auto-oxidation of anthraquinones is currently the main process for hydrogen peroxide production. Direct synthesis is a green alternative and has potential for on-site production. However, there are two limitations: safety concerns because of the explosive gas mixture produced and low selectivity of the process. The aim of this thesis was to develop a process for direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide utilizing microreactor technology. Experimental and numerical approaches were applied for development of the microreactor. Development of a novel microreactor was commenced by studying the hydrodynamics and mass transfer in prototype microreactor plates. The prototypes were designed and fabricated with the assistance of CFD modeling to optimize the shape and size of the microstructure. Empirical correlations for the mass transfer coefficient were derived. The pressure drop in micro T-mixers was investigated experimentally and numerically. Correlations describing the friction factor for different flow regimes were developed and predicted values were in good agreement with experimental results. Experimental studies were conducted to develop a highly active and selective catalyst with a proper form for the microreactor. Pd catalysts supported on activated carbon cloths were prepared by different treatments during the catalyst preparation. A variety of characterization methods were used for catalyst investigation. The surface chemistry of the support and the oxidation state of the metallic phase in the catalyst play important roles in catalyst activity and selectivity for the direct synthesis. The direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide was investigated in a <b>bench-scale</b> continuous <b>process</b> using the novel microreactor developed. The microreactor was fabricated based on the hydrodynamic and mass transfer studies and provided a high interfacial area and high mass transfer coefficient. The catalysts were prepared under optimum treatment conditions. The direct synthesis was conducted at various conditions. The thesis represents a step towards a commercially viable direct synthesis. The focus is on the two main challenges: mitigating the safety problem by utilization of microprocess technology and improving the selectivity by catalyst development...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of dissolved aquatic organic matter present in four natural water sources, {{as well as}} corresponding treated waters derived from eight water treatment plants, is described. An assessment is made {{of the performance of}} direct filtration, conventional treatment, and lime softening in removing trihalomethane (THM) precursors from a diverse array of water sources. A comparison is made between conventional treatment and direct filtration in removing THM precursors from a common natural water source, the Colorado River. In addition, the effect of selected initial conditions and operating parameters on the direct filtration process are evaluated by using a synthetic water/bench-scale apparatus. Important {{characteristics of}} the organic matter, including molecular weight (MW) distribution, carboxylic acidity and humic substances content, appear to affect the removal of this organic material. As a general rule, THM reactivity or yield (ug THM/mg C) increases with MW. The < 10, 000 MW range was found to be the most consistent reactive fraction of aquatic organic matter. All of the various treatments preferentially removed the most reactive fraction of precursor present in each MW range. None of the various treatments proved to be very effective in removing precursor material below a MW of < 500. Humic molecules, with the highest carboxylic acidity and hence highest charge density, are generally more difficult to remove by alum coagulation. All of the various treatment processes studied preferentially removed hydrophobic over hydrophilic aquatic organic matter. None of the source related conditions (fulvic acid, kaolinite, pH) nor process-related conditions (flocculation velocity gradient, mixing time, prechlorination, preozonation) evaluated under the same experimental conditions exerted a major impact upon the performance of the <b>bench-scale</b> direct filtration <b>process.</b> Larger sized particles may be easier to remove by bench-scale treatment, but removal of the smaller particles may result in better removals of organic matter as quantified by NVTOC and UV Absorbance...|$|R
40|$|Bechtel, {{together}} with Amax Research and Development Center (Amax R&D), has prepared this study which provides conceptual cost {{estimates for the}} production of premium quality coal-water slurry fuel (CWF) in a commercial plant. Two scenarios are presented, one using column flotation technology and the other the selective agglomeration to clean the coal to the required quality specifications. This study forms part of US Department of Energy program �Engineering Development of Advanced Physical Fine Coal Cleaning for Premium Fuel Applications,� (Contract No. DE-AC 22 - 92 PC 92208), under Task 11, Project Final Report. The primary objective of the Department of Energy program is to develop the design base for prototype commercial advanced fine coal cleaning facilities capable of producing ultra-clean coals suitable for conversion to stable and highly loaded CWF. The fuels should contain less than 2 lb ash/MBtu (860 grams ash/GJ) of HHV and preferably less than 1 lb ash/MBtu (430 grams ash/GJ). The advanced fine coal cleaning technologies to be employed are advanced column froth flotation and selective agglomeration. It is further stipulated that operating conditions during the advanced cleaning process should recover not less than 80 percent of the carbon content (heating value) in the run-of-mine source coal. These goals for ultra-clean coal quality are to be met under the constraint that annualized coal production costs does not exceed $ 2. 5 /MBtu ($ 2. 37 /GJ), including the mine mouth cost of the raw coal. A further objective of the program is to determine the distribution of a selected suite of eleven toxic trace elements between product CWF and the refuse stream of the cleaning <b>processes.</b> Laboratory, <b>bench-scale</b> and <b>Process</b> Development Unit (PDU) tests to evaluate advanced column flotation and selective agglomeration were completed earlier under this program with selected coal samples. A PDU with a capacity of 2 st/h was designed by Bechtel and installed at Amax R&D, Golden, Colorado by Entech Global for process evaluation tests. The tests successfully demonstrated the capability of advanced column flotation as well as selective agglomeration to produce ultra-clean coal at specified levels of purity and recovery efficiency. Test results and the experience gained during the operation of the PDU have provided valuable insights into the processes studied. Based on the design data obtained from the test work and a set of project design criteria, two sets of conceptual designs for commercial CWF production plants have been developed, one using column flotation and the other using selective agglomeration process. Using these designs, Capital as well as Operating and Maintenance (O&M) cost estimates for the plants have been compiled. These estimates have then been used to derive the annualized cost of production of premium CWF on a commercial scale. Further, a series of sensitivity analysis have been completed to evaluate the effects of variations in selected cost components and process parameters on the overall economics of premium fuel productio...|$|R
40|$|A <b>bench-scale</b> ion {{exchange}} <b>process</b> with batch biological denitrification of the spent regenerant brine {{was developed to}} remove nitrate &om drinking water. This research indicates that the combination procedure results in 50 percent reduction of regenerant consumption and 90 percent reduction in the mass of waste salt discharged. The process features a sequencing batch reactor to accomplish the biological denitrification of a 0. 5 N sodium chloride spent regenerant solution. Now being pilot tested in California, the process-which is simple, flexible, and reliable-should be suitable for use by small systems. Contamination of drinking water with nitrate 'presents a health hazard because nitrate (N 03 -) {{can be reduced to}} nitrite (NOz-) ion in the gastrointestinal tract. Nitrite causes methemoglobinemia, a sometimes fatal disease to which infants are particularly susceptible. In addition, nitrate and nitrite have the potential to form carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds that are potent animal carcinogens, al-though they have not been conclusively shown to cause human cancers. '* 2 Thus, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the European Community have es-tablished the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for N 03 [...] N at 10 mg/L and 11. 3 mg/L, re~pectively. ~. ~ Although nitrate is not normally signif-icant in pristine groundwaters, a recent survey of US wells found {{that more than half of}} them contained nitrate at detect-able levels, whereas an estimated 1. 2 per-cent of community wells and 2. 4 percent of rural wells exceeded the 10 mg N 03 [...] N/L MCL 5 In Europe the nitrate prob-lem tends to be worse because of the greater population density. For example, in 1970. 60 public water supplies intermit-tently exceeded 11. 3 mg NOB [...] N/L in En-gland and Wales; in 1980 the number was 90; in 1987 it had risen to 187. 6 World-wide, the situation is similar; nitrate contamination is ever increasing be-cause it results from human activities, particularly agriculture. As population increases, so does nitrate contamina-tion, because effective nitrate pollution prevention strategies have generally not been implemented. Removing nitrates from drinking water Ion exchange, biological denitrifi-cation, and membrane desalting with reverse osmosis hyperfiltration or elec-trodialysis are the most common meth...|$|R
40|$|Purdue University Calumet (Purdue) and Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) have {{conducted}} an independent study to identify deployable technologies {{that could help}} the BP Whiting Refinery, and other petroleum refineries, meet future wastewater discharge limits. This study has been funded by BP. Each organization tested {{a subset of the}} target technologies and retains sole responsibility for its respective test design and implementation, quality assurance and control, test results obtained from each of the technologies, and corresponding conclusions and recommendations. This project was divided in two phases and modules. This report summarizes the work conducted by Argonne in Phase II Module 3 (Bench Scale Testing). Other Modules are discussed elsewhere (Emerging Technologies and Approaches to Minimize Discharges into Lake Michigan, Phase 2, Modules 1 - 3 Report, April 2011, prepared for BP Americas by the Argonne - Purdue Task Force). The goal of this project was to identify and assess available and emerging wastewater treatment technologies for removing mercury and vanadium from the Whiting Refinery wastewater and to conduct bench-scale tests to provide comparable, transparent, and uniform results across the broad range of technologies tested. After the bench-scale testing phase, a previously developed decision matrix was refined and applied by Argonne to process and review test data to estimate and compare the preliminary performance, engineering configuration, preliminary cost, energy usage, and waste generation of technologies that were shown to be able to remove Hg and/or V to below the target limit at the bench scale. The data were used as the basis to identify the best candidates for further testing at the bench or pilot scale on a slip stream of effluent to lake (ETL) or clarifier effluent (CE) at the Whiting Refinery to determine whether future limits could be met and to generate other pertinent data for scale-up and sustainability evaluation. As a result of this technology assessment, Argonne identified several technologies that, at the bench-scale, could achieve the targeted performance for the removal of mercury and vanadium. A subset of those technologies were recommended for further testing either at the bench scale or at the pilot scale to determine whether future discharge limits could be met at the pilot-scale. The objectives of this project module are to: (1) Test at the bench-scale a subset of the technologies previously identified in Module 1 for the removal of target heavy metals down to 1. 3 ppt Hg and 280 ppb V; (2) Review and <b>process</b> <b>bench-scale</b> test results {{on the basis of the}} end-point performance measures matrix to determine preliminary comparative performance, cost-effectiveness, and potential engineering configuration of tested technologies; (3) Assess the technological feasibility and readiness of the identified technologies for implementation at the Whiting Refinery; and (4) Select technically and economically feasible mercury- and vanadium-removal technologies and vendors to be recommended for pilot-scale testing at the Whiting Refinery...|$|R
