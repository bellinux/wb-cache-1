50|$|One of {{the main}} {{disadvantages}} {{is the lack of}} joint strength as compared to a welded joint due to the softer filler metals used. The strength of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joint</b> is likely to be less than that of the base metal(s) but greater than the filler metal. Another disadvantage is that brazed joints can be damaged under high service temperatures. Brazed joints require a high degree of base-metal cleanliness when done in an industrial setting.

The joint color is often {{different from that of the}} base metal, creating an aesthetic disadvantage.|$|E
40|$|Brazing, {{as a type}} {{of joining}} process, is widely used in {{manufacturing}} industries to join individual components of a structure. Structural reliability of a brazed assembly is strongly dependent on the joint mechanical properties. In the present work, mechanical reliability of low carbon steel <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> with copper filler metal is investigated and a methodology for failure analysis of <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> using the cohesive zone model (CZM) is presented. Mechanical reliability of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> is characterized by strength and toughness. Uniaxial and biaxial strengths of the joints are evaluated experimentally and estimated by finite element method using the ABAQUS software. Microstructural analysis of the joint fracture surfaces reveals different failure mechanisms of dimple rupture and dendritic failure. Resistance of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> against crack propagation, evaluated by the single-parameter fracture toughness criterion, shows dependency on the specimen geometry and loading configuration. Fracture of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> and the subsequent ductile tearing process are investigated using a two-parameter CZM. The characterizing model parameters of the cohesive strength and cohesive energy are identified by a four-point bend fracture test accompanied with corresponding FE simulation. Using the characterized CZM, the joint fracture behavior under tensile loading is well estimated. Predictability of the developed cohesive zone FE model for fracture analysis of <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> independent of geometry and loading configuration is validated. The developed cohesive zone FE model is extended to fatigue crack growth analysis in <b>brazed</b> <b>joints.</b> A cyclic damage evolution law is implemented into the cohesive zone constitutive model to irreversibly account for the joint stiffness degradation over the number of cycles. Fatigue failure behavior of the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> is characterized by performing fully reversed strain controlled cyclic tests. The damage law parameters are calibrated based on the analytical solutions and the experimental fatigue crack growth data.

Brazing temperatures employed were 900 - 950 °C for the titanium-based filler and 900 - 990 °C for the zirconium-based filler alloys, respectively. The brazing time durations were 600, 1200 and 1800 s. The <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> {{were evaluated by}} ultrasonic test, and their microstructures and phase constitutions analyzed by metallography, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Since microstructural evolution across the furnace <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> primarily depends on their alloying elements such as Cu, Ni and Zr along the joint. Accordingly, existence of Zr 2 Cu, Ti 2 Cu and (Ti,Zr) 2 Ni intermetallic compounds was identified in the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints.</b> The chemical composition of segregation region {{in the center of}} <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> was identical to virgin filler alloy content which greatly deteriorated the shear strength of the <b>joints.</b> Adequate <b>brazing</b> time (1800 s) and/or temperature (950 °C for Ti-based and 990 °C for Zr-based) resulted in an acicular Widmanstätten microstructure throughout the entire joint section due to eutectoid reaction.

SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process.

Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good <b>braze</b> <b>joint,</b> the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to braze alloy wire. Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> has shown that quality <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser <b>brazing.</b> Laser <b>braze</b> <b>joint</b> properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties.

Their work showed that the intermetallic layer grew with increase in ageing time. In addition, the shear strength decreased with increased ageing time, due to growth in the intermetallic compound thickness. It was noted that Al-Cu <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> formed with a Zn- 22 Al- 0.05 Ce filler metal had higher shear strength compared to those formed with a Zn- 22 Al filler metal. With a nominal ageing time, the joint had a ductile fracture mode; however, increased ageing time changed the joint to brittle fracture mode.|$|R

In this chapter we will review why such common engineering tools as Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{as well as many}} well-established theories (Tresca, von Mises, Highest Principal Stress, etc) don't work well for the <b>brazed</b> <b>joints.</b> This chapter will show how the classic approach of using interaction equations and the less known Coulomb-Mohr failure criterion can be employed to estimate Margins of Safety (MS) in <b>brazed</b> <b>joints...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of high-temperature electrochemical {{devices such as}} solid oxide fuel cells, oxygen, and hydrogen separators and gas reformers poses a great challenge in brazing technology of metal/ceramic joints. To maintain the integrity of such equipment, the resulting seals have to be stable and hermetic during continuous and cyclic high temperature operation. As a solution for joining metal and ceramic materials, reactive air brazing has gained increasing interest in recent years. This paper compares <b>joints</b> <b>brazed</b> by different filler alloys: pure Ag, AgCu, and AgAl in three different aspects: contour accuracy, room temperature delamination resistance, and corresponding microstructures of the as-brazed and fractured <b>brazed</b> <b>joints.</b> Discussion focuses on fracture mechanism and associated delamination resistance. AgAl <b>brazed</b> <b>joints</b> exhibit the most promising mechanical properties and contour accuracy...|$|R
