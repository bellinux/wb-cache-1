The shroud shields the antenna from radiation from angles outside the main <b>beam</b> <b>axis,</b> reducing the sidelobes. It is sometimes used to prevent interference in terrestrial microwave links, where several antennas using the same frequency are located close together. The shroud is coated inside with microwave absorbent material. Shrouds can reduce back lobe radiation by 10dB.|$|E
25|$|The second {{design is}} the top-entry holder {{consists}} of a cartridge that is several cm long with a bore drilled down the cartridge axis. The specimen is loaded into the bore, possibly using a small screw ring to hold the sample in place. This cartridge is inserted into an airlock with the bore perpendicular to the TEM optic axis. When sealed, the airlock is manipulated to push the cartridge such that the cartridge falls into place, where the bore hole becomes aligned with the <b>beam</b> <b>axis,</b> such that the beam travels down the cartridge bore and into the specimen. Such designs are typically unable to be tilted without blocking the beam path or interfering with the objective lens.|$|E

30|$|According to {{electromagnetic}} theory, {{optical tweezers}} enable trapping and manipulation of particles via two light pressure forces: gradient force and scattering force.

Two specular off-axis vortex beams carrying fractional orbital angular momentum at the fundamental frequency (FF) are used.

40|$|The spin angular {{momentum}} in an elliptically polarized {{beam of light}} plays several noteworthy roles in optical traps. It contributes to the linear momentum density in a non-uniform beam, and thus to the radiation pressure exerted on illuminated objects. It can be converted into orbital {{angular momentum}}, and thus can exert torques even on optically isotropic objects. Its curl, moreover, contributes to both forces and torques without spin-to-orbit conversion. We demonstrate these effects experimentally by tracking colloidal spheres diffusing in elliptically polarized optical tweezers. Clusters of spheres circulate deterministically about the <b>beam's</b> <b>axis.</b> A single sphere, by contrast, undergoes stochastic Brownian vortex circulation that maps out the optical force field.

2500|$|The hadron {{calorimeter}} absorbs energy from particles that {{pass through the}} EM calorimeter, but do interact via the strong force; these particles are primarily hadrons. [...] It is less precise, both in energy magnitude and in the localization (within about 0.1radians only). [...] The energy-absorbing material is steel, with scintillating tiles that sample the energy deposited. [...] Many {{of the features of}} the calorimeter are chosen for their cost-effectiveness; the instrument is large and comprises a huge amount of construction material: {{the main part of the}} calorimeter – the tile calorimeter – is 8metres in diameter and covers 12metres along the <b>beam</b> <b>axis.</b> [...] The far-forward sections of the hadronic calorimeter are contained within the forward EM calorimeter's cryostat, and use liquid argon as well, while copper and tungsten are used as absorbers.|$|E
2500|$|The Inner Detector {{begins a}} few {{centimetres}} from the proton <b>beam</b> <b>axis,</b> extends to a radius of 1.2metres, and is 6.2 metres in length along the beam pipe. [...] Its basic {{function is to}} track charged particles by detecting their interaction with material at discrete points, revealing detailed information about the types of particles and their momentum. [...] The magnetic field surrounding the entire inner detector causes charged particles to curve; {{the direction of the}} curve reveals a particle's charge and the degree of curvature reveals its momentum. [...] The starting points of the tracks yield useful information for identifying particles; for example, if a group of tracks seem to originate from a point other than the original proton–proton collision, this may be a sign that the particles came from the decay of a hadron with a bottom quark (see b-tagging). [...] The Inner Detector has three parts, which are explained below.|$|E
2500|$|A type of antenna that {{combines}} a horn with a parabolic reflector {{is known as}} a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by [...] Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 [...] and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. [...] It is also referred to as the [...] "sugar scoop" [...] due to its characteristic shape. [...] It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. [...] The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, [...] so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis. [...] The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main <b>beam</b> <b>axis,</b> so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. [...] Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% [...] as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. [...] This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. [...] Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT Long Lines microwave network. [...] Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. [...] Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. [...] Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} laser beams {{containing}} phase singularity {{can be used for}} trapping and guiding light-absorbing particles in air. The experiments were performed with agglomerates of carbon nanoparticles with the size in the range 0. 1 – 10 µm; the typical cw laser power was of a few mW. The stability of open-air three-dimensional trapping was within ± 2 µm in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions. The particle position on the <b>beams</b> <b>axis</b> within the trap can be controlled by changing the relative intensity of two beams. The distinguishing feature of the trapping strategy is that particles are trapped at the intensity minimum of the beam, thus with minimum heating and intervention into the particle properties, which is important for direct studies of particle properties and for air-trapping of living cells. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{proposed}} baseline {{design for}} the Space Infrared Telescope Facility includes a Tertiary Mirror Assembly (TMA) which selectively redirects the telescope's converging science beam to each of several instruments. The TMA's mirror rotates on an axis coincident with the <b>beam's</b> <b>axis,</b> and is held steady during observation by a kinematic mount. A bearing has been designed whose compliance causes minimal interference with the precision of the kinematic mount, and which is well suited to the particular requirements of a cryogenic satellite such as SIRTF.

It potentially eliminates problems associated with mechanical bearings that arise in similar applications, such as lubricant loss or failure, bearing wear, and sensitivity to particulates, and does so without imposing the thermal load of a bearing heater or active magnetic bearing.
