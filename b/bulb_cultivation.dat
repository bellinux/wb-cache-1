50|$|But {{during the}} 19th century, {{the beauty of}} the area and its estates slowly began to disappear. Developers bought the estates, cut down the forests, and {{excavated}} the sand dunes to create fields for <b>bulb</b> flower <b>cultivation.</b> This process accelerated in 1904 when a lime-sand brick factory was built just south of Hillegom, which needed large amounts of sand. By the early 1920s, all estates had disappeared, except for Het Hof which became Hillegom's town hall. This same period saw the rapid growth of the bulb flower industry and Hillegom's population, up to 8800 in 1916.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulb</b> exhibitions:Bulb <b>cultivation</b> {{emerged as}} the {{successor}} to herb cultivation. From 1880 the number of bulb growers and bulb fields grew to 250 and 252 hectares respectively, {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Tulips, daffodils and gladioli were grown, amongst other flowers. The majority of bulb fields lie behind the dunes as the sandy soil there is extremely suitable for cultivation. Noordwijk earned a national and international reputation for its impressive bulb exhibitions. In 1932 a Flora park was set up within the Offem country estate. Furthermore, Noordwijk entries could be admired at foreign bulb exhibitions and subsequently also in the flower exhibitions. Today the Noordwijk bulb area covers 311 hectares of land.|$|R

40|$|Polianthes tuberosa is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} flower crop in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam that is propagated by the harvesting and planting of <b>bulbs.</b> The <b>cultivation</b> of P. tuberosa {{is complicated by}} an endemic nematode infection that damages {{a high proportion of}} the plants. Based on morphological criteria and ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, we have determined that the infection is caused by an Aphelenchoides sp. nematode and is most likely Aphelenchoides besseyi. By scoring various parts of harvested plants with flowers for the presence of viable nematodes over a period of six months, we determined that the nematode is an ectoparasite that can survive the intercrop periods, especially in the bulbs that are used to plant new crops. A comparison of farming practices in the Mekong Delta failed to identify useful control methods, but rather indicated that fields that have cultivated P. tuberosa for the longest periods suffer the worst damage from the nematode infection. Finally, we demonstrated that the nematode is capable of infecting 30 rice cultivars but does not cause the white tip disease usually associated with A. besseyi infection...|$|R

5000|$|Flower <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> {{takes place}} in Kennemerland in North Holland. The area extends roughly from the Haarlem area (including villages {{to the south and}} west of Haarlem) to Petten (northwest of Alkmaar). Wealthy merchants from Haarlem and Amsterdam {{introduced}} the cultivation of flower bulbs on a small scale basis in the sandy soil located close to the dunes in the 16th century. After the Tulip Mania crash of 1637, floriculture strongly declined. Unlike in the Duin- en Bollenstreek to the south, Kennemerland was not—despite the broad dune area south of Castricum—extensively cultivated for this purpose. In the 19th century the area had been earmarked for preservation of the Amsterdam water supply (Amsterdamse Waterleidingduinen) and as a location for the national steel company (Koninklijke Hoogovens).|$|E
5000|$|... ‘Zeeër’ or ‘Binner’:There {{have always}} been notable {{differences}} between coastal Noordwijk aan Zee and inland Noordwijk-Binnen. In days gone by {{this was due to}} religious and occupational differences, which were easily maintained due to the geographical differences. Noordwijk aan Zee inhabitants were by origin fishermen, with a Protestant background. The primary occupation within Noordwijk-Binnen was <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation,</b> with Roman Catholicism being the predominant faith. During the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) some of the ‘Geuzen’ (Protestant rebels) were from Protestant Noordwijk aan Zee. This area suffered under the Spaniards, whilst Catholic Noordwijk-Binnen was spared. This discrimination continued, and not just in a religious sense. Whilst the coastal dwelling ‘Zeeër’ fished for a living, the inland ‘Binner’ cultivated herbs and later bulbs. Until the start of the 20th century Noordwijk had a small fleet of barges at its disposal, which departed from the beach as there was no harbour. In the 19th century Noordwijk developed into a seaside resort. To this day the notion of being either a Zeeër or Binner continues, especially amongst the older generation.|$|E

40|$|The soil {{preparation}} in horticulture, including organic, {{is characterized by}} intense soil tillage, which increases energy costs and unbalanced the environment. The organic system in onion cultivation has shown satisfactory results, however the soil covering use tends to improve the cultivation environment and may result in higher yields. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of onion cultivars in organic cultivation under different soil coverages. The experiment was conducted {{in the period of}} April to October of 2009, under protected cropping, in the experimental area of the horticulture sector of the Universidade Federal do Acre (UFAC), in Rio Branco, Acre, Brazil. A randomized block design was adopted, in a split-plot arrangement, the plots being comprised of soil coverings: coffee bean husks, grass straw (Brachiaria decumbens); dessicated bamboo leaves (Bambusa spp.) and uncovered soil (control treatment), and the subplots comprised of three onion cultivars (IPA 10, IPA 11 and IPA 12), with four repetitions. The variables analyzed were total bulb yield (t ha- 1), marketable bulb yield (t ha- 1), fresh mass of the bulb (g bulb- 1), classification of the bulbs and loss of mass as a function of storage time. There was no interaction effect between the soil coverings and the cultivars. Cultivars IPA 10 and IPA 11 showed greater agronomic performance of the studied variables. The soil coverings did not affect the yield and average mass of the <b>bulbs</b> under organic <b>cultivation.</b> The three cultivars presented more than approximately 70 % of the bulbs in class 2 and a maximum of 5 % of unmarketable bulbs.

40|$|An {{inventory}} {{has been}} made of manual lifting situations in the cultivation and forcing of flower bulbs and bulb flowers. Originally this was the first part of a study with two objectives: (1) reduction of physical load of workers in flower <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation,</b> due to manual handling of crates, and (2) uniformization of crates in <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> and bulb forcing. Meanwhile, a new study on uniformization of these crates has started (AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿). Therefore the original study was stopped after the inventory and two new studies were started: `Information supply for reduction of physical load during handling of crates in bulb flower production¿ and `Fitting Arbo-expertise in the AKK-project `focus on crates for (flower) bulbs¿¿. First, an overview {{has been made}} of the most important situations in <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> and bulb flower production where crates are lifted or moved. Then, ten bulb flower or flower bulb producers and three mechanization companies were interviewed. Information is collected at the production companies concerning the physical load, due to manual handling of the crates and concerning motives for or against mechanization. Based on the collected data Lifting Indices (a standard for physical load because of lifting) were calculated. In all visited companies several types of crates were used. In eight companies at least one type of palletboxes was used. Beside these, most companies use several 60 x 40 cm and 50 x 75 cm crates. Most companies use several types of these crates with different heights. It is concluded that in <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> most crate handling situations are mechanized, since generally very heavy (1 x 1. 2 x 1 m) palletboxes are used. Particularly in small companies and in some minor crops manual lifting occurs. In these cases, health standards are always exceeded. However, it must be noticed that this work occurs only during a limited part of the year. In bulb flower production more manual lifting occurs, especially when flowers are produced in pot soil. During planting, lifting indices (LI) between 2. 8 and 3. 3 (about three times the permitted weight) were found. Moving crates in and out the greenhouse is often mechanized, but during manual moving the LI was between 4. 5 and 6. 5. During manual emptying of crates, filled with soil, LI was between 4. 4 and 6. 7. When flowers are forced in water, the weights are much lower and LI was between 1 and 2. According to the visited mechanization companies it is almost always possible to adapt stackers and de-stackers so that they can handle several types of crates. This applies to other processes as well, such as emptying, filling and cleaning the crates. The most important bottleneck for mechanization is a financial one, since mechanization not always results in labour saving sufficient to cover the investment costs...|$|E
40|$|A {{major problem}} in flower <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> is weed control. Synthetic {{herbicides}} are mainly used, although they cause a range of problems, and integrated weed control through application of naturally occurring allelochemicals would be highly desirable. Flower bulb production creates large amounts of leftover biomass. Utilizing this source for weed control may provide new applications of the bulb crops. We therefore screened 33 flower bulb extracts for allelochemical activity against weeds. Several methanol and chloroform extracts were observed to inhibit germination and growth of Senecio vulgaris L. and Lolium perenne L., as representatives of di- and mono-cotyledonous weeds, respectively. Narciclasine was identified as the bioactive compound in Narcissus. The extract of Amaryllis belladonna L. was equally active, but did not contain any narciclasine. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the A. belladonna extract resulted {{in the identification of}} lycorine as the bio-active compound. The IC 50 measured for radicle growth inhibition was 0. 10 µM for narciclasine and 0. 93 µM for lycorine, compared to 0. 11 mM of chlorpropham, a synthetic herbicide. Therefore, the leftover biomass from the spring bulb industry represents an interesting potential source for promising allelochemicals for further studies on weed growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Background: Exposure to {{pesticides}} {{has been}} linked to Parkinson's disease (PD), although associations between specific pesticides and PD have not been well studied. Residents of rural areas can be exposed through environmental drift and volatilization of agricultural pesticides. Objectives: Our aim was to investigate the association between lifetime environmental exposure to individual pesticides and the risk of PD, in a national case-control study. Methods: Environmental exposure to pesticides was estimated using a spatio-temporal model, based on agricultural crops around the residential address. Distance up to 100 m from the residence was considered most relevant, considering pesticide drift potential of application methods used in the Netherlands. Exposure estimates were generated for 157 pesticides, used during the study period, of which four (i. e. paraquat, maneb, lindane, benomyl) were considered a priori relevant for PD. Results: A total of 352 PD cases and 607 hospital-based controls were included. No significant associations with PD were found for the a priori pesticides. In a hypothesis generating analysis, including 153 pesticides, increased risk of PD was found for 21 pesticides, mainly used on cereals and potatoes. Results were suggestive for an association between <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> and PD. Conclusions: For paraquat, risk estimates for the highest cumulative exposure tertile were in line with previously reported elevated risks. Increased risk of PD was observed for exposure to (a cluster of) pesticides used on rotating crops. High correlations limited our ability to identify individual pesticides responsible for this association. This study provides some evidence for an association between environmental exposure to specific pesticides and the risk of PD, and generates new leads for further epidemiological and mechanistic research...|$|E
40|$|In 2006 a {{study is}} done to {{generate}} ergonomic advices {{with respect to the}} design of a standardized crate that is to be used in flower <b>bulb</b> <b>cultivation</b> and flower bulb trade. Reason for this study was an earlier AKK study, which concluded that standardisation of the crates will reduce costs (particularly for transport) and improve flower bulb quality. Therefore, companies in this sector try to implement standardized crates. The aim {{of the present study was}} to give ergonomic advices concerning the layout of these crates, resulting in reduction of the physical load during manual handling of them. Another goal was to satisfy the people who will have to work with the crates, by respecting their wishes and requirements as far as possible. In close cooperation with the manager of the AKK-study, labour-related questions which remained unanswered in that study are inventoried. Further, according to the method `ergonomic design, additional wishes of the people who will have will work with the standardised crates have been formulated. Finally is examined how the inventoried requirements and wishes can be fulfilled. For that purpose the questions were answered, based on literature reviews, measurements and expertise. Some of the most important results are that: Physical load is lower during the lifting of 40 x 60 cm crates than during the lifting of 50 x 75 cm crates with the same weight. The physical load during the lifting of low standing crates reduces when the crates (and therefore handles) are as high as possible, but this effect is very small. Since the height of the piles is limited by other factors, no effect of crate altitude on physical load is expected when crates have to be moved from or to a high level. Without the use of special tools the physical load is always too high when piles are higher than 1. 70 m. But even in ideal conditions the lifting of 15 or 20 kg crates to an altitude of 1. 70 m results in a Lifting Index of 1. 1 or 1. 4 respectively, what is higher than the health standard. For handles, a dimension of 125 x 40 mm is recommended. Sharp edges must be avoided and it must be impossible to put sharp objects, such as staples, through the handles. Closed handles prevent that bulbs fall through the handles. Physical load when crates are taken from or placed on a high pile can be reduced al little when these handles are not only at the top of the crates, but also halfway. No large effect of standardisation of the layout of the crates on mechanisation is expected, since nearly all tools do not pick up the crates but grip them. Standardisation of the format (40 x 60 cm) is important, however, and the sides must be exactly rectangular. For transport in conditioned sea containers (inner width 2. 26 or 2. 28 m.) 100 x 120 cm pallets are most suitable. However, physical load during manual piling up of crates on these pallets is higher than when 80 x 100 cm pallets are used. In both cases the health limits are largely exceeded during manual handling of the crates. If crates with different altitudes must become piled up on the same pallet, tuning of the altitude of the different crates is needed. Good examples are 18 and 24 cm or 16. 5 and 22 cm. If it must be possible to read the information on the crates automatically, transponders (chips) are preferred over bar codes. It is recommended to apply a low-frequency system and to give all crates only a unique number. A central database can contain information concerning the contents of all crates. The recommendations in this report answer different questions and some of them can not be combined with some others. For this reason the `ideal crate will be a combination of compromises. Therefore it is recommended - in accordance with the original design of this study to carry out a pilot before choosing definitively for one basic design for the standardized crates. In this pilot all users should be involved, and it is preferred to let them test a number of copies of the aimed types of cask...|$|E
