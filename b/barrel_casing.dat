500|$|Other {{members of}} the 47th Battalion had garrisoned the {{northern}} end of the previously unoccupied bank, but the southern half remained open. A group of about 50 Germans of the 6th Company of II/229 RIR, advancing earlier than planned, had overrun the Lewis gun team covering the level crossing, and began advancing southwards behind the embankment {{to the rear of the}} right forward company of the battalion. Seeing their movement, McDougall and others opened fire on them. The <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> of McDougall's Lewis gun had grown so hot that his left hand became blistered, but he continued to fire it with the help of another sergeant. Of the party of Germans who had penetrated about [...] beyond the railway line, two officers and 20 men had already been killed. Australian troops converged on the remaining Germans, and they quickly surrendered. A total of one officer and 29 men were captured. For his actions that morning, McDougall was later awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award that could be received by an Australian soldier for gallantry in the face of the enemy.|$|E
50|$|The FNAB-43 {{also uses}} a muzzle brake and {{compensator}} {{built into the}} <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> similar to some Russian weapons, and the magazine housing is hinged so that the magazine can lie beneath the barrel similarly to the French MAT-49. The single metal bar stock can be folded upwards rendering the weapon more compact.|$|E
50|$|The Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr is {{constructed}} rather like many semi-automatic pistols, {{it has a}} casing and spring around the barrel; the whole casing recoils backward. The breech block, with firing pin and extractor, is pinned to {{the back end of}} the <b>barrel</b> <b>casing.</b> The rear end of the gun does not recoil and has the hammer, sear and trigger built into it. Gas coming from four vents, {{near the end of the}} barrel, holds the bolt closed till the gas pressure drops to a safe level. Some selective fire Gustloff Volkssturmgewehrs were made.|$|E
50|$|In {{steam power}} plants, MJTs are used on {{boiler feed pump}} head and <b>barrel</b> <b>casings,</b> boiler circ pump main flanges, stop valves, control valves, turbine couplings, stay rods, manway doors, inlet flanges, and {{feedwater}} heaters. MJTs can {{save a lot of}} time during scheduled downtime or maintenance because they require less time to install and remove than other bolting methods.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 15 The Janschwalde Power Station {{consists}} of six 500 MW units that were commissioned between 1981 and 1989. These units, which were equipped with turbo feedpumps manufactured in Russia, {{had an average}} efficiency of only 78 percent and a mean time between overhauls of 25, 000 hr. The test was to adapt these boiler feedpumps at the lowest possible cost (only minor modifications to the base and the pipework were envisaged), and to achieve a payback time of {{four to five years}} by improving the pump efficiency and reducing operating costs. This was accomplished by fitting new cartridges into the existing <b>barrel</b> <b>casings.</b> These cartridges consisted of six-stages of a well-proved hydraulic with a specific speed of 1700 operating at the nominated turbine speed of 5600 to 5700 rpm. The processing of the contract within the pump manufacturer?s organization is described, along with the extensive coordination and quality assurance within a tight production schedule (delivery time of only seven months before the trail operation of the first pump unit). The efficiency of the new pumps was determined onsite by means of thermodynamic measurement. The specific features of the pumps and the proof efficiency in the power station by means of thermodynamic measurement are defined in detail...|$|R
5000|$|During Operation Desert Storm (1991), {{there was}} a need for a deep {{penetration}} bomb similar to the British weapons of World War II, but none of the NATO air forces had such a weapon. As a stop-gap, some were developed over a period of 28 days, using old 8 inch (203 mm) artillery <b>barrels</b> as <b>casings.</b> These bombs weighed over two tons but carried only 647 lb of high explosive. They were laser-guided and were designated [...] "Guided Bomb Unit-28 (GBU-28)". It was proved to be effective for the intended role.|$|R
50|$|The MG 3 has a quick-change, chrome-lined barrel {{with four}} {{right-hand}} grooves and a rifling twist rate of 1 in 305 mm (1:12 in). Alternatively, MG 3 barrels {{can also have}} polygonal rifling. The barrel is integrated with the barrel breech. During sustained firing, {{there is a need}} for the barrel to be changed and this is how they are swapped: The gun is cocked and the barrel catch on the right of the barrel shroud is swung forward. Then, the breech end of the hot barrel swings out and can be removed by elevating or twisting the gun. A fresh barrel would be inserted through the barrel catch and the muzzle bearing. When the catch is rotated back, the barrel is locked and the machine gun can resume firing. Both the receiver housing and ventilated <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> are made from pressed sheet steel. A muzzle device is mounted at the end of the barrel and it acts as a flash suppressor, muzzle brake and recoil booster.|$|E
5000|$|Enfield noted 13 flaws, {{all with}} simple fixes, {{remarking}} [...] "converting the Ross {{was not a}} complicated matter." [...] Field trials in France showed [...] "well authenticated" [...] reports of few breakages or stoppages.Enfield recommended a number of changes: the barrel cover be fitted with a continuous length of tubing and a wooden forend, allowing the weapon to dispense with the rest, which was criticized for its fragility; a corrugated metal cover be fitted to the body, with a dust shield over the bolt handle; the magazine mouth be bevelled to ease feeding; the magazine be made of thinner metal to reduce its excessive weight; the breech cover not extend so far back to prevent injury to the firer; strengthen the extractor to prevent failures to feed with thick-rimmed cases (one of the few feeding problems noted); the hand-cocking lever be deleted puzzle as the weapons {{still has to be}} cocked for the first shot, also removing eight new parts; and the <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> be made in one piece, to eliminate a minor double failure issue.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{multistage}} pump problems {{in conjunction with}} axial thrust are presented. The entire investigation {{has been focused on}} the pump design concept with all impellers in series (facing in one direction) and is valid for <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> type as well for segmental type. The major part of the investigation has been experimental on one stage testing arrangement, using also Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) for determination of fluid rotation in the impeller side chamber. Numerical flow analysis (NFA) has been applied for some flow variants in order to verify whether a numerical approach could simulate the test results. The phenomenon of fluid rotation in side chambers and its effect on impeller hydraulic axial thrust has been determined for different leakage flow regimes. Influence of increased wear ring radial clearance on axial thrust has been analysed together with the solutions for hydraulic axial thrust reduction...|$|E
50|$|The initial DEFA 551 was {{developed}} in the late 1940s. It was based on the German Mauser MG 213C, an experimental revolver cannon developed for the Luftwaffe. The MG 213 never reached production, but inspired the DEFA, the very similar British ADEN cannon, and the smaller American M39 cannon. As the DEFA 552 it entered production in 1954. In 1968 an upgraded version, Canon 550-F3, {{was developed}}, entering production in 1971 as the DEFA 553. The new version provided a new feed system, nitro-chrome plated steel <b>barrel,</b> forged drum <b>casing,</b> and improved electrical reliability.|$|R
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the <b>casings,</b> <b>barrels,</b> and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|R
50|$|During World War I, the Vickers gun {{became a}} {{standard}} weapon on British and French military aircraft, especially after 1916. Although {{heavier than the}} Lewis, its closed bolt firing cycle made {{it much easier to}} synchronize to allow it to fire through aircraft propellers. The belt feed was enclosed right up to the gun's feed-way to inhibit effects from wind. Steel disintegrating-link ammunition belts were perfected in the UK by William de Courcy Prideaux in mid-war and became standard for aircraft guns thereafter. The famous Sopwith Camel and the SPAD XIII types used twin synchronized Vickers, as did most British and French fighters between 1918 and the mid-1930s. In the air, the weighty water cooling system was rendered redundant by the chilly temperatures at high altitude and the constant stream of air passing over the gun as the plane flew; but because the weapon relied on barrel recoil, the (empty) water-holding <b>barrel</b> jacket or <b>casing</b> needed to be retained. Several sets of louvred slots were cut into the barrel jacket to aid air cooling, a better solution than what had initially been attempted with the 1915-vintage lMG 08 German aircraft ordnance.|$|R
40|$|The PED Directive is a European law {{issued in}} 2002 and this Directive covers all “pressure equipment”. However {{there are some}} {{exclusions}} from PED such as compressors, turbines and so on when the pressure is not a significant design factor for the device and the pressure does not represent an hazard for the people. The aim {{of the work is}} analysed with some International Codes for the vessels and centrifugal compressors, and with Finite Element Analysis, if the primarily compressor casing design criterion, built in GE Oil&Gas, is the pressure or something else. This work allows to evaluate the applicability of the PED on GE Oil&Gas centrifugal compressors casings or not and, if it is applicable, which additional requirements the compressors must satisfy. The document also provides a structural parametric optimization of a particular <b>barrel</b> <b>casing</b> and the evaluation of its strength and stiffness varying some geometrical parameters...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 51 High {{pressure}} hydrocracker {{charge is}} one of the most arduous services for multistage centrifugal pumps in the refining industry. Future plant capacity requirements of the hydrocracker unit at a United Kingdom site required a 25 percent increase in capacity and a three to 10 percent increase in differential pressure of the charge pump duty. After preliminary investigations, the decision was made to rerate and upgrade the existing pumps, as opposed to purchasing new equipment. In addition to the performance rerate, there was a requirement to resolve a long term vibration problem and to improve the performance of the mechanical seals. The final scope of work included major modifications to the pumps including one new <b>barrel</b> <b>casing,</b> cartridge-type double mechanical seals, new gearboxes, and new motors. In addition, extensive modifications of the baseplates were required, which included new support pedestals for both pumps and motors. Refurbishment of the lube oil systems and modification to the seal oil systems were also carried out. Of major significance is that complete refurbishment and recommissioning of two out of the three pump sets was carried out with the plant in operation...|$|E
