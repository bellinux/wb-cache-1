25|$|Table Mountain is {{also home}} to porcupines, mongooses, snakes, lizards, tortoises, and a rare endemic species of {{amphibian}} that is only found on Table Mountain, the Table Mountain ghost frog. The last lion in the area was shot circa 1802. Leopards persisted on the mountains until perhaps the 1920s but are now extinct locally. Two smaller, secretive, nocturnal carnivores, the rooikat (caracal) and the vaalboskat (also called the vaalkat or Southern African wildcat) were once common in the mountains and the mountain slopes. The rooikat continues to be seen on rare occasions by mountaineers but the status of the vaalboskat is uncertain. The mountain cliffs are home to several raptors species, apart from the Verreaux's eagle. They include the jackal buzzard, <b>booted</b> <b>eagle</b> (in summer), African harrier-hawk, peregrine falcon and the rock kestrel. In 2014 three pairs of African fish eagles were believed to be breeding on the Peninsula, but they nest in trees generally as far away from human habitation as is possible on the Peninsula. Their number in 2017 is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{golden eagle}} {{is part of}} a broad group of raptors called “booted eagles” which are defined by the feature that all species have {{feathering}} over their tarsus, unlike many other accipitrids which have bare legs. Included in this group are all species described as “hawk eagles” including the genera Spizaetus and Nisaetus, as well as assorted monotypical genera such as Oroaetus, Lophaetus, Stephanoaetus, Polemaetus, Lophotriorchis and Ictinaetus. The genus Aquila is distributed across every continent but for South America and Antarctica. Up to 20 species have been classified in the genus but the taxonomic placement of some of the traditional species has been questioned as of late. Traditionally, the Aquila eagles have been grouped superficially as largish, mainly brownish or dark-colored booted eagles that vary little in transition from their juvenile to their adult plumages. Genetic research has recently indicated the golden eagle is included in a clade with Verreaux's eagle in Africa as well as the Gurney's eagle (A. gurneyi) and the wedge-tailed eagle (clearly part of an Australasian radiation of the lineage). This identification of this particular clade has long been suspected based on similar morphological characteristics amongst these large-bodied species. More surprisingly, the smaller, much paler-bellied sister species Bonelli's eagle (A. fasciatus) and African hawk-eagle (A. spilogaster), previously included in the Hieraaetus genus, have been revealed to be genetically much closer to the Verreaux's and golden eagle lineage than to other species traditionally included in the Aquila genus. Other largish Aquila species, the eastern imperial, the Spanish imperial, the tawny and the steppe eagles, are now thought to be separate, close-knit clade, which attained some similar characteristics to the prior clade via convergent evolution. Genetically, the “spotted eagles” (A. pomarina, hasata & clanga), have been discovered to be more closely related to the long-crested eagle (Lophaetus occipitalis) and the black eagle (Ictinaetus malayensis), and many generic reassignments have been advocated. The Hieraaetus genus, including the <b>booted</b> <b>eagle</b> (H. pennatus), little eagle (H. morphnoides) and Ayres's hawk-eagle (H. ayresii), consists of much smaller species, that are in fact smallest birds called eagles outside of the unrelated Spilornis serpent-eagle genus. This genus has recently been eliminated by many authorities and are now occasionally also included in Aquila, although not all ornithological unions have followed this suit in this re-classification. The small-bodied Wahlberg's eagle (H. wahlbergi) has been traditionally considered a Aquila species due to its lack of change from juvenile to adult plumage and brownish color but it is actually genetically aligned to the Hieraaetus lineage. Cassin's hawk-eagle (H. africanus) is also probably closely related to the Hieraaetus group rather than the Spizaetus/Nisaetus “hawk-eagle” group (in which it was previously classified) which is not known to have radiated to Africa.|$|E

50|$|Although {{currently}} {{placed in}} the monotypic genus Lophaetus recent {{research has suggested that}} this species forms a clade with the spotted eagles, gretar spotted eagle (Clanga clanga), Indian spotted eagle (Clanga hastata) and lesser spotted eagle (Clanga pomarina). The merged genus would be called Lophaetus but most authorities regard that further work on the classification of the <b>booted</b> <b>eagles</b> is required and retain the long-crested eagle in the monotypic Lophaetus.|$|R
50|$|The park's climate, varied {{vegetation}} and isolation allow a rich wildlife based on various raptorial birds such as hawks, <b>booted</b> <b>eagles,</b> short toed snake eagles, Egyptian vultures {{and a few}} more.

50|$|This bird {{is found}} in humid {{tropical}} forests from southern Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula, to Trinidad and Tobago, south to Peru and Argentina. They are able to tolerate some degree of habitat fragmentation, breeding successfully near cities and in forest fragments as small as 200 ha. Despite a slender build and a body weight no greater than a large Buteo hawk, the ornate hawk-eagle is a notably powerful predator which, like other <b>booted</b> <b>eagles,</b> can take prey up to five times its own weight. Birds are the principal prey. Prey items have ranged in size from 180 g to 8 kg when taken. Prey species have included little blue herons, curassows, toucans, wood quail, pigeons, macaws, parrots, cotingas, chickens, and even a black vulture. Mammals are also significant prey, with agoutis, squirrels, rats, procyonids, and monkeys often taken. Reptiles are also occasionally hunted.|$|R

50|$|For {{terrestrial}} predators, including {{birds of}} prey, sub-Saharan Africa {{may be the}} most competitive environment in the modern world. Due to great diversity of raptors present, each species have shown adaptive specializations, which may consist of various morphological differences that allow them to capitalize on distinct prey selection, hunting methods, habitat and/or nesting habits. The larger <b>booted</b> <b>eagles</b> that dominate the avian food chain in Africa consists of martial eagles, 4 kg Verreaux's eagles and 3.64 kg crowned eagles, which due to their size and conspicuousness may lend themselves to comparisons. While prey species may overlap in these in southern Africa and some parts of east Africa, where the prey size range of all three eagles averages 1 to 5 kg, these three powerful eagles differ considerably in habitat preferences, nesting habits and hunting methods. The Verreaux's eagle nests in and hunts around rocky, mountainous kopje to be in close proximity to the much favored prey, rock hyraxes, which they mainly use contour-hunting (hugging the uneven ground to surprise the prey) to capture. The crowned eagle dwells mainly in mature forests, building nests in large interior trees, and is primarily a perch-hunter, watching and listening for monkeys and other prey over a long period. While all three are known to locally favor rock hyraxes, the nesting habitat differences where they overlap are sufficient to allow these birds not to effect one another. The average prey mass of Verreaux's eagle was similar to that martial eagles, with a pair of studies showing it ranges from 1.82 to 2.6 kg. The mean prey mass of crowned eagles in southern Africa also appears to be similar to that of martial eagles but in west Africa (i.e. Ivory Coast) it was considerably heavier at 5.67 kg (which may well be the highest mean prey mass for any of the world’s raptors). Elsewhere, mean prey masses for the larger <b>booted</b> <b>eagles</b> appears to be considerably smaller than in the larger African species, i.e. single studies for the Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti) and wedge-tailed eagles showed means of 0.45 kg and 1.3 kg, respectively, while a large number of extensive dietary studies for the golden eagle show its global mean prey mass is around 1.61 kg.|$|R
40|$|While {{alteration}} of the migratory habits of birds {{is widely regarded}} as one of the most evident ecological effects of climate change, studies reporting shifts in migration phenology for long-lived, long-distance migrants have been few. Using time series of count data collected in southern Spain during autumn migration, we examined the magnitude and direction of phenological shifts for six common species of soaring birds. Many current methods for investigating phenological change rely on continuous data sets; however, these data may be unavailable for a variety of reasons. We used a cross-correlation analysis, which allowed us to compare recent data on the timing of migration from 1999 – 2011 to a historic data set collected during 1976 – 1977. The direction of phenological shifts for autumn migration was species-specific. White Storks Ciconia ciconia and Black Kites Milvus migrans appeared to have delayed passage, Black Storks Ciconia nigra and European Honey Buzzards Pernis apivorus have advanced their migratory timing, and we found no clear phenological change for Short-toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus or <b>Booted</b> <b>Eagles</b> Hieraaetus pennatus...|$|R

40|$|Our {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 2003 – 2012 in Eastern Ukraine, in the basin of the Seversky Donets river. The total surveyed area was ca. 900 km 2 of nesting habitats suitable for raptors. A total of 69 vacant nests were found, i. e. 33. 2 % {{of the total number of}} nests (208). Nests occupied by recipient species, i. e. the so-called ‘effective nest pool’, were 23 – 24, i. e. 33. 3 – 34. 7 % of the pool of available nests. Up to 25 % of all pairs of raptors depend on the availability of vacant nests of heterospecifics. Ravens (Corvus corax) are the most significant donors of nests: 42. 5 % of the pool of available nests is built by this species, and more than 60 % of them are occupied by recipient species. Common Buzzard (Buteo buteo) comes second with 26. 09 and 58. 3 %, respectively. The most common recipients of nests are Hobbies (Falco subbuteo), Common Kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) and <b>Booted</b> <b>Eagles</b> (Hieraaetus pennatus). The most significant factors that govern occupation of vacant nests by recipient species are: availability of nests in the marginal zone of forest plots, i. e. within 500 m from the forest edge, large distance from human settlements (> 1500 m), presence of nests located on trees in the canopy storey, and mature and submature age of forest stands. For seven species considered in our research (n= 227), the most important factors were position of nests, in the forest canopy layer, no logging activity within 300 m of the nest, no regular human disturbance, and presence of “windows” in the canopy made by fallen trees...|$|R
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} {{infrequently}} hunts other birds of prey, perhaps doing so {{only slightly more}} often than do crowned eagles and Verreaux's eagles. In comparison, the temperate-zone-dwelling golden eagle is a fairly prolific predator of other birds of prey. This {{may be due to}} more scarce prey resources in colder regions forcing eagles to pursue difficult prey such as this more frequently, whereas <b>booted</b> <b>eagles</b> in rich Africa biospheres may not need to do so as much. Nonetheless, a somewhat diverse range of raptorial birds have been identified as prey for martial eagles: the 0.61 kg lanner falcon (Falco biarmicus), the 0.65 kg spotted eagle owl (Bubo africanus) (with a surprisingly large number of 6 found at one nest in Tsavo East), the 0.67 kg pale chanting goshawk (Melierax canorus), the 2.04 kg hooded vulture (Necrosyrtes monachus) (in one case after a protracted aerial battle), the 4.17 kg white-headed vulture (Trigonoceps occipitalis) and even Africa’s largest bird of prey, the 9.28 kg Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres). As apex predators, martial eagles are themselves largely invulnerable to predation. A video exists that purportedly depicts a leopard killing a martial eagle but this eagle was misidentified as it actually features a leopard preying on an immature African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vociferus) (and, at that, one that was possibly grounded for unknown reasons). There are, however, verified (if rare) cases of caracals preying on sleeping martial eagles at night, by climbing trees and pouncing in an ambush. It is possible that leopards may too ambush sleeping eagles but post-fledgling martial eagles are known to be highly wary and healthy individuals a great majority of the time will successfully evade potential dangers by day. Predation on nests of martial eagles, beyond those by humans, are little-known, with no verified depredations known in the literature, but are likely to occur.|$|R
