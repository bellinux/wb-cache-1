[...] Initial proposal of adopting Soviet Tamir-11(MG-11, NATO reporting name Stag Hoof) search light sonar was rejected, because it was not considered adequate enough due to its single <b>beam</b> <b>search</b> capability, which means the low speed of search cycle would easily lose targets. A more capable indigenous Chinese sonar was ordered to be developed, with Mr. Huo Guozheng (霍国正) named as the general designer. The resulting indigenous Chinese domestic sonar was SJD-1 low frequency (LF), high power, large aperture sonar with a cylindrical array (designated as Type 601 sonar array), which was accepted into service after eleven major trials at the sea. Type 601 sonar array of SJD-1 sonar has a diameter of 2 meters, height of 1 meter and weight of 4 tons, and the range is in excess of 6 nautical miles (nm), more than twice the range of Soviet Tamir/MG-11 search light sonar originally proposed. SJD-1 sonar was jointly developed by 706th Research Institute, 726th & 461th Factories, and it is the first bow mounted sonar adopted by Chinese navy. SJD-1 is frequently confused with its successor SJD-2, more commonly referred as SJD-II, whose design started in the 1970s, but was not completed until the 1980s due to major redesign. SJD-1 sonar was installed on Luda class destroyers and subsequently upgraded to SJD-2 in the 1980s.|$|E

30|$|The {{demand for}} {{wireless}} broadband communication {{has been growing}} rapidly, {{which has been the}} driving force for the emergence of 5 G cellular networks. It has recently been shown in the literature that millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is not only feasible for dynamic outdoor cellular networks, but can facilitate a thousand fold increase in data capacity [1 – 4]. The mmWave cellular networks are expected to first be deployed in dense urban environments where the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal may typically be unavailable, and the demand for large data rates is high. With coverage ranges that can extend to hundreds of meters, the network must be solely responsible for localization, while also simultaneously achieving high data rates in such scenarios [1]. Communication performance in 5 G networks will be limited by the amount of time required to align the highly directional beams of the communicating nodes, particularly for exhaustive <b>beam</b> <b>searches,</b> which are costly to capacity [5]. A network that is able to localize node positions can significantly reduce the time spent on beam alignment and increase capacity [6]. Thus, it is important to characterize the performance of mmWave network localization for urban scenarios.|$|R

However, high free-space path loss makes it necessary to employ beamforming capable directional antennas. When beamforming is used, the links are sensitive to misalignment in antenna directionality because of movement of devices. To identify and circumvent the misalignments, we propose to use the motion sensors (i. e., accelerometer and gyroscope) which are already present in most of the modern mobile devices. By finding the extent of misaligned beams, corrective actions are carried out to reconfigure the antennas. Motion sensors on mobile devices provide means to estimate the extent of misalignments. We collected real data from motion sensors and steer the beams appropriately. The results from our study show that the sensors are capable of detecting the cause of errors as translational or rotational movements.
