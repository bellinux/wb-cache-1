40|$|In {{open pit}} mining, it is {{important}} to know as much information as possible about rock masses to be mined for more cost-effective mining operation. In rock engineering perspective, information about rock mass characteristics usually includes hardness of the rock, geological features, fractures, faults, ore contacts, water bearing stratum. The information about large scale rock mass characterisation is still based on traditional methods such as widely spacedcore drillings, geological mapping of exposed walls, analysis of drill cutting, etc but these methods involve uncertainty about rock mass characteristics in uncored areas. In addition, they are expensive and time consuming. The need for more inexpensive methods providing high resolution rock mass characterisation over large mining areas is therefore a priority forfuture mining industry. Measurement While Drilling (MWD) is a well-established drill monitoring technique which provides information about the rock mass in each production hole. This technique is inexpensive and also ensures high resolution information. By using this technique, drill parameters such as penetration rate, feed force, rotation speed, rotation torque and air pressure are recorded during production drilling which can be used to characterise the penetrated rock mass. However, recorded parameters are not only influencedby the variation of rock mass characteristics; they are also affected by the operators, rig control system interventions, bit wear and measurement errors. In order to use this large amount of data on recorded parameters for the purpose of rock mass characterisation, it is necessary to improve our existing understanding about the contribution of all the influencingfactors and to develop the techniques for identifying and minimising the effect of those factors on rock mass characterisation. The focus of this thesis is to evaluate Measurement While Drilling (MWD) system as a tool for large scale rock mass characterisation in rotary blast hole drilling. In this thesis, researchmethods mainly include literature review, data collection, processing, integration, and analysis. The data have been collected from one of the operating open pit mines in Sweden. Multivariate analysis has been performed to assess the wear of the bit. This thesis presents an attempt to evaluate recorded penetration rate and calculated specific energy for rock mass characterisation. Penetration rate is considered as resistance to crushingof the rock while the calculated specific energy is taken as an index of the mechanical efficiency of a rock working process. The analysis shows that horizontal maps of penetration rate and specific energy (hole average) value reflects the variation of rock mass characteristics in a bench. The areas in the bench which have comparatively higher penetration rate and lower specific energy reflect possible interaction between the bit and soft or weak rock orheavily jointed rock. In contrast some areas in the bench have a relatively lower penetration rate and higher specific energy, indicating possible interaction between the bit and hard rock. In addition, using penetration rate and specific energy values between two subsequent benches indicate similar boundaries among the penetrated zones. When plotting specific energy against penetration rate in each bench, a clear inverse non-linear relationship has beenfound between those parameters. This correlation indicates that penetration rate and specific energy can indicate rock mass behaviour. Further, statistical analysis is done to observe the statistical significance of penetration rate and specific energy values among the different penetrated areas in the bench. The results indicate that penetration rate and specific energy can be used for characterizing large scale rock masses. In addition, information about the rockmass in the upper bench can possibly be used in the next bench to improve production planning. However, hole by hole analysis shows penetration rate and specific energy are influenced by bit wear, hole depth variables, flushing system, operator influence, drill control system, etc. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that penetration rate and specific energy reflecting the change of rock mass characteristics basically are not correlated to bit life length. The bit life length seems instead to be well correlated to the operational parameters such as rotation torque, rotation speed and to a minor extent feed force. Conclusions from PCA analysis must be conservative since the explanation rate for the first two components islimited to 56. 5 %. Further, the analysis shows that recorded penetration rate has a negative trend with the increasing hole depth. The calculated specific energy has a positive trend with the increasing hole depth. This means that recorded parameters are influenced by hole depth variables. The flushing system also influences recorded parameters. The analysis shows that constant air pressure from the collaring point to the end does not give a clear indication of better flushing system as frequent joints and regular water ingression usually cause fluctuation of pressure. Some of the above mentioned problems can be handled to minimise the effect of influencing factors on recorded parameters. The direct effect of bit wear and hole depth dependency can be minimised by generating a horizontal map of recorded data (e. g. penetration rate) over a large area in the <b>bench.</b> <b>Hole</b> depth dependency on recorded parameters can also be neutralised by performing normalisation based on a regression line using simple geometry. Inshort, the effect of influencing factors on the recorded parameters obtained by using the Measurement While Drilling technique can be minimised and, this technique, in turn, can become a useful tool for large scale rock mass characterisation.

40|$|Abstract In {{hard rock}} mining {{blasting}} {{is the most}} productive excavation technique applied to fragment insitu rock to the required size for efficient loading and crushing. In order to blast the insitu rock to the desired fragment size blast design parameter such as <b>bench</b> height <b>hole</b> diameter spacing burden hole length bottom charge specific charge and rock factor are considered. The research was carried out as a practical method on Nchanga Open Pits NOP ore Bench to optimize the blasting design parameters that can yield the required fragmentation size thereby reducing the shovel loading times and maximizing efficiency of the subsequent mining unit operations such as hauling and crushing. Fragmentation characteristics such as the mean fragment size were measured {{by means of a}} digital measuring tape and predicated using the Kuznetsov equation and rock factor value of ore bench was calculated using Lilly 1986 equations by means of rock characteristics. Traditional blasting design parameters were acquired for NOP and modified using Langerfors and Sharma P. A approaches. Several blast operations were conducted using both traditional and modified blasting design parameters on the same ore bench with the same geological conditions. Loading times of the shovel and fragment sizes were obtained after the blasts from ore bench where both the traditional and modified blasting design parameters were applied. Results show that mean fragment size and loading times were reduced from 51 cm and 12 minutes to 22 cm and 3 minutes where traditional and modified blasting design parameters were applied respectively...|$|R

40|$|A {{discrete}} element {{computer program}} named DMC{underscore}BLAST (Distinct Motion Code) {{has been under}} development since 1987 for modeling rock blasting (Preece {ampersand} Taylor, 1989). This program employs explicit time integration and uses spherical or cylindrical elements that are represented as circles in two dimensions (2 -D). DMC{underscore}BLAST calculations compare favorably with data from actual bench blasts (Preece et al, 1993). Buffer Choke blasting is commonly used in surface gold mines to break the rock and dilate it sufficiently for ease of digging, with the assumption of insignificant horizontal movement. The blast designs usually call for relatively shallow <b>holes</b> <b>benches</b> ({lt} 11 m) with small blastholes (approx. 165 mm), small burdens and spacings ({lt} 5 m), often with 50 % {{or more of the}} hole stemmed. Control of blast-induced horizontal movement is desired because the ore is assayed in place from the blasthole drill cuttings and digging polygons of ore and waste are laid out before the blast. Horizontal movement at the ore waste boundary can result in dilution of the ore or loss of ore with the waste. The discrete element computer program DMC{underscore}BLAST has been employed to study spatial variation of horizontal rock motion during buffer choke blasting. Patterns of rock motion can be recognized from the discrete element simulations that would be difficult or impossible to recognize in the field (Preece, Tidman and Chung, 1997). Techniques have been developed to calculate ore waste and dilution from the horizontal movement predicted by DMC{underscore}BLAST. Four DMC{underscore}BLAST simulations of buffer blasting have been performed. The blasts are identical except that the burden and spacing are systematically varied which also changes the powder factor. Predictions of ore waste or dilution are made for each burden in the blast, assuming no horizontal movement, to illustrate the spatial variation observed...|$|R
