500|$|With the {{official}} UK record chart for Jubilee week {{about to be}} released, the Daily Mirror predicted that [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] would <b>be</b> <b>number</b> <b>one.</b> As it turned out, the record placed second, behind a Rod Stewart single in its fourth week at the top. Many believed that the record had actually qualified for the top spot, but that the chart had been rigged to prevent a spectacle. McLaren later claimed that CBS Records, which was distributing both singles, {{told him that the}} Sex Pistols were actually outselling Stewart two to one. There is evidence that an exceptional directive was issued by the British Phonographic Institute, which oversaw the chart-compiling bureau, to exclude sales from record-company operated shops such as Virgin's for that week only.|$|E

For Sylvia Patterson of the NME, {{the song is}} an [...] "obscenely catchy Motown swinger", she added that it is [...] "the proper pop genius destined to <b>be</b> <b>number</b> <b>one</b> until Japan falls into the sea". Rolling Stone magazine's David Wild called it [...] "a retro, Supremes-lite confection that's as undeniable as it is unoriginal." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as a [...] "delicious re-creation of Motown-era bop packed with skipping-down-the-street good vibrations". Larry Flick of Billboard magazine said that it has [...] "a bouncy, Supremes-like retro vibe", and called its hook [...] "irresistible". Flick also praised the David Morales remix of the song, calling it [...] "a vibrant, time-sensitive disco ditty", while Howard Scripps from The Press of Atlantic City called it [...] "an obvious girl-group ditty", and added that it [...] "is another potential hit".

While privately Everett doubted any station would play the song due to its length at over 6 minutes, he said nothing to Mercury and placed the song on the turntable, and, after hearing it, enthused: [...] "forget it, it's going to <b>be</b> <b>number</b> <b>one</b> for centuries". While Capital Radio hadn't officially accepted the song, the anarchic Everett would talk incessantly about a record he had but couldn't play, before the song [...] "accidentally" [...] started playing, with Everett stating: [...] "Oops, my finger must've slipped." [...] Capital's switchboard was jammed with callers wanting to know when the song was going to be released – on one occasion Everett aired the song 36 times in one day.|$|E

In total, sixteen songs failed to reach number one with Record Retailer but topped the NME chart. In 1969, after the BMRB chart was introduced, four songs topped the NME but not the BMRB chart. Notable discrepancies include [...] "19th Nervous Breakdown" [...] which reached number one on the NME, Disc, and Melody Maker charts, topped the BBC's Pick of the Pops aggregated chart and was announced as number one on Top of the Pops; however, because it did not reach number one on the Record Retailer chart it is omitted from the Official Chart Company's canon. The Beatles' [...] "Please Please Me" [...] suffered the same fate so, arguably, should be considered The Beatles' first number-one single.

In Ireland, the album peaked at number 22 on the chart in late January, {{at the same time}} as [...] "La La" [...] was released as a single chart.

Simpson's success in album sales with Autobiography outshines that of her sister Jessica, who despite having a singing career since 1999, failed to attain major success with record sales until she appeared on her 2003 reality television show. Geffen President Jordan Schur said of Simpson's success: [...] "It's unheard of in this business—even for a superstar—to sell this number of records," [...] and emphasized her relative obscurity until not long before the album's release. Simpson expressed surprise at the degree of her album's success: [...] "I just hoped my album charted. I didn't expect it to <b>be</b> <b>number</b> <b>one</b> in the country! It was a huge shock."
