5|$|Although {{there had}} <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> {{fighting}}, the main Japanese force on Manus {{had not been}} located. Advancing inland towards Rossum, the 7thCavalry found it on 20March. Six days of fighting around Rossum were required before the 7th and 8thCavalry reduced the entrenched Japanese positions there. The Japanese bunkers, actually log and earth pillboxes, proved resistant to artillery fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{policy of}} the government in employing so weak and vacillating a person as General Miles to look after the uneasy Indians, has resulted in a terrible loss of blood to our soldiers, and a battle which, at best, is a disgrace to the war department. There has <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time for prompt and decisive measures, the employment of which would have prevented this disaster.|$|E
25|$|Several of Lightvessels {{had been}} sunk along the coast, the vessels were {{tethered}} and the Trinity House crews could not manoeuvre. Radar usually picked up enemy raiders {{before they reached}} the target area but in poor light, the ships were very vulnerable. Both Keith Park and Leigh-Mallory were concerned the Luftwaffe would attack lightships off the East Coast {{and they decided to}} put up aerial patrols over the coast near their anchorages. Convoy Bosom sailed from Lyme Bay and Hurricanes from 238 Squadron chased off three Bf109s; the Hurricanes spotted a Seenotflugkommando 4 He59 ambulance at 14:30 and shot it down, killing the four crew. As Bosom steamed eastwards, another He 59 from Seenotflugkommando 1 arrived and shadowed the convoy and was attacked by 43 Squadron. A Hurricane was shot down and the pilot bailed out but drowned and the He 59 escaped into cloud. Aircraft from 601 Squadron took over and the Heinkel was shot down; the crew bailed out too low and their parachutes failed to open. As Bosom reached the RAF Kenley and RAF Biggin Hill sectors, there had <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time for the He 59s to report it and Park ordered standing patrols of 24 fighters over Bosom, split evenly between Spitfire and Hurricane units.|$|E

500|$|Watts had {{originally}} {{proposed that the}} monument {{take the form of}} a colossal bronze figure, but by 1887 was proposing that the memorial take the form of [...] "a kind of Campo Santo", consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes, to be built in Hyde Park. Watts's suggestion was not taken up, leading Watts to comment that [...] "if I had proposed a race course round Hyde Park, there would have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> sympathisers". However, his high-profile lobbying further raised the already high public awareness of the death of Alice Ayres.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{interview}} with Guy Raz of Weekend All Things Considered, Chabon {{said that he}} writes from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. each day, Sunday through Thursday. He tries to write 1,000 words a day. Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day. If {{you want to write}} novels, they take a long time, and they're big, and {{they have a lot of}} words in them.... The best environment, at least for me, is a very stable, structured kind of life." ...|$|E
500|$|Watts by {{this stage}} had {{abandoned}} {{the idea of a}} colossal bronze figure, and proposed [...] "a kind of Campo Santo", consisting of a covered way and marble wall inscribed with the names of everyday heroes, to be built in Hyde Park. Despite an offer of funding from John Passmore Edwards, Watts's suggestion was not taken up, leading Watts to comment that [...] "if I had proposed a race course round Hyde Park, there would have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> sympathisers". Watts continued to lobby for such a memorial, with both himself and Mary Watts redrafting their wills to leave the bulk of their estate to the purpose, and considered selling his home, New Little Holland House, to finance the project.|$|E

500|$|Charles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times, though mildly {{critical}} {{of a few}} of the show's elements still was impressed with Fun Home, saying [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> new American musicals better put together than Fun Home, but I can't think of one in recent years that has touched me as much with its tender, ironic and courageous vulnerability." [...] He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it [...] "gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional" [...] but that it [...] "succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2011, it was {{announced}} that McGregor was to leave Neighbours after contract negotiations led to his role being written out of the show. A reporter for the Herald Sun said McGregor's contract had not been renewed after it expired. The reporter also said the McGregor wanted to pursue other acting opportunities. McGregor also wanted to pursue modelling opportunities in Europe and he explained, [...] "It's been tough [...] I didn't realise how many hours were involved, and I had to knock back so many modelling jobs." [...] McGregor shot his final scenes in late April 2011. McGregor said Mark's exit storyline would see him forced out of Ramsay Street. He explained, [...] "things get very difficult for Mark, and he's forced to make some tough decisions - both about his career and his feelings for Kate." [...] Mark's departure unfolded during a real time episode, which was broadcast on 22 June 2011. Mark was forced to go into witness protection after he was stalked and threatened for exposing corruption within the police force. In a twist to the storyline, Mark was later said to have been killed. McGregor believed Mark could return in the future, saying [...] "There have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> other characters who've come back from the dead - but that's not to say I'd want to. But if Brennan ever does pop up again, I'd like to be asked first for the role." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gossage was harshly {{critical}} of CART's decision. He argued that CART assured him it could run the race {{even though it}} had not conducted more extensive tests at the track. Russell argued that there was no time due to scheduling conflicts. Michael Andretti added that there was no real way to simulate ≈26 or more cars in a race. ESPN's Robin Miller later said that CART should have known there was a problem the minute the first driver clocked [...] on Friday—which would have <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to slow down the cars and race safely.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing {{the world}} premiere, Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded The Classical Style as an [...] "exuberantly witty and often {{touching}} one-act opera" [...] and wrote, [...] "There has <b>been</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> musicology written about opera, the brilliant pianist and writer Jeremy Denk points out, but never an opera about musicology. Now he and composer Steven Stucky have rectified that oversight in glorious fashion." [...] Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times similarly {{called it an}} [...] "illuminating, academic, occasionally combative, close study of the musical style of Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven by a brilliant pianist and scholar who died in 2012." [...] Richard Scheinin of the San Jose Mercury News declared it a [...] "winning little opera" [...] and further described it as [...] "gorgeous to hear, and filled with laughs." [...] Reviewing the New York City premiere, Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times wrote, [...] "It’s {{hard to say what}} the future holds for The Classical Style. But even those who lack understanding of the rudiments of harmony would surely enjoy it, while also learning something in the most entertaining way."
