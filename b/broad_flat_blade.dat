50|$|In gardening, a spade is a {{hand tool}} used to dig or loosen ground, or {{to break up}} lumps in the soil. Together with the fork it forms {{one of the chief}} {{implements}} wielded by the hand in agriculture and horticulture. It is sometimes considered a type of shovel. Its typical shape is a <b>broad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> with a sharp lower edge, straight or curved. The upper edge {{on either side of the}} handle affords space for the user's foot, which drives it into the ground. The wooden handle ends in a cross-piece, sometimes T-shaped and sometimes forming a kind of loop for the hand.|$|E

50|$|The broad-bladed tree sponge {{may grow}} to 20 cm in height and be 2-4 cm thick. It {{is a massive}} erect sponge, having <b>broad</b> <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> {{extending}} from a small stalk. It has a slightly hairy texture, but is smooth in appearance. It is bright red in colour.|$|R
5000|$|A spatula is [...] "a <b>broad,</b> <b>flat,</b> {{flexible}} <b>blade</b> used to mix, {{spread and}} lift material" [...] including foods, drugs, plaster and paints. It {{derives from the}} Latin word for a flat piece of wood or splint (a diminutive form of the Latin spatha, meaning broadsword), and hence can also refer to a tongue depressor. The words spade (digging tool) and spathe are similarly derived. The word spatula {{is known to have}} been used in English since 1525.|$|R
50|$|Mostly {{a cutting}} sword, the rounded tip is ill-suited to thrusting, while the <b>flat,</b> <b>broad</b> <b>blade</b> is {{specialized}} for cutting. As with other similar cutting-centric arming swords, {{it can still}} be using for thrusting, though it's only likely to do damage to unarmored targets.|$|R
50|$|Oakeshott X {{describes}} {{the type of}} sword common in the late Viking age, remaining in use up to the 13th century. It features a <b>broad</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> with an average length of 80 cm with a very wide and shallow fuller running almost {{the entire length of}} the blade but fading out just before the point (which is typically rounded). The grip has the same average length as earlier Viking swords of about 9 cm. The tang is usually very <b>flat</b> and <b>broad,</b> and tapers sharply towards the pommel. The cross or cross-guard is of square section, about 18-20 cm, tapering towards the tips, in some rare cases slightly curved. The type X is narrower and longer than the typical Viking sword, representing a transitional type to the knightly sword of the High Middle Ages. Tenth century Norsemen referred to this type of sword as gaddhjalt (meaning spike hilt). The pommel usually takes an oval Brazil-nut form or a disk-shape. The inlaid ULFBERHT mark is characteristic of the type X sword.|$|R

2500|$|During the Middle Ages spathula {{was used}} to refer to the {{shoulder}} blade. Spathula is a diminutive of spatha, with the latter originally meaning broad, two-edged sword without a point, <b>broad,</b> <b>flat,</b> wooden instrument for stirring any liquid, a spattle, spatula [...] or spathe of the palm tree [...] and its diminutive used in classical and late Latin for referring to a leg of pork [...] or a little palmbranch. The English word spatula is actually derived from Latin spatula, an orthographic variant of spathula. Oddly enough, classical Latin non-diminutive spatha can be translated as English spatula, while its Latin diminutive spatula is not translated as English spatula. Latin spatha is derived from ancient Greek σπάθη. Therefore, the form spathula is more akin to its origin than spatula. Ancient Greek σπάθη has a similar meaning as Latin spatha, as any broad blade, and can also refer to a spatula or to the broad blade of a sword., but also to the blade of an oar. The aforementioned πλάται for shoulder blades was also used for blades of an oar. Concordantly σπάθη was also {{used to refer to}} the shoulder blade. Interestingly, the English word spade, as well as the Dutch equivalent spade [...] is cognate with σπάθη. Please notice, that the aforementioned term pala as applied by Roman physician Caelius Aurelianus, also means spade. Pala is probably related to the Latin verb pandere, to spread out, [...] and to extend. This verb is thought to be derived from an earlier form spandere, with the root spa-. Σπάθη is actually derived from the similar root spē(i), that means to extend. It seems that os latum scapularum, ὠμοπλάτη, πλάται, pala, spathula and σπάθη all refer to the same aspect of the shoulder blade, i.e. being a <b>flat,</b> <b>broad</b> <b>blade,</b> with the latter three words etymological related to each other.|$|R

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments concerning the behavior of several types of impellers regarding the depression formatted and operating in a specific range of rotations. Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R

2500|$|Early axial {{compressors}} offered poor efficiency, so {{poor that}} in the early 1920s a number of papers claimed that a practical jet engine would be impossible to construct. Things changed after A. A. Griffith published a seminal paper in 1926, noting that the reason for the poor performance was that existing compressors used <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and were essentially [...] "flying stalled". He showed that the use of airfoils instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> would increase efficiency to the point where a practical jet engine was a real possibility. He concluded the paper with a basic diagram of such an engine, which included a second turbine that was used to power a propeller.|$|R
