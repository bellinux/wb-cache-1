5|$|The B-1 {{was first}} envisioned in the 1960s as a {{platform}} that would combine the Mach 2 speed of the B-58 Hustler with the range and payload of the B-52, and would ultimately replace both bombers. After {{a long series of}} studies, Rockwell International (now part of Boeing) won the design contest for what emerged as the B-1A. This version had a top speed of Mach 2.2 at high altitude and the capability of flying for long distances at Mach 0.85 at very low altitudes. The combination of the high cost of the aircraft, the introduction of the AGM-86 ALCM cruise missile that flew the same <b>basic</b> <b>profile,</b> and early work on the stealth bomber all significantly affected the need for the B-1. This led to the program being cancelled in 1977, after the B-1A prototypes had been built.|$|E
25|$|Published in February 2014 by the OpenID Foundation, {{the third}} {{generation}} of OpenID technology, OpenID Connect, is an authentication layer that sits {{on top of the}} OAuth 2.0 authorization framework. It allows computing clients to verify the identity of an end-user based on the authentication performed by an authorization server, as well as to obtain the <b>basic</b> <b>profile</b> information about the end-user in an interoperable and REST-like manner. In technical terms, OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format. OpenID Connect allows a range of organizations, including web-based, mobile and JavaScript clients, to request and receive information about authenticated sessions and end-users. The OpenID Connect specification is extensible, supporting optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID providers, and session management.|$|E
