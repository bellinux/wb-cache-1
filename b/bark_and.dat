5|$|Building traditions {{varied by}} region {{and type of}} structure. Food storage houses - stabbur - were usually built on stilts in ways that made it {{difficult}} for mice and rats, but not cats, to get in. Exterior cladding varied by region, often to take into account local climate conditions. Roofs were often covered with birch <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> sod.|$|E

5|$|Mycena inclinata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, deriving its {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves, twigs, <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> branches.

5|$|Red pandas are {{excellent}} climbers, and forage largely in trees. They eat mostly bamboo, and may eat small mammals, birds, eggs, flowers, and berries. In captivity, they were observed to eat birds, flowers, maple and mulberry leaves, and <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> fruits of maple, beech, and mulberry.|$|E
5|$|The pudús are herbivorous, {{consuming}} vines, {{leaves from}} low trees, shrubs, succulent sprouts, herbs, ferns, blossoms, buds, tree <b>bark,</b> <b>and</b> fallen fruit. They can survive without drinking water {{for long periods}} due to the high water content of the succulent foliage in their diets.|$|E

5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever fruit is available in addition to tree <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|Habitat loss has {{occurred}} through commercial harvesting of the sago, or conversion to rice cultivation and fishponds. The rail is a prized food for local people who catch it with traps made from strings of <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> hunt it with dogs. The only described nest {{was in an}} area well-used by local villagers, and the rail may be more adaptable to habitat changes than had been thought. There were also several sightings in northeast Halmahera in 2008 and 2011, extending {{the area in which}} this bird has been seen in recent years.|$|E

5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} about their {{behaviour}} until the field studies of Birutė Galdikas, who became a leading authority on the apes. When she arrived in Borneo, Galdikas settled into a primitive <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> thatch hut, at a site she dubbed Camp Leakey, {{near the edge of}} the Java Sea. Despite numerous hardships, she remained there for over 30 years and became an outspoken advocate for orangutans and the preservation of their rainforest habitat, which is rapidly being devastated by loggers, palm oil plantations, gold miners, and unnatural forest fires.|$|E

5|$|Persoonia levis {{is rarely}} seen in cultivation, {{mainly because of}} {{difficulties}} in propagation; seed germination is unpredictable, and cuttings have been nearly impossible to strike. Nevertheless, its colourful <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> leaves are attractive horticultural features. Well-drained sandy soils in sun or part shade are needed for the plant in a garden situation. Once established, it tolerates moderate frosts and dry spells and grows fairly readily, albeit slowly, in suitable conditions. Plantsmen in England germinated seed as early as 1795.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it gets no taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|Pure long-fibre Sphagnum moss is an {{excellent}} potting medium, though combinations involving {{any of the following}} – peat, perlite, vermiculite, sand, lava rock, pumice, Osmunda fibre, orchid <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> horticultural charcoal – may be used with equal success. The potting medium should be well-drained and not too compacted. Moss is useful for moisture retention near the roots. The mix should be thoroughly soaked in water prior to potting the plant.|$|E

50|$|The borough {{was formed}} in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 as the London Borough of Barking. The {{constituent}} parts were {{almost all of the}} Municipal Borough of <b>Barking</b> <b>and</b> the greater part of the Municipal Borough of Dagenham. At the time of the amalgamation the combined population of <b>Barking</b> <b>and</b> Dagenham was around 180,000, the northern tip of Dagenham having been incorporated into Redbridge and a small area of Barking in Newham. The borough was renamed <b>Barking</b> <b>and</b> Dagenham in 1980. In 1994 the part of the Becontree estate in Redbridge was transferred to <b>Barking</b> <b>and</b> Dagenham. The area covered by Mayesbrook Park in the Borough was once part of the historic Manor of Jenkins, seat of the Fanshawe family.|$|R

5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the hymenium and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily hollowed out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or <b>bark,</b> <b>and</b> a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, <b>bark</b> <b>and</b> nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
