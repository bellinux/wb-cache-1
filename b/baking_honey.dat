She began <b>baking</b> <b>honey</b> cakes and peddling them to the thousands of Christian pilgrims who came to Jerusalem annually before Christmas and remained there until after Easter. Often she stood at Jaffa Gate or at Lions' Gate, peddling to pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Once a pilgrim asked her if she sold Russian black bread. Kreshe experimented with different formulas until she developed her own dark bread by adding carob paste to locally made grain. Her sales of honey cake and black bread grew so much that her son Yehoshua left yeshiva to help her manage the business.|$|E

In the Castellany of Rozprza there were such villages as Woźniki (manufacture of wagons), Piekary (bread <b>baking),</b> Bartodzieje (<b>honey</b> making), and Ciesle (woodworking). Rozprza itself was completely remodelled, with a new 12-meter wide moat and a wide rampart. Altogether the defensive system of the gord was some 30 meter wide. First documented mention of Rozprza comes from the year 1065, when during the reign of King Bolesław II the Generous, Rozprza was obliged to pay a fee to a Benedictine Abbey at Mogilno. In the Bull of Gniezno (1136), Rozprza is described as an important center of trade, commerce and administration.|$|R
