25|$|Historically in Lutheranism {{there have}} been two parties {{regarding}} Eucharistic adoration: Gnesio-Lutherans, who followed Martin Luther's view in favor of adoration, and Philippists who followed Philipp Melanchthon's view against it. Although Luther did not entirely approve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, he wrote a treatise The Adoration of the Sacrament (1523) where he defended adoration <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> that the issue not be forced. In his reform of the Roman Mass Luther placed the Sanctus after the Institution Narrative to serve as a solemn act of worship of the Real Presence just brought about by the latter. After the death of Martin Luther, further controversies developed including Crypto-Calvinism and the second Sacramentarian controversy, started by Gnesio-Lutheran Joachim Westphal. The Philippist understanding of the Real Presence without overt adoration through time became dominant in Lutheranism, although it is not in accordance with Luther's teaching. The German theologian Andreas Musculus can be {{regarded as one of the}} warmest defenders of Eucharistic adoration in early Lutheranism.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, while {{awaiting}} entrance to Saumur, Lahm {{won the first}} Gordon Bennett Cup international balloon race against competitors from seven nations, all of which had a military officer as a crew member. The race, commencing at the Tuileries Garden in Paris, was actually a distance competition across the English Channel. His father had planned to pilot the balloon United States himself <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> to return to America for Katherine's wedding, and so recruited his son to fly in his place. Accompanied by Major Henry Blanchard Hersey of the United States Weather Bureau, who had studied the storm tracks and prevailing winds, Lahm started 12th {{in a field of}} 16 late in the afternoon of September 30. Under a full moon they reached the Channel before midnight and a lightship off the coast of England three hours later, where fog obscured the surface. The morning sun slowly burned off the fog and caused the balloon to ascend to 3,000 meters altitude. Lahm and Hersey established their position over Berkshire around 07:00 and continued north, gradually descending to avoid drifting out over the North Sea. They landed near Fylingdales in Yorkshire after covering a distance of 641 kilometers and more than 22 hours aloft.|$|E

500|$|On August 19, 2003, Twain's concert film Up! Live in Chicago premiered on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) {{and drew}} in over 8.87 million viewers, {{therefore}} becoming the second-most-viewed concert film on television, behind Celine Dion's A New Day... Live in Las Vegas (2003). Following its success on television, NBC was interested again in collaborating with Twain {{for a second}} prime time special. Twain accepted the offer, <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> to deviate from high-elaboration, and perform a show much more stripped and intimate than the one filmed for Up! Live in Chicago or those included in her Up! Tour (2003–04). She explained, [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} to something stripped-down and rootsy. I've been doing big concerts for quite a long time, and I love it, but I just want that contrast." [...] Ergo, she turned to singer and fiddler Alison Krauss, head of the bluegrass band Alison Krauss and Union Station, whom she had collaborated with on numerous instances; Krauss and her band backed Twain in her performance of [...] "Forever and for Always" [...] at the 2003 CMT Music Awards, and recorded a duet with Twain for [...] Twain described her decision to be completely influenced by her desire to [...] "break the music down", and that Alison Krauss and Union Station were her only choice for the television special.|$|E
500|$|Harry Flynn is a {{longtime}} business associate of Drake's and an antagonist of Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by Steve Valentine. In the second game, he approaches Drake, convincing him to [...] help steal an oil lamp from a Turkish museum for a wealthy client. The two, along with Frazer, plan to keep the lamp for themselves, believing {{it will lead to}} the location of Marco Polo's lost fleet and the treasures it holds. In reality, Flynn is working for Lazarevic, and betrays Drake, taking the location coordinates and landing Drake in prison. He then works with Lazarevic in searching for the Cintamani Stone. When Lazarevic apprehends Drake, he has Flynn force him to find the location of the entrance to Shambhala. [...] There, Lazarevic and his men, Flynn, Drake and company are attacked by the Guardians, where Flynn is gravely wounded due to a gunshot wound from Lazarevic, his employer having clearly grown tired of his failures. Flynn ultimately commits suicide while attempting to blow up Drake but severely wounds Fisher with a grenade. Naughty Dog used the dialog in the game to hint at the relationship between Drake and Flynn, <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> ambiguity regarding the exact nature of their past dealings, and to show what Drake could have become. Flynn mainly served to hint at the darker past where Drake performed less heroic activities. Flynn was not written as a British character; the casting of a British actor was mere coincidence.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Brennan concurred, <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> {{to simplify}} the test for {{determining}} a plaintiff’s Seventh Amendment rights.

[...] If the plaintiff requested a legal remedy (such as monetary damages), Brennan would simply assume that the right to a jury trial existed, unless Congress had assigned the particular action to a non-Article III tribunal, and a jury trial would frustrate the intent of Congress.|$|E
2500|$|On April 15, 1861, {{after the}} Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, President Abraham Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers {{to put down}} secession. Galena was {{enthusiastic}} {{in support of the}} war and recognized in Grant the one local with broad military experience. Grant helped recruit a company of volunteers in Galena and accompanied it to Springfield, the state capital, where untrained units were assembling in great confusion. Sponsored by his influential Congressman Elihu B. Washburne, Grant was named by the governor, Richard Yates, to train volunteers; he proved efficient and energetic in the training camps <b>but</b> <b>desired</b> a field command. Yates appointed him as a colonel in the Illinois militia and gave him command of the undisciplined and rebellious 21st Illinois Infantry on June 17. He went to Mexico, Missouri, guarding the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad from Confederate attack.

Frémont, to command the District of Southeast Missouri. He soon established his headquarters at Cairo, Illinois, where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi. His command was soon reorganized and renamed the District of Cairo.|$|E
