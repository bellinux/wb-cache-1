25|$|This was {{his first}} solo {{retrospective}} in fifteen years, and {{provides an overview of}} his work from the 1950s to now.... At the heart of the exhibition is Twombly’s work exploring the cycles associated with seasons, nature and the passing of time. Several key groups are brought together for the first time, such as Tate’s Four Seasons (1993–94) with those from the Museum of Modern Art, New York. The exhibition also explores how Twombly is influenced by antiquity, myth and the Mediterranean, for example the violent red swirls in the Bacchus 2005 paintings which <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the drunken god of wine. The exhibition provides a unique opportunity to see the full range of Twombly’s long and influential career from a fresh perspective.|$|E
500|$|Maxwell, as a character, [...] "controls the action". He is the protagonist, and traps {{the viewer}} into the {{coach in the}} opening seconds of the episode by closing the curtains. This is a {{reversal}} of the way that, in the theatre, the opening of curtains brings the viewer into the story. As the translator, he acts as the only link between Jorg and the other characters; furthermore, as the episode does not have subtitles, he acts as the link between Jorg and Anglophone viewers. Revelations about the character are seeded in a different way to other characters. His profession and supply of medication <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> [...] "upper-class gentleman serial killers" [...] or [...] "cut-glass accented British actors brought in to play cold killers in Hollywood cinema". The revelation that Maxwell is a murderer is [...] "a satisfying payoff for those who've figured it out", but in the final twist—Jorg's identity—control is taken from Maxwell and, therefore, the audience.|$|E

Max Kessler of Paper gave [...] "Aura" [...] a lukewarm review; the song had [...] "all the classic Gaga attributes", including [...] "controversial and mildly clever lyrics set to a throbbing, almost-grating dance beat that's at times great and at times horrible". Its lyrics were controversial, with some Muslims accusing Gaga of degrading the burqa by sexualizing it.

500|$|Other apologetic {{arguments}} do {{not deny}} {{the meaning of the}} papyri as determined by Egyptologists, but in addition propose that the hieroglyphic text has some hidden meaning. Some apologists argue that there are other messages and meanings embedded in the text along with the Egyptologist's translations that are unknown to us. For many years, Hugh Nibley, for instance, preferred the argument that the Sensen text has two meanings: one that can be determined by standard translation, and another than can only be divined with something like the Urim and Thummim, or a seer stone. Similarly, Richley Crapo and John Tvedtnes proposed that the Sensen text may have merely been a mnemonic device, used [...] "to <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> 'a set number of memorized phrases relating to Abraham's account of his life.'" [...] Crapo and Tvedtnes argued that, were one to compare the literal meaning of the hieroglyphic characters found in the Sensen text with the Book of Abraham, certain parallels could be found; for instance, the first hieroglyph found the in Sensen text means [...] "this", and Crapo and Tvedtnes pointed out that the opening of [...] reads, [...] "Now this priest had offered..." [...] This argument was popular within LDS circles, but Klaus Baer criticized it because the supposed parallels offered were [...] "related by no visible principle" [...] and instead seemed to have been made ad hoc.|$|E
500|$|Poulenc's {{principal}} {{works for}} large orchestra comprise two ballets, a Sinfonietta and four keyboard concertos. The {{first of the}} ballets, Les biches, was first performed in 1924 and remains one of his best-known works. Nichols writes in Grove that the clear and tuneful score has no deep, or even shallow, symbolism, a fact [...] "accentuated by a tiny passage of mock-Wagnerian brass, complete with emotive minor 9ths". The first {{two of the four}} concertos are in Poulenc's light-hearted vein. The Concert champêtre for harpsichord and orchestra (1927–28), evokes the countryside seen from a Parisian point of view: Nichols comments that the fanfares in the last movement <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> the bugles in the barracks of Vincennes in the Paris suburbs. The Concerto for two pianos and orchestra (1932) is similarly a work intended purely to entertain. It draws on a variety of stylistic sources: the first movement ends in a manner reminiscent of Balinese gamelan, and the slow movement begins in a Mozartian style, which Poulenc gradually fills out with his own characteristic personal touches. The Organ Concerto (1938) is in a much more serious vein. Poulenc said that it was [...] "on the outskirts" [...] of his religious music, and there are passages that draw on the church music of Bach, though there are also interludes in breezy popular style. The second ballet score, Les Animaux modèles (1941), has never equalled the popularity of Les biches, though both Auric and Honegger praised the composer's harmonic flair and resourceful orchestration. Honegger wrote, [...] "The influences that have worked on him, Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky, are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think– it's Poulenc." [...] The Sinfonietta (1947) is a reversion to Poulenc's pre-war frivolity. He came to feel, [...] "I dressed too young for my age... is a new version of Les biches but young girls [...] that are forty-eight years old– that's horrible!" [...] The Concerto for piano and orchestra (1949) initially caused some disappointment: many felt that it was not an advance on Poulenc's pre-war music, a view he came to share. The piece has been re-evaluated in more recent years, and in 1996 the writer Claire Delamarche rated it as the composer's finest concertante work.|$|E

Their existence remains provisional – more or less virtual – whether in life, on a gallery wall, or on a computer chip.|$|E

New York Times critic Manohla Dargis, in her review of Tekkonkinkreet, describes Treasure Town as [...] "a surreal explosion of skewed angles, leaning towers, hanging wires, narrow alleys and gaudily cute flourishes that <b>bring</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> a yakuza cityscape {{by way of a}} Hello Kitty theme park." [...] Indeed, Tekkons sumptuous art direction was widely praised, with Production Designer Kimura receiving the Best Art Direction award at the 2008 Tokyo International Anime Fair.

In the example of [...] "God Only Knows", which contains an ambivalent key and non-diatonic chords, musicologist Philip Lambert cites its [...] "choral fantasy" [...] section to contain complex key changes that elude the listener [...] "for the entire experience—that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted". Perone's interpretation also suggests a visceral musical continuity. On the second track [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "One of the high points of the composition and Brian's vocal performance... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response {{to the realization that}} his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures." [...] He describes the [...] "stepwise falloff of the interval of a third {{at the end of each}} verse" [...] to be a typically [...] "Wilsonian" [...] feature that recurs throughout the album in addition to a [...] "madrigal sigh motif" [...] that can be heard in [...] "That's Not Me", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif appears in the next track, [...] "Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in [...] "Caroline, No".
