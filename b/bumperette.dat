25|$|This LeSabre {{came out}} in 1991 for the 1992 model year, the LeSabre was {{redesigned}} {{along the same lines}} as the previous year's Park Avenue. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door ("family-style") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent <b>bumperettes.</b> The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.|$|R
5000|$|For the 2007 {{model year}} Lotus several minor changes were made. The LOTUS decals {{on the rear}} of the vehicle, {{previously}} flat stickers, were replaced by raised lettering. The headlamp units were sealed. Also, in order to comply with US Federally mandated bumper restrictions, the frontal crash structure was slightly changed and rear <b>bumperettes</b> were added next to the licence plate mount. Approximately 100 2007 model year [...] "launch" [...] cars were shipped to the US without these bumper changes. Also in 2007, the Elise S was released and the 111R renamed Elise R. All Lotus Elise cars manufactured after 1 January 2007 include the new headlights and 2.5 mi/h km/h bumpers, although they are hidden in the front.|$|R

The reason was the 1955 President Speedster was loaded with {{standard}} equipment including: choice of Studebaker Automatic Drive or overdrive transmissions, power steering, power brakes, four-barrel carburetor, dual exhaust, [...] "Shoemaker-stitched" [...] diamond-quilted genuine top-grain leather seating, carpeting front and rear, a map pocket (but no glove box) an eight-tube push-button radio, an engine-turned dashboard with a Stewart-Warner 160 mph speedometer and an 8,000 rpm tachometer, turn signals, electric clock, tinted glass, cigarette lighter, oil filter and oil bath air cleaner, dual backup lamps, triple horns, two-speed electric wipers, tubeless whitewall tires, simulated wire wheel covers and fog-light <b>bumperettes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{new body}} style {{featured}} a fastback roofline and ventless full-door glass with no rear side quarter windows. Doors were wider to permit {{easier access to}} the rear seat, and new pull-up handles replaced the old handles, for which the lower button had to be pushed in to open the door. The roof was a new double-shell unit for improved rollover protection and noise reduction. The base model featured a separate bumper/grille design with parking lights under the bumper, while the Rally Sport option included a distinctive grille surrounded by a flexible Endura material along with round parking lights beside the headlights and <b>bumperettes</b> surrounding {{on both sides of}} the grille. The rear was highlighted by four round taillights similar to the Corvette. A convertible was not offered, making this the only Camaro generation not to offer one.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Lusso" [...] (luxury) Pantera L {{was also}} introduced, in August 1972 as a 1972½ model. For the US market it {{featured}} {{a large black}} single front bumper that incorporated a built-in airfoil to reduce front end lift at high speeds, rather than the separate <b>bumperettes</b> still used abroad, {{as well as a}} 266 Net hp (198 kW) Cleveland engine. The [...] "L" [...] model featured many factory upgrades and updates that fixed most of the problems and issues the earlier cars experienced. It was so improved that the 1973 DeTomaso Pantera was Road Test Magazine’s Import car of the year beating out Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, and Porsche. During 1973 the dash was changed, going from two separate pods for the gauges to a unified unit with the dials angled towards the driver. The U.S. version 1974 Pantera GTS featured GTS badging but not the higher compression, solid lifter engine of its European GTS [...] "cousin".|$|R
