60|$|Now it is a {{fact that}} as he said these words I {{experienced}} a sensation as though a stone had come out of my throat; so readily do our nerves deceive us that I even thought it grated against my teeth as I opened my mouth to give it passage. At any rate the choking was gone, only now I felt as though I were quite empty and floating on air, as though I were not I, in short, but a mere shell of a thing, all of which doubtless was caused by the stench of those burning roots. Still I could look and take note, for I distinctly saw Zikali thrust his huge head, first into the smoke of what I will call my fire, next into that of Saduko's fire, and then lean <b>back,</b> <b>blowing</b> the stuff in clouds from his mouth and nostrils. Afterwards I saw him roll over on to his side and lie quite still with his arms outstretched; indeed, I noticed that one of his fingers seemed to be in the left-hand fire and reflected that it would be burnt off. In this, however, I must have been mistaken, since I observed subsequently that it was not even scorched.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the victim}} has signs of severe airway obstruction, and is conscious, give up to 5 <b>back</b> <b>blows</b> (sharp blows between the {{shoulder}} blades {{with the victim}} leaning well forwards). Check {{to see if the}} obstruction has cleared after each <b>blow.</b> If 5 <b>back</b> <b>blows</b> fail to relieve the obstruction, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts, again checking if each attempt has relieved the obstruction.|$|R
40|$|Foreign body {{aspiration}} {{in children}} under {{four years old}} {{is one of the}} most frequently observed reasons for accident related deaths. It is more common in this age group due to inadequate swallowing functions and exploration of objects with the mouth. The most frequently encountered foreign bodies are food and toy parts. Life threatening complete laryngeal obstruction is rarely observed. Dyspnea, hypersalivation, cough and cyanosis can be seen. The basic and life-saving treatment approach is complete removal of foreign body maneuvers in the sudden onset of total obstruction. Here we report a six-month old male, who ingested a foreign body and was treated with <b>back</b> <b>blow</b> maneuvers successfully. In this case we emphasized the importance of <b>back</b> <b>blow</b> maneuvers. Keywords: Upper airway obstruction, Child, <b>Back</b> <b>blows</b> maneuver...|$|R

50|$|The {{ingestion}} and aspiration {{of foreign}} objects poses a common and dangerous problem in young children. It {{remains one of}} {{the leading cause of death}} in children under the age of 5. Common food items (baby carrots, peanuts, etc.) and household objects (coins, metals, etc.) may lodge in various levels of the airway tract and cause significant obstruction of the airway. Complete obstruction of the airway represents a medical emergency. During such crisis, caretakers may attempt <b>back</b> <b>blows,</b> abdominal thrust, or the Heimlich maneuver to dislodge the inhaled object and reestablish airflow into the lungs.|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of foreign body obstruction {{of the upper}} airway {{has been the subject}} of considerable attention and controversy. Current recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences, the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association include the use of <b>back</b> <b>blows,</b> abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) or chest thrusts (or both) and finger probes, until definitive therapy by trained medical and paramedical personnel becomes available. Nevertheless, a number of authorities on this subject have claimed that these approaches are dangerous, and that abdominal thrusts should be the first and only first-aid technique used in this situation...|$|R
5000|$|Henry Heimlich, {{noted for}} promulgating {{abdominal}} thrusts, claimed that back slaps were proven to cause death by lodging foreign objects into the windpipe. The 1982 Yale study by Day, DuBois, and Crelin that persuaded the American Heart Association to stop recommending <b>back</b> <b>blows</b> {{for dealing with}} choking was partially funded by Heimlich's own foundation.
