5|$|The <b>bromide</b> anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of <b>bromide</b> chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. <b>Bromide</b> has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of <b>bromide</b> can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of <b>bromide</b> is about 3 to 5grams of <b>bromide,</b> thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

40|$|Background: Attempts {{to produce}} greener {{bromination}} of 2 -acetyl 9 H-fluorene with KBr+KBrO 3 reagent using fly-ash:H 2 O catalyst in aqueous media gave 9 H-fluorenacylbromides. Generally, the halo-keto compounds possess insect antifeedant activities. Therefore, the insect antifeedant activities of these acyl <b>bromides</b> {{have been studied}} using 4 th instar larvae Achoea janata L against castor semilooper. Methods: Solvent free bromination method was used for synthesizing some 9 H-fluorenacylbromides. They were characterized by UV, IR, NMR and mass spectroscopic data. Castor-leaf discs were used for evaluation of insect antifeedant activities of the synthesized acyl <b>bromides.</b> Results: The yields of synthesized acyl <b>bromides</b> were over 60 %. The physical constants, analytical and spectral data of these ketones has been determined. Halo substituted acyl <b>bromides</b> gave good insect antifeedant activities. Conclusion: Easy handling, non-hazardous and environmentally benign bromination methods have been adopted for synthesizing acyl <b>bromides</b> with good yields. Bromo substituted acyl <b>bromides</b> show better insect antifeedant activity...|$|R
5|$|<b>Bromide</b> compounds, {{especially}} potassium <b>bromide,</b> {{were frequently}} used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides {{in the form}} of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve <b>bromide</b> for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like Bromo-Seltzer, in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple <b>bromide</b> ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and <b>bromide</b> salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene <b>bromide</b> was an {{additive}} in gasolines {{containing lead}} anti-engine knocking agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead <b>bromide,</b> which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).|$|E

The in vitro microbiological activity of the synthesized phosphonium <b>bromides</b> against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and the yeast Candida albicans was determined in comparison to standard agents.

40|$|Monitoring <b>bromides</b> (Br−) is {{of crucial}} {{importance}} since bromates, potential human carcinogens, are formed during ozonation of water containing <b>bromides</b> in concentrations > 100 [*]μg[*]L− 1. Within this study, silver (Ag) and four carbon-supported Ag catalysts were synthesized by the γ-radiation method and their morphology and structure examined using transmission electron microscopy, X–ray diffraction, and UV-Vis analysis. The nanocatalysts were tested for Br− sensing in aqueous media using cyclic voltammetry. All five Ag materials exhibited electroactivity for sensing of Br− ions, with pure Ag catalyst giving the best response to Br− ions presence {{in terms of}} the lowest limit of detection. Sensing of <b>bromides</b> was also explored in tap water after addition of <b>bromides</b> suggesting that herein prepared catalysts could be used for <b>bromides</b> detection in real samples.

5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} <b>bromide</b> is a colourless gas, {{like all}} the hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen <b>bromide</b> at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen <b>bromide</b> is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{significantly}} less {{abundant in the}} crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5parts per million of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as <b>bromide</b> salts.

There, it makes up 65parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the Dead Sea contains 0.4% <b>bromide</b> ions.
