25|$|The {{population}} of Arizona, particularly in Phoenix, swelled as {{result of the}} war and it was the new military installations and associated manufacturers that provided the impetus for the growth. Many veterans who were stationed in Arizona during the war returned after the fighting was over, having found it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to find work and raise a family. In 1940, the {{population of}} Arizona was less than 500,000, but by 1950 it had grown to 750,000. The population of Phoenix in 1940 was 65,000. By 1960 it had become the largest city in the Southwest with a population of 439,000.|$|E

25|$|In late 1955, {{at the age}} of 25, McQueen left New York {{and headed}} for California, where he moved into a house on Vestal Avenue in the Echo Park area, seeking acting jobs in Hollywood. When McQueen {{appeared}} in a two-part television Westinghouse Studio One presentation entitled The Defenders, Hollywood manager Hilly Elkins (who managed McQueen's first wife, Neile) took note of him and decided that B-movies would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for the young actor to make his mark. He landed his first film role in a bit part in Somebody Up There Likes Me, directed by Robert Wise and starring Paul Newman. McQueen was subsequently hired for the films Never Love a Stranger, The Blob (his first leading role) which depicts a flesh eating amoeba-like space creature, and The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{they both}} {{traveled}} (together with their Chinese teacher Mr. Wong whom Rev. Nelson had converted) toward Changshu (Dzang Zok), {{a city of}} about 100,000 people) about 70 miles northwest of Shanghai in February 1858. They preached, including on Chinese New Year's Day, and confirmed Rev. Nelson's suggestion that it might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to establish a mission, and accordingly wrote bishop Boone for permission in May. However, a week after they received accommodation at a temple in February, a police officer advised the priest who gave them shelter not to harbor foreign devils. Before they returned in June, Britain's gunboat diplomacy had led to the Treaty of Tientsin. While Changshu's mayor was interested in their preaching (and became their new landlord), and many others also wanted the missionaries to stay, other Mandarin officials opposed them.|$|E

500|$|In the early-21st century, the Greater London Authority {{commissioned}} {{a plan to}} improve {{the road from the}} architectural firm, Terry Farrell and Partners. The original study proposed removing the underpass (which was subsequently cancelled) and providing a pedestrian crossing and removing the gyratory system connecting Tottenham Court Road and Gower Street. The scheme was approved by the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone as [...] "the start of changing the Marylebone to Euston road from a highway into a series of linked public spaces." [...] The pedestrian crossing opened in March 2010. Livingstone's successor, Boris Johnson, favours keeping the Euston Road underpass and declared it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to test his nerves when cycling around London.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{reception in}} trade publications, but some advertisements would boast {{the power of}} the film or {{go so far as to}} call it a great American drama. The The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "As a sketch of country folk, admirable because it is true. The situations are well worked out. The conversion! Could it be? A New England church meeting would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> to exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a girl could become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the imagination. That a simple little dance like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E

2500|$|A {{worker at}} DC Central Kitchen saw Tracht's apology on TV and heard {{his desire to}} show he was sorry. She thought that the [...] "Kitchen" [...] would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for him to prove himself, and shared the idea with a co-worker who knew Rock Newman; he made a phone call. Soon, Tracht was mopping floors and {{cleaning}} bathrooms for four hours a day, several times a week. He volunteered for four months, laboring with unemployed and homeless people. Of the experience, Tracht stated: [...] "It's {{the kind of place}} where you can rediscover yourself. I did things I'd never done in my life. I went in there like an idiot, and now I know how to clean and mop, how to shovel and unload, how to slice and dice." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the fall}} of 1887, after {{traveling}} through the White Pass to Lake Bennett, Moore somehow knew that gold would soon be discovered in the Yukon and {{wasted no time in}} preparing for the day his prediction would come to pass. With his son, Ben, Moore struck out for Juneau, Alaska by canoe. When they passed what would later be named Skagway, Moore noted that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for a wharf. Loading up with supplies in Juneau, they swiftly returned through the Lynn Canal to Skagway Bay where Moore preempted [...] {{at the mouth of the}} Skagway River at a place the Indians called Skagua, and named it Mooresville. He built a log cabin, a sawmill, and began the construction of a wharf in anticipation of the ships that would land there, offloading thousands of eager gold-seekers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{culture and}} {{intellectual}} {{output of the}} Jewish community in Poland {{had a profound impact}} on Judaism as a whole. Some Jewish historians have recounted that the word Poland is pronounced as Polania or Polin in Hebrew, and as transliterated into Hebrew, these names for Poland were interpreted as [...] "good omens" [...] because Polania can be broken down into three Hebrew words: po ("here"), lan ("dwells"), ya ("God"), and Polin into two words of: po ("here") lin (" [...] dwell"). The [...] "message" [...] was that Poland was meant to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for the Jews. During the time from the rule of Sigismund I the Old until the Nazi Holocaust, Poland would be at the center of Jewish religious life. Many agreed with Rabbi David ben Shemu’el ha-Levi (Taz) that Poland was a place where “most of the time the gentiles do no harm; on the contrary they do right by Israel” (Divre David; 1689).|$|E

2500|$|Henry Vane {{was a young}} aristocrat, and {{possibly}} the most socially prominent person {{to come to the}} Massachusetts Bay colony in the 1630s. [...] He was born in 1613 to Henry Vane the Elder, a Privy counsellor of Charles I and therefore {{one of the most powerful}} men in England. [...] The younger Vane had an intense religious experience when he was in his teens which left him confident of his salvation, and his ensuing beliefs did not conform with the established Anglican Church. [...] He came to New England with the blessing of William Laud, who thought that this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>place</b> for him to get Puritanism out of his system. [...] He was 22 years old when he arrived in Boston on 6 October 1635, and his devoutness, social rank, and character lent him an air of greatness. Winthrop called him a [...] "noble gentleman" [...] in his journal.|$|E
