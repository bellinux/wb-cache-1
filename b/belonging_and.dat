5|$|In 1979, Davies {{completed}} his O-Levels and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the University of Oxford; he abandoned his aspirations {{of becoming a}} comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him that his colour-blindness would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create Welsh-language drama to be performed at the National Eisteddfod of Wales, including Pair Dadeni, a play based on the Mabinogion myth cycle, and Perthyn, a drama about community <b>belonging</b> <b>and</b> identity in early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by Worcester College, Oxford to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially 19th-century literature such as Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha Empire {{was founded}} in 1645 by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj of the Bhosle dynasty. Common {{elements}} among the citizens of Raja Shivaji's Maratha Empire were the Marathi language, the Hindu religion, {{a strong sense of}} <b>belonging,</b> <b>and</b> a national feeling. Raja Shivaji led resistance efforts to free the Hindus from the Mughals and Muslim Sultanate of Bijapur and established rule of the Brahminical Hindus. This kingdom was known as the Hindavi Swarajya ("Hindu self-rule") in the Marathi language. Raja Shivaji's capital was located at Raigad.Raja Shivaji successfully defended his empire from attacks by the Mughal Empire and his Maratha Empire went on to defeat and overtake it as the premier power in India within few decades. A key component of the Maratha administration was the council of eight ministers, called the Ashta Pradhan (council of eight). The senior-most member of the Ashta Pradhan was called the Peshwa or the Mukhya Pradhan (prime minister). The Peshwa was the right-hand man of Raja Shivaji.|$|E

25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of <b>belonging</b> <b>and</b> a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E
500|$|Ndlovu-Gatsheni {{argued that}} since the mid-1990s, Mugabe's rhetoric and speeches came to be {{dominated}} by three main themes: an obsession with a perceived British threat to re-colonise Zimbabwe, to transfer the land controlled by white farmers to the black population, and issues of <b>belonging</b> <b>and</b> patriotism. References to the Rhodesian Bush War featured prominently in Mugabe's speeches. The scholar of African studies Abiodun Alao noted that Mugabe was determined to [...] "take advantage of the past in order to secure a firm grip on national security".|$|E

It sought to provide children with experiences that enriched their knowledge about their environment and improved their reasoning, through teaching them mathematical and geometric concepts. The show introduced its viewers to Arab history by citing important events, such as showing castles that were the center of historic battles. Geography was highlighted, especially the location of countries and their cities and capitals, which had the secondary effect of helping children increase their feelings of <b>belonging</b> <b>and</b> feeling proud of their Arab heritage. Children's social awareness, especially their comprehension of social roles and their functions, was also emphasized.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} religiosity, the need to <b>belong</b> <b>and</b> body image among adolescent girls. Previous literature indicates {{that there is a}} positive relationship between religiosity and individuals’ self-rated physical, mental, emotional, and cognitive well-being; however, this research has focused largely on young adults and the elderly. My study will help expand on this literature by examining adolescent girls. During this time of discovery for teenagers, the need to <b>belong</b> <b>and</b> its connection with body image are pivotal factors for growth and development. An analysis of the data from the National Study of Youth and Religion (n= 1670) will assess how religion affects girls’ need to <b>belong</b> <b>and</b> how both of those factors affect body image. Religiosity is determined by seven questions that consider both behavioral and conceptual aspects, while the need to <b>belong</b> <b>and</b> body image will be measured by the following questions: In general, how happy or unhappy are you with your body and physical appearance, how important or unimportant is it to you to fit in with what teens your age think is cool, and how much do you feel loved and accepted for who you are? Based on the previous research, I hypothesize {{that there will be a}} relationship between religion, the need to <b>belong,</b> <b>and</b> body image, and that both adolescent girls’ need to fit in and body image will be affected by their degree of religiosity...|$|R
500|$|Accordingly, {{while the}} {{imperious}} orator {{will tend to}} prefer a passionate crowd over a sympathetic one, the timid orator (or subject) will have the opposite preferences. The imperious orator is interested mostly in a mob that is more given to rash emotion than to reflection. (Russell 1938:18) The orator will try to engineer two 'layers' of belief in his crowd: [...] "a superficial layer, in which {{the power of the}} enemy is magnified so as to make great courage seem necessary, and a deeper layer, {{in which there is a}} firm conviction of victory" [...] (Russell 1938:18). By contrast, the timid will seek a sense of <b>belonging,</b> <b>and</b> [...] "the reassurance which is felt in being one of a crowd who all feel alike" [...] (Russell 1938:17).|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} argued for similar analogues between Andrade's {{sexuality}} and Macunaíma's complex status. [...] Though Andrade was not openly gay, {{and there is}} no direct evidence of his sexual practices, many of Andrade's friends have reported after his death that he was clearly interested in men (the subject is only reluctantly discussed in Brazil). [...] It was over a pseudonymous accusation of effeminacy that Andrade broke with Oswald de Andrade in 1929. [...] Macunaíma prefers women, but his constant state of <b>belonging</b> <b>and</b> not belonging is associated with sex. [...] The character is sexually precocious, starting his romantic adventures at the age of six, and his particular form of eroticism seems always to lead to destruction of one kind or another.|$|E
500|$|The {{story is}} divided into 21 chapters, with each chapter {{switching}} between the points-of-view of the supervillain Dr. Impossible and the superhero Fatale. The narrative is written in the first person, like a memoir, describing the inner monologues of the two protagonists. The dual narrative foils and [...] "blur the distinction" [...] between the superheroes and the supervillain. The language was described as having a [...] "sincere tone of glory" [...] and [...] "boyish indulgence" [...] with [...] "an undercurrent of sadness and a surprisingly human universality". While the story uses standard comic book story elements, like superheroes fighting supervillains, the book is written entirely in prose. The story combines a satire of superhero archetypes and comic book clichés, {{such as the use}} of many superlatives, with realist elements that portray the sometimes mundane lives and everyday challenges of its characters, like coping with cybernetic body parts that weigh far more than a natural body and that react before the brain registers what is happening. Common social situations and psychological issues, like loneliness and trying to connect with a group, are also portrayed. Reviewers identified numerous themes, such as power, greed, fame, ego, loneliness, <b>belonging,</b> <b>and</b> identity.|$|E
