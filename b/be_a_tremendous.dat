Despite Australia this time having the advantage of playing on its own soil, the England team that had wrested the Ashes from the Australians was expected to be highly competitive.|$|E

2500|$|Tourism {{has been}} {{a key factor in}} {{economic}} development for many Southeast Asian countries, especially Cambodia. According to UNESCO, [...] "tourism, if correctly conceived, can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> development tool and an effective means of preserving the cultural diversity of our planet." [...] Since the early 1990s, [...] "even the non-ASEAN nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where the income derived from tourism is low, are attempting to expand their own tourism industries." [...] In 1995, Singapore was the regional leader in tourism receipts relative to GDP at over 8%. By 1998, those receipts had dropped to less than 6% of GDP while Thailand and Lao PDR increased receipts to over 7%. Since 2000, Cambodia has surpassed all other ASEAN countries and generated almost 15% of its GDP from tourism in 2006.|$|E

Game Informer rated Kinect 8 out of 10, praising the technology but noting that the experience {{takes a while to}} get used to and that the spatial requirement may pose a barrier. Computer and Video Games called the device a technological gem and applauded the gesture and voice controls, while criticizing the launch lineup and Kinect Hub.|$|E

2500|$|By 1881, {{only five}} sternwheelers {{were on the}} river, Irving's Reliance, Royal City and William Irving along with Moore's Cassiar and Western Slope and the two captains battled for the {{increased}} business caused by {{the construction of the}} Canadian Pacific Railway. The old rivalry ran hot as Moore's and Irving's sternwheelers raced up and down the Fraser, competing for passengers. To compete with Moore's Western Slope, Irving built a new sternwheeler, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire near Hope and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> financial blow to John Irving who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier.|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Michelle had parted ways with Mathew Knowles (her manager) and Music World Entertainment. On February 8, 2010, Williams made a return to Broadway by commencing a seven-week limited engagement in Chicago at the Ambassador Theatre, replacing Ashlee Simpson. In April, producers Barry and Fran Weissler announced that Williams would extend her limited engagement in Chicago. Williams was scheduled to play her final performance on Sunday, March 28, 2010, but played an additional 18 performances through Tuesday, April 13, prior to joining the Los Angeles engagement of the Chicago national tour, Tuesday, April 20 through Sunday, May 9 at the Pantages Theatre. In commenting on Williams' engagements Barry Weissler said, [...] "Michelle has proven to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> asset to CHICAGO, first in London last year and now on Broadway. In addition to being a fantastic performer, she's as delightful and genuine offstage as she is onstage.

2500|$|At about 2:30 am, several workers {{near the}} Monument emerged {{with a machine}} gun they had {{captured}} from the troops and vowed to take revenge. They were persuaded {{to give up the}} weapon by Hou Dejian. The workers also handed over an assault rifle without ammunition, which Liu Xiaobo smashed against the marble railings of the Monument. Shao Jiang, a student who had witnessed the killings at Muxidi, pleaded with the older intellectuals to retreat, saying too many lives had been lost. Initially, Liu Xiaobo was reluctant, but eventually joined Zhou Tuo, Gao Xin and Hou Dejian in making the case to the student leaders for a withdrawal. Chai Ling, Li Lu and Feng Congde initially rejected the idea of withdrawal. At 3:30am, at the suggestion of two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo Tuo agreed to attempt to negotiate with the soldiers. They rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 38th Army's 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for the students to the southeast. The commissar told Hou, [...] "it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> accomplishment, if you can persuade the students to leave the Square.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{controversy}} concerning biblical {{accuracy and}} {{content in the}} writing of the script arose over statements from Ridley Scott that he would be looking to natural causes for the miracles, including drainage from a tsunami for the parting of the Red Sea. [...] According to Scott, the parting of the Red Sea was inspired by a tsunami believed to have been triggered by an underwater earthquake off the Italian coast around 3000 BC. This, combined with statements from Christian Bale about Moses, whom he portrayed ("I think the man was likely schizophrenic {{and was one of the}} most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life"), raised criticism. Those who voiced their concern included author Brian Godawa saying, [...] "It's accurate to portray Moses as an imperfect hero, so Christians won't take issue with that, but to be so extreme as to call him one of the most barbaric people in history, that sounds like he's going out of his way to distance himself from the very people you’d think he wants to appeal to." [...] Another was the CEO of Faith-Driven Consumer, Chris Stone, saying about Bale's comments [...] "There's nothing in the biblical history that supports that. It's an indication that there will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>tremendous</b> disconnect between Bale’s interpretation and the expectations of the market" [...] and suggesting that Christians will not go to cinemas to see the film.|$|E
